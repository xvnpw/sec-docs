## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict URL Parameter Validation and Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/strict_url_parameter_validation_and_whitelisting.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Strict URL Parameter Validation and Whitelisting

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify All Endpoints:**  List every URL endpoint exposed by Graphite-web (e.g., `/render`, `/metrics/find`, `/dashboard/load`).
        2.  **Define Allowed Parameters:** For *each* endpoint, create a whitelist specifying:
            *   Allowed parameter names (e.g., `target`, `from`, `until`, `format`).
            *   Expected data type for each parameter (integer, string, timestamp, specific enum).
            *   Maximum length for string parameters.
            *   Allowed character set (e.g., alphanumeric, specific punctuation).
            *   Regular expressions (used *sparingly* and with extreme caution) to define allowed patterns *if absolutely necessary*.  Prefer simpler validation methods.
        3.  **Implement Validation Logic:**  In the *Graphite-web code* handling each endpoint (likely in Django views or middleware):
            *   Before processing any request, check if the incoming URL contains *only* the whitelisted parameters.
            *   For each parameter, validate its value against the defined type, length, and character set restrictions.
            *   Reject the request (with a 400 Bad Request) if *any* parameter is invalid or unexpected.
            *   Log the rejection, including the source IP, the invalid parameter, and the reason.
        4.  **Use a Validation Library:**  Employ a robust validation library within the Graphite-web code (e.g., `cerberus`, `jsonschema`, or Django's form validation).
        5.  **Centralize Validation:** Centralize the validation logic in Graphite-web's middleware or a decorator.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Critical:** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code through crafted URL parameters.  Many past Graphite-web CVEs involved RCE via parameter injection.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High:** Limits allowed characters and validates input, reducing XSS risk.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium:** Validating parameter lengths and types prevents excessively large/complex requests.
        *   **Information Disclosure - Medium:** Prevents probing with unexpected parameters.
        *   **SQL Injection (if applicable) - High:** Helps prevent SQL injection if parameters are used in queries.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **RCE:**  Risk reduction: Very High.
        *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: High.
        *   **DoS:** Risk reduction: Medium.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: Medium.
        *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduction: High (if applicable).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**  *Hypothetical Example:* Partially implemented in `render/views.py` using basic regular expressions, but not consistently applied. Uses Django's `int()` for some parameters, but lacks comprehensive whitelisting.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  *Hypothetical Example:*
        *   Missing comprehensive whitelists for all endpoints, especially `/dashboard/*` and `/metrics/*`.
        *   Lacks centralized validation; validation is scattered.
        *   Doesn't use a dedicated validation library; relies on ad-hoc regex and basic type conversions.
        *   Insufficient logging of validation failures.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Content-Type Header Enforcement (Within Graphite-web)](./mitigation_strategies/content-type_header_enforcement__within_graphite-web_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Content-Type Header Enforcement (Within Graphite-web)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Expected Content Types:** For each Graphite-web endpoint, determine the expected `Content-Type` (e.g., `application/json`, `text/plain`).
        2.  **Implement Enforcement:** In the *Graphite-web code* (middleware or view):
            *   Check the `Content-Type` header of incoming requests.
            *   Reject the request (e.g., 415 Unsupported Media Type) if the header is missing or doesn't match.
            *   Do *not* infer the content type from the request body.
        3.  **Centralize Enforcement:** Implement this check in Graphite-web's middleware.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Content Sniffing Attacks - Medium:** Prevents browsers from misinterpreting content type.
        *   **Unexpected Input Handling - Medium:** Ensures only expected data formats are processed.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Content Sniffing:** Risk reduction: Medium.
        *   **Unexpected Input:** Risk reduction: Medium.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** *Hypothetical Example:* Implemented for JSON API endpoints in `api/middleware.py`, but not for all.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** *Hypothetical Example:*
        *   Missing enforcement for endpoints serving images or other non-JSON content.
        *   Not consistently applied across all middleware.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Encoding (HTML, within Graphite-web)](./mitigation_strategies/output_encoding__html__within_graphite-web_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Output Encoding (HTML, within Graphite-web)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify HTML Output:** Find all parts of *Graphite-web's code* that generate HTML:
            *   Templates for dashboards/pages.
            *   Error messages including user-supplied data.
            *   Dynamically generated HTML.
        2.  **Implement HTML Encoding:**
            *   Use Django's template auto-escaping (verify it's enabled).
            *   For HTML generated *outside* templates (in view functions), use `django.utils.html.escape` to encode *all* user-supplied data.
            *   Review JavaScript code; use safe methods like `textContent` instead of `innerHTML`.
        3.  **Context-aware encoding:** Use context-aware encoding.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High:** Prevents injection of malicious JavaScript.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: High.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** *Hypothetical Example:* Django's auto-escaping is enabled, but manual HTML generation might not be encoded.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** *Hypothetical Example:*
        *   Audit view functions and error handling for proper HTML encoding.
        *   Review JavaScript for DOM-based XSS.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Features (Configuration-Based)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_features__configuration-based_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unnecessary Features (Configuration-Based)

    * **Description:**
        1. **Review Configuration:** Examine Graphite-web's configuration files (e.g., `local_settings.py`, `graphite.wsgi`) for settings enabling optional features.
        2. **Identify Unused Features:** Determine which optional features are *not* needed.
        3. **Disable Features:** Modify the configuration files to disable unused features (e.g., setting variables to `False`, commenting out sections).
        4. **Test Thoroughly:** Test the application to ensure remaining functionality works and no side effects were introduced.
        5. **Document Disabled Features:** Record which features were disabled and why.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        * **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Unused Features - Variable Severity:** Reduces the attack surface.
        * **Unintended Functionality Exposure - Medium:** Prevents access to unintended features.

    * **Impact:**
        * **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Risk reduction: Variable.
        * **Unintended Functionality:** Risk reduction: Medium.

    * **Currently Implemented:** *Hypothetical Example:* Some features might be disabled, but a comprehensive review hasn't been done.

    * **Missing Implementation:** *Hypothetical Example:*
        * Thorough review of all configuration options.
        * Document disabled features.
        * Re-test after disabling.
