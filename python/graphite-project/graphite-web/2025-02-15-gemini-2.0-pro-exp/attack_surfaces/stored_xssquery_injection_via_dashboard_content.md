Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Stored XSS/Query Injection via Dashboard Content" attack surface in Graphite-Web, following the structure you requested:

# Deep Analysis: Stored XSS/Query Injection in Graphite-Web Dashboards

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which a stored XSS/Query Injection vulnerability can be exploited in Graphite-Web's dashboard functionality.  This includes identifying specific code paths, data flows, and potential failure points that contribute to the vulnerability.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for remediation and prevention, going beyond the high-level mitigation strategies already identified.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface related to **stored** XSS and query injection within Graphite-Web's dashboard feature.  It encompasses:

*   **Dashboard Definition Storage:** How and where dashboard definitions are stored (database, file system, etc.).
*   **Dashboard Loading and Rendering:** The process by which Graphite-Web retrieves, parses, and renders dashboard definitions to the user's browser.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Examination of existing input validation and sanitization mechanisms (or lack thereof) within the relevant code paths.
*   **Output Encoding:**  Analysis of how data from dashboard definitions is encoded (or not) before being displayed in the user interface.
*   **Query Execution:** How Graphite queries embedded within dashboard definitions are handled and executed.
*   **Relevant Code Sections:** Identification of specific files and functions within the Graphite-Web codebase that are directly involved in dashboard handling.

This analysis *excludes* other potential attack surfaces within Graphite-Web, such as those related to metrics rendering, user authentication (except as it relates to dashboard access control), or other features unrelated to dashboards.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the Graphite-Web source code (available on GitHub) to identify vulnerable code patterns, data flows, and missing security controls.  This will be the primary method.
*   **Static Analysis (Potential):**  If feasible, automated static analysis tools *might* be used to identify potential vulnerabilities. However, manual code review is prioritized due to the specific nature of this vulnerability.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Limited):**  Limited dynamic analysis (e.g., setting up a local Graphite-Web instance and attempting to inject malicious payloads) may be used to *confirm* findings from the code review, but it is not the primary focus.  The goal is to understand the *root cause* in the code, not just to demonstrate the exploit.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Review of any available Graphite-Web documentation related to dashboard management and security.
*   **Issue Tracker Review:**  Searching the Graphite-Web issue tracker on GitHub for any existing reports or discussions related to this vulnerability or similar issues.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

Based on the provided information and a preliminary review of the Graphite-Web codebase, the following areas are critical for in-depth analysis:

**4.1. Dashboard Storage and Retrieval:**

*   **`graphite-web/webapp/graphite/dashboard/views.py`:** This file likely contains the views responsible for handling dashboard creation, saving, loading, and deletion.  We need to examine functions like `saveDashboard`, `loadDashboard`, and `deleteDashboard`.
*   **`graphite-web/webapp/graphite/dashboard/models.py` (or similar):**  This file (or a similar one) likely defines the data model for dashboards.  We need to understand how dashboard definitions are structured and stored (e.g., as JSON blobs in a database).  The specific database used (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) is also relevant, as different databases might have different escaping requirements.
*   **Database Interaction:**  Identify the specific database queries used to store and retrieve dashboard data.  Look for any instances where user-provided data is directly inserted into SQL queries without proper parameterization or escaping.  This is a potential source of SQL injection, which could be used to manipulate dashboard data.

**4.2. Dashboard Rendering:**

*   **`graphite-web/webapp/graphite/dashboard/views.py` (again):**  The view functions responsible for rendering dashboards (e.g., `viewDashboard`) are crucial.  We need to trace how the dashboard definition (retrieved from storage) is processed and passed to the template.
*   **Templates (e.g., `graphite-web/webapp/graphite/templates/dashboard/view.html`):**  The HTML templates used to render dashboards are critical.  We need to examine how data from the dashboard definition is inserted into the HTML.  Look for:
    *   **Unsafe Variable Interpolation:**  Are variables from the dashboard definition directly inserted into the HTML without any escaping or encoding?  This is the classic XSS vulnerability.  For example, `{{ dashboard.title }}` without any escaping is vulnerable.
    *   **`safe` Filter (Django):**  If the Django templating engine is used, the `safe` filter explicitly marks a variable as "safe" and disables auto-escaping.  *Any* use of the `safe` filter on user-provided data is a major red flag.
    *   **JavaScript Handling:**  How are JavaScript sections within the dashboard definition handled?  Are they directly embedded into the HTML, or are they sanitized/sandboxed in any way?
*   **JavaScript Libraries:**  Identify any JavaScript libraries used for rendering dashboards (e.g., jQuery, React, Vue.js).  These libraries might have their own security considerations and potential vulnerabilities.  Examine how these libraries are used to interact with the dashboard data.

**4.3. Input Validation and Sanitization:**

*   **`graphite-web/webapp/graphite/dashboard/views.py` (and related files):**  Thoroughly examine the code for *any* input validation or sanitization performed on dashboard data *before* it is saved.  Look for:
    *   **Whitelist-Based Validation:**  The most secure approach is to define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and structures for dashboard definitions.  Any input that doesn't match the whitelist is rejected.
    *   **Blacklist-Based Validation:**  A less secure approach is to define a blacklist of disallowed characters or patterns.  This is prone to bypasses, as attackers can often find ways to circumvent blacklists.
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  If regular expressions are used for validation, carefully examine them for correctness and potential bypasses.  Regular expressions can be complex and error-prone.
    *   **HTML/JavaScript Sanitization Libraries:**  Look for the use of libraries like `bleach` (Python) or similar to sanitize HTML and JavaScript input.  Ensure that these libraries are used correctly and configured securely.
*   **Missing Validation:**  The *absence* of any input validation or sanitization is a major vulnerability.

**4.4. Query Execution:**

*   **`graphite-web/webapp/graphite/render/views.py` (and related files):**  This area likely handles the execution of Graphite queries.  We need to examine how queries from dashboard definitions are extracted and passed to the rendering engine.
*   **`target` Parameter:**  The `target` parameter within a dashboard definition is particularly important, as it specifies the Graphite query to be executed.  We need to ensure that this parameter is properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious query injection.
*   **Function Calls:**  Look for any instances where user-provided data is used to construct function calls within Graphite queries.  This is a potential source of arbitrary code execution.  For example, if a user can inject a `target` like `maliciousFunction(some.metric)`, this could lead to serious consequences.

**4.5. Authentication and Authorization:**

*   **`graphite-web/webapp/graphite/account/views.py` (and related files):**  While not the direct source of the XSS vulnerability, the authentication and authorization mechanisms are crucial for limiting the impact.  We need to verify that:
    *   **Dashboard Access Control:**  Only authorized users can create, modify, and delete dashboards.  Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to limit the privileges of different user roles.
    *   **Authentication Strength:**  Strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) should be used to prevent account compromise.

**4.6. Specific Code Examples (Hypothetical - based on common vulnerabilities):**

Here are some *hypothetical* code examples illustrating potential vulnerabilities, which the code review would aim to find (or confirm the absence of):

*   **Vulnerable View (Python/Django):**

    ```python
    # graphite-web/webapp/graphite/dashboard/views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from .models import Dashboard

    def view_dashboard(request, dashboard_id):
        dashboard = Dashboard.objects.get(id=dashboard_id)
        return render(request, 'dashboard/view.html', {'dashboard': dashboard})
    ```

    ```html
    <!-- graphite-web/webapp/graphite/templates/dashboard/view.html -->
    <h1>{{ dashboard.title }}</h1>
    <div id="graph-container"></div>
    <script>
        var targets = {{ dashboard.targets|safe }}; // HUGE VULNERABILITY!
        // ... (rest of the JavaScript code to render the graph) ...
    </script>
    ```
    This is vulnerable because the `dashboard.title` is not escaped in the template, and the `dashboard.targets` is explicitly marked as `safe`, disabling auto-escaping.

*   **Vulnerable Model (Python/Django):**

    ```python
    # graphite-web/webapp/graphite/dashboard/models.py
    from django.db import models

    class Dashboard(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=255)  # No validation!
        targets = models.TextField() # No validation!
        # ...
    ```
    This is vulnerable because there's no validation on the `title` or `targets` fields, allowing arbitrary data to be stored.

* **Vulnerable Query Execution (Hypothetical):**
    ```python
        # graphite/render/views.py
        def render_graph(request):
            target = request.GET.get('target')
            # ... (code to execute the query based on 'target') ...
            #  VULNERABLE if 'target' is used directly without sanitization
            result = execute_graphite_query(target)
            return HttpResponse(result)
    ```
    If the `target` parameter is taken directly from the request and used in `execute_graphite_query` without any sanitization, it's vulnerable to query injection.

## 5. Recommendations (Detailed)

Based on the deep analysis, the following detailed recommendations are provided:

1.  **Comprehensive Input Sanitization (Dashboard Definitions):**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:** Implement a strict whitelist for all fields within the dashboard definition (title, targets, etc.). Define allowed characters, data types, and structures. Reject any input that doesn't conform.
    *   **HTML Sanitization:** Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., `bleach` in Python) to remove or escape any potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes from the `title` and other relevant fields. Configure the sanitizer to allow only a very limited set of safe HTML tags (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<a>` with restricted attributes).
    *   **JSON Validation:** Validate the structure of the dashboard definition as valid JSON. This prevents attackers from injecting malformed JSON that could cause parsing errors or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Target Sanitization:**  Implement specific sanitization for the `target` parameter.  This might involve:
        *   **Parsing and Validation:** Parse the `target` string into its components (function names, arguments, etc.) and validate each component against a whitelist of allowed functions and argument patterns.
        *   **Parameterization:** If possible, use a parameterized query approach to pass the `target` to the Graphite rendering engine, preventing injection.
        *   **Regular Expressions (with caution):** If regular expressions are used, ensure they are extremely strict and thoroughly tested for bypasses.

2.  **Secure Output Encoding (Dashboard Rendering):**
    *   **Templating Engine:** Use a templating engine that automatically escapes output by default (e.g., Django's template engine with auto-escaping enabled).
    *   **Avoid `safe` Filter:**  *Never* use the `safe` filter (or equivalent) on user-provided data in templates.
    *   **Contextual Escaping:** Ensure that the correct escaping method is used for the context. For example, use HTML escaping for HTML attributes, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript code, etc.
    *   **JavaScript Sandboxing (Consideration):** For advanced use cases, consider sandboxing JavaScript code within the dashboard using techniques like iframes or Web Workers. This is a more complex solution but can provide a higher level of security.

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   **Strict CSP:** Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts, styles, images, and other resources can be loaded. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure against XSS.
    *   **`script-src` Directive:**  Carefully configure the `script-src` directive to allow only trusted sources for JavaScript. Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` if at all possible. If inline scripts are necessary, use nonces or hashes to allow only specific inline scripts.
    *   **`object-src` Directive:** Set `object-src 'none'` to prevent the loading of plugins (e.g., Flash, Java) that could be used for XSS.
    *   **`base-uri` Directive:** Set `base-uri 'self'` to prevent attackers from injecting `<base>` tags to hijack relative URLs.

4.  **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to restrict access to dashboard creation and modification based on user roles.  Ensure that only trusted users have the ability to create or modify dashboards.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA for all user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
    *   **Session Management:**  Implement secure session management practices, including:
        *   **Secure Cookies:** Use the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags for all cookies.
        *   **Session Timeout:**  Implement a reasonable session timeout to automatically log out inactive users.
        *   **CSRF Protection:**  Ensure that CSRF protection is enabled to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews, focusing on security-sensitive areas like dashboard handling.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform regular penetration testing to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use automated vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in Graphite-Web and its dependencies.

6.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Regularly update all dependencies (including Graphite-Web itself, Python libraries, JavaScript libraries, and the database) to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:**  Monitor for security advisories related to Graphite-Web and its dependencies.

7. **Database Security (If Applicable):**
    * **Parameterized Queries:** If a relational database is used, *always* use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection. Never directly concatenate user input into SQL queries.
    * **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by Graphite-Web has only the necessary privileges. Avoid using a database administrator account.

By implementing these recommendations, the risk of stored XSS and query injection vulnerabilities in Graphite-Web dashboards can be significantly reduced. The combination of input sanitization, output encoding, CSP, and strong authentication/authorization provides a multi-layered defense against this type of attack.
