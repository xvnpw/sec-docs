# Deep Analysis: Path Traversal in Graphite-Web (/dashboard/load/<name>)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the path traversal vulnerability in Graphite-Web's `/dashboard/load/<name>` endpoint.  This includes understanding the root cause, potential exploitation scenarios, the impact of successful exploitation, and to reinforce the proposed mitigation strategies with detailed explanations and examples.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to remediate the vulnerability effectively.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `/dashboard/load/<name>` endpoint of Graphite-Web.  It covers:

*   The mechanism by which the vulnerability is introduced.
*   How attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
*   The potential consequences of a successful attack.
*   Detailed analysis of the provided mitigation strategies, including code-level considerations.
*   Recommendations for testing and verification.

This analysis *does not* cover other potential vulnerabilities in Graphite-Web or general security best practices beyond what's directly relevant to this specific path traversal issue.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Breakdown:**  Dissect the vulnerability, explaining the underlying code behavior that allows for path traversal.
2.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic attack scenarios, including variations and potential bypasses of weak mitigations.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detail the specific types of information that could be exposed and the consequences of that exposure.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Thoroughly analyze each proposed mitigation strategy, providing code-level examples and considerations.
5.  **Testing and Verification:**  Suggest methods for testing the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.
6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:** Identify any remaining risks after mitigation.

## 2. Vulnerability Breakdown

The vulnerability stems from Graphite-Web directly using the user-supplied `name` parameter in the `/dashboard/load/<name>` URL path as part of a file path to retrieve a dashboard.  If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate this input, an attacker can inject directory traversal sequences (`../`) to navigate outside the intended dashboard directory and access arbitrary files on the server.

**Simplified Code Example (Illustrative - Not Actual Graphite-Web Code):**

```python
# VULNERABLE CODE EXAMPLE
def load_dashboard(request, name):
    dashboard_path = "/path/to/dashboards/" + name + ".json"  # Vulnerable: Direct concatenation
    try:
        with open(dashboard_path, 'r') as f:
            dashboard_data = f.read()
            return HttpResponse(dashboard_data)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return HttpResponseNotFound("Dashboard not found")

```

In this simplified example, if `name` is `../../../../etc/passwd`, `dashboard_path` becomes `/path/to/dashboards/../../../../etc/passwd`, which resolves to `/etc/passwd`.  The application would then attempt to open and return the contents of `/etc/passwd`.

## 3. Exploitation Scenarios

### 3.1 Basic Path Traversal

The most straightforward attack involves using `../` sequences to navigate to sensitive files:

*   `/dashboard/load/../../../../etc/passwd`:  Attempts to read the system's password file.
*   `/dashboard/load/../../../../etc/shadow`: Attempts to read the shadow file (if accessible, which it shouldn't be with proper system permissions).
*   `/dashboard/load/../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log`:  Attempts to read Apache access logs.
*   `/dashboard/load/../../../../home/graphite/.ssh/id_rsa`: Attempts to read a user's private SSH key (if Graphite-Web runs as that user).

### 3.2 Variations and Bypasses

*   **Encoded Characters:** Attackers might try URL-encoding the traversal sequences (e.g., `%2e%2e%2f` for `../`).  A robust mitigation must handle decoded input.
*   **Null Bytes:**  Appending a null byte (`%00`) might truncate the intended file extension, potentially bypassing some checks.  For example, `/dashboard/load/../../../../etc/passwd%00.json`.
*   **Double Encoding:**  Using double URL encoding (e.g., `%252e%252e%252f`) might bypass some single-decoding sanitization routines.
* **Absolute Paths:** If the code doesn't check for absolute paths, an attacker could try `/dashboard/load//etc/passwd`.
* **Long Path:** Using a very long path with many `../` sequences might cause issues with some systems or bypass length checks.

## 4. Impact Assessment

Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposure of sensitive files, including:
    *   Configuration files (database credentials, API keys, etc.).
    *   Source code (revealing other vulnerabilities).
    *   System files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, log files).
    *   User data.
*   **System Compromise:**  If configuration files or SSH keys are exposed, attackers could gain access to the server or other connected systems.
*   **Denial of Service:**  While less likely with *read* access, an attacker might be able to trigger errors or resource exhaustion by accessing unexpected files.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Data breaches can severely damage an organization's reputation.

## 5. Mitigation Analysis

### 5.1 Input Sanitization (Graphite-Web Specific)

**Recommendation:**  Implement a strict whitelist-based sanitization routine.  *Do not* rely solely on blacklisting.

**Code Example (Illustrative):**

```python
import re
import os

def sanitize_dashboard_name(name):
    """
    Sanitizes the dashboard name, allowing only alphanumeric characters,
    underscores, and hyphens.  Returns a sanitized string or None if invalid.
    """
    if not re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+$", name):
        return None  # Reject invalid characters
    return name

def load_dashboard(request, name):
    sanitized_name = sanitize_dashboard_name(name)
    if sanitized_name is None:
        return HttpResponseBadRequest("Invalid dashboard name")

    # ... (rest of the function, using sanitized_name) ...
```

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Whitelist:**  The regular expression `^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+$` enforces a whitelist of allowed characters.  This is far more secure than trying to blacklist specific characters.
*   **Decoding:**  Ensure that the input is decoded *before* sanitization.  Handle URL encoding, double encoding, and other potential obfuscation techniques.  The web framework (e.g., Django) usually handles this, but it's crucial to verify.
*   **Normalization:** Consider normalizing the input (e.g., converting to lowercase) to prevent case-sensitive bypasses.
*   **Length Limits:** Impose a reasonable length limit on the dashboard name to prevent potential denial-of-service or buffer overflow issues.

### 5.2 Secure File Handling (Graphite-Web Specific)

**Recommendation:**  Use a mapping between dashboard names and their actual file locations.  *Never* construct the file path directly from user input.

**Code Example (Illustrative):**

```python
import os
import uuid

DASHBOARD_DIR = "/var/lib/graphite/dashboards/"  # Dedicated, restricted directory

def generate_dashboard_filename(dashboard_name):
    """
    Generates a safe, unique filename for a dashboard.
    """
    # Example: Use a UUID to create a unique filename
    return str(uuid.uuid4()) + ".json"

def load_dashboard(request, name):
    sanitized_name = sanitize_dashboard_name(name)
    if sanitized_name is None:
        return HttpResponseBadRequest("Invalid dashboard name")

    # Example: Using a dictionary as a simple mapping (replace with database)
    dashboard_mapping = {
        "my_dashboard": "dashboard_123.json",
        "another_dashboard": "dashboard_456.json",
        # ...
    }

    filename = dashboard_mapping.get(sanitized_name)
    if filename is None:
        return HttpResponseNotFound("Dashboard not found")

    filepath = os.path.join(DASHBOARD_DIR, filename)

    # Use os.path.realpath() to resolve any symbolic links and ensure
    # the file is within the intended directory.
    real_filepath = os.path.realpath(filepath)
    if not real_filepath.startswith(DASHBOARD_DIR):
        return HttpResponseForbidden("Access denied")

    try:
        with open(real_filepath, 'r') as f:
            dashboard_data = f.read()
            return HttpResponse(dashboard_data)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return HttpResponseNotFound("Dashboard not found")
    except PermissionError:
        return HttpResponseForbidden("Access Denied")

```

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Dedicated Directory:**  Store dashboards in a dedicated directory (`DASHBOARD_DIR`) that is *not* web-accessible and has restricted permissions.
*   **Mapping:**  Use a mapping (dictionary, database, etc.) to associate sanitized dashboard names with unique, safe filenames.  This prevents direct file system access based on user input.
*   **`os.path.realpath()`:**  Use `os.path.realpath()` to resolve any symbolic links and ensure that the final file path is within the intended `DASHBOARD_DIR`. This is a crucial defense against symlink-based attacks.
*   **`startswith()` Check:**  Verify that the resolved path starts with the `DASHBOARD_DIR`. This prevents attackers from escaping the intended directory.
* **Error Handling:** Handle `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError` gracefully.

### 5.3 Least Privilege (Process Level)

**Recommendation:**  Run the Graphite-Web process with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  It should *not* have read access to sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow`.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Dedicated User:**  Create a dedicated user account (e.g., `graphite`) with limited permissions to run the Graphite-Web process.
*   **File System Permissions:**  Ensure that the `graphite` user only has read access to the `DASHBOARD_DIR` and any other necessary directories.  It should *not* have read access to system directories or other users' home directories.
*   **`chroot` (Optional):**  For enhanced security, consider running Graphite-Web in a `chroot` jail.  This confines the process to a specific directory subtree, further limiting its access to the file system.  This is a more advanced technique and requires careful configuration.

## 6. Testing and Verification

*   **Automated Testing:**  Create automated tests that specifically target the `/dashboard/load/<name>` endpoint with various path traversal payloads (including encoded and double-encoded variations).  These tests should verify that the application returns appropriate error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request or 403 Forbidden) and does *not* expose any file contents.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing by security professionals to identify any potential bypasses or weaknesses in the implemented mitigations.
*   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code changes to ensure that the sanitization and file handling logic is correctly implemented and covers all potential attack vectors.
* **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan the codebase for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

## 7. Residual Risk Assessment

Even with the implemented mitigations, some residual risks may remain:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There's always a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries or frameworks used by Graphite-Web.
*   **Misconfiguration:**  If the mitigations are not configured correctly (e.g., incorrect file permissions, weak sanitization rules), the vulnerability could still be exploitable.
*   **Other Vulnerabilities:**  This analysis focuses solely on the path traversal vulnerability.  Other vulnerabilities in Graphite-Web could still exist and be exploited.

Continuous monitoring, regular security updates, and ongoing security assessments are crucial to minimize these residual risks.
