# Threat Model Analysis for graphite-project/graphite-web

## Threat: [Unauthorized Metric Data Access](./threats/unauthorized_metric_data_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts HTTP requests directly to the Graphite-Web rendering API (e.g., `/render/`) or the web interface, bypassing any intended authentication or authorization. They exploit the lack of built-in, robust access control within Graphite-Web to retrieve sensitive data by guessing metric names or using brute-force techniques.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential system metrics, potentially revealing internal infrastructure details, performance data, business-sensitive information, or security-relevant data. This could lead to further attacks, competitive disadvantage, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `graphite.render.views.renderView`: The primary view function handling rendering requests.
        *   `graphite.browser.views`: Views related to the web interface for browsing metrics.
        *   Any URL patterns configured to expose metric data without authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory:** Implement a robust reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache, etc.) *in front of* Graphite-Web, handling *all* authentication and authorization. Configure the proxy to deny access to Graphite-Web URLs without valid credentials.  Graphite-Web's built-in authentication is insufficient on its own.
        *   **Strongly Recommended:** Integrate with an existing identity provider (LDAP, OAuth2, SSO) via the reverse proxy or a dedicated, well-vetted authentication plugin.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Complex Queries](./threats/denial_of_service_via_complex_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted requests to the Graphite-Web rendering API (`/render/`) with extremely complex queries, using functions like `groupByNode`, `summarize`, or nested functions with large time ranges or wildcard patterns.  These queries are designed to consume excessive CPU, memory, or I/O resources *within Graphite-Web's processing logic*.
    *   **Impact:** The Graphite-Web server becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing metric data. This disrupts monitoring, alerting, and operational dashboards, potentially leading to delayed incident response or service outages.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `graphite.render.views.renderView`: The core rendering function.
        *   `graphite.render.functions`: The functions used to process and aggregate data (e.g., `summarize`, `groupByNode`, `derivative`, `hitcount`, and any custom functions).  The attacker exploits the computational complexity of these functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory:** Implement strict query timeouts within Graphite-Web itself (e.g., `DEFAULT_CACHE_DURATION`, `MAX_FETCH_STEP`, and potentially custom timeout logic within the rendering views). These settings directly control how long Graphite-Web will spend processing a query.
        *   **Strongly Recommended:** Implement a query analysis mechanism (potentially a custom middleware or a separate service) to detect and block potentially malicious queries *before* they are fully processed by Graphite-Web. This could involve analyzing the query structure, the number of data points requested, or the use of expensive functions.
        * **Recommended:** Implement caching (Memcached, Redis) to reduce load for frequently accessed queries.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Pickle Deserialization](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_pickle_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a crafted malicious payload using the pickle protocol to a Graphite-Web endpoint that accepts and processes pickle data (e.g., a rendering endpoint configured to accept pickle input or a custom endpoint).  The attacker leverages the inherent insecurity of Python's `pickle` module to execute arbitrary code *within the Graphite-Web process*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the Graphite-Web server and potentially the underlying host, allowing them to steal data, install malware, or launch further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `graphite.render.evaluator.evaluateTarget` (if pickle is enabled for rendering).
        *   `graphite.protocols.PickleReceiver` (if used, but this is less directly Graphite-Web and more Carbon).  The vulnerability lies in *any* Graphite-Web component that uses `pickle.loads` on untrusted data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory:** *Disable the use of the pickle protocol entirely within Graphite-Web.* This is the most effective mitigation.  Use JSON or other safe serialization formats for all data exchange.
        *   **If Pickle is Absolutely Necessary (Strongly Discouraged and should be avoided):**
            *   Ensure that *no* Graphite-Web endpoint accepts pickle data from untrusted sources. This is extremely difficult to guarantee in practice and is not a reliable mitigation.
            *   Implement strict network-level access controls (firewalls) to prevent any external access to potential pickle endpoints. This is a defense-in-depth measure, not a primary solution.
        * **Strongly Recommended:** Use alternative protocols like the Carbon plaintext protocol or the Graphite HTTP API with JSON for data ingestion and rendering.
