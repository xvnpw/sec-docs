Okay, let's create a design document for the Graphite project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Graphite is an open-source project focused on providing a highly scalable, real-time graphing system.  It's designed to handle numeric time-series data.  The primary business goals appear to be:

*   Provide a reliable and performant monitoring solution: Graphite is used to visualize metrics, so uptime and accurate data representation are critical.  Users rely on it to make operational decisions.
*   Maintain an active open-source community:  The project's success depends on community contributions and adoption.  This implies a need for ease of use, good documentation, and responsiveness to community needs.
*   Support a wide range of integrations: Graphite's value is increased by its ability to receive data from various sources (collectors) and integrate with other systems (like Grafana for dashboards).

Based on these goals, the most important business risks are:

*   Data Loss or Corruption:  Loss of monitoring data can lead to missed alerts and inability to diagnose issues. Corruption can lead to incorrect decisions.
*   Performance Degradation or Unavailability:  If Graphite becomes slow or unavailable, it disrupts the monitoring workflow and can impact the systems being monitored.
*   Security Vulnerabilities:  Exploitable vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial-of-service attacks.  This is particularly important if Graphite is exposed to the public internet.
*   Lack of Community Adoption/Contribution: If the project stagnates, it may become obsolete or lose relevance.
*   Integration Failures: If Graphite cannot reliably receive data from collectors or integrate with dashboarding tools, its usefulness is significantly diminished.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the provided GitHub repository, the following security controls and accepted risks are identified. Note that this is an assessment based on the repository *contents*, not a full security audit.

*   security control: Input validation: The repository contains code related to parsing and processing data from various sources. The extent and effectiveness of input validation are not immediately clear from a cursory review but are assumed to be present to some degree. Location: Various parsing functions within the codebase.
*   security control: Limited attack surface: Graphite's core components (carbon, whisper, webapp) have well-defined roles, which helps limit the potential impact of a vulnerability in any single component. Location: Architectural design.
*   accepted risk: Limited built-in authentication/authorization: Graphite itself has very basic authentication. It typically relies on external systems (e.g., a reverse proxy with authentication) or network-level controls for access control. This is a common deployment pattern, but it's an accepted risk that must be addressed at the deployment level.
*   accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service: Graphite is designed for high throughput, but it's still susceptible to denial-of-service attacks if overwhelmed with data or malicious requests. Mitigation is expected to be handled at the infrastructure level (e.g., rate limiting, load balancing).
*   accepted risk: Dependency vulnerabilities: Like any software project, Graphite depends on external libraries. These dependencies may have vulnerabilities that could impact Graphite's security. Location: requirements.txt, package.json, etc.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   Implement robust input sanitization and validation across all data input paths (carbon, webapp API). This should include checks for data type, length, and allowed characters.
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially on the web application component.
*   Establish a clear process for managing and updating dependencies, including vulnerability scanning and timely patching.
*   Provide detailed documentation on secure deployment configurations, including recommendations for authentication, authorization, and network security.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for security-relevant events, such as failed login attempts, unusual data patterns, and system errors.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The system SHOULD allow integration with external authentication providers (e.g., LDAP, OAuth).
    *   The system SHOULD support basic username/password authentication for local accounts (with secure password storage).
    *   The system SHOULD enforce password complexity requirements.
*   Authorization:
    *   The system SHOULD provide a mechanism to control access to specific metrics or data views.
    *   The system SHOULD support role-based access control (RBAC) to define different levels of access for users.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The system MUST validate all input data from external sources (carbon, webapp API).
    *   The system MUST sanitize data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injection).
    *   The system MUST enforce data type and length restrictions.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The system SHOULD use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for all data transmission.
    *   The system SHOULD encrypt sensitive data at rest (if applicable).
    *   The system SHOULD use strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.

## BUILD

Graphite's build process is relatively straightforward, primarily involving Python packaging.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer(("Developer")) -- "Writes Code" --> GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHub -- "Triggers" --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions\n(CI/CD)"]
    GitHubActions -- "Builds" --> PythonPackage["Python Package\n(e.g., .tar.gz, .whl)"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs Tests" --> TestResults["Test Results"]
    PythonPackage -- "Published to" --> PyPI["PyPI\n(Python Package Index)"]
```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code review: Pull requests on GitHub are typically reviewed before being merged, providing a basic level of code review. Location: GitHub pull request process.
*   security control: Automated testing: The repository includes unit tests that are run as part of the build process. Location: GitHub Actions workflows.
*   security control: Dependency management: Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` or similar files, allowing for tracking and potential vulnerability scanning. Location: `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`.

Recommended improvements:

*   Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools into the GitHub Actions workflow to scan for potential vulnerabilities in the code.
*   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `pip-audit`, `safety`) to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies during the build process.
*   Consider signing releases to ensure the integrity of the distributed packages.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Real-time monitoring of systems and applications.
    *   Historical data analysis for capacity planning and troubleshooting.
    *   Alerting on critical events.

*   Data We Are Trying to Protect:
    *   Time-series metric data: This data can include sensitive information about system performance, resource utilization, and application behavior.
    *   Configuration data: Graphite configuration files may contain credentials or other sensitive information.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   Metric data: Sensitivity varies depending on the specific metrics being collected. Some metrics may be publicly available (e.g., website traffic), while others may be highly confidential (e.g., internal system performance data).
    *   Configuration data: Generally considered highly sensitive.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   What are the specific compliance requirements (if any) for the deployment environment (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)?
