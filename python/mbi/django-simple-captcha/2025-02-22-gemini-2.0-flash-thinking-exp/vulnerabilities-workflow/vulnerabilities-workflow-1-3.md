### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Audio CAPTCHA Generation

- Description:
    The `captcha_audio` view in `captcha/views.py` uses `subprocess.run` to execute external commands, specifically `flite` for text-to-speech conversion and optionally `sox` for audio processing. The text that is converted to speech is derived from the `challenge` field of the `CaptchaStore` model. If an attacker can manipulate the `challenge` field to contain shell commands, these commands could be executed by the server when the `captcha_audio` view is accessed.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker needs to find a way to inject a malicious payload into the `challenge` field of a `CaptchaStore` record. This might be possible through other vulnerabilities or by directly manipulating the database if access is gained. For demonstration purposes, assume an attacker can create a `CaptchaStore` entry with a crafted `challenge`.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious `challenge` string containing shell commands, for example: `test$(whoami)`.
    3. The attacker obtains the `hashkey` of the `CaptchaStore` record with the malicious `challenge`.
    4. The attacker requests the audio CAPTCHA by accessing the URL `/captcha/audio/<hashkey>.wav`, replacing `<hashkey>` with the obtained hash key.
    5. The `captcha_audio` view retrieves the malicious `challenge` from the database.
    6. The view then uses `subprocess.run([settings.CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH, "-t", text, "-o", path])` where `text` is the malicious `challenge`.
    7. If the system shell is invoked by `subprocess.run` and processes the command, the shell command `$(whoami)` within the `challenge` string will be executed on the server. The output of this command might be included in the audio generated by `flite` or could have other unintended consequences depending on the context and the presence of `sox`.

- Impact:
    Successful command injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. The severity of the impact depends on the permissions of the user running the web application. At a minimum, it can lead to information disclosure (e.g., output of `whoami` or other commands being spoken in the audio or logged). In a worst-case scenario, an attacker could gain full control of the server.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The code does not sanitize or escape the `challenge` string before passing it to `subprocess.run`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The `challenge` string generated and stored in `CaptchaStore` should be strictly controlled to prevent injection of shell-sensitive characters. Implement input validation to ensure that only expected characters are used in the challenge.
    - Command parameterization: Instead of passing the entire challenge string as a single argument to `flite`, if possible, explore if `flite` or `sox` APIs allow for safer ways to provide input, possibly through file streams or other mechanisms that avoid shell interpretation. If direct command execution is necessary, ensure proper escaping of shell arguments.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure that the web server process runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of successful command injection.

- Preconditions:
    - The application must be using the audio CAPTCHA feature (`CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH` configured).
    - An attacker must be able to inject malicious content into the `challenge` field of the `CaptchaStore` model. This is the primary precondition that needs further investigation to assess the real exploitability.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/captcha/views.py`
    ```python
    def captcha_audio(request, key):
        if settings.CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH:
            try:
                store = CaptchaStore.objects.get(hashkey=key)
            except CaptchaStore.DoesNotExist:
                # HTTP 410 Gone status so that crawlers don't index these expired urls.
                return HttpResponse(status=410)

            text = store.challenge
            if "captcha.helpers.math_challenge" == settings.CAPTCHA_CHALLENGE_FUNCT:
                text = text.replace("*", "times").replace("-", "minus").replace("+", "plus")
            else:
                text = ", ".join(list(text))
            path = str(
                os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), f"{key}_{secrets.token_urlsafe(6)}.wav")
            )
            subprocess.run([settings.CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH, "-t", text, "-o", path])
            # ... (sox processing) ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability lies in the line `subprocess.run([settings.CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH, "-t", text, "-o", path])`. The variable `text`, which comes directly from `store.challenge`, is passed as an argument to the `-t` option of the `flite` command. If `text` contains shell command injection payloads, they will be executed.
    - The code does perform some string replacements for `math_challenge`, but this is not related to shell escaping and does not prevent command injection if the original challenge itself is malicious.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Ensure `CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH` is configured in `settings.py` to enable audio CAPTCHA.
        - Modify the challenge generation function temporarily to allow setting a custom challenge. For example, in `captcha/helpers.py`, if using `random_char_challenge`, temporarily change it to accept a parameter to set the challenge directly for testing. Or, directly insert a `CaptchaStore` record into the database.
    2. **Inject Malicious Challenge:**
        - Create a `CaptchaStore` record directly in the database or through a modified challenge generation process, setting the `challenge` field to `test$(whoami)`. Note the `hashkey` of this record.
    3. **Trigger Audio CAPTCHA Generation:**
        - Access the audio CAPTCHA URL in a browser or using `curl`: `/captcha/audio/<hashkey>.wav`, replacing `<hashkey>` with the hashkey from the previous step.
    4. **Analyze Response/Server Behavior:**
        - Listen to the generated audio file. Check if the audio output contains the result of the `whoami` command. This would confirm command injection.
        - Examine server logs for any unusual activity or errors that might indicate command execution.
        - (Optional, for more in-depth testing): Use network monitoring tools to observe any outbound network connections initiated by the `flite` or `sox` processes, which could be a sign of successful command injection leading to further exploitation.

This test case aims to demonstrate the command injection vulnerability. A successful test would involve hearing the output of the `whoami` command in the audio or observing other signs of command execution on the server.
