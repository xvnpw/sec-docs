- **Vulnerability: Insecure Django Settings – DEBUG Enabled and Weak SECRET_KEY**  
  - **Description:**  
    An external attacker may exploit the fact that the project’s settings file sets `DEBUG = True` and uses a hardcoded, trivial secret key (`SECRET_KEY = "empty"`). By intentionally causing an error (for example, by visiting a non‐existent URL), the attacker can trigger Django’s debug error page. This page will reveal sensitive internal configuration details (such as settings, file paths, installed apps, and even portions of the source code), providing the attacker with a roadmap of the application’s inner workings.
    - *Step by step triggering:*  
      1. Deploy the application with the provided `testproject/settings.py` configuration.  
      2. Visit an invalid URL or deliberately cause an unhandled exception.  
      3. View the resulting debug error page showing detailed environment and configuration information.
  - **Impact:**  
    Exposure of sensitive configuration data (including the weak secret key) can lead to session tampering, compromised signing of cookies and tokens, and further attacks against cryptographic functions. In a production environment, this is critical because it greatly assists an attacker in mounting additional exploits.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    There are no mitigations in the project. The settings explicitly set `DEBUG = True` and `SECRET_KEY = "empty"`.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Disable debug mode (i.e. set `DEBUG = False`) in any publicly deployed instance.  
    - Generate and use a secure, random secret key in production.  
    - Properly configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to restrict accepted host headers.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The application must be deployed using the current `testproject/settings.py` configuration (i.e. with debug mode enabled and the weak secret key in use).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `/code/testproject/settings.py`, the following lines are present:  
      ```python
      DEBUG = True  
      SECRET_KEY = "empty"
      ```  
      These settings are intended only for testing purposes but are extremely dangerous if the application is accessible publicly.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application to a publicly accessible environment using the provided settings.  
    2. Navigate to a deliberately invalid URL (for example, by entering a wrong path in the browser).  
    3. Observe that Django’s detailed error/debug page is displayed, showing sensitive settings, stack traces, and the insecure `SECRET_KEY`.  
    4. Confirm that the debug output contains the hardcoded values and internal configuration details.

- **Vulnerability: Insecure Temporary File Handling in Audio Captcha Generation**  
  - **Description:**  
    The `captcha_audio` view builds temporary file paths for processing audio captchas by concatenating a valid captcha key with a short random token generated via `secrets.token_urlsafe(6)`, using the system’s temporary directory (obtained from `tempfile.gettempdir()`). These paths are then passed to external subprocess calls (e.g. to generate or process audio files) without using an atomic, secure file‐creation function. An attacker who can write to the shared temporary directory may attempt a race (or symlink) attack by preemptively creating a symbolic link at the predicted file path, causing the subprocess to write its output to an attacker‑controlled location.
    - *Step by step triggering:*  
      1. An attacker (with the ability to write to the system’s temporary folder) monitors or predicts the file‑naming pattern such as `<key>_<randomtoken>.wav`.  
      2. The attacker creates a symbolic link at a probable target name, redirecting the output to a file of their choice.  
      3. The attacker then triggers the `captcha_audio` endpoint with a valid captcha key.  
      4. The subprocess writes its output to the symlink target, thereby overwriting or corrupting an arbitrary file.
  - **Impact:**  
    If exploited, this flaw could allow an attacker to overwrite sensitive files or inject unwanted data into critical files. In a worst-case scenario (for example, on a misconfigured or shared system), this might lead to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The code does use `secrets.token_urlsafe(6)` to add randomness to the filename; however, the randomness does not guarantee that file creation happens atomically or that the file is safe from race conditions.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Use secure temporary file creation functions (such as `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` with proper flags or equivalent atomic file‑creation methods) to avoid TOCTOU race conditions.  
    - Validate that any temporary file created is not a symbolic link (by checking file status before writing).  
    - Enforce strict file permissions on temporary files.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The attacker must have (or be able to induce) write access to the shared temporary directory (e.g. `/tmp` on Unix systems).  
    - The attacker must be able to predict or influence the file‑naming scheme by repeatedly triggering the endpoint.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `/code/captcha/views.py`, the audio captcha function contains the following key snippet:  
      ```python
      path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), f"{key}_{secrets.token_urlsafe(6)}.wav")
      subprocess.run([settings.CAPTCHA_FLITE_PATH, "-t", text, "-o", path])
      ```  
      There is no use of an atomic file‑creation call (e.g. no use of `NamedTemporaryFile` with `delete=False` and proper flags), leaving a window for a race condition.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Identify (or obtain) a valid captcha `key` by first triggering a captcha image request.  
    2. In a controlled test environment, pre-create a symbolic link in the system’s temporary directory following the naming convention `<key>_<suffix>.wav`, linking it to a harmless test file (or, in a real exploit scenario, to a sensitive file).  
    3. Trigger the `captcha_audio` endpoint with the identified key and observe whether the subprocess call writes to the attacker‑controlled destination.  
    4. Verify that the file being overwritten (or written to) is not an intended temporary file.  
    5. Repeating this under concurrent conditions can help confirm the presence of a race condition.

- **Vulnerability: Global Random State Manipulation in Captcha Image Generation**  
  - **Description:**  
    To ensure that the same captcha image is rendered for a given key, the `captcha_image` view seeds Python’s global random state with the user‐supplied `key` by calling `random.seed(key)`. Although the code later attempts to “reset” the state by calling `random.seed()` with no parameter, this practice affects the global random number generator and may be unsafe in a multitasking or multithreaded environment. An attacker who can reliably trigger the view with a known key may be able to predict the sequence of random numbers used soon after—thereby undermining the randomness that other security functions (or even parts of the captcha generation) depend on.
    - *Step by step triggering:*  
      1. The attacker calls the `captcha_image` endpoint with a known (or captured) captcha key, causing `random.seed(key)` to be invoked.  
      2. In a race or if the application processes multiple requests concurrently, the modified random state may be used in subsequent operations.  
      3. The attacker then observes (or deduces) the outputs of functions relying on Python’s global random state (for example, the letter color generation or even parts of a newly generated captcha challenge).
  - **Impact:**  
    Predictability of the random state can weaken the captcha challenge itself or any other feature relying on randomness (such as token generation elsewhere in the application). This predictability can help an attacker craft input that bypasses the intended randomness of the captcha or other defenses.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The function calls `random.seed()` (with no parameters) after generating the image in an attempt to reset the random state. However, this does not guarantee that concurrent operations are not affected by the altered global state.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Use an isolated instance of a random number generator (for example, instantiate a local `random.Random(key)` object) rather than reseeding the global random module.  
    - Ensure that any deterministic behavior required for image generation does not affect the global state.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The attacker must be able to trigger the `captcha_image` view with a known key and then observe other functionality that relies on Python’s global random generator in a concurrent or closely timed scenario.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `/code/captcha/views.py`, the function begins with:  
      ```python
      random.seed(key)  # Do not generate different images for the same key
      …  
      # After captcha image generation
      random.seed()
      ```  
      This practice temporarily overrides the global random state based on externally provided data (the captcha key).
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Trigger the `captcha_image` endpoint with a known captcha key and capture details of the generated image (such as letter rotation angles or colors, if observable).  
    2. Immediately invoke another functionality that also uses the global random module (for instance, requesting a new captcha challenge or any debug feature that exposes random-based output).  
    3. Compare the outputs to see if they can be predicted based on the known seeding value.  
    4. If the outputs are predictable (or correlate with the attacker‑controlled key), then the vulnerability is confirmed.
