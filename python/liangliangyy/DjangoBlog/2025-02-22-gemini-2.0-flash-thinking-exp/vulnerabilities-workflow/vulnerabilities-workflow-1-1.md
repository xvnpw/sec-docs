## Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via WeChat Robot Command Injection
- Description:
    1. The application integrates with WeChat using WeRoBot.
    2. The `servermanager/robot.py` module handles WeChat messages.
    3. If a WeChat user sends the message "ADMIN", the robot enters admin mode.
    4. The application checks for a hardcoded admin password defined in `settings.WXADMIN` (or '123' in testing mode).
    5. If the user provides the correct password after sending "ADMIN", they become an authenticated administrator within the WeChat robot session.
    6. Once authenticated, the administrator can send commands to the robot.
    7. The `CommandHandler` in `servermanager/api/commonapi.py` executes these commands using `os.popen(cmd).read()`.
    8. **Vulnerability:**  `os.popen` executes shell commands directly without any sanitization or input validation. A malicious authenticated administrator can inject arbitrary shell commands into the robot, leading to Remote Code Execution on the server.
- Impact:
    - Critical - Successful exploitation allows a threat actor to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete server compromise, data theft, data manipulation, denial of service, and further malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The application relies on a hardcoded password for WeChat admin authentication, which is insecure and easily compromised if exposed or guessed. There is no input validation or sanitization of commands before execution.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Remove the hardcoded admin password and implement a secure authentication mechanism for WeChat admin access. Consider using API keys, OAuth, or other robust authentication methods.
    - **Crucially:** Sanitize and validate all commands received from WeChat before executing them. Implement a strict command whitelist or use parameterized command execution to prevent command injection. Avoid using `os.popen` or similar functions for executing external commands directly with user-provided input. If command execution is absolutely necessary, use safer alternatives and carefully control the input.
    - Implement proper authorization controls to restrict access to sensitive functionalities like command execution to only truly authorized users.
- Preconditions:
    - WeChat robot functionality must be enabled and accessible.
    - An attacker needs to guess or obtain the hardcoded admin password (`WXADMIN` or '123' in testing).
    - The attacker needs to interact with the WeChat robot and authenticate as an administrator.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/servermanager/robot.py`
    - Function: `MessageHandler.handler`
    ```python
    class MessageHandler:
        # ...
        def handler(self):
            info = self.message.content
            # ...
            if self.userinfo.isAdmin and self.userinfo.isPasswordSet:
                if self.userinfo.Command != '' and info.upper() == 'Y':
                    return cmd_handler.run(self.userinfo.Command) # Command Execution
                else:
                    if info.upper() == 'HELPME':
                        return cmd_handler.get_help()
                    self.userinfo.Command = info
                    self.save_session()
                    return "确认执行: " + info + " 命令?"
            # ...
    ```
    - File: `/code/servermanager/api/commonapi.py`
    - Function: `CommandHandler.run` and `CommandHandler.__run_command__`
    ```python
    class CommandHandler:
        # ...
        def run(self, title):
            # ...
            if cmd:
                return self.__run_command__(cmd[0].command) # Calls __run_command__
            else:
                return "未找到相关命令，请输入hepme获得帮助。"

        def __run_command__(self, cmd):
            try:
                res = os.popen(cmd).read() # Vulnerable command execution
                return res
            except BaseException:
                return '命令执行出错!'
    ```
    - **Vulnerability:** The code directly passes the `cmd` variable, which can be influenced by WeChat user input after admin authentication, to `os.popen`. This allows for command injection.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up and configure the WeChat robot to be accessible for testing.
    2. Initiate a conversation with the WeChat robot.
    3. Send the message "ADMIN" to the robot.
    4. The robot should prompt for the admin password. Send the hardcoded password (if known) or '123' if in testing mode. If `WXADMIN` is set in environment, use that value, otherwise try '123'.
    5. If authentication is successful, the robot should respond with "验证通过,请输入命令或者要执行的命令代码:输入helpme获得帮助".
    6. Now, send a malicious command to the robot. For example, to test command execution, try: `ls -al ; id`. This command attempts to list directory contents and then execute the `id` command to show user identity.
    7. Send 'Y' to confirm command execution when prompted by the robot ("确认执行: ... 命令?").
    8. Observe the response from the robot. If the command injection is successful, the response should include the output of both `ls -al` and `id` commands, indicating arbitrary command execution on the server. For example, you might see the output of `ls -al` followed by user and group ID information from `id`.
    9. To further confirm RCE, try more impactful commands like creating a file in a temporary directory (`touch /tmp/rce_test`) and then check if the file is created on the server.

- Vulnerability Name: Unrestricted File Upload with Potential for Arbitrary File Overwrite and Code Execution
- Description:
    1. The application provides a file upload endpoint at `/upload` (view function `fileupload` in `blog/views.py`).
    2. This endpoint is intended for image uploads (图床 functionality).
    3. Authentication is attempted using a `sign` parameter in the GET request, which is compared to a hash of `settings.SECRET_KEY`.
    4. If the `sign` is valid, the application proceeds to save the uploaded files.
    5. Files are saved under `settings.STATICFILES/files/` or `settings.STATICFILES/image/` directories, based on whether the uploaded file is detected as an image (by extension).
    6. Image files are processed using PIL (Pillow) library to re-save with quality optimization.
    7. **Vulnerability:**
        - **Unrestricted File Upload:** While there is a basic `sign` check, it's primarily for preventing unauthorized access, not for restricting file types or content. An attacker who obtains or bypasses the `sign` can upload arbitrary files.
        - **Potential Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Although `os.path.normpath` is used, if an attacker can craft a filename with directory traversal sequences that bypass normalization or exploit vulnerabilities in path handling, they might be able to overwrite existing files within the `STATICFILES_DIRS` location.
        - **Potential Code Execution:** If an attacker uploads a malicious executable file (e.g., `.php`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.html` with JavaScript) and can access its URL via the static file serving mechanism of the web server, they could potentially achieve code execution on the server or client-side execution depending on the file type and server configuration. The risk is higher if the `STATICFILES_DIRS` are served directly by the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) and not just by Django's `staticfiles` app in development.
- Impact:
    - High - Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary file upload, potentially overwriting existing static files. If malicious executable files are uploaded and accessible, it can lead to Remote Code Execution (depending on server configuration and file type). Even uploading HTML files with malicious JavaScript can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the static file serving does not set appropriate `Content-Type` and security headers.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Basic `sign` parameter check for authentication.
    - Using `os.path.normpath` for path normalization (partially mitigates path traversal, but may not be sufficient).
    - Image files are reprocessed using PIL (not a security mitigation, primarily for optimization).
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Stronger Authentication and Authorization:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the file upload endpoint. Relying solely on a simple `sign` is not sufficient for security.
    - **File Type Validation and Whitelisting:** Implement strict file type validation to only allow intended file types (e.g., images). Use a whitelist approach and reject any file types not explicitly allowed. Validate file content (magic bytes, MIME type) in addition to file extensions, as extensions can be easily spoofed.
    - **Filename Sanitization:** Sanitize filenames to prevent directory traversal attempts and other malicious filenames. Avoid directly using user-provided filenames. Consider generating unique, random filenames or using a controlled naming scheme.
    - **Path Traversal Prevention:** Implement robust path traversal prevention measures beyond `os.path.normpath`. Ensure that the target directory for file uploads is securely configured and that uploaded files cannot be placed outside of the intended directory.
    - **Security Headers:** Configure the web server to serve static files with appropriate security headers (e.g., `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` for unknown files, `Content-Disposition: attachment` to force download, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Content-Security-Policy`) to mitigate potential client-side attacks and ensure files are treated as static data, not executable content.
- Preconditions:
    - The `/upload` endpoint must be accessible.
    - An attacker needs to obtain or bypass the `sign` parameter validation (which is relatively weak as it's based on `SECRET_KEY` hash but exposed in GET requests).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/blog/views.py`
    - Function: `fileupload`
    ```python
    @csrf_exempt
    def fileupload(request):
        # ...
        if request.method == 'POST':
            sign = request.GET.get('sign', None)
            if not sign:
                return HttpResponseForbidden()
            if not sign == get_sha256(get_sha256(settings.SECRET_KEY)): # Weak Authentication
                return HttpResponseForbidden()
            response = []
            for filename in request.FILES:
                timestr = timezone.now().strftime('%Y/%m/%d')
                imgextensions = ['jpg', 'png', 'jpeg', 'bmp']
                fname = u''.join(str(filename))
                isimage = len([i for i in imgextensions if fname.find(i) >= 0]) > 0
                base_dir = os.path.join(settings.STATICFILES, "files" if not isimage else "image", timestr)
                if not os.path.exists(base_dir):
                    os.makedirs(base_dir)
                savepath = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(base_dir, f"{uuid.uuid4().hex}{os.path.splitext(filename)[-1]}")) # Path Normalization - potentially insufficient
                if not savepath.startswith(base_dir):
                    return HttpResponse("only for post")
                with open(savepath, 'wb+') as wfile: # File Saving
                    for chunk in request.FILES[filename].chunks():
                        wfile.write(chunk)
                if isimage:
                    from PIL import Image
                    image = Image.open(savepath)
                    image.save(savepath, quality=20, optimize=True) # Image reprocessing - not security
                url = static(savepath)
                response.append(url)
            return HttpResponse(response)
        else:
            return HttpResponse("only for post")
    ```
    - **Vulnerability:** The code lacks proper file type validation, filename sanitization, and robust path traversal prevention. The `sign` based authentication is weak.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Obtain the valid `sign` value. This might require knowing `settings.SECRET_KEY` or finding a way to extract it if it's inadvertently exposed. If `SECRET_KEY` is very strong and not exposed, bypassing the `sign` might not be directly feasible for an external attacker. However, for testing purposes, assume you can obtain a valid `sign`.
    2. Craft a malicious file. For example, create a simple HTML file with JavaScript (`malicious.html`):
    ```html
    <html>
    <body>
    <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability from File Upload");</script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    3. Prepare a POST request to `/upload?sign=[VALID_SIGN]` with `malicious.html` as a file upload. Use `curl`, `Postman`, or a similar tool.
    4. Send the request to the application.
    5. The application should respond with a success status (HTTP 200) and return the URL of the uploaded file.
    6. Access the returned URL in a web browser.
    7. Check if the JavaScript alert box ("XSS Vulnerability from File Upload") appears. If it does, it confirms that arbitrary HTML/JS files can be uploaded and served as static content, leading to potential XSS.
    8. To test for potential code execution (if applicable to your server environment and file types), try uploading executable files (e.g., `.php`, `.py`, `.sh`) and attempt to access them via the returned URL. Observe the server's behavior to determine if code execution is possible. For example, if you upload a PHP file, try to access it via the browser and see if the PHP code is executed by the server.
    9. To test path traversal, craft a filename like `../../../evil.txt` and upload it. Check if the file is saved outside the intended `STATICFILES_DIRS` or if you can overwrite existing files. This might be more challenging to exploit due to `os.path.normpath`, but it's worth testing different path traversal payloads.

- Vulnerability Name: Open Redirect in OAuth Login
- Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious OAuth login URL by manipulating the `next_url` parameter.
    2. When a user clicks on this crafted link and successfully authenticates via OAuth, they will be redirected to the attacker-controlled URL instead of the intended page within the DjangoBlog application.
    3. This can be used for phishing attacks, where users are redirected to a fake login page or malicious website after OAuth authentication.
- Impact:
    - High - Users can be redirected to malicious websites, potentially leading to credential theft, malware installation, or other security breaches. This can severely damage user trust and the reputation of the website.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code attempts to validate the `next_url` by checking `p.netloc`, but this check is insufficient and can be bypassed.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement a robust whitelist of allowed hostnames or use Django's `is_safe_url` utility function to validate the `next_url` parameter.
    - Properly sanitize and validate the `next_url` parameter to ensure it is a safe URL within the application's domain.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must have OAuth login functionality enabled.
    - An attacker needs to be able to craft URLs for OAuth login, which is typically the case.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/oauth/views.py`
    - Function: `get_redirecturl(request)`
    ```python
    def get_redirecturl(request):
        nexturl = request.GET.get('next_url', None)
        if not nexturl or nexturl == '/login/' or nexturl == '/login':
            nexturl = '/'
            return nexturl
        p = urlparse(nexturl)
        if p.netloc:
            site = get_current_site().domain
            if not p.netloc.replace('www.', '') == site.replace('www.', ''):
                logger.info('非法url:' + nexturl)
                return "/"
        return nexturl
    ```
    - The code retrieves the `next_url` parameter from the GET request.
    - It attempts to validate the URL by parsing it using `urlparse` and checking if `p.netloc` (the network location) is present.
    - It then compares `p.netloc` (after removing 'www.') with the current site's domain (also after removing 'www.').
    - **Vulnerability:** This validation is flawed. An attacker can bypass this check by using URLs with different schemes or by encoding malicious characters in the hostname. For example, using a URL like `http://attacker.com@yourdomain.com` or `http://yourdomain.com.attacker.com` can bypass this check. The check only verifies if the netloc *contains* the domain, not if it *starts* with it or is a subdomain.
    - After the flawed check, the code returns the unsanitized `nexturl`, leading to an open redirect.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Access the application's login page.
    2. Initiate an OAuth login flow (e.g., for Google, GitHub, etc.). Capture the OAuth authorization URL.
    3. Modify the `redirect_uri` parameter in the OAuth authorization URL to point to the application's OAuth authorize endpoint (e.g., `/oauth/authorize?type=google`) and append a malicious `next_url` parameter. For example, if using Google OAuth and the application domain is `yourdomain.com`, craft a URL like:
    ```
    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://yourdomain.com/oauth/authorize?type=google&scope=openid%20email&next_url=http://attacker.com
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with the actual client ID of the application.
    4. Open the crafted URL in a browser.
    5. Complete the OAuth login process using valid credentials.
    6. After successful OAuth authentication, observe that you are redirected to `http://attacker.com` instead of the expected page on `yourdomain.com`.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in RSS Feed via Markdown Rendering
- Description:
    1. The application uses Markdown to render article content in RSS feeds.
    2. If the Markdown rendering process in the RSS feed does not properly sanitize HTML, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into article content.
    3. When a user views the RSS feed through a feed reader or browser, the injected JavaScript code will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
- Impact:
    - High - Successful XSS can lead to account compromise, data theft, and further attacks against users viewing the RSS feed.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project uses `CommonMarkdown.get_markdown` to render markdown, which uses `markdown` library and extensions like `codehilite`, `toc`, and `tables`. It's unclear from the provided files if output sanitization is performed after markdown rendering in the RSS feed generation context.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Ensure that the output of `CommonMarkdown.get_markdown` is properly sanitized before being included in the RSS feed.
    - Use a robust HTML sanitization library (like `bleach` which is already in `utils.py` but not explicitly used in feed generation) to remove or escape any potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes from the rendered Markdown content before including it in the RSS feed.
- Preconditions:
    - RSS feed functionality must be enabled.
    - The application must use Markdown for article content.
    - An attacker needs to be able to create or modify article content, which is usually possible for authors/administrators.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/djangoblog/feeds.py`
    - Function: `item_description(self, item)`
    ```python
    def item_description(self, item):
        return CommonMarkdown.get_markdown(item.body)
    ```
    - The code uses `CommonMarkdown.get_markdown(item.body)` to generate the item description for the RSS feed.
    - File: `/code/djangoblog/utils.py`
    - Function: `CommonMarkdown.get_markdown(value)`
    ```python
    class CommonMarkdown:
        @staticmethod
        def _convert_markdown(value):
            md = markdown.Markdown(
                extensions=[
                    'extra',
                    'codehilite',
                    'toc',
                    'tables',
                ]
            )
            body = md.convert(value)
            toc = md.toc
            return body, toc

        @staticmethod
        def get_markdown_with_toc(value):
            body, toc = CommonMarkdown._convert_markdown(value)
            return body, toc

        @staticmethod
        def get_markdown(value):
            body, toc = CommonMarkdown._convert_markdown(value)
            return body
    ```
    - `CommonMarkdown.get_markdown` simply converts Markdown to HTML using the `markdown` library without explicit sanitization in this function. While `utils.py` defines `sanitize_html` using `bleach`, it's not used in `CommonMarkdown.get_markdown` directly.
    - **Vulnerability:** If article `body` contains malicious Markdown that, when converted to HTML, includes JavaScript, and this HTML is not sanitized before being put into the RSS feed, then XSS is possible. RSS readers might execute JavaScript embedded in feed items.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Log in to the DjangoBlog admin panel as an author or administrator.
    2. Create a new article or edit an existing one.
    3. In the article body, insert the following Markdown code to inject JavaScript:
    ```markdown
    <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
    ```
    4. Publish the article.
    5. Access the RSS feed URL of the blog (e.g., `/feed/` or `/rss/`).
    6. View the RSS feed source code or open it in an RSS reader.
    7. Observe if the `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>` tag is present in the RSS feed item's description.
    8. If using a browser to view the RSS feed, check if the JavaScript alert box (`XSS Vulnerability`) appears. If using an RSS reader, check if it executes JavaScript (behavior might vary depending on the RSS reader, some might block JS execution). If the script tag is present and/or JavaScript executes, then the vulnerability is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Path Traversal in Avatar Download Functionality
- Description:
    1. The `save_user_avatar` function in `djangoblog/utils.py` downloads user avatars from URLs provided in OAuth profiles.
    2. If the provided URL is not properly validated and sanitized, an attacker could provide a malicious URL that points to:
        - Internal resources on the server (SSRF), potentially exposing sensitive information or internal services.
        - Local file paths (Path Traversal), potentially reading sensitive files on the server.
    3. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to internal resources or sensitive data.
    4. The `sync_user_avatar` management command in `/code/blog/management/commands/sync_user_avatar.py` uses this vulnerable `save_user_avatar` function to periodically synchronize user avatars. This command execution can be triggered by system administrators, making the vulnerability exploitable during routine maintenance tasks.
- Impact:
    - High - SSRF and Path Traversal vulnerabilities can lead to the exposure of sensitive internal data, access to internal services, and potentially remote code execution in some scenarios.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The code checks the response status code and image extensions, but it lacks proper URL validation and sanitization to prevent SSRF and Path Traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement strict validation of the avatar URL to ensure it points to a valid external image resource and not to internal resources or local file paths.
    - Whitelist allowed protocols (e.g., `http`, `https`) and hostnames for avatar URLs.
    - Prevent resolving to internal IP addresses or reserved hostnames.
    - Sanitize the URL to prevent path traversal attempts (e.g., block `..` sequences).
- Preconditions:
    - OAuth login functionality must be enabled.
    - The application must use the `save_user_avatar` function to download and store user avatars from OAuth providers.
    - An attacker needs to be able to control the avatar URL provided by the OAuth provider or manipulate the OAuth flow to inject a malicious avatar URL.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/djangoblog/utils.py`
    - Function: `save_user_avatar(url)`
    ```python
    def save_user_avatar(url):
        '''
        保存用户头像
        :param url:头像url
        :return: 本地路径
        '''
        logger.info(url)

        try:
            basedir = os.path.join(settings.STATICFILES, 'avatar')
            rsp = requests.get(url, timeout=2) # requests.get without URL validation
            if rsp.status_code == 200:
                if not os.path.exists(basedir):
                    os.makedirs(basedir)

                image_extensions = ['.jpg', '.png', 'jpeg', '.gif']
                isimage = len([i for i in image_extensions if url.endswith(i)]) > 0
                ext = os.path.splitext(url)[1] if isimage else '.jpg'
                save_filename = str(uuid.uuid4().hex) + ext
                logger.info('保存用户头像:' + basedir + save_filename)
                with open(os.path.join(basedir, save_filename), 'wb+') as file:
                    file.write(rsp.content)
                return static('avatar/' + save_filename)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(e)
            return static('blog/img/avatar.png')
    ```
    - The code uses `requests.get(url, timeout=2)` to download the avatar from the provided `url`.
    - **Vulnerability:** There is no validation or sanitization of the `url` before making the `requests.get` call. This makes the application vulnerable to SSRF and Path Traversal. An attacker could provide URLs like:
        - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` (SSRF to internal admin panel)
        - `http://localhost/server-status` (SSRF to server status page if running on localhost)
        - `file:///etc/passwd` (Path Traversal to read local files - may or may not work depending on `requests` library and OS, but still a risk)
        - `http://username:password@attacker.com/` (Credential leakage if the application follows redirects to attacker's site with credentials in URL).
    - The check for `image_extensions` and `rsp.status_code == 200` only happens *after* the potentially dangerous request is made, and doesn't prevent SSRF/Path Traversal.

    - Function: `Command.handle`
    ```python
    class Command(BaseCommand):
        # ...
        def handle(self, *args, **options):
            # ...
            for u in users:
                # ...
                url = u.picture
                if url:
                    if url.startswith(static_url):
                        if self.test_picture(url):
                            continue
                        else:
                            if u.metadata:
                                manage = get_manager_by_type(u.type)
                                url = manage.get_picture(u.metadata) # Get avatar URL from OAuth provider
                                url = save_user_avatar(url) # Vulnerable function call
                            else:
                                url = static('blog/img/avatar.png')
                    else:
                        url = save_user_avatar(url) # Vulnerable function call
                else:
                    url = static('blog/img/avatar.png')
                # ...

    ```
    - The `sync_user_avatar` management command iterates through OAuth users and calls `save_user_avatar` with the user's avatar URL retrieved from their OAuth profile or directly from `u.picture`. This command execution makes the SSRF/Path Traversal vulnerability in `save_user_avatar` more relevant as it's used in a scheduled or manually triggered task.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a network traffic capture tool (e.g., Wireshark or tcpdump) or a request logging service (like webhook.site or requestbin.com).
    2. Initiate an OAuth login flow (e.g., using Google, GitHub, etc.).
    3. During the OAuth flow, if possible, manipulate or intercept the OAuth response to inject a malicious avatar URL. If direct manipulation isn't feasible, try to find an OAuth provider that allows setting a custom avatar URL and set it to a malicious URL before initiating the login. Example malicious URLs to test:
        - SSRF: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` (replace `8000` with your application's port if different)
        - Path Traversal: `file:///etc/passwd` (for Linux-based servers) or `file:///C:/Windows/win.ini` (for Windows-based servers - might not work directly due to `requests` library limitations but worth testing). For testing SSRF to an external service, you can use a request logging service URL like `https://webhook.site/your_unique_webhook_id`.
    4. Complete the OAuth login process.
    5. Observe the network traffic capture or request logs.
    6. **For SSRF:** Check if there are requests made by the server to internal resources like `127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` or `localhost/server-status` or to your request logging service URL. If you see such requests originating from the server, SSRF is confirmed.
    7. **For Path Traversal:** Check server logs for any errors related to file access or if the application attempts to process or display content that might indicate local file access (less likely to be directly visible in this function's context, but server-side errors might indicate attempts). For testing Path Traversal more effectively, you might need to modify the code temporarily to log or expose the content read from the file, if possible, without breaking the application significantly. For the purpose of this test case as an external attacker, demonstrating SSRF is more readily achievable and sufficient to prove the vulnerability in the URL handling.
    8. **Trigger Avatar Sync Command:** Alternatively, or additionally, you can wait for the scheduled execution of `sync_user_avatar` command (if it's scheduled) or manually execute the command `python manage.py sync_user_avatar` on the server after setting a malicious avatar URL in your OAuth profile. Observe the server's network traffic or logs during the execution of this command to detect SSRF attempts.
