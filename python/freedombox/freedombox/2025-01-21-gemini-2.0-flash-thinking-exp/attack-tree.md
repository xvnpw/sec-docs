## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Exploit FreedomBox System Itself](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_critical_node_exploit_freedombox_system_itself.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE Gain Root Access to FreedomBox](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_root_access_to_freedombox.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Vulnerability in FreedomBox Core Software](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerability_in_freedombox_core_software.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Unpatched Package Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_unpatched_package_vulnerability.md)

        * Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities in FreedomBox-specific packages that haven't been patched.
        * This often involves exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with available exploit code.
        * Success grants the attacker root privileges on the FreedomBox system.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Vulnerability in Underlying Debian OS](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerability_in_underlying_debian_os.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Unpatched Debian Package Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_unpatched_debian_package_vulnerability.md)

        * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Debian packages that FreedomBox relies on.
        * Similar to the above, this often involves exploiting known vulnerabilities.
        * Success grants the attacker root privileges on the FreedomBox system.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_weak_or_default_credentials.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Brute-force SSH/Web Interface Password](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_brute-force_sshweb_interface_password.md)

        * Attackers attempt to guess the SSH or web interface password through repeated login attempts.
        * This is effective if the FreedomBox uses weak or default passwords.
        * Successful brute-force grants the attacker initial access, which can be escalated to root.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Misconfigured Services](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_misconfigured_services.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Unsecured Remote Access (e.g., exposed SSH)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_unsecured_remote_access__e_g___exposed_ssh_.md)

        * Attackers exploit misconfigured firewall rules that allow unrestricted access to services like SSH from the public internet.
        * This, combined with weak credentials or vulnerabilities in the service itself, can lead to root access.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE Manipulate FreedomBox Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_manipulate_freedombox_configuration.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Disable Security Features](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_disable_security_features.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Disable Firewall Rules](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_disable_firewall_rules.md)

        * Attackers with sufficient privileges (often gained through exploiting other vulnerabilities) disable the FreedomBox's firewall.
        * This removes a critical security barrier, exposing services to potential attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Introduce Malicious Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_introduce_malicious_configurations.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Modify DNS Settings to Redirect Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_modify_dns_settings_to_redirect_traffic.md)

        * Attackers with sufficient privileges modify the DNS settings managed by FreedomBox.
        * This allows them to redirect traffic intended for the application to a malicious server, enabling phishing or data interception.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Services Managed by FreedomBox](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_services_managed_by_freedombox.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Vulnerabilities in Web Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_web_server__e_g___apache__nginx_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Unpatched Web Server Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_unpatched_web_server_vulnerability.md)

    * Attackers target known vulnerabilities in the web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx) managed by FreedomBox.
    * This is particularly effective if FreedomBox is running an outdated version of the web server with known security flaws.
    * Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to compromise the application or the FreedomBox itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack via FreedomBox](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_via_freedombox.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH Intercept Traffic Through FreedomBox](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_intercept_traffic_through_freedombox.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH FreedomBox Acting as a Router/Gateway](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_freedombox_acting_as_a_routergateway.md)

    * If the FreedomBox is configured as the network gateway, all traffic to and from the application passes through it.
    * Attackers on the same network (or through a compromised FreedomBox) can intercept this traffic.
    * This allows them to eavesdrop on sensitive data, including login credentials and application data, especially if HTTPS is not properly implemented or the FreedomBox's CA is compromised.
