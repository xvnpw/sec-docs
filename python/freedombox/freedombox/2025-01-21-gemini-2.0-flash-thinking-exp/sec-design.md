    style F fill:#aaf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Detailed Data Flow Description:**

1. **User Initiates Request:** A user on their device sends an HTTPS request to access a web application hosted on the FreedomBox.
2. **Internet Transit:** The request travels across the internet.
3. **Firewall Inspection:** The FreedomBox firewall intercepts the incoming request on port 443. Firewall rules determine if the traffic is allowed.
4. **Web Server Handling:** If allowed, the request reaches the web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache). The web server may handle static content directly or act as a reverse proxy.
5. **Application Server Processing:** For dynamic content, the web server forwards the request to the appropriate application server (e.g., a Python application running with a WSGI server).
6. **Database Interaction:** The application server may need to retrieve or store data, sending a database query to the database server (e.g., PostgreSQL).
7. **Database Response:** The database server processes the query and returns the requested data to the application server.
8. **Response Generation:** The application server processes the data and generates an HTTP response.
9. **Response Delivery (Reverse Path):** The HTTP response travels back through the web server, firewall, and internet to the user's device.
