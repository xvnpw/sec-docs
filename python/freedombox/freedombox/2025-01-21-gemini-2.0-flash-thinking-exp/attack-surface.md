# Attack Surface Analysis for freedombox/freedombox

## Attack Surface: [Weak Default Credentials for FreedomBox Administration](./attack_surfaces/weak_default_credentials_for_freedombox_administration.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Weak Default Credentials for FreedomBox Administration
    *   **Description:** The initial administrative account for FreedomBox (often `admin` or `freedom`) may have a default, well-known password.
    *   **How FreedomBox Contributes:** FreedomBox sets up this initial administrative account, and if the user doesn't change the password, it remains a significant vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default `admin` password to log into the FreedomBox Plinth interface and gains full control over the system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the FreedomBox instance, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and control over services managed by FreedomBox.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Provide clear instructions and prompts during the application setup process to force users to change the default FreedomBox administrator password.
        *   **Users:** Immediately change the default password for the FreedomBox administrative user upon initial setup. Enforce strong password policies.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in FreedomBox Plinth Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_freedombox_plinth_web_interface.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in FreedomBox Plinth Web Interface
    *   **Description:** The web interface (Plinth) used to manage FreedomBox may contain security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), or authentication bypasses.
    *   **How FreedomBox Contributes:** Plinth is a core component of FreedomBox, providing the primary management interface. Any vulnerabilities within it directly expose the system.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability in a Plinth configuration page to inject malicious JavaScript, potentially stealing administrator session cookies.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to FreedomBox configuration, potential for privilege escalation, and the ability to manipulate FreedomBox settings or data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Keep the FreedomBox instance updated to the latest stable version, which includes security patches for Plinth. If integrating with Plinth's API, carefully sanitize any data received from it.
        *   **Users:** Regularly update the FreedomBox instance. Avoid using untrusted networks when accessing the Plinth interface.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Enabled FreedomBox Network Services](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_enabled_freedombox_network_services.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Enabled FreedomBox Network Services
    *   **Description:** FreedomBox enables various network services (SSH, VPN, DNS, etc.) which, if vulnerable or misconfigured, can be exploited.
    *   **How FreedomBox Contributes:** FreedomBox's purpose is to provide these services, inherently increasing the network attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the OpenVPN server running on FreedomBox to gain unauthorized access to the network.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the network, data interception, denial of service, or compromise of the FreedomBox instance itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Document which FreedomBox services are necessary for the application and advise users to disable unnecessary services. Provide guidance on secure configuration of these services.
        *   **Users:** Only enable necessary network services. Keep all enabled services updated. Configure strong authentication and encryption for these services. Utilize the FreedomBox firewall to restrict access to these services.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in FreedomBox Software Packages](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_freedombox_software_packages.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in FreedomBox Software Packages
    *   **Description:** FreedomBox relies on numerous underlying software packages. Vulnerabilities in these packages can be exploited to compromise the system.
    *   **How FreedomBox Contributes:** FreedomBox's functionality depends on these packages, making it susceptible to their vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the `systemd` package used by FreedomBox allows an attacker to gain root privileges.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the FreedomBox instance, potentially affecting all services and data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Emphasize the importance of keeping the FreedomBox instance updated. Monitor security advisories related to the packages used by FreedomBox.
        *   **Users:** Regularly update the FreedomBox instance through its update mechanism. Subscribe to security mailing lists for FreedomBox and its underlying operating system.
