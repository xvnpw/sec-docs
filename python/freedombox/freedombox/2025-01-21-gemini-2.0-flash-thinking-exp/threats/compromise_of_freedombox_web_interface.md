    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Using compromised credentials obtained from other breaches to attempt login.
    *   **Exploiting Authentication Logic Flaws:**  Vulnerabilities in the authentication process itself, such as bypassing authentication checks or exploiting flaws in password reset mechanisms.
    *   **Authorization Issues:**  Exploiting flaws in how permissions are managed, allowing an attacker with limited access to escalate privileges.
*   **Session Management Weaknesses:**
    *   **Session Fixation:**  Tricking a user into using a known session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the session.
    *   **Session Hijacking (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into the web interface that steal session cookies.
    *   **Insecure Session Storage:**  Storing session information insecurely, making it accessible to attackers.
    *   **Lack of Proper Session Invalidation:**  Failure to invalidate sessions upon logout or after a period of inactivity, allowing for replay attacks.
*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into the web interface that are executed by other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Command Injection:**  Injecting malicious commands that are executed by the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system.
    *   **Path Traversal:**  Manipulating file paths to access sensitive files outside the intended webroot.
*   **Web Server Configuration Issues:**
    *   **Insecure Default Configurations:**  Using default configurations that expose unnecessary information or features.
    *   **Missing Security Headers:**  Lack of security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`) that can mitigate certain attacks.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposing sensitive information through error messages, directory listings, or verbose logging.
*   **Compromised Administrator Credentials:**
    *   **Phishing Attacks:**  Tricking administrators into revealing their credentials.
