# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for freedombox/freedombox

## Mitigation Strategy: [Automated Dependency Auditing (FreedomBox-Integrated)](./mitigation_strategies/automated_dependency_auditing__freedombox-integrated_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Automated Dependency Auditing (FreedomBox-Integrated)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Built-in Inventory Script:** Integrate a script (e.g., Python) *directly into FreedomBox* (e.g., as a Plinth module or a background service) that automatically generates a comprehensive inventory of all installed software (Debian packages, Python libraries, FreedomBox modules) and their versions.
    2.  **Vulnerability Database Integration:** Integrate this script with vulnerability databases (NVD, Python Packaging Advisory Database) via APIs or local data feeds. This integration should be part of the FreedomBox codebase.
    3.  **Automated Checks (Background Service):** Configure the script to run automatically as a background service within FreedomBox, checking for vulnerabilities on a regular schedule.
    4.  **Plinth-Integrated Alerting:** Display vulnerability alerts *directly within the Plinth interface*. These alerts should be prominent and include:
        *   Affected package/library and version.
        *   Vulnerability description (CVE ID, severity).
        *   Link to vulnerability details.
        *   *Direct links to Plinth's update functionality* for the affected component, if available.  If not available via Plinth, provide clear command-line instructions.
        *   Prioritization based on severity and exploit availability.
    5.  **Automated Remediation (Ideal):**  Explore the feasibility of *automatically* updating vulnerable packages through Plinth (with user confirmation, or as a configurable option). This is a higher level of integration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits in Dependencies (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the window of vulnerability.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Severity: High to Critical):** Prevents running with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: High):** Provides some detection capability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Reduces risk significantly.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Reduces risk to near zero (with prompt updates).
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Provides some detection.

*   **Currently Implemented (Verify):**
    *   Basic dependency tracking likely exists.
    *   *Unlikely* to have fully automated, Plinth-integrated vulnerability scanning and alerting.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Fully Automated, Plinth-Integrated System:**  This is the key missing component.
    *   **Prioritized Alerting:**  Alerts based on severity and exploit availability.
    *   **Automated Remediation (Ideal):**  Automatic updates through Plinth.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhanced Configuration Validation (Plinth-Integrated)](./mitigation_strategies/enhanced_configuration_validation__plinth-integrated_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Enhanced Configuration Validation (Plinth-Integrated)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Pre-Configuration Validation (Plinth Hooks):** Integrate validation checks *directly into Plinth's code*.  Before applying any configuration change, Plinth should:
        *   Parse the proposed configuration.
        *   Use regular expressions or dedicated parsing libraries to identify insecure configurations.
        *   Check against a *built-in* list of known misconfigurations and security best practices *for each service*.
        *   *Prevent* the application of insecure configurations, displaying clear error messages and guidance to the user *within Plinth*.
    2.  **Security Hardening Defaults:**  Modify FreedomBox's default configurations for all services to be as secure as possible *out of the box*. This minimizes the risk of misconfiguration by users.
    3.  **Configuration Templates (Secure by Default):** Use configuration templates that are designed with security in mind. These templates should:
        *   Minimize the attack surface.
        *   Use strong cryptography.
        *   Follow least privilege principles.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Service Misconfiguration Exploits (Severity: High to Critical):** Prevents common misconfigurations.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Reduces opportunities for privilege escalation through misconfigured services.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of data exposure due to misconfiguration.
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: Medium to High):** Mitigates some DoS vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Service Misconfiguration Exploits:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Reduces risk.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Reduces risk.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Reduces risk for some DoS types.

*   **Currently Implemented (Verify):**
    *   Plinth likely has *some* basic input validation.
    *   *Unlikely* to have comprehensive pre-configuration validation against a built-in list of security best practices.
    *   Default configurations may not be fully hardened.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Pre-Configuration Validation (Plinth-Integrated):** This is the key missing component.
    *   **Security Hardening Defaults:**  Review and strengthen default configurations.
    *   **Secure Configuration Templates:** Ensure templates are secure by design.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plinth Security Hardening (Code-Level)](./mitigation_strategies/plinth_security_hardening__code-level_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Plinth Security Hardening (Code-Level)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mandatory MFA (Plinth Code):** Enforce MFA for *all* Plinth users *at the code level*. This should be a non-bypassable requirement. Integrate support for multiple MFA methods (TOTP, U2F) directly into Plinth.
    2.  **Aggressive Rate Limiting (Plinth Code):** Implement strict rate limiting on Plinth login attempts *within Plinth's code*. This should be more aggressive than standard web application rate limiting.
    3.  **Robust Session Management (Plinth Code):**
        *   Implement short session timeouts.
        *   Use secure, HTTP-only cookies.
        *   Invalidate sessions on password changes or sensitive actions.
        *   Implement protection against session fixation and hijacking (e.g., session ID regeneration) *within Plinth's code*.
    4.  **Input Validation and Output Encoding (Plinth Code):**
        *   Thoroughly validate *all* user input to Plinth, using strict whitelists where possible, *within Plinth's code*.
        *   Properly encode *all* output from Plinth to prevent XSS attacks, using a robust templating engine with automatic escaping.
        *   Sanitize any data used in shell commands or database queries to prevent injection attacks.
    5.  **Detailed Audit Logging (Plinth-Integrated):** Implement *detailed* audit logging of *all* actions performed within Plinth. This should be a built-in feature of Plinth, with logs stored securely and protected from tampering. Log rotation and retention policies should be configurable within Plinth.
    6. **Default Access Restriction:** Configure Plinth *by default* to be accessible only from the local network. Provide clear instructions and options within Plinth for configuring access from other networks (e.g., via VPN or reverse proxy).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Plinth (Severity: High):** MFA and rate limiting.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Severity: High):** MFA.

    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Input validation and output encoding.
    *   **Injection Attacks (Severity: High):** Input sanitization.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** All of the above.
    *   **Account Takeover (Severity: Critical):** MFA.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Significantly reduces the risk of all listed threats.

*   **Currently Implemented (Verify):**
    *   Plinth likely has *some* authentication and session management.
    *   *Unlikely* to have mandatory MFA enforced at the code level.
    *   Rate limiting may be present, but likely not aggressive enough.
    *   Input validation and output encoding may be present, but not comprehensive.
    *   Audit logging may be present, but not to the level of detail described.
    * Default access restriction is unlikely.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Mandatory MFA (Code-Level):** This is crucial.
    *   **Aggressive Rate Limiting (Code-Level):** More robust rate limiting.
    *   **Comprehensive Input Validation and Output Encoding (Code-Level):** Thorough review and strengthening.
    *   **Detailed Audit Logging (Plinth-Integrated):** More comprehensive and secure logging.
    * **Default Restricted Access:** Making local-only access the default.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforced Full Disk Encryption (FreedomBox Setup)](./mitigation_strategies/enforced_full_disk_encryption__freedombox_setup_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Enforced Full Disk Encryption (FreedomBox Setup)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default FDE:** Modify the FreedomBox installation process to make full disk encryption (FDE) the *default* option. Provide clear warnings if the user chooses to disable it.
    2.  **Simplified Key Management:** Integrate key management (e.g., storing the encryption key securely, recovering from a lost key) into the Plinth interface, making it as user-friendly as possible.
    3.  **Strong Cryptography:** Use a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256) and a robust key derivation function (e.g., PBKDF2) by default.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Physical Theft of Device (Severity: Critical):** FDE protects data.
    *   **Unauthorized Physical Access (Severity: Critical):** FDE is a key part of mitigating this.
    *   **Data Recovery from Stolen Device (Severity: Critical):** FDE prevents data recovery.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Physical Theft/Data Recovery:** FDE *eliminates* the risk of data compromise (with a strong key).

*   **Currently Implemented (Verify):**
    *   FreedomBox likely *supports* FDE.
    *   *Unlikely* to *enforce* FDE by default.
    *   Key management integration with Plinth may be limited.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Default FDE:** Making FDE the default option during installation.
    *   **Simplified Key Management (Plinth-Integrated):**  Improving the user experience for key management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Staged Rollouts and Rollback (FreedomBox Update System)](./mitigation_strategies/staged_rollouts_and_rollback__freedombox_update_system_.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy: Staged Rollouts and Rollback (FreedomBox Update System)**

* **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Staging Environment (Ideal):**  Develop a mechanism within FreedomBox to automatically create and manage a staging environment for testing updates. This could involve using containers or virtual machines.
    2.  **Automated Testing Framework:** Integrate an automated testing framework into the FreedomBox update process. This framework should run a suite of tests (functional, security, performance) on the staging environment before any update is released.
    3.  **Automated Rollback:** Implement an automated rollback mechanism within FreedomBox (accessible through Plinth) that can restore the system to a previous version in case of a failed update. This mechanism should rely on backups created automatically before each update.
    4. **Changelog Integration:** Display the changelog for each available update *prominently within Plinth*, highlighting security-related changes.
    5. **User Feedback Mechanism:** Integrate a mechanism within Plinth for users to easily report any issues encountered after an update.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Introduction of New Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical):** Staged rollouts and testing.
    *   **System Instability (Severity: Medium to High):** Testing.
    *   **Data Loss (Severity: Critical):** Automated rollback.
    *   **Downtime (Severity: Medium to High):** Automated rollback.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **New Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **System Instability:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Data Loss:** Provides a recovery mechanism.
    *   **Downtime:** Minimizes downtime.

*   **Currently Implemented (Verify):**
    *   FreedomBox has an update mechanism.
    *   *Unlikely* to have a fully automated staging environment or testing framework.
    *   Automated rollback may be limited or absent.
