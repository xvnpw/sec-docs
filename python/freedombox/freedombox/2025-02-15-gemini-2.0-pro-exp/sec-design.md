# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Debian-based operating system, providing a stable and secure foundation with regular security updates. (Described in the project's documentation and inherent in the choice of Debian).
*   security control: Automatic updates to ensure timely patching of security vulnerabilities. (Described in the project's documentation and implemented through Debian's unattended-upgrades).
*   security control: Use of HTTPS for secure communication between the user and the FreedomBox. (Described in the project's documentation and implemented through Let's Encrypt integration).
*   security control: Firewall to restrict network access to the FreedomBox. (Described in the project's documentation and implemented through `firewalld`).
*   security control: Access control mechanisms to limit user privileges and protect sensitive data. (Described in the project's documentation and implemented through Plinth's user management).
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing (mentioned on the project website, details may vary).
*   security control: Sandboxing of applications to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities. (Partially implemented through application-specific configurations and systemd features).
*   security control: Use of strong passwords and support for multi-factor authentication (2FA) (implemented in Plinth).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party applications and services, which may introduce their own security risks.
*   accepted risk: Potential for user misconfiguration, leading to security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Limited resources for comprehensive security testing and auditing.
*   accepted risk: The inherent complexity of securing a multi-purpose server environment.
*   accepted risk: The possibility of zero-day exploits affecting the underlying operating system or applications.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a comprehensive intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS).
*   Enhance sandboxing capabilities using technologies like containers (e.g., Docker, Podman) or virtual machines.
*   Implement regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
*   Provide more detailed security hardening guides and checklists for users.
*   Develop a formal security incident response plan.
*   Integrate Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) or AppArmor for mandatory access control.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies enforced.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (2FA) for all user accounts.
    *   Secure storage of user credentials (e.g., using salted hashing).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
    *   Session management with secure timeouts and logout functionality.

*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user privileges.
    *   Principle of least privilege applied throughout the system.
    *   Clear separation of duties for different user roles.
    *   Auditing of all access and authorization attempts.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   Use of whitelisting rather than blacklisting for input validation.
    *   Proper encoding of output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
    *   Protection against other common web vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, command injection).

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    *   Regular review and update of cryptographic configurations.
    *   HTTPS with HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).

## BUILD

The FreedomBox build process involves creating disk images for various hardware platforms. While the repository doesn't use a traditional CI system like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for publicly distributing builds, it does have scripts and tools for automating the image creation process. The process is primarily driven by scripts within the repository, executed in a controlled environment.

```mermaid

        BuildScripts -- Includes --> Linting[("Linting\n(Shellcheck)")]
        BuildScripts -- Includes --> StaticAnalysis[("Static Analysis\n(Debian Package Lintian)")]
    end
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers contribute code to the Git repository.
2.  A build server (typically a Debian virtual machine) is set up with the necessary tools and dependencies.
3.  Build scripts (e.g., `setup`, `image`) within the repository are executed.
4.  These scripts fetch packages from Debian and Freedombox repositories.
5.  The scripts perform various tasks, including:
    *   Setting up the target environment (e.g., creating a chroot).
    *   Installing required packages.
    *   Configuring system settings.
    *   Building FreedomBox-specific packages (e.g., Plinth).
    *   Creating a disk image.
6.  Security checks are integrated into the build process:
    *   Linting (e.g., Shellcheck) to identify potential issues in shell scripts.
    *   Static analysis (e.g., Debian package lintian) to check for package quality and security issues.
7.  The resulting disk image is then typically tested and published to a download server.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Use of a controlled build environment (Debian VM) to minimize the risk of contamination.
*   security control: Reliance on official Debian repositories for base packages, ensuring package integrity through cryptographic signatures.
*   security control: Use of build scripts to automate the process and reduce manual errors.
*   security control: Integration of linting (Shellcheck) to catch potential scripting errors.
*   security control: Use of static analysis tools (lintian) to identify potential packaging issues.
*   security control: (Potentially) Code signing of FreedomBox-specific packages. (Needs verification from the repository).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   User data privacy and confidentiality.
*   System availability and stability.
*   Integrity of the FreedomBox software and configuration.
*   User authentication and authorization.
*   Secure communication channels (HTTPS, encrypted email, etc.).
*   Reputation and trustworthiness of the FreedomBox project.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   User credentials (passwords, usernames, API keys): High sensitivity.
*   Personal data stored within applications (emails, files, contacts, messages): High sensitivity.
*   System configuration files: Medium sensitivity.
*   Application logs: Medium sensitivity (may contain sensitive information).
*   Network traffic metadata: Medium sensitivity.
*   Public keys: Low sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the specific process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by users or researchers?
*   Are there any plans to implement more comprehensive sandboxing using containers or VMs?
*   What are the specific procedures for security audits and penetration testing?
*   How are FreedomBox-specific packages signed and verified?
*   What is the long-term strategy for managing the increasing complexity of securing a multi-purpose server?
*   What mechanisms are in place to detect and respond to intrusions?
*   Is there a dedicated security team or individual responsible for security oversight?
*   How is user data backed up and restored, and what security measures are in place for backups?
*   What are the specific legal and regulatory requirements that FreedomBox aims to comply with?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure and private personal server for non-technical users. The project prioritizes user privacy and data ownership over extensive features or enterprise-level scalability.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows security best practices where possible, but may have limited resources for advanced security measures. Users are expected to take some responsibility for securing their own devices and networks.
*   DESIGN: The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the addition of new applications and features. The core components are based on well-established open-source technologies. The build process is automated but may not use a publicly accessible CI/CD pipeline.
