# Attack Surface Analysis for freedombox/freedombox

## Attack Surface: [1. Plinth Web Interface (Privilege Escalation)](./attack_surfaces/1__plinth_web_interface__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Plinth web interface allowing an attacker to gain elevated privileges, potentially leading to root access.
    *   **FreedomBox Contribution:** Plinth *is* the core management interface, inherently requiring elevated privileges to manage system services. This central, privileged role is the direct contribution.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow in a Plinth module responsible for system configuration allows execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. Attacker gains full control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Rigorous code review of Plinth and *all* modules (especially those interacting with system APIs), focusing on input validation, memory safety, and secure coding. Implement robust privilege separation. Use static analysis and fuzzing.
        *   **Users:** Keep FreedomBox and all modules updated. Avoid untrusted modules.

## Attack Surface: [2. Plinth Web Interface (Authentication/Authorization Bypass)](./attack_surfaces/2__plinth_web_interface__authenticationauthorization_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Plinth's authentication or authorization allowing bypass of security controls and unauthorized access.
    *   **FreedomBox Contribution:** Plinth *is* the authentication and authorization gateway for managing the FreedomBox. Its design and implementation directly impact this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A session fixation vulnerability allows hijacking of a user's session, granting access to Plinth without credentials. Or, a flaw in role-based access control allows privilege escalation within Plinth.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to settings, potential data breaches, and possible privilege escalation to root.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication (including MFA support). Use secure session management (HttpOnly/Secure cookies, timeouts, CSRF protection). Enforce strict authorization checks on *all* sensitive operations.
        *   **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords. Enable MFA if available. Regularly review user accounts and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [3. Plinth Web Interface (Injection Attacks - XSS/Command/SQL)](./attack_surfaces/3__plinth_web_interface__injection_attacks_-_xsscommandsql_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities allowing injection of malicious code (scripts, commands, SQL) into Plinth.
    *   **FreedomBox Contribution:** Plinth processes user input and interacts with system components/databases *by design*. This interaction is the direct contribution.
    *   **Example:** Reflected XSS in a Plinth search feature allows injection of JavaScript that steals cookies. Command injection in a module executing shell commands allows arbitrary command execution.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, system compromise, defacement, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Strict input validation and output encoding. Use parameterized queries. Avoid shell commands; if needed, use secure APIs with escaping. Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   **Users:** Keep FreedomBox and modules updated. Be cautious with links and untrusted forms.

## Attack Surface: [4. Unvetted Third-Party Modules](./attack_surfaces/4__unvetted_third-party_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced by insecure or malicious third-party modules.
    *   **FreedomBox Contribution:** FreedomBox's *module system itself* is the direct contribution. The extensibility model creates this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A third-party module contains a backdoor allowing remote control. Or, a module has a known, unpatched vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely; could range from minor leaks to complete system compromise, depending on the module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Rigorous module vetting (code review, security testing, vulnerability handling policy). Provide reporting mechanisms. Implement sandboxing/isolation to limit compromised module impact.
        *   **Users:** Only install modules from trusted sources. Review module permissions before installation. Keep modules updated. Disable/remove unused modules.

## Attack Surface: [5. Default Service Exposure (Unsecured *FreedomBox-Specific* Defaults)](./attack_surfaces/5__default_service_exposure__unsecured_freedombox-specific_defaults_.md)

*   **Description:** Services enabled *by default by FreedomBox* that are not securely configured, where the insecurity is a direct result of FreedomBox's default choices.  This is *narrower* than the previous version.
    *   **FreedomBox Contribution:** FreedomBox's *specific default service configurations* are the direct contribution. This is about *how* FreedomBox sets things up initially.
    *   **Example:**  If FreedomBox, *by default*, enabled SSH with password authentication *and* a default, well-known user account, *that* would be a direct contribution.  (Simply enabling SSH is not enough; it's the insecure *default configuration* that matters here).  Another example: if a FreedomBox-specific service (e.g., a custom backup tool) had an insecure default configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to services, potential data breaches, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Provide secure defaults for *all* FreedomBox-specific services and configurations.  Minimize the use of default credentials.  Implement a security checklist/wizard to guide users through essential hardening steps *immediately* after installation.  Prioritize secure-by-default principles.
        *   **Users:** Immediately after installation, review and harden the configuration of *all* enabled services, paying *special attention* to any services that are unique to FreedomBox or configured by FreedomBox. Change default passwords/usernames. Enable strong authentication.
