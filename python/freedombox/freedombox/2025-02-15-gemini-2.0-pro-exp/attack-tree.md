## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit FreedomBox Services](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_freedombox_services.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Tor Hidden Services [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_tor_hidden_services__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in applications exposed as Tor hidden services, or misconfiguring the hidden service itself. FreedomBox's role is in setting up and managing the hidden service configuration.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   Ensure FreedomBox's Tor configuration follows best practices for hidden service security.
        *   Regularly audit the application behind the hidden service for vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor Tor logs (via FreedomBox, if possible) for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 I2P [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_i2p__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to Tor, exploiting vulnerabilities in applications exposed via I2P, or misconfiguring the I2P router itself. FreedomBox manages the I2P router.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   Ensure FreedomBox keeps the I2P router updated.
        *   Review FreedomBox's default I2P configuration for security best practices.
        *   Monitor I2P logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Other Services (VPN, file sharing, etc.) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_other_services__vpn__file_sharing__etc____high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Each service managed by FreedomBox (OpenVPN, WireGuard, Samba, etc.) has its own potential vulnerabilities. FreedomBox's management of these services is the key attack surface.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   **Service-Specific Updates:** FreedomBox *must* prioritize timely updates for *all* managed services.
        *   **Configuration Audits:** Regularly review FreedomBox's generated configurations for each service.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure FreedomBox configures services with the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** If possible, consider network segmentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Plinth (Web Interface)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_plinth__web_interface_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Plinth Authentication Bypass {CRITICAL} [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_plinth_authentication_bypass_{critical}__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Bypassing Plinth's authentication mechanisms (e.g., through flaws in session management, password reset functionality, or brute-force attacks).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies within Plinth.
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts.
        *   *Strongly recommend* adding MFA support to Plinth.
        *   Use secure cookies (HTTPS-only, secure flag, HttpOnly flag), proper session timeouts, and robust session ID generation.
        *   Audit authentication logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Plinth Input Validation Bypass [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_plinth_input_validation_bypass__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Bypassing input validation checks in Plinth, potentially leading to command injection, SQL injection (if Plinth uses a database), or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   *Always* perform input validation on the server-side.
        *   Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good input) instead of blacklisting.
        *   Use carefully crafted regular expressions to validate input formats.
        *   Avoid using system calls if possible. If necessary, use a safe API that prevents command injection.
