# Attack Surface Analysis for freedombox/freedombox

## Attack Surface: [Plinth Web Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plinth_web_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical and high severity vulnerabilities within the Freedombox web interface (Plinth) itself, such as code injection, authentication bypass, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to administrative access, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) enabling unauthorized actions.
*   **Freedombox Contribution:** Freedombox *is* Plinth. Plinth is the primary management interface, and its vulnerabilities directly expose the entire Freedombox system and any integrated application relying on it.
*   **Example:** A code injection vulnerability in Plinth allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Freedombox server with root privileges, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of Freedombox, complete control over services and data, potential lateral movement to other systems, and severe impact on the integrated application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Updates:** Apply Freedombox security updates immediately upon release to patch Plinth vulnerabilities.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Restrict access to Plinth to only essential, trusted administrators and networks. Use strong authentication.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF in front of Plinth to filter malicious requests and potentially mitigate some web-based attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting Plinth to proactively identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Freedombox Installed Services](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_freedombox_installed_services.md)

*   **Description:** High severity vulnerabilities in services installed and managed through Freedombox (e.g., web servers, databases, VPNs) that can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Freedombox Contribution:** Freedombox simplifies service installation and management. Outdated or vulnerable services installed via Freedombox directly increase the attack surface, especially if the integrated application relies on these services. Freedombox's update mechanism is crucial but relies on timely Debian package updates.
*   **Example:** An outdated web server (like Apache or Nginx) installed via Freedombox contains a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain shell access to the Freedombox server, potentially compromising the integrated application's data or environment.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Compromise of specific services, potential data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential escalation to system-wide compromise, significantly impacting the integrated application's functionality and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Updates:** Configure Freedombox to automatically install security updates for all managed services.
    *   **Minimize Service Footprint:** Only install absolutely necessary services. Remove or disable any unused services to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Service-Specific Hardening:**  Apply service-specific hardening configurations beyond Freedombox defaults, following security best practices for each service.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan Freedombox and its installed services for known vulnerabilities using automated vulnerability scanners.

## Attack Surface: [Underlying Debian OS Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/underlying_debian_os_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Critical and high severity vulnerabilities within the underlying Debian operating system (kernel, core libraries, system utilities) that Freedombox is built upon, allowing for privilege escalation, remote code execution, or system compromise.
*   **Freedombox Contribution:** Freedombox's security posture is fundamentally tied to Debian's security. Unpatched Debian vulnerabilities directly impact Freedombox. Freedombox's update process is essential for maintaining a secure base OS.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability in the Linux kernel allows for local privilege escalation. An attacker gaining initial limited access to Freedombox (e.g., through a web application flaw) can exploit this kernel vulnerability to gain root privileges and completely compromise the system.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full system compromise, complete control over all services and data, potential for lateral movement within the network, and severe impact on the integrated application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automatic OS Updates:** Ensure Freedombox is configured to automatically install security updates for the underlying Debian operating system.
    *   **Kernel Live Patching (if available):** Explore and enable kernel live patching mechanisms if offered by Debian or Freedombox to reduce reboot requirements for kernel security updates.
    *   **System Hardening:** Implement general Debian system hardening practices to reduce the attack surface of the OS itself (e.g., disabling unnecessary kernel modules, using security tools).
    *   **Regular Security Audits of OS Configuration:** Periodically audit the underlying Debian OS configuration for security weaknesses.

## Attack Surface: [Freedombox API Vulnerabilities (if used)](./attack_surfaces/freedombox_api_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical and high severity vulnerabilities in any API (official or unofficial) provided by Freedombox for external interaction, potentially allowing for remote code execution, authentication bypass, or unauthorized data access.
*   **Freedombox Contribution:** If the integrated application utilizes a Freedombox API for management or data exchange, vulnerabilities in this API become a direct and potentially critical attack vector.
*   **Example:** A Freedombox API endpoint used by the integrated application is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient input validation. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through the integrated application to execute arbitrary commands on the Freedombox server with elevated privileges.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Potential for full compromise of Freedombox through the API, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and direct, severe impact on the integrated application's security and functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure API Design & Development:** If developing or using a Freedombox API, prioritize security in the design and development process. Implement robust authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.
    *   **Dedicated API Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Conduct specific security audits and penetration testing focused on the Freedombox API to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for API Access:** Grant the integrated application only the absolutely necessary API permissions.
    *   **Strict Input Validation & Output Encoding:** Implement rigorous input validation and output encoding on both the application and Freedombox API sides to prevent injection attacks.
