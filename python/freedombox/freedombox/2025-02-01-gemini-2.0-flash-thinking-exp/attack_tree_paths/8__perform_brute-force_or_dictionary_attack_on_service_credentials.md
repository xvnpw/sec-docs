### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Perform Brute-force or Dictionary Attack on Service Credentials

#### 4.1 Attack Description Breakdown

**Attack Path:** 8. Perform Brute-force or Dictionary Attack on Service Credentials

**Description:** Attackers use automated tools to brute-force or dictionary attack credentials for services like SSH or VPN.

**Likelihood:** Low (Rate limiting and account lockout are common for services).

**Impact:** Medium to High (Service access, potentially leading to system access).

**Mitigations:**

*   Enforce strong passwords for services
*   Account lockout policies for services
*   Rate limiting for services
*   Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
*   Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for services

#### 4.2 Detailed Analysis

##### 4.2.1 Attack Vectors and Techniques

*   **Internet-facing Services:** Freedombox is often deployed to provide services accessible over the internet. Services like SSH, VPN (if exposed), and the web administration interface are prime targets for brute-force attacks from anywhere in the world. Attackers can scan for open ports and services and then launch attacks.
*   **Local Network Attacks:** If an attacker gains access to the local network (e.g., through compromised devices, insider threat, or physical access), they can target Freedombox services from within the network. This might bypass some perimeter defenses but is still subject to service-level security measures.
*   **Brute-force Attacks:** This involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters for a password. Modern brute-force tools are highly optimized and can try thousands of passwords per second. The effectiveness depends on password complexity and the presence of rate limiting or account lockout.
*   **Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers use lists of commonly used passwords (dictionaries) to attempt logins. These attacks are faster than brute-force attacks if the target uses a weak or common password.
*   **Hybrid Attacks:** Combinations of brute-force and dictionary attacks, often incorporating common password variations, keyboard patterns, and personal information.
*   **Credential Stuffing:** If user credentials have been compromised in data breaches on other services, attackers may attempt to reuse these credentials to log in to Freedombox services.

##### 4.2.2 Impact on Freedombox

A successful brute-force or dictionary attack on service credentials can have significant consequences for a Freedombox system and its users:

*   **Unauthorized Service Access:** Attackers gain access to the targeted service (e.g., SSH, VPN, Web UI).
*   **System Access (SSH):**  Compromising SSH credentials grants attackers command-line access to the Freedombox server. This is the most critical impact, as it allows for:
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to all data stored on the Freedombox, including personal files, emails, contacts, and potentially sensitive application data.
    *   **System Manipulation:**  Installation of malware, backdoors, or rootkits. Modification of system configurations, potentially disrupting services or gaining persistent access.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Intentional disruption of services hosted on the Freedombox.
    *   **Pivoting:** Using the compromised Freedombox as a stepping stone to attack other devices on the local network or even other systems on the internet.
*   **VPN Access (VPN Services):** Compromising VPN credentials allows unauthorized users to connect to the VPN server, potentially gaining access to the local network behind the Freedombox and intercepting VPN traffic.
*   **Web Administration Interface Access:**  Access to the Freedombox web interface allows attackers to modify system settings, potentially creating new user accounts, disabling security features, or installing malicious software through web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Reputation Damage:** If a Freedombox is compromised and used for malicious activities, it can damage the user's reputation and potentially lead to legal repercussions.

##### 4.2.3 Evaluation of Mitigations in Freedombox Context

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the suggested mitigations in the context of Freedombox:

*   **Enforce strong passwords for services:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Highly effective if implemented correctly. Strong, unique passwords are the first line of defense against brute-force attacks.
    *   **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should strongly encourage or enforce strong password policies during initial setup and user creation for all services.  Clear guidance and tools (like password strength meters) within the web interface are crucial. Default passwords should be avoided entirely.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** User awareness and adherence to strong password practices are critical. Freedombox documentation and user interface should emphasize the importance of strong passwords.

*   **Account lockout policies for services:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Very effective in preventing brute-force attacks. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the account is temporarily locked, hindering automated attacks.
    *   **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should implement account lockout policies for all services, especially SSH and the web administration interface.  Configuration options for lockout thresholds and duration should be provided.
    *   **Potential Gaps:**  Account lockout can be bypassed if attackers use distributed attacks or rotate usernames.  Also, legitimate users might get locked out if they forget their passwords.  Clear error messages and account recovery mechanisms are needed.

*   **Rate limiting for services:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Effective in slowing down brute-force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts from a specific IP address within a given time frame.
    *   **Freedombox Implementation:** Rate limiting should be implemented at the service level (e.g., SSH, web server).  Tools like `fail2ban` are commonly used on Linux systems and could be integrated or recommended for Freedombox.
    *   **Potential Gaps:**  Rate limiting might be less effective against distributed brute-force attacks from botnets.  Careful configuration is needed to avoid blocking legitimate users behind NAT or shared IP addresses.

*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  IDS/IPS can detect and potentially block brute-force attacks by analyzing network traffic patterns and identifying suspicious login attempts.
    *   **Freedombox Implementation:**  Integrating or recommending an IDS/IPS like `fail2ban` (which can act as a basic IPS) or more advanced solutions like Suricata or Snort could enhance security.  However, IDS/IPS can be resource-intensive and require configuration.
    *   **Potential Gaps:**  IDS/IPS effectiveness depends on rule sets and configuration.  False positives and false negatives are possible.  Resource consumption on a potentially resource-constrained Freedombox needs to be considered.

*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for services:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective in mitigating brute-force attacks. Even if an attacker obtains the password, they still need the second factor (e.g., OTP from an authenticator app, hardware token).
    *   **Freedombox Implementation:**  Freedombox should strongly encourage and facilitate the use of 2FA for all services, especially SSH and the web administration interface.  Support for common 2FA methods like TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) is essential. Clear documentation and easy setup are crucial for user adoption.
    *   **Potential Gaps:**  User adoption is key.  2FA setup needs to be user-friendly.  Recovery mechanisms are needed if users lose their second factor device.  Some services might not easily support 2FA.

#### 4.3 Recommendations for Freedombox

Based on the analysis, here are actionable recommendations to strengthen Freedombox's defenses against brute-force and dictionary attacks on service credentials:

1.  **Default Security Hardening:**
    *   **Strong Password Enforcement:**  Implement mandatory strong password policies during initial setup and user creation for all services. Use password strength meters in the web interface.
    *   **Enable Account Lockout by Default:**  Enable account lockout policies for SSH and the web administration interface with reasonable thresholds (e.g., 5 failed attempts in 5 minutes, lockout for 15 minutes). Make these defaults configurable for advanced users.
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting by Default:**  Integrate `fail2ban` or similar rate limiting mechanisms and enable them by default for SSH and the web administration interface.  Pre-configure sensible rate limits.

2.  **Promote and Simplify 2FA:**
    *   **Prominent 2FA Promotion:**  Make 2FA a highly visible security recommendation in the Freedombox web interface and documentation.
    *   **Simplified 2FA Setup:**  Streamline the 2FA setup process for all services, especially SSH and the web interface. Provide clear, step-by-step guides with screenshots.  Consider QR code based setup for TOTP.
    *   **Default 2FA for Critical Services (Optional but Recommended):**  Consider making 2FA mandatory for remote SSH access and web administration interface access in future versions, while providing clear opt-out instructions for users who understand the risks.

3.  **Enhanced User Guidance and Documentation:**
    *   **Security Best Practices Guide:**  Create a comprehensive security best practices guide specifically for Freedombox users, prominently featuring the importance of strong passwords, 2FA, and understanding attack vectors.
    *   **Security Auditing Tools:**  Provide tools within the Freedombox web interface to help users audit their security settings and identify potential weaknesses (e.g., password strength checks, 2FA status for services).
    *   **Clear Error Messages and Recovery:**  Improve error messages during login failures to guide users without revealing too much information to attackers. Provide clear account recovery mechanisms for locked-out accounts and lost 2FA devices.

4.  **Consider Advanced Security Features (For Future Development):**
    *   **Geo-IP Blocking (Optional):**  For users who know they will only access their Freedombox from specific geographic locations, consider offering Geo-IP blocking capabilities to restrict access from other regions.
    *   **Honeypot Services (Advanced):**  Explore the possibility of integrating honeypot services to detect and log unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Freedombox to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including those related to brute-force attacks.
