### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Brute-force or Dictionary Attack on Admin Credentials

#### 4.1. Attack Vectors

The primary attack vector for this path is the **publicly accessible Freedombox web administration interface**.  By default, Freedombox exposes its web interface, typically accessible via a web browser, allowing users to manage the system. This interface is the target for credential-based authentication and thus, vulnerable to brute-force attacks if not adequately protected.

While theoretically, an attacker might attempt brute-forcing through other interfaces (e.g., SSH if exposed), the web interface is the most common and readily accessible entry point for administrative access.

#### 4.2. Vulnerabilities Exploited

This attack path exploits the following potential vulnerabilities:

* **Weak or Default Admin Credentials:**  If users choose weak passwords or fail to change default credentials (if any exist during initial setup - Freedombox aims for user-defined passwords during setup), the attack becomes significantly easier.
* **Insufficient Rate Limiting:** If Freedombox's login mechanism lacks robust rate limiting, attackers can make numerous login attempts in a short period, increasing the likelihood of success.
* **Lack of Account Lockout Policies:**  Without account lockout, attackers can continuously attempt logins without penalty, making brute-force attacks feasible over time.
* **Absence of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  If 2FA is not enabled, the password becomes the single point of failure. Compromising the password grants immediate access, regardless of other mitigations.

#### 4.3. Steps of the Attack

An attacker would typically follow these steps to execute a brute-force or dictionary attack:

1. **Target Identification:** Identify a Freedombox instance exposed to the internet. This can be done through various methods, including:
    * **Shodan/Censys scans:** Searching for devices with Freedombox's characteristic web interface or open ports.
    * **Manual reconnaissance:** Targeting known Freedombox users or domains.
    * **Exploiting information leaks:**  Finding publicly available information about Freedombox deployments.

2. **Access Login Page:** Navigate to the Freedombox administrative login page, typically located at `/plinth/` or a similar path on the Freedombox's IP address or domain.

3. **Credential Guessing Attack:** Employ automated tools specifically designed for brute-force and dictionary attacks, such as:
    * **Hydra:** A popular parallelized login cracker.
    * **Medusa:** Another modular, parallel, brute-force login cracker.
    * **Ncrack:**  Network authentication cracking tool.
    * **Custom scripts:**  Scripts written in languages like Python or Bash using libraries for HTTP requests and password lists.

    These tools will systematically send login requests to the Freedombox server, attempting various username and password combinations.
    * **Dictionary Attack:** Uses pre-compiled lists of common passwords, leaked password databases, and variations of common words.
    * **Brute-force Attack:** Attempts all possible combinations of characters within a defined length and character set.

4. **Mitigation Evasion Attempts:**  If Freedombox implements mitigations like rate limiting or account lockout, attackers might attempt to bypass them:
    * **Distributed Attacks:** Using botnets or multiple compromised machines to distribute login attempts and bypass IP-based rate limiting.
    * **Slow and Low Attacks:**  Pacing login attempts slowly to stay below rate limiting thresholds and avoid triggering detection.
    * **CAPTCHA Bypasses (if implemented):**  Using CAPTCHA solving services or techniques to bypass CAPTCHA challenges.
    * **Timing Attacks (less likely for brute-force, but possible):** Exploiting subtle timing differences in server responses to infer valid credentials (more relevant for targeted attacks, less so for broad brute-force).

5. **Successful Login and Privilege Escalation:** If valid credentials are guessed, the attacker gains administrative access to the Freedombox system. This grants them full control and the ability to perform any administrative action.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact

Successful brute-force attack on admin credentials leads to **High Impact**, granting the attacker **Full administrative access to Freedombox**. This has severe consequences:

* **Complete System Control:** The attacker gains root-level access, allowing them to control all aspects of the Freedombox operating system, services, and configurations.
* **Data Breach and Confidentiality Loss:** Access to all data stored on the Freedombox, including personal files, emails, contacts, documents, and any other sensitive information. This leads to a complete breach of user privacy and confidentiality.
* **Service Disruption and Availability Loss:**  The attacker can disrupt or disable any service running on Freedombox, causing downtime and loss of functionality for the user and potentially connected users. This includes critical services like VPN, file sharing, web servers, etc.
* **Malware Installation and System Compromise:** The attacker can install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software on the Freedombox. This can be used for various purposes, including:
    * **Persistent access:** Maintaining access even after password changes.
    * **Botnet participation:** Using the Freedombox as part of a botnet for DDoS attacks or other malicious activities.
    * **Pivoting to other networks:** Using the compromised Freedombox as a gateway to attack other devices on the local network or connected networks.
* **Reputation Damage and Trust Erosion:** For Freedombox as a project, successful attacks can damage its reputation and erode user trust in its security.

#### 4.5. Evaluation of Existing Mitigations

The provided mitigations are generally sound security practices. Let's evaluate them specifically for Freedombox:

* **Enforce strong passwords:**
    * **Effectiveness:** Highly effective in increasing the complexity and time required for brute-force attacks. Strong passwords significantly reduce the likelihood of dictionary attacks.
    * **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should enforce strong password policies during initial setup and password changes. This includes minimum length, character complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and potentially password strength meters.
    * **Evaluation:** **Crucial and fundamental mitigation.**  Freedombox should have robust password policies enforced by default. User education on password security is also essential.

* **Account lockout policies:**
    * **Effectiveness:** Very effective in preventing brute-force attacks by temporarily disabling accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    * **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should implement account lockout policies for the admin login. This requires defining:
        * **Maximum failed attempts:**  The threshold for triggering lockout.
        * **Lockout duration:**  The period for which the account is locked.
        * **Reset mechanism:** How to unlock the account (e.g., after a timeout, admin intervention).
    * **Evaluation:** **Highly recommended and effective.**  Account lockout should be enabled by default in Freedombox with reasonable parameters.

* **Rate limiting:**
    * **Effectiveness:** Slows down brute-force attacks significantly, making them less efficient and potentially time-consuming enough to be impractical.
    * **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should implement rate limiting on login attempts. This can be done at various levels:
        * **IP-based rate limiting:** Limiting login attempts from a specific IP address within a time window.
        * **Session-based rate limiting:** Limiting attempts per user session.
        * **User-based rate limiting:** Limiting attempts per username.
    * **Evaluation:** **Effective in mitigating brute-force attacks.** Rate limiting should be implemented in Freedombox, ideally combining multiple approaches for better protection. Care must be taken to avoid overly aggressive rate limiting that could affect legitimate users.

* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    * **Effectiveness:** Can detect and potentially block brute-force attempts based on patterns and signatures.
    * **Freedombox Implementation:** Integrating an IDS/IPS into Freedombox can provide an additional layer of security.  However, this might add complexity for users to configure and manage.  Simpler, built-in detection mechanisms might be more practical for Freedombox's target audience.
    * **Evaluation:** **Adds an extra layer of security but might be complex for typical users.**  Consider simpler, integrated detection mechanisms within Freedombox as a first step, rather than relying solely on external IDS/IPS. Logging failed login attempts is a crucial component of detection.

* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    * **Effectiveness:** **The most effective mitigation.** 2FA significantly reduces the risk of brute-force attacks, even if passwords are weak or compromised.  It requires the attacker to possess a second factor (e.g., a code from a mobile app) in addition to the password.
    * **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should strongly encourage and facilitate the use of 2FA for admin login. This should include:
        * **Easy setup process:**  Simple and user-friendly 2FA setup.
        * **Support for standard 2FA methods:**  TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) via apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
        * **Clear documentation and guidance:**  Instructions on how to enable and use 2FA.
    * **Evaluation:** **Highly recommended and crucial for robust security.** 2FA should be prominently promoted and easy to enable in Freedombox.

#### 4.6. Potential Bypasses of Mitigations

While the listed mitigations are effective, potential bypasses exist:

* **Weak Passwords:**  If users choose weak passwords despite policies, brute-force attacks remain a viable threat, even with other mitigations in place.
* **Rate Limiting Bypasses:**
    * **Distributed Attacks:**  Attacks originating from numerous IP addresses can circumvent simple IP-based rate limiting.
    * **Slow and Low Attacks:**  Carefully paced attacks can stay below rate limiting thresholds.
* **Account Lockout Bypasses:**
    * **Short Lockout Duration:** If the lockout period is too short, attackers can simply wait and retry.
    * **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Lockout:**  An attacker could intentionally trigger account lockout for legitimate users, causing disruption.
* **IDS/IPS Evasion:** Sophisticated attackers might use techniques to evade detection by IDS/IPS, such as slow and low attacks or obfuscated attack patterns.
* **Social Engineering:**  While not directly bypassing technical mitigations, social engineering attacks could trick users into revealing their credentials, rendering brute-force mitigations irrelevant.
* **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting unknown vulnerabilities in the login mechanism itself could bypass all intended mitigations.

#### 4.7. Recommendations for Improvement

To further strengthen Freedombox's defenses against brute-force attacks on admin credentials, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Default Strong Password Policy:**
    * **Enforce strong password requirements** during initial setup and password changes.
    * **Implement password complexity checks** (minimum length, character types).
    * **Integrate a password strength meter** to provide real-time feedback to users.
    * **Consider disallowing common or weak passwords** (using lists of known weak passwords).

2. **Mandatory Account Lockout (Default Enabled):**
    * **Enable account lockout by default** with reasonable parameters (e.g., 5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout).
    * **Make lockout parameters configurable** for advanced users, but strongly recommend keeping it enabled.
    * **Implement clear messaging** to users when their account is locked out and how to unlock it (e.g., wait time, admin intervention).

3. **Robust and Adaptive Rate Limiting:**
    * **Implement multi-layered rate limiting:** Combine IP-based, session-based, and user-based rate limiting.
    * **Consider adaptive rate limiting:** Dynamically adjust rate limits based on detected attack patterns.
    * **Implement CAPTCHA or similar challenges** after a certain number of failed attempts as an additional layer of protection (use with caution to avoid usability issues).

4. **Prominent and Easy 2FA Implementation:**
    * **Make 2FA setup prominent and strongly recommend enabling it** during initial setup and in security settings.
    * **Provide a user-friendly 2FA setup process.**
    * **Support standard TOTP-based 2FA.**
    * **Offer clear and accessible documentation and tutorials on 2FA.**
