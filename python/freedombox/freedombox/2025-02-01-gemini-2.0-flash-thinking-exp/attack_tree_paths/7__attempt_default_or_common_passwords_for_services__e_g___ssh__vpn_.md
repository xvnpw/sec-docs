### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Attempt Default or Common Passwords for Services (e.g., SSH, VPN)

#### 4.1. Attack Description and Mechanism

This attack path exploits the common vulnerability of services configured with default or easily guessable passwords. Attackers leverage this weakness to gain unauthorized access. The mechanism typically involves:

1. **Service Discovery:** Attackers first identify services running on a Freedombox instance. This can be done through port scanning (e.g., scanning for open ports like 22 for SSH, VPN ports, web ports) or by analyzing publicly available information about the target.
2. **Credential Guessing:** Once services are identified, attackers attempt to authenticate using default or common usernames and passwords. This can be done through:
    * **Default Credential Lists:** Attackers use lists of default usernames and passwords commonly associated with specific services and software.
    * **Common Password Lists:**  Attackers utilize lists of frequently used passwords (e.g., "password", "123456", "admin").
    * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Automated tools are used to systematically try a large number of password combinations against the service's login interface.
    * **Dictionary Attacks:**  Attackers use dictionaries of words and common phrases, often combined with variations and numbers, to guess passwords.

#### 4.2. Target Services in Freedombox Context

Freedombox, designed to be a personal server, typically hosts several services that are potential targets for this attack:

* **SSH (Secure Shell):**  Used for remote administration and secure access to the command line. Default SSH configurations might be vulnerable if passwords are weak or unchanged.
* **VPN Services (OpenVPN, WireGuard):**  Allow secure remote access to the Freedombox network. Default configurations or weak user-chosen passwords for VPN accounts are prime targets.
* **Web Administration Interface (Freedombox UI):**  While the attack tree path focuses on *services*, the web interface itself is a service and could be targeted if default credentials were ever present or if users choose weak passwords for the admin account. (Although this attack tree path is distinct from "Attempt Default Admin Interface Credentials", there's overlap in the concept of weak passwords).
* **Web Services (e.g., Nextcloud, other hosted applications):** If users install and configure web applications on Freedombox, these services might also be vulnerable if default or weak passwords are used for their accounts.
* **Database Services (if exposed):**  If database services like PostgreSQL or MariaDB are exposed (less common in typical Freedombox setups but possible), they could be targeted with default credentials.

**Freedombox Specific Considerations:**

* **Initial Setup Process:** The initial Freedombox setup process is crucial. If the process doesn't strongly encourage or enforce changing default passwords for services (if any exist initially), users might leave systems vulnerable.
* **User Awareness:**  Freedombox targets users who may not be cybersecurity experts.  Lack of security awareness can lead to users neglecting to change default passwords or choosing weak passwords.
* **Ease of Use vs. Security:** Balancing ease of use with strong security is a challenge.  Making password changes and strong password enforcement too complex might deter users, but lax security can lead to vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3. Likelihood and Impact in Freedombox

* **Likelihood:**  Rated as **Low to Medium**.
    * **Low:** If Freedombox's default setup strongly encourages or enforces strong passwords and changing defaults, and if users are generally security-conscious.
    * **Medium:** If the default setup is less stringent, and if users are less security-aware and might overlook password security.  The likelihood increases if Freedombox documentation or tutorials don't sufficiently emphasize password security.
* **Impact:** Rated as **Medium to High**.
    * **Medium:**  Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to specific services like SSH or VPN. This allows attackers to potentially monitor network traffic, access files shared through VPN, or gain limited control over the Freedombox.
    * **High:**  If attackers gain SSH access, they can potentially escalate privileges, gain root access to the entire Freedombox system, install malware, access sensitive data, and completely compromise the user's personal server and potentially their network.  Compromised VPN access could be used to launch attacks against other devices on the user's network.

#### 4.4. Evaluation of Proposed Mitigations

* **Mitigation 1: Change default service credentials:**
    * **Effectiveness:** **High**.  This is the most fundamental and crucial mitigation. If services are shipped with default credentials, changing them immediately during setup eliminates a major vulnerability.
    * **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should **absolutely ensure** that no services are shipped with default, well-known credentials. The initial setup process should *force* users to set strong, unique passwords for all relevant services.
    * **Usability:**  Requires a well-designed setup process that guides users through password changes without being overly complex.

* **Mitigation 2: Enforce strong passwords for services:**
    * **Effectiveness:** **High**.  Strong passwords significantly increase the difficulty of brute-force and dictionary attacks.
    * **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should implement password complexity requirements (minimum length, character types) for all service accounts.  A password strength meter during password creation can provide real-time feedback to users.
    * **Usability:**  Password complexity requirements can sometimes be frustrating for users.  Clear guidance on creating strong passwords and user-friendly password strength indicators are essential.

* **Mitigation 3: Key-based authentication (for SSH):**
    * **Effectiveness:** **Very High**. Key-based authentication for SSH is significantly more secure than password-based authentication. It eliminates the vulnerability to password guessing attacks.
    * **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should **strongly encourage** and **facilitate** key-based authentication for SSH. The setup process should guide users on how to generate and install SSH keys. Password-based SSH authentication should ideally be disabled by default or strongly discouraged.
    * **Usability:**  Key-based authentication can be slightly more complex for less technical users to set up initially.  Clear documentation, user-friendly tools for key generation and management within the Freedombox UI, and good tutorials are crucial.

* **Mitigation 4: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for services:**
    * **Effectiveness:** **High**. 2FA adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords. Even if a password is compromised, attackers still need the second factor (e.g., a code from a mobile app).
    * **Freedombox Implementation:** Freedombox should **enable 2FA** for as many services as possible, especially for critical services like the web administration interface and VPN.  Support for standard 2FA methods like TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) apps is essential.
    * **Usability:**  2FA adds a step to the login process, which can be slightly less convenient.  Clear instructions on setting up and using 2FA, and support for user-friendly 2FA apps are important.

#### 4.5. Additional Mitigations and Recommendations for Freedombox Development Team

Beyond the listed mitigations, consider these additional measures:

* **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies for services after a certain number of failed login attempts. This can slow down brute-force attacks.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on login attempts for services to further hinder brute-force attacks.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Consider integrating or recommending IDS/IPS solutions that can detect and potentially block suspicious login attempts or brute-force attacks.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on password security and service configurations, to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
* **Security Awareness Education:**  Provide clear and accessible security awareness information to Freedombox users, emphasizing the importance of strong passwords, changing defaults, and enabling 2FA. Integrate security tips and best practices into the Freedombox UI and documentation.
* **Default Secure Configurations:**  Ensure that all services in Freedombox are configured with secure defaults out-of-the-box. This includes disabling password-based SSH authentication by default and encouraging key-based authentication.
* **Regular Security Updates:**  Maintain Freedombox and its underlying services with regular security updates to patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited through password-based attacks or other means.
* **Password Management Tools Integration (Optional):** Explore the possibility of integrating with password management tools or providing guidance on using them to generate and store strong passwords for Freedombox services.

**Recommendations for Freedombox Development Team (Actionable):**

1. **Mandatory Password Changes:**  Ensure the Freedombox setup process *forces* users to change any default passwords (if any exist, ideally none should).
2. **Strong Password Enforcement:** Implement and enforce strong password complexity requirements for all service accounts. Include a password strength meter in the UI.
3. **Prioritize Key-Based SSH:**  Make key-based SSH authentication the default and strongly recommend it during setup.  Consider disabling password-based SSH authentication by default.
4. **Implement 2FA Widely:**  Enable 2FA for the Freedombox web interface and all other critical services where feasible. Provide clear instructions and support for setting up 2FA.
5. **Account Lockout and Rate Limiting:** Implement account lockout and rate limiting mechanisms for login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks.
6. **Security Awareness Integration:**  Incorporate security tips and best practices directly into the Freedombox UI and documentation, specifically addressing password security and the risks of default credentials.
7. **Regular Security Audits:**  Schedule regular security audits and penetration testing to continuously assess and improve Freedombox's security posture.

By implementing these mitigations and recommendations, the Freedombox project can significantly reduce the risk associated with the "Attempt Default or Common Passwords for Services" attack path and enhance the overall security and trustworthiness of the platform.
