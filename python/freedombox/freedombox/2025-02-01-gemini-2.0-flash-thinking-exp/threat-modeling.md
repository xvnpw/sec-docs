*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory:** Enable automatic security updates for Freedombox and its underlying operating system.
    *   **Mandatory:** Regularly check for and apply Freedombox updates manually if automatic updates are not consistently enabled or for major version upgrades.
    *   **Recommended:** Implement vulnerability scanning tools to proactively identify outdated software components and prioritize updates.

## Threat: [Freedombox Misconfiguration - Permissive Firewall Rules Leading to Service Exposure](./threats/freedombox_misconfiguration_-_permissive_firewall_rules_leading_to_service_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  A critical misconfiguration of the Freedombox firewall (e.g., `iptables`, `nftables`, or Freedombox's interface) opens up unnecessary ports or services to the public internet or untrusted networks. Attackers can then directly target these exposed services, bypassing intended network security boundaries.
*   **Impact:** Direct exposure of Freedombox services to attack, potentially leading to unauthorized access, service compromise, data breaches, and denial of service attacks targeting the exposed services.
*   **Freedombox Component Affected:** Freedombox Firewall (configuration and rulesets).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory:**  Implement a strict default-deny firewall policy. Only explicitly allow necessary inbound and outbound traffic.
    *   **Mandatory:** Regularly review and audit Freedombox firewall rules to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and only allow essential traffic.
    *   **Recommended:** Use Freedombox's firewall management interface with caution and fully understand the implications of each rule change.
    *   **Recommended:** Consider using network segmentation to further isolate Freedombox and limit the impact of firewall misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Freedombox Misconfiguration - Weak Service Configurations Enabling Unauthorized Access](./threats/freedombox_misconfiguration_-_weak_service_configurations_enabling_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical services within Freedombox are misconfigured with weak security settings (e.g., default or weak passwords, disabled authentication mechanisms, insecure protocol choices). Attackers can exploit these weak configurations to gain unauthorized access to services and potentially escalate privileges within Freedombox.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to critical Freedombox services, potential compromise of service data, privilege escalation to administrative levels within Freedombox, and potential for complete system takeover.
*   **Freedombox Component Affected:** Configuration files and settings of critical Freedombox services (e.g., Plinth, VPN, web server, database).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory:** Follow security hardening guides and best practices specifically for each Freedombox service being used.
    *   **Mandatory:** Enforce the use of strong, unique passwords for all service accounts and administrative interfaces. Utilize password managers to manage complex passwords.
    *   **Mandatory:** Enable and properly configure robust authentication mechanisms for all services. Disable or remove default accounts where possible.
    *   **Recommended:** Regularly review service configurations for security weaknesses and perform security audits to identify potential misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Insecure Freedombox API Usage (Plinth API) Leading to Privilege Escalation or Data Breach](./threats/insecure_freedombox_api_usage__plinth_api__leading_to_privilege_escalation_or_data_breach.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Freedombox Plinth API (if used by the application) are exploited, or the API itself has inherent security flaws (e.g., insecure authentication, authorization bypasses, API injection vulnerabilities). Attackers can leverage these API weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to Freedombox functionalities, manipulate data, or escalate privileges.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized administrative access to Freedombox, manipulation of Freedombox configurations and data, potential privilege escalation to root level, and compromise of application data or functionality if it relies on the API for critical operations.
*   **Freedombox Component Affected:** Freedombox Plinth API (specifically vulnerable API endpoints).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory:** If using the Plinth API, thoroughly review its security documentation and understand potential security implications.
    *   **Mandatory:** Keep the Freedombox Plinth API updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Recommended:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API access. Restrict API access to only authorized components and users using the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Recommended:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Plinth API and application's API integration to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Freedombox Services - Publicly Accessible or Weakly Protected Storage](./threats/data_leakage_through_freedombox_services_-_publicly_accessible_or_weakly_protected_storage.md)

*   **Description:**  Application data stored within Freedombox services (e.g., shared folders, databases) is made publicly accessible due to misconfiguration or weak access controls. Alternatively, default or weak credentials for accessing these storage services are used. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to directly access and exfiltrate sensitive application data.
*   **Impact:**  Critical confidentiality breach, unauthorized access to sensitive application data, potential data theft, misuse, or public disclosure of confidential information.
*   **Freedombox Component Affected:** Freedombox storage services (e.g., file sharing, database services) and their access control mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory:** Implement strong, role-based access controls on all Freedombox services used for data storage. Ensure only authorized users and applications can access sensitive data.
    *   **Mandatory:** Never use default credentials for any Freedombox services. Enforce strong, unique passwords for all storage service accounts.
    *   **Recommended:** Use encryption for sensitive data at rest within Freedombox storage services to add an extra layer of protection.
    *   **Recommended:** Regularly review and audit access controls to ensure they are correctly configured and effectively enforced.
