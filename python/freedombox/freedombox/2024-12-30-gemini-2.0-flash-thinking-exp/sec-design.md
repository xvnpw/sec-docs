## Project Design Document: FreedomBox (Improved)

**1. Introduction**

This document provides a detailed architectural design of the FreedomBox project. It aims to clearly outline the system's components, their interactions, and the overall architecture. This document will serve as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities, enabling a comprehensive understanding of potential security vulnerabilities. This revision expands on the initial design to provide greater detail and clarity for security analysis.

**2. Project Goals and Scope**

* **Goal:** To provide a user-friendly, self-hosted server platform that empowers individuals to control their digital lives and data.
* **Scope:** This document covers the core software components of a typical FreedomBox installation, including the operating system, key services, and the web interface. It focuses on the logical architecture, key data flows, and security-relevant interactions. While it mentions examples of applications, the primary focus remains on the foundational elements of FreedomBox. Specific application configurations and vulnerabilities are outside the scope of this document unless they directly impact core FreedomBox functionality.

**3. System Overview**

FreedomBox is built upon a Debian-based operating system and provides a web-based interface (Plinth) for managing various server applications and services. It aims to be a single point of control for a user's personal server needs, simplifying the management of self-hosted services.

A typical FreedomBox deployment involves installing the software on a dedicated single-board computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi), a virtual machine, or a physical server within a home or small office network. It is generally expected to be behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) router and connected to the internet. Users typically access it through their local network or remotely via VPN or port forwarding (with associated security risks).

**7. Security Considerations (Detailed)**

This section expands on the initial security considerations, providing more specific examples of potential threats and vulnerabilities.

* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Threats:** Brute-force attacks on login forms, weak password usage, session hijacking, privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Plinth or individual services.
    * **Mitigations:** Strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, secure session management (e.g., HTTPOnly and Secure flags), principle of least privilege.

* **Network Security:**
    * **Threats:** Unauthorized access from the internet or local network, port scanning, denial-of-service attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Mitigations:** Properly configured firewall rules (least privilege principle for ports), intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), using secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH), disabling unnecessary services.

* **Data Security:**
    * **Threats:** Data breaches due to unauthorized access, data corruption, insecure storage of sensitive information (e.g., passwords, private keys).
    * **Mitigations:** Data at rest encryption, access control lists (ACLs), regular backups, secure deletion of sensitive data.

* **Software Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Threats:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the operating system, core services, and Plinth, leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    * **Mitigations:** Regular software updates and patching, vulnerability scanning, using security auditing tools.

* **Supply Chain Security:**
    * **Threats:** Compromised software packages or dependencies containing malware.
    * **Mitigations:** Verifying package signatures, using trusted repositories, monitoring for suspicious package updates.

* **Physical Security:**
    * **Threats:** Unauthorized physical access to the device, leading to data theft or tampering.
    * **Mitigations:** Secure physical location of the device, BIOS/UEFI passwords, full disk encryption.

* **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Threats:** Attacks aimed at making the FreedomBox unavailable by overwhelming its resources.
    * **Mitigations:** Rate limiting, traffic filtering, resource monitoring, using a reverse proxy with DoS protection.

* **Privacy:**
    * **Threats:** Unintentional or malicious disclosure of user data, lack of transparency in data handling.
    * **Mitigations:** Implementing privacy-preserving configurations, providing clear privacy policies, minimizing data collection.

**8. Assumptions and Constraints**

* It is assumed that the user has a basic understanding of networking concepts.
* The FreedomBox is assumed to be connected to a reliable internet connection.
* The user is responsible for configuring strong passwords and keeping the system updated.
* This design document focuses on a standard FreedomBox installation and may not cover all possible configurations or third-party applications.
* The security of the underlying hardware is assumed.

**9. Future Considerations**

* **Improved Containerization:**  Further leveraging containerization technologies for service isolation and simplified deployment and management of applications.
* **Enhanced Monitoring and Logging:** Implementing a centralized logging system and robust monitoring tools for proactive security monitoring and incident response.
* **Automated Security Hardening:** Developing automated scripts or tools to apply security best practices and configurations.
* **Integration with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Exploring the use of HSMs for enhanced security of cryptographic keys and sensitive data.
