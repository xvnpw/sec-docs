# Attack Surface Analysis for freedombox/freedombox

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in FreedomBox Web UI (Authentication and Authorization)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_freedombox_web_ui__authentication_and_authorization_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in how FreedomBox authenticates and authorizes users accessing its web interface. This could allow unauthorized access to manage the FreedomBox system and potentially the integrated application.
    *   **How FreedomBox Contributes:** FreedomBox provides the central web interface for managing the system, including user accounts and potentially application configurations. Vulnerabilities here directly expose the entire FreedomBox environment.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the login form to bypass authentication or uses a brute-force attack due to weak password policies enforced by FreedomBox.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the FreedomBox system, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of the integrated application and its data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure the FreedomBox instance is running the latest stable version with all security patches applied. Avoid making modifications to the core authentication mechanisms unless absolutely necessary and with thorough security review.
        *   **Users:** Enforce strong password policies for FreedomBox user accounts. Enable multi-factor authentication if available within FreedomBox. Regularly review user accounts and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in FreedomBox Web UI (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_freedombox_web_ui__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  The FreedomBox web interface, used for management, may be vulnerable to XSS, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users accessing the interface.
    *   **How FreedomBox Contributes:** FreedomBox's web UI handles user input for various configuration settings and displays system information. If this input is not properly sanitized or output is not correctly encoded, XSS vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious script into a FreedomBox configuration field. When an administrator views this field, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf, possibly impacting the integrated application's configuration or access.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover of FreedomBox administrators, potentially leading to manipulation of the integrated application or exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure the FreedomBox instance is up-to-date. If developing extensions or custom modules for FreedomBox, strictly adhere to secure coding practices, including proper input sanitization and output encoding to prevent XSS.
        *   **Users:** Keep web browsers updated. Be cautious about clicking on links within the FreedomBox interface from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in FreedomBox Backend Daemons and Services](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_freedombox_backend_daemons_and_services.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in the core daemons and background services that power FreedomBox functionality.
    *   **How FreedomBox Contributes:** FreedomBox relies on various daemons for managing system processes, networking, and other core functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these daemons can provide attackers with direct access to the underlying operating system and potentially the integrated application.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a FreedomBox daemon allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that daemon, potentially gaining root access and compromising the entire system, including the integrated application.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service for both FreedomBox and the integrated application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Ensure the FreedomBox instance is running the latest stable version with all security patches applied. Monitor FreedomBox security advisories and apply updates promptly. Avoid modifying core FreedomBox daemons unless absolutely necessary and with extensive security testing.
        *   **Users:**  Regularly update the FreedomBox system. Subscribe to security mailing lists or notifications for FreedomBox to stay informed about vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in FreedomBox Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_freedombox_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in how FreedomBox receives and installs updates.
    *   **How FreedomBox Contributes:** FreedomBox's update mechanism is crucial for patching vulnerabilities. If this mechanism is compromised, attackers could inject malicious updates.
    *   **Example:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack during an update, injecting malicious code into the update package. This code could then compromise the FreedomBox system and the integrated application.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise through malicious updates, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, and loss of control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure the FreedomBox update process uses secure protocols (HTTPS) and verifies the integrity of updates using cryptographic signatures.
        *   **Users:** Ensure the FreedomBox system is configured to automatically install security updates. Verify the authenticity of the update source if manual updates are performed.
