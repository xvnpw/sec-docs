## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Core FreedomBox Services (e.g., Plinth)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_core_freedombox_services__e_g___plinth_.md)

*   Attackers target the core services of FreedomBox, particularly Plinth (the web interface). These services are essential for managing the system, and vulnerabilities here can grant significant control.
*   This path is high-risk because core services are often complex and can contain undiscovered flaws. Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities__e_g___cves_.md)

*   This path focuses on leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities in FreedomBox or its components.
*   It's high-risk because readily available exploits and information make these attacks easier to execute, especially if systems are not promptly patched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Applications Managed by FreedomBox](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_installed_applications_managed_by_freedombox.md)

*   FreedomBox manages various applications. Vulnerabilities in these applications can be exploited to gain access to the application data or the FreedomBox system itself.
*   This is high-risk because the security of these managed applications depends on their own development and update cycles, which might not be tightly controlled by the FreedomBox administrator.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FreedomBox System Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_freedombox_system_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   This path targets misconfigurations in the FreedomBox system itself, such as weak credentials or insecure firewall rules.
*   It's high-risk because these weaknesses are often the result of simple oversights and can be easily exploited by attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   Attackers attempt to gain access using default or easily guessable passwords for FreedomBox accounts or services.
*   This is a particularly high-risk path due to its simplicity and the significant access it can grant upon success.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in FreedomBox's Web Interface (Plinth)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_freedombox's_web_interface__plinth_.md)

*   This path targets vulnerabilities in the Plinth web interface, such as input validation flaws or authentication bypasses.
*   It's high-risk because the web interface is often exposed to the network and can be a direct target for attackers.
