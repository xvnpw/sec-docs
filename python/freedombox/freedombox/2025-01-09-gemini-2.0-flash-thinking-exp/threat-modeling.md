# Threat Model Analysis for freedombox/freedombox

## Threat: [Compromised FreedomBox Administrator Credentials](./threats/compromised_freedombox_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the FreedomBox administrator account. This could be through brute-forcing a weak password, phishing the administrator, exploiting a vulnerability in the FreedomBox login process, or gaining access through a compromised device with stored credentials. Once in, the attacker has full control over the FreedomBox instance.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can modify FreedomBox configurations, potentially exposing the application or its data. They can access data stored on the FreedomBox that the application relies on. They might be able to install malicious software on the FreedomBox, potentially impacting the application's functionality or security. They could also disrupt the services FreedomBox provides to the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** FreedomBox Web Interface (authentication module), potentially SSH service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User/Admin:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all FreedomBox accounts.
        *   **User/Admin:** Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the administrator account.
        *   **User/Admin:** Regularly review and audit user accounts and permissions on the FreedomBox.
        *   **User/Admin:** Restrict access to the FreedomBox web interface and SSH to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        *   **User/Admin:** Monitor login attempts and implement account lockout policies for repeated failed attempts.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in FreedomBox Core Components](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_freedombox_core_components.md)

*   **Description:** The core FreedomBox software itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws, logic errors). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the FreedomBox system, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the FreedomBox, allowing the attacker to access or manipulate application data, disrupt application services, or use the FreedomBox as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various core FreedomBox modules and libraries (e.g., Plinth, systemd services, core Python libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User/Admin:** Enable automatic security updates for FreedomBox to ensure timely patching of vulnerabilities.
        *   **User/Admin:** Subscribe to FreedomBox security mailing lists or follow their security advisories to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developer:** When integrating, be aware of the FreedomBox version and any known vulnerabilities in that version.
        *   **Developer:** If contributing to FreedomBox, follow secure coding practices and conduct thorough security testing.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Integrated FreedomBox Applications](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_integrated_freedombox_applications.md)

*   **Description:** FreedomBox integrates various third-party applications (e.g., Nextcloud, Tor). These applications might have their own security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the specific application and potentially gain access to the FreedomBox or the application relying on it.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the compromised application. It could range from data breaches within that specific application to gaining control over the FreedomBox if the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation. This could also indirectly impact the application if it relies on data or services from the compromised integrated application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific integrated applications within FreedomBox (e.g., Nextcloud, Tor, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and the integrated application).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User/Admin:** Keep all integrated FreedomBox applications updated to the latest versions.
        *   **User/Admin:** Review the security configurations of each integrated application and harden them according to best practices.
        *   **User/Admin:** Be aware of the attack surface introduced by each integrated application and disable or uninstall those not strictly necessary.
        *   **Developer:** Understand the security implications of relying on specific integrated applications and their potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromised FreedomBox Update Mechanism](./threats/compromised_freedombox_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the FreedomBox's update mechanism. This could involve intercepting update requests and serving malicious updates, or compromising the infrastructure from which FreedomBox downloads updates.
    *   **Impact:**  A successful attack could lead to the installation of backdoors, malware, or other malicious software on the FreedomBox, granting the attacker persistent access and control. This would have a severe impact on the application and all data managed by the FreedomBox.
    *   **Affected Component:** FreedomBox's update manager (likely using `apt` or similar package management tools).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **FreedomBox Project:** Implement robust security measures for the update infrastructure, including signing updates and using secure communication channels.
        *   **User/Admin:** Verify the authenticity of updates if possible (though this is often difficult for end-users).
        *   **User/Admin:** Monitor system activity after updates for any signs of compromise.

## Threat: [FreedomBox Firewall Misconfiguration](./threats/freedombox_firewall_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** The FreedomBox's firewall (likely `iptables` or `nftables`) might be misconfigured, either by the user or due to a software bug. This could expose ports and services to the internet or local network that should be protected, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:**  A misconfigured firewall could directly expose the application to attacks from the internet or local network. Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the exposed services or gain unauthorized access to the FreedomBox itself.
    *   **Affected Component:** FreedomBox Firewall (iptables/nftables configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User/Admin:** Carefully review and configure the FreedomBox firewall rules, ensuring only necessary ports are open.
        *   **User/Admin:** Use tools to scan the FreedomBox for open ports and verify the firewall configuration.
        *   **FreedomBox Project:** Provide clear and secure default firewall configurations and guidance for users.

## Threat: [Data Breach via Compromised FreedomBox Services](./threats/data_breach_via_compromised_freedombox_services.md)

*   **Description:** If the application stores data on services managed by FreedomBox (e.g., Nextcloud files, a database), a compromise of those services could lead to a data breach. This could happen due to vulnerabilities in the service itself or due to compromised FreedomBox credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Sensitive application data could be exposed, leading to privacy violations, financial loss, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data storage services managed by FreedomBox (e.g., Nextcloud data directories, database servers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User/Admin:** Ensure data at rest is encrypted on the FreedomBox.
        *   **User/Admin:** Regularly back up application data stored on the FreedomBox to a secure, off-site location.
        *   **Developer:** Implement application-level encryption for sensitive data before storing it on FreedomBox services.
        *   **Developer:** Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored on the FreedomBox if possible.
