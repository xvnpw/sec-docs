## Combined Vulnerability List for Django Extensions

This list combines all identified vulnerabilities from the provided reports for Django Extensions.

### Vulnerability 1: Remote Code Execution via `runscript` command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Remote Code Execution via `runscript` command
*   **Description:**
    The `runscript` management command in Django Extensions allows executing arbitrary Python scripts within the Django project's context. If an attacker can somehow control the `script` argument passed to this command, they can execute arbitrary code on the server. This is because the command dynamically imports and executes a `run()` function from the specified script.

    To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to:
    1. Identify a way to execute Django management commands, specifically `runscript`, from an external interface. This is generally not directly exposed in typical web applications.
    2. Craft or place a malicious Python script within the Django project's accessible script directories (e.g., within an app's `scripts` or `fixtures` directory, or a location where direct import is possible).
    3. Execute the `runscript` command, providing the name of the malicious script as the argument.

*   **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary Python code execution on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including:
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   Modification or deletion of data.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Full control over the application and underlying system.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    None within the `django-extensions` project itself. Django management commands are intended for administrative tasks and are generally not designed to be exposed to untrusted external users. The security relies on the assumption that access to management commands is restricted to authorized personnel.

*   **Missing mitigations:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The `runscript` command lacks any input validation or sanitization of the `script` argument. It directly uses the provided string to locate and import a Python module.
    *   **Access Control:** In a real-world scenario where management commands might be inadvertently exposed, there should be strict access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from executing commands like `runscript`.
    *   **Sandboxing or Code Review:** For highly sensitive environments, consider sandboxing the execution environment for `runscript` or implementing rigorous code review for any scripts executed via this command.

*   **Preconditions:**
    1. Django Extensions must be installed in the Django project.
    2. The `runscript` management command must be accessible or exposed in some way to an external attacker. This is highly unlikely in standard deployments, but could occur through misconfiguration of admin panels or other custom interfaces that allow command execution.
    3. The attacker needs to be able to either place a malicious script within the project's script lookup paths or identify and exploit a way to directly import a malicious module using the `script` argument.

*   **Source code analysis:**
    ```python
    File: /code/django_extensions/management/commands/runscript.py

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        # ...
        scripts = options['script'] # User-provided script name from command line

        def find_modules_for_script(script):
            """ Find script module which contains 'run' attribute """
            modules = []
            # first look in apps
            for app in apps.get_app_configs():
                for subdir in subdirs: # subdirs are 'scripts', 'fixtures'
                    mod = my_import("%s.%s" % (app.name, subdir), script) # Construct module path and import
                    if mod:
                        modules.append(mod)
            # try direct import
            if script.find(".") != -1:
                parent, mod_name = script.rsplit(".", 1)
                mod = my_import(parent, mod_name) # Try direct import based on user input
                if mod:
                    modules.append(mod)
            else:
                # try app.DIR.script import
                for subdir in subdirs:
                    mod = my_import(subdir, script) # Try import from subdirs
                    if mod:
                        modules.append(mod)
            return modules

        def my_import(parent_package, module_name):
            full_module_path = "%s.%s" % (parent_package, module_name)
            # ...
            try:
                t = importlib.import_module(full_module_path) # Dynamically import module based on user input
            except ImportError as e:
                # ...
                return False
            if hasattr(t, "run"):
                # ...
                return t # Return the imported module if it has a run() function

        def run_script(mod, *script_args):
            # ...
            try:
                set_directory(mod)
                exit_code = mod.run(*script_args) # Execute the run() function from the imported module
                # ...
            except Exception as e:
                # ...
                raise

        # ...
        for script in scripts: # Iterate through provided script names
            script_modules = find_modules_for_script(script) # Find module for each script name
            # ...
            script_to_run.extend(script_modules)

        for script_mod in script_to_run:
            # ...
            run_script(script_mod, *script_args) # Execute the run() function of each found module
    ```
    The code flow clearly shows that the `script` argument from the command line is used to dynamically import and execute Python modules. The `importlib.import_module` function is used to import modules based on user-provided input without sufficient validation or sanitization, leading to the potential for Remote Code Execution if an attacker can control the input.

*   **Security test case:**
    1.  Set up a Django project with `django-extensions` installed. Ensure you have command-line access to this project.
    2.  Create a Django app named `vulntest`. Inside the `vulntest` app directory, create a directory named `scripts`.
    3.  Inside `vulntest/scripts`, create a file named `malicious.py` with the following content:
        ```python
        import os

        def run(*args):
            # Malicious code to create a file in the project root directory
            with open('../pwned.txt', 'w') as f:
                f.write('You have been PWNED by runscript RCE vulnerability!')
            return True
        ```
    4.  Open a terminal, navigate to your Django project's root directory (where `manage.py` is located).
    5.  Execute the following Django management command:
        ```bash
        python manage.py runscript vulntest.malicious
        ```
    6.  Check the project root directory. If the command was successful and the vulnerability is present, a file named `pwned.txt` will be created in the project root directory with the message written in step 3, indicating code execution.

### Vulnerability 2: Arbitrary File Write via the “create_template_tags” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Write via the “create_template_tags” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “create_template_tags” command copies a pre–packaged template tags directory into a target app’s directory. An external attacker who can invoke this command (for example, via an exposed management interface) and supply a manipulated tag library name using the `--name` parameter may craft input (for instance including directory traversal characters) that causes files to be written into unintended locations in the application’s source tree.
*   **Impact:**
    Unauthorized file writes may allow the attacker to inject malicious code, establish persistent backdoors, or otherwise alter application behavior.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command assumes trusted developer usage and does not validate the `--name` parameter.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Enforce strict authentication/authorization on management commands.
    – Sanitize and validate all file/directory name inputs to prevent directory traversal or unintended overwrites.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – Management command interface is externally exposed (e.g. with DEBUG=True).
    – The attacker can supply arbitrary input via the `--name` option.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *create_template_tags.py* the command obtains the target app’s path via `app_config.path` and computes a tag library name (defaulting to “appname_tags” or basing it on the app’s directory). It then calls `copy_template()` which walks a template folder and writes each file to a path built from the unsanitized user input.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application in an environment with misconfigured (externally exposed) management commands.
    2. Execute the command with a malicious `--name` argument (e.g. one containing "../" sequences).
    3. Examine the file system to verify that files are written outside the expected directory, confirming arbitrary file write capability.

### Vulnerability 3: Arbitrary File Write via the “create_command” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Write via the “create_command” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “create_command” command creates a new management command by copying a template directory into an application’s directory. Because the destination filename is determined by replacing placeholders with a user–supplied command name (via the `--name` parameter) without additional sanitization, an attacker may supply malicious input to force files to be written in unintended locations.
*   **Impact:**
    Overwritten or newly created files in sensitive locations can provide the attacker with a persistent foothold, including a backdoor for arbitrary code execution in subsequent imports.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command is assumed to be run only in trusted environments by developers; no runtime access checks or input sanitization is applied.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Enforce proper authentication and restrict the file write operations to pre–approved directories.
    – Validate and sanitize all parameters that determine destination file paths.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – The management command interface is exposed externally.
    – The attacker can modify the `--name` parameter when invoking the command.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *create_command.py*, the `copy_template()` function is used to copy a template command. The new file’s target path is constructed by replacing “sample” with the value supplied via the command–line options; no additional checks are performed.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy a test instance with management commands accessible externally.
    2. Invoke `create_command` with a crafted `--name` parameter that includes directory traversal patterns.
    3. Verify via file system inspection that unintended files have been created or existing files overwritten.

### Vulnerability 4: Arbitrary Database Modification via the “merge_model_instances” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Database Modification via the “merge_model_instances” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “merge_model_instances” command merges duplicate model instances based on user input provided interactively. An attacker who can call this command remotely (for example, via an exposed CLI interface) may supply crafted numeric choices to target critical models and fields.
*   **Impact:**
    Improper merging or deletion of database records can lead to unintended data loss, corruption, or even privilege escalation if user accounts are affected.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command relies solely on interactive prompts assuming a trusted operator.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Enforce robust authentication and authorization.
    – Replace interactive input with secure, parameterized execution or require explicit confirmation steps in production.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – The management interface is misconfigured and exposed externally.
    – The application contains duplicate records that can be merged.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *merge_model_instances.py*, the command prints a numbered list of available models and fields and then calls Python’s built–in `input()` to receive selection values. These inputs are then used directly to choose records for merging and deletion without further sanity checks.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up an instance with duplicate entries in a sensitive model.
    2. Trigger the command remotely and supply malicious inputs to target specific records.
    3. Verify that records are merged or deleted beyond what the operator intended.

### Vulnerability 5: Sensitive Model Structure Disclosure via the “list_model_info” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Model Structure Disclosure via the “list_model_info” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    This command lists every model’s fields—including types, database column types—and method signatures. An attacker invoking it remotely receives detailed introspection output that can reveal the internal architecture and business logic of the application.
*   **Impact:**
    Detailed internal model information can be leveraged by an attacker to craft targeted attacks, such as injection payloads or logic exploits, by revealing unobfuscated business rules and schema details.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command is designed solely for debugging in trusted environments and does not filter or obscure sensitive details.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Restrict access to this command via authentication and role–based access control.
    – Consider limiting the output in production settings.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – Management commands are exposed externally.
    – The application runs with debugging/introspection features enabled.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *list_model_info.py*, all models obtained via Django’s apps registry are iterated over. Model field names, types, and even full method signatures (if the `--signature` flag is used) are printed to standard output.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application with an exposed management command interface.
    2. Execute `list_model_info` using options that display full method signatures and field details.
    3. Capture the output and confirm that it includes comprehensive internal model structure information.

### Vulnerability 6: Sensitive Internal Signal Information Disclosure via the “list_signals” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Internal Signal Information Disclosure via the “list_signals” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “list_signals” command finds and prints all Django model signals with their receiver function names, module paths, and even source file line numbers.
*   **Impact:**
    Revealing detailed signal wiring within the system provides attackers with insights into internal event handling and potential hooks for exploitation, aiding in further targeted attacks.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command is intended for internal debugging without any access restrictions.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Require authentication and restrict debugging tools to trusted users only.
    – Redact or obfuscate sensitive implementation details (like file names and line numbers) when not in a secure development environment.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – External access to the management command interface.
    – The application uses Django signals that are discoverable via garbage collection.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *list_signals.py*, the script uses Python’s garbage collector (`gc.get_objects()`) to locate all objects of type `ModelSignal` and then iterates through receivers to print details—including module names and source code locations—without filtering for sensitive information.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application in an environment that exposes management commands.
    2. Execute the `list_signals` command and capture the full output.
    3. Confirm that internal module names, receiver function names, and source locations are revealed.

### Vulnerability 7: Arbitrary Code Execution via the “runserver_plus” Management Command with Werkzeug Debugger

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via the “runserver_plus” Management Command with Werkzeug Debugger
*   **Description:**
    The “runserver_plus” command launches a development web server enhanced by the Werkzeug debugger. When an exception is raised, the debugger’s interactive shell is made available.
*   **Impact:**
    An attacker who can access the exposed web server may trigger an exception and then use the interactive debugger interface to execute arbitrary Python code on the server, effectively taking complete control over the application environment.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – This command is intended only for trusted development use and relies on local access (for example, binding to localhost).
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Require strict network access controls or authentication for running the debugger.
    – Disable the interactive debugger or bind it strictly to loopback interfaces in production deployments.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – The management command interface and resulting web server are misconfigured to be accessible from untrusted networks.
    – The debugger is enabled and not disabled by appropriate configuration.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *runserver_plus.py*, after setting up the WSGI handler, the command wraps it with Werkzeug’s `DebuggedApplication` without additional authentication. This exposes the interactive debugger on exception, making it possible for an attacker to issue arbitrary commands.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Start `runserver_plus` in an environment with external network access.
    2. Cause an exception (or wait for one to occur) to make the debugger visible.
    3. From an external host, access the interactive debugger, execute arbitrary Python commands, and verify that full control is obtained.

### Vulnerability 8: Sensitive Data Disclosure via the “dumpscript” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Data Disclosure via the “dumpscript” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “dumpscript” command outputs a Python script that, when run, repopulates the database with object data. This script includes a full dump of model instance data with no filtering of sensitive fields.
*   **Impact:**
    An attacker gaining access to the output may learn sensitive internal data—including personally identifiable information, authentication details, or business-critical data—which could be leveraged for further attack, impersonation, or data exfiltration.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command is designed for use in a controlled, trusted development environment and does not sanitize its output.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Enforce authentication and restrict this command to use only in secure environments.
    – Implement selective redaction of sensitive fields in the dump.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – Management commands are exposed externally.
    – The application’s database contains sensitive data and is dumped in plaintext via this command.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *dumpscript.py*, the script serializes each model instance by writing Python statements that reconstruct the objects (including all attributes by using Python’s `repr()` on field values). No filtering is done to remove or mask sensitive information.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up an application containing sensitive test data and expose the management commands.
    2. Run `dumpscript` for a given app and capture the output file.
    3. Verify that the script includes complete, unredacted data from the database.

### Vulnerability 9: Sensitive File Location Disclosure via the “unreferenced_files” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive File Location Disclosure via the “unreferenced_files” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “unreferenced_files” command recursively inspects the MEDIA_ROOT directory and prints the absolute paths of files that are not referenced by any FileField in the database.
*   **Impact:**
    An attacker who triggers this command may learn the internal file system layout (including paths and file names of potentially sensitive assets), which can aid in lateral movement or targeted file access attacks.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command is written for debugging and does not restrict output of file paths.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Restrict access to trusted administrators only.
    – Consider redacting or limiting file path details in the command output for untrusted users.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – MEDIA_ROOT is configured and accessible.
    – The command is executed in an environment where management functions are externally accessible.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *unreferenced_files.py*, a recursive directory walk is performed over MEDIA_ROOT; every file that is not referenced in the database is printed with its absolute path.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy an instance with a populated MEDIA_ROOT and exposed management commands.
    2. Execute the `unreferenced_files` command.
    3. Confirm that full, absolute file paths are disclosed in the output.

### Vulnerability 10: Sensitive Email Content Disclosure via the “mail_debug” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Email Content Disclosure via the “mail_debug” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “mail_debug” command starts an SMTP debugging server that logs every email message (including headers and bodies) to the console or to a designated output file. An attacker who can access this debugging interface may intercept and read the full content of all email messages being sent.
*   **Impact:**
    Exposure of email content may reveal sensitive personal details (such as account credentials or confidential correspondence), enabling phishing, impersonation, and further compromise of user data.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command is intended strictly for local debugging and does not require authentication for the SMTP server.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Restrict the debugging server to only local or whitelisted IP addresses.
    – Disable the command or redirect its output when running in production.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – The SMTP debugging server is run via an externally accessible management command interface.
    – Outbound mails are processed by the debugging server rather than a secure mail provider.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *mail_debug.py*, the custom SMTP server subclass (ExtensionDebuggingServer) logs incoming email messages using the module logger with no access controls or filtering, thereby disclosing full message content.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Run the application with the mail debugging server active and accessible externally.
    2. Trigger an email from the application.
    3. Remotely access the debugging server’s log output to verify that complete, unredacted email messages are visible.

### Vulnerability 11: Arbitrary Database State Manipulation via the “managestate” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Database State Manipulation via the “managestate” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “managestate” command can dump and load a snapshot of the applied migration state from/to a JSON file. An attacker who can supply a modified state file and trigger the “load” action may force the application to roll back migrations or to apply an alternative migration set.
*   **Impact:**
    This manipulation may lead to schema rollbacks, data corruption, or the loss of security constraints—thus undermining database integrity and exposing sensitive historical migration data.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command assumes manual execution by trusted administrators and does not validate the integrity or authenticity of state files.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Enforce authentication and restrict the command to trusted users.
    – Validate and possibly cryptographically sign migration state files to prevent tampering.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – The management command interface is exposed externally.
    – An attacker can supply or modify the state file used for loading migrations.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *managestate.py*, depending on the chosen action (“dump” or “load”), the command writes to or reads from a JSON file using no integrity checks. This file is then used to drive Django’s migrate command without additional verification.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prepare a malicious migration state file that instructs the system to revert crucial schema changes.
    2. Deploy the system with an exposed management command interface.
    3. Invoke `managestate load` with the malicious file and verify (via database inspection) that the migration state has been altered.

### Vulnerability 12: Arbitrary Database Reset via the “reset_db” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Database Reset via the “reset_db” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “reset_db” command drops and then recreates the entire database based on settings and command–line parameters. An external attacker who accesses this command may confirm the reset prompt and force complete erasure of production data.
*   **Impact:**
    This results in catastrophic data loss and complete service disruption, with irreversible destruction of stored information.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command does prompt for interactive confirmation before proceeding.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Require strong authentication and restrict database reset operations to non–network-accessible, secured environments.
    – Disable or obfuscate the command in production deployments, or require multi–factor confirmation.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – The management command interface is improperly exposed externally.
    – An attacker can bypass interactive confirmations (e.g. via non–interactive mode or automation).
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *reset_db.py*, after (optionally) prompting the user for confirmation, the command connects to the database engine and executes SQL commands (e.g., DROP DATABASE and CREATE DATABASE) without additional caller verification.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy a test instance (with a non–critical database) with externally exposed management commands.
    2. Invoke `reset_db` in a non–interactive mode (or supply “yes” automatically) and then check via database inspection that all user data has been deleted.
    3. Confirm that the database schema was dropped and recreated.

### Vulnerability 13: Unauthorized Email Modification via the “set_fake_emails” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthorized Email Modification via the “set_fake_emails” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “set_fake_emails” command resets all user email fields to a predefined format based on user attributes. An external attacker who triggers this command can change registered email addresses to attacker–controlled values.
*   **Impact:**
    This could allow the attacker to intercept password resets, hijack account recovery processes, and compromise user accounts by redirecting sensitive communications to an adversary.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command is intended only for environments running in DEBUG mode and assumes usage by trusted developers.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Restrict the availability of the command via robust authentication or disable it in production.
    – Validate that the command is running in a safe context before applying changes to user data.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – The application is misconfigured to allow external execution of management commands (e.g. with DEBUG=True).
    – An attacker can supply or override the default email format parameter.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *set_fake_emails.py*, the command loops over user accounts (optionally filtering out staff or admin users) and resets each email by applying a formatting string (defaulting to `'%(username)s@example.com'`) without any additional checks.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy a test instance with a populated user database and with management commands exposed externally.
    2. Execute the `set_fake_emails` command with a custom format that the attacker controls.
    3. Verify that the affected user accounts now use the attacker–specified email addresses.

### Vulnerability 14: Arbitrary File Deletion via the “delete_squashed_migrations” Management Command

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Deletion via the “delete_squashed_migrations” Management Command
*   **Description:**
    The “delete_squashed_migrations” command deletes migration files that have been replaced by a squashed migration and then edits the squashed migration file (by deleting lines that match a specific regex). An attacker triggering this command may force deletion or corruption of migration files.
*   **Impact:**
    If migration history is removed or the squashed migration file is improperly altered, the application’s database schema becomes inconsistent and future migration operations may fail, leading to long–term system instability and potential data loss.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    – The command prompts interactively before deleting files.
*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    – Enforce strict authorization so that only trusted administrators can invoke file deletion commands.
    – Validate that file paths and contents have not been tampered with before proceeding with deletion or modification.
*   **Preconditions:**
    – The management command interface is accessible externally and accepts untrusted parameters.
*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    In *delete_squashed_migrations.py*, the command locates migration files corresponding to the “replaces” attribute of a squashed migration and then calls `os.remove()` without verifying that the targeted files are safe to delete. It subsequently opens the squashed migration file and deletes lines matching a regex without further checks.
*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy a test instance with a known migration set and an exposed management command interface.
    2. Execute `delete_squashed_migrations` supplying an app label and squashed migration name.
    3. Confirm via file system inspection that migration files have been deleted and that the squashed migration file has been modified unexpectedly.

### Vulnerability 15: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `highlight` template tag

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `highlight` template tag
*   **Description:**
    1. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into content that is processed by the `highlight` template tag.
    2. The `highlight` template tag uses Pygments library to highlight code syntax.
    3. The output of Pygments is directly rendered into the template without proper escaping of HTML entities.
    4. If an attacker can control the input to the `highlight` tag, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the template is rendered.
*   **Impact:**
    - High
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        - Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
        - Defacing the website.
        - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
        - Phishing attacks.
*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High
*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly renders the output of Pygments without HTML escaping.
*   **Missing mitigations:**
    - HTML escaping of the output from the `highlight` template tag before rendering it in the template. Django's `escape` template filter or `mark_safe` with manual escaping should be used.
*   **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be using the `highlight` template tag from `django-extensions`.
    - An attacker must be able to influence the input that is passed to the `highlight` template tag. This could be through user-generated content, URL parameters, or other input vectors that are rendered using this template tag.

    from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
    from pygments import highlight
    from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter
    from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name, guess_lexer

    register = template.Library()

    @register.tag(name='highlight')
    def do_highlight(parser, token):
        """
        {% highlight [lexer_name] [linenos] [name=".."] %}
        .. code block ..
        {% endhighlight %}
        """
        nodelist = parser.parse(('endhighlight',))
        parser.delete_first_token()

        tokens = token.contents.split()
        if len(tokens) < 1:
            raise template.TemplateSyntaxError("'{% highlight %}' statement requires an argument, the language of the code block.")

        lexer_name = tokens[1]
        linenos = False
        name = None

        if len(tokens) > 2:
            if 'linenos' in tokens[2:]:
                linenos = True
            for kwarg in tokens[2:]:
                if kwarg.startswith('name='):
                    try:
                        name = kwarg.split('=', 1)[1].strip('"').strip("'")
                    except IndexError:
                        pass

        return HighlightNode(nodelist, lexer_name, linenos, name)


    class HighlightNode(template.Node):
        def __init__(self, nodelist, lexer_name, linenos, name):
            self.nodelist = nodelist
            self.lexer_name = lexer_name
            self.linenos = linenos
            self.name = name

        def render(self, context):
            source = self.nodelist.render(context)
            try:
                lexer = get_lexer_by_name(self.lexer_name)
            except ValueError:
                lexer = guess_lexer(source)
            formatter = HtmlFormatter(linenos=self.linenos, cssclass='highlight', prestyles='margin: 0')
            if name:
                desc = '<div class="predesc"><span>%s</span></div>' % name
            else:
                desc = ''
            return mark_safe(desc + highlight(source, lexer, formatter))
    ```
    - The `HighlightNode.render` method retrieves the source code from the template (`self.nodelist.render(context)`).
    - It then uses `pygments.highlight` to perform syntax highlighting.
    - **Crucially, the output of `pygments.highlight` is directly wrapped in `mark_safe` without any HTML escaping.** This means that if the source code contains HTML or JavaScript, it will be rendered as-is in the final output, leading to XSS if the input source is attacker-controlled.
*   **Security test case:**
    1. Create a Django template that uses the `highlight` template tag and renders user-controlled input within it. For example, assume a view that passes user input `code_snippet` to the template:
    ```html+django
    {% load highlighting %}
    <div>
        {% highlight 'html' %}
            {{ code_snippet }}
        {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
    ```
    2. As an attacker, craft a malicious input for `code_snippet` that contains JavaScript code:
    ```html
    <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">
    ```
    3. Send a request to the application that includes this malicious input.
    4. Observe the rendered HTML output in the browser.
    5. If the vulnerability exists, an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" will be displayed, indicating that the JavaScript code was executed.
    6. Inspect the HTML source. You will see that the injected `<img>` tag is rendered without escaping, and the `onerror` event handler is active.

### Vulnerability 16: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `syntax_color` template filters (`colorize`, `colorize_table`, `colorize_noclasses`)

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `syntax_color` template filters (`colorize`, `colorize_table`, `colorize_noclasses`)
*   **Description:**
    1. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into content that is processed by the `colorize`, `colorize_table`, or `colorize_noclasses` template filters.
    2. These template filters use Pygments library to highlight code syntax.
    3. The output of Pygments is directly rendered into the template without proper escaping of HTML entities.
    4. If an attacker can control the input to these filters, they can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the template is rendered.

    ```
    - The `colorize`, `colorize_table`, and `colorize_noclasses` filter functions use `pygments.highlight` to perform syntax highlighting.
    - **Crucially, the output of `pygments.highlight` is directly wrapped in `mark_safe` without any HTML escaping.** This means that if the input value contains HTML or JavaScript, it will be rendered as-is in the final output, leading to XSS if the input source is attacker-controlled.
*   **Security test case:**
    1. Create a Django template that uses the `colorize` template filter and renders user-controlled input within it. For example, assume a view that passes user input `code_snippet` to the template:
    ```html+django
    {% load syntax_color %}
    <div>
        {{ code_snippet|colorize:'html' }}
    </div>
    ```
    2. As an attacker, craft a malicious input for `code_snippet` that contains JavaScript code:
    ```html
    <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability from colorize filter!')">
    ```
    3. Send a request to the application that includes this malicious input.
    4. Observe the rendered HTML output in the browser.
    5. If the vulnerability exists, an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability from colorize filter!" will be displayed, indicating that the JavaScript code was executed.
    6. Inspect the HTML source. You will see that the injected `<img>` tag is rendered without escaping, and the `onerror` event handler is active.
    7. Repeat steps 1-6 for `colorize_table` and `colorize_noclasses` filters, adjusting the alert message in step 2 accordingly (e.g., "XSS Vulnerability from colorize_table filter!").
