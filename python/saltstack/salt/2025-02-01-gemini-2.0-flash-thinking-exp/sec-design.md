  - Requirement: Sanitize user-provided data in Salt states and modules to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if web interfaces are exposed.
  - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client-side (Salt CLI, API) and server-side (Salt Master, Minion).
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms for communication between Salt Master and Minions (e.g., AES).
  - Requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys used for authentication and encryption.
  - Requirement: Implement cryptographic hashing for data integrity checks.

 - What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the Salt deployment?
- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to improve operational efficiency and security through automation.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is a high priority, and the organization is willing to invest in security controls. Secure software development lifecycle practices are generally followed.
