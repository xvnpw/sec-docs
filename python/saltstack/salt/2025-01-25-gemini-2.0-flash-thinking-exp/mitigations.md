## Mitigation Strategy: [Master and Minion Communication Security (Salt-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/master_and_minion_communication_security__salt-specific_.md)

### Master and Minion Communication Security (Salt-Specific)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable SSL/TLS Encryption in Salt
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Modify Salt Master Configuration:** Edit the Salt Master configuration file (`/etc/salt/master`).
        2.  **Set `ssl: True`:** Ensure the line `ssl: True` is present and uncommented in the configuration file. This setting instructs the Salt Master to enforce SSL/TLS encryption for all communication.
        3.  **Restart Salt Master Service:** Restart the `salt-master` service (e.g., `systemctl restart salt-master`) for the configuration change to take effect. Salt Minions will automatically attempt to connect using SSL/TLS after the Master is configured.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping on Salt Communication (High Severity):** Without SSL/TLS, Salt commands and data transmitted between Master and Minions are in plain text, allowing interception and exposure of sensitive information managed by Salt.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Salt Communication (High Severity):** Attackers could intercept and manipulate unencrypted Salt communication, potentially injecting malicious commands or altering configurations managed by Salt.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Eavesdropping:** High Impact - Encrypting Salt communication renders intercepted data unreadable, effectively preventing eavesdropping on sensitive Salt operations.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High Impact - SSL/TLS encryption and certificate verification (inherent in Salt's SSL/TLS implementation) significantly hinder MitM attacks targeting Salt communication channels.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Assuming default Salt configuration without explicit SSL/TLS enablement).
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Salt Master configuration file (`/etc/salt/master`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Salt Master and Minion Keys](./mitigation_strategies/verify_salt_master_and_minion_keys.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Verify Salt Master and Minion Keys
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Master Key Fingerprint Verification (Minion Setup):** During the initial Salt Minion setup, when the Minion connects to the Master, it receives the Master's public key.  Manually verify the fingerprint of this key using Salt's `salt-key` utility.
            *   **Obtain Master Fingerprint:** On the Salt Master, use `salt-key -F master` to display the Master key fingerprint.
            *   **Compare Fingerprints on Minion:** Compare this fingerprint with the one presented by the Minion during its initial connection attempt.
            *   **Accept Key on Minion (If Match):** Only accept the Master key on the Minion if the fingerprints match, ensuring connection to the legitimate Master.
        2.  **Minion Key Fingerprint Verification (Master Acceptance):** When a Minion key is submitted to the Salt Master for acceptance, verify its fingerprint before accepting it using `salt-key` on the Master.
            *   **List Unaccepted Keys:** On the Salt Master, use `salt-key -l unaccepted` to list pending Minion keys.
            *   **Get Minion Key Fingerprint:** For each pending key, use `salt-key -f <minion_id>` to display its fingerprint.
            *   **Verify Fingerprint Out-of-Band:** Obtain the Minion's key fingerprint through a secure channel *outside* of Salt (e.g., secure shell, pre-shared key).
            *   **Compare Fingerprints on Master:** Compare the out-of-band fingerprint with the one displayed by `salt-key -f`.
            *   **Accept Key on Master (If Match):** Accept the Minion key using `salt-key -a <minion_id>` only if the fingerprints match, ensuring legitimate Minions are added.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Rogue Salt Master Impersonation (High Severity):** Prevents Minions from connecting to and being controlled by an unauthorized, malicious Salt Master.
        *   **Rogue Salt Minion Impersonation (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized, malicious Minions from joining the Salt infrastructure and potentially gaining access or disrupting operations.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks During Salt Key Exchange (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of MitM attacks during the initial key exchange process in Salt.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Rogue Master/Minion:** High Impact - Prevents unauthorized entities from becoming part of the Salt infrastructure, eliminating a critical attack vector in Salt deployments.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Key Exchange:** Medium Impact - Significantly reduces the window of opportunity for MitM attacks during the crucial initial key exchange phase of Salt setup.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Assuming manual key verification is not a standard operational procedure).
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Minion bootstrapping and Master key acceptance processes, Master Minion key acceptance processes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Rotate Salt Master and Minion Keys](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_rotate_salt_master_and_minion_keys.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Rotate Salt Master and Minion Keys
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Establish a Salt Key Rotation Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for rotating Salt Master and Minion keys (e.g., every 3-6 months).
        2.  **Salt Master Key Rotation:**
            *   **Generate New Master Key:** On the Salt Master, use `salt-key --gen-master` to create a new Master key pair.
            *   **Securely Distribute New Public Key:** Distribute the new Master public key to all Minions through a secure method (e.g., configuration management, secure file transfer).
            *   **Update Minion Configuration:** On each Minion, update the `master_pub` path in `/etc/salt/minion` to point to the new Master public key file.
            *   **Restart Minions:** Restart the `salt-minion` service on each Minion.
            *   **Replace Old Master Key:** Replace the old Master key files with the newly generated ones on the Salt Master.
            *   **Restart Master:** Restart the `salt-master` service.
        3.  **Salt Minion Key Rotation:**
            *   **Generate New Minion Keys:** On each Minion, use `salt-key --gen-minion` to generate a new key pair.
            *   **Submit New Key to Master:** The Minion will automatically submit its new public key to the Salt Master.
            *   **Accept New Minion Key on Master:** On the Salt Master, use `salt-key -a <minion_id>` to accept the new Minion key.
            *   **Revoke Old Minion Key (Recommended):** On the Salt Master, use `salt-key -r <minion_id>` to revoke the old Minion key, further limiting the lifespan of potentially compromised keys.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Compromised Salt Keys (Medium to High Severity):** If Salt Master or Minion keys are compromised, regular rotation limits the time window an attacker can use these keys to control Salt infrastructure.
        *   **Long-Term Exposure of Salt Keys (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk associated with prolonged use of the same Salt keys, which increases the chance of compromise over time.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromised Keys:** Medium to High Impact - Key rotation significantly reduces the impact of a Salt key compromise by invalidating the compromised keys relatively quickly.
        *   **Long-Term Key Exposure:** Medium Impact - Proactively mitigates the risk of key compromise due to long-term usage in Salt environments.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Assuming no automated or scheduled Salt key rotation process).
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Scripts or automation for Salt key rotation, scheduling for regular key rotation, procedures for key distribution and acceptance within Salt.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Storage of Salt Keys](./mitigation_strategies/secure_storage_of_salt_keys.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Storage of Salt Keys
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Restrict File System Permissions for Salt Key Directories:** On both Salt Master and Minions, apply strict file system permissions to the directories where Salt keys are stored (typically `/etc/salt/pki/master` on Master and `/etc/salt/pki/minion` on Minions).
            *   **Master Key Directory:** Ensure only the user running the `salt-master` process (usually `salt`) has read and write access to `/etc/salt/pki/master` and its contents. Set permissions to `700` or `600`.
            *   **Minion Key Directory:** Ensure only the user running the `salt-minion` process (usually `salt`) has read and write access to `/etc/salt/pki/minion` and its contents. Set permissions to `700` or `600`.
        2.  **Regularly Audit Salt Key Permissions:** Periodically review the file system permissions on Salt key storage locations to ensure they remain correctly configured and haven't been weakened.
        3.  **Consider Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for Salt Master Key (Advanced):** For highly sensitive Salt deployments, consider storing the Salt Master private key in an HSM. This provides a hardware-backed, tamper-resistant environment for key storage, enhancing security.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Salt Private Keys (High Severity):** Weak file system permissions could allow unauthorized users or processes to read Salt private keys, enabling impersonation of the Salt Master or Minions.
        *   **Theft of Salt Private Keys (High Severity):** Insecure storage makes Salt private keys vulnerable to theft if systems are compromised, allowing attackers to gain control over the Salt infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Key Access:** High Impact - Restricting access to Salt private keys via file system permissions effectively prevents unauthorized users from compromising Salt security through key access.
        *   **Key Theft:** High Impact - Secure storage significantly reduces the risk of Salt key theft, especially HSMs which offer robust protection against physical and logical extraction.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Assuming default OS file permissions are in place, without specific hardening for Salt key storage).
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Hardening file system permissions for Salt key directories, HSM integration for Salt Master key (if required), automated auditing of Salt key permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization (Salt-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization__salt-specific_.md)

### Authentication and Authorization (Salt-Specific)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Authentication for Salt Users (CLI/API)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enforce Strong Passwords for Salt Users (If Applicable):** If password-based authentication is used for Salt users accessing the CLI or API, enforce strong password policies.
            *   **Password Complexity:** Mandate complex passwords meeting length, character type, and uniqueness requirements.
            *   **Password Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular password changes for Salt users.
            *   **Account Lockout:** Configure account lockout after failed login attempts to protect against brute-force attacks on Salt user accounts.
        2.  **Utilize Key-Based Authentication for Salt Users (Recommended):** Prefer key-based authentication over passwords for Salt user access to the Salt Master (CLI and API).
            *   **Generate SSH Keys:** Generate SSH key pairs for each Salt user who needs CLI or API access.
            *   **Distribute Public Keys:** Securely distribute user public keys to the Salt Master and configure user accounts for key-based authentication.
            *   **Disable Password Authentication (If Possible):** Disable password-based authentication for Salt user access to eliminate password-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Salt User Accounts (High Severity):** Weak passwords make Salt user accounts vulnerable to brute-force attacks, potentially granting attackers unauthorized access to manage the Salt infrastructure.
        *   **Password Guessing or Compromise of Salt User Accounts (High Severity):** Easily guessed or compromised passwords for Salt users can lead to unauthorized access and control over Salt.
        *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks Against Salt User Accounts (Medium Severity):** If Salt users reuse passwords, compromised credentials from other services could be used to gain access to Salt.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High Impact - Strong passwords and account lockout significantly increase the difficulty of brute-force attacks. Key-based authentication eliminates password-based brute-force risks.
        *   **Password Guessing/Compromise:** High Impact - Strong passwords and key-based authentication make password guessing and compromise much less likely for Salt user accounts.
        *   **Credential Stuffing:** Medium Impact - Reduces the risk of credential stuffing attacks targeting Salt user accounts, especially with key-based authentication.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Assuming basic password authentication might be in place for Salt users, without enforced strong policies or key-based authentication).
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Password complexity policies for Salt users, account lockout configuration, implementation of key-based authentication for Salt users, disabling password authentication for Salt access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Salt's Authorization System (ACLs)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_salt's_authorization_system__acls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Salt's Authorization System (ACLs)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Salt Access Control Policies:** Determine the necessary access levels for different users and Minions within Salt based on roles and responsibilities. Identify which users and Minions should have access to specific Salt functions, states, pillars, and files.
        2.  **Configure Salt ACLs in Master Configuration:** Implement Salt's Access Control Lists (ACLs) in the Salt Master configuration file (`/etc/salt/master`).
            *   **`peer` ACLs:** Define rules in `peer` section to control which Minions can execute Salt commands on other Minions, limiting lateral movement within the Salt infrastructure.
            *   **`client` ACLs:** Define rules in `client` section to control which Salt users can execute Salt commands and access Salt functions, enforcing role-based access control for Salt operations.
            *   **`pillar_roots` ACLs:** Define rules in `pillar_roots` section to control which Minions and users can access specific Pillar data, restricting access to sensitive configuration information managed by Salt.
            *   **`file_roots` ACLs:** Define rules in `file_roots` section to control which Minions and users can access specific files on the Salt file server, limiting access to configuration files and resources managed by Salt.
        3.  **Apply Principle of Least Privilege in Salt ACLs:** Grant only the minimum necessary Salt permissions to users and Minions through ACLs. Avoid overly permissive ACL rules that could broaden the attack surface within Salt.
        4.  **Regularly Review and Update Salt ACLs:** Periodically review and update Salt ACL configurations to reflect changes in roles, responsibilities, and security requirements within the Salt environment.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Execution of Salt Functions (Medium to High Severity):** Without ACLs, users or Minions might be able to execute Salt functions beyond their authorized scope, potentially leading to misconfiguration, disruption, or security breaches within Salt-managed systems.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Salt Data (Medium to High Severity):** Without ACLs, users or Minions could access sensitive Pillar data or files on the Salt file server that they should not have access to, leading to data leaks or misuse of sensitive information managed by Salt.
        *   **Lateral Movement via Salt (Medium Severity):** Permissive `peer` ACLs could allow a compromised Minion to execute Salt commands on other Minions, facilitating lateral movement and expanding the impact of a Minion compromise within the Salt infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Function Execution:** Medium to High Impact - Salt ACLs prevent unauthorized execution of Salt functions, limiting the potential for misuse of Salt capabilities and reducing the risk of unintended or malicious actions within Salt.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Medium to High Impact - Salt ACLs protect sensitive Pillar data and files on the Salt file server from unauthorized access, mitigating the risk of data breaches and exposure of sensitive configuration details managed by Salt.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium Impact - Restricting Minion-to-Minion communication through Salt `peer` ACLs hinders lateral movement by attackers who might compromise a Minion, limiting the spread of an attack within the Salt environment.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Assuming basic or no Salt ACLs are configured beyond default settings).
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Definition of Salt access control policies, configuration of `peer`, `client`, `pillar_roots`, and `file_roots` ACLs in the Salt Master configuration file (`/etc/salt/master`), establishment of a regular Salt ACL review process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Salt Minions](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_salt_minions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Salt Minions
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Avoid Running Salt Minions as Root (Default):** By default, Salt Minions run as the root user. Evaluate if running as root is absolutely necessary for all Salt Minion operations in your environment.
        2.  **Create a Dedicated Non-Privileged User for Salt Minion (Recommended):** Create a dedicated, non-privileged user account specifically for running the `salt-minion` process.
            *   **Create User Account:** Create a new user (e.g., `saltminion`) with minimal privileges required for Salt Minion operations.
            *   **Change Minion User in Configuration:** Modify the Salt Minion configuration file (`/etc/salt/minion`) and set the `user` option to the newly created user: `user: saltminion`.
            *   **Restart Salt Minion Service:** Restart the `salt-minion` service for the user change to take effect.
        3.  **Utilize Salt's `user` and `sudo` Execution Modules in States:** When Salt states require elevated privileges for specific tasks, use Salt's `user` and `sudo` execution modules within states instead of running the entire Minion process as root.
            *   **`user` Execution Module:** Use Salt's `user.present`, `user.absent`, etc., state functions with the `runas` parameter to execute user management commands as a specific user when needed.
            *   **`sudo` Execution Module:** Use Salt's `sudo.run`, `sudo.script` execution modules to execute specific commands with `sudo` privileges within Salt states only when necessary. Configure `sudoers` appropriately on Minions to restrict `sudo` access to only the required commands and users invoked by Salt.
        4.  **Minimize `sudo` Usage in Salt States:** Carefully review Salt states and minimize the use of `sudo` to only the absolutely essential commands requiring elevated privileges.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation from Salt Minion Compromise (High Severity):** If a Salt Minion running as root is compromised, an attacker immediately gains root-level access to the system, maximizing the impact of the compromise.
        *   **Accidental Root-Level Actions via Salt (Medium Severity):** Running Salt Minions as root increases the risk of accidental or unintended actions being performed with root privileges through Salt, potentially leading to system instability or misconfiguration.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation from Minion Compromise:** High Impact - Running Salt Minions with reduced privileges significantly limits the impact of a Minion compromise. An attacker compromising a non-root Minion will have restricted initial privileges, making privilege escalation a necessary step.
        *   **Accidental Root Actions:** Medium Impact - Reduces the risk of accidental root-level actions through Salt by limiting the default privileges of the Salt Minion process.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Applicable (Assuming Salt Minions are running as root by default).
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Creation of a dedicated non-privileged user for Salt Minions, configuration of the Minion user in `/etc/salt/minion`, review and modification of Salt states to utilize `user` and `sudo` modules for privilege elevation, `sudoers` configuration on Minions to restrict `sudo` access for Salt.
