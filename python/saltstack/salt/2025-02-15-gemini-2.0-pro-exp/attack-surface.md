# Attack Surface Analysis for saltstack/salt

## Attack Surface: [1. Compromised Salt Master](./attack_surfaces/1__compromised_salt_master.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains full control of the Salt Master, allowing them to control all connected minions. This is the single most critical point of failure.
    *   **How Salt Contributes:** The Salt Master is the central authority and communication hub. Its compromise grants complete control over the managed infrastructure.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the Salt Master service to gain root access to the Master server. They then use this access to deploy ransomware to all connected minions.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all managed systems. Potential for widespread data breaches and operational disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patching:** Keep the Salt Master software up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Prioritize patching known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Hardening:** Harden the operating system of the Salt Master server.  Disable unnecessary services and follow security best practices for the OS.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Salt Master on a dedicated, secure network segment with strict firewall rules.  Limit inbound access to only necessary ports (4505, 4506) and only from authorized minion IPs and administrative workstations.
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Use strong, unique passwords for all Salt Master access (including API and CLI).  Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Configure Salt users and roles with the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid granting overly broad access.
        *   **TLS Encryption:** Enforce TLS encryption for all Master-Minion communication.  Verify minion keys diligently during the initial connection.
        *   **Auditing:** Enable detailed logging on the Salt Master and regularly review logs for suspicious activity.  Integrate with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring.
        *   **eAuth:** If using external authentication, ensure the external provider is secure and the eAuth configuration is robust.
        *   **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning of the Salt Master and its host environment.

## Attack Surface: [2. Rogue Minion Connection](./attack_surfaces/2__rogue_minion_connection.md)

*   **Description:** An unauthorized system connects to the Salt Master, potentially receiving configurations or executing commands intended for legitimate minions.
    *   **How Salt Contributes:** Salt's architecture relies on minions connecting to the Master.  If key management is weak, a rogue minion can impersonate a legitimate one.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the network and configures a system to connect to the Salt Master, pretending to be a newly provisioned server. The attacker's system then receives sensitive configuration data.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for data exfiltration, unauthorized command execution, and lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Key Management:** Implement a rigorous process for reviewing and approving minion key requests.  Do *not* use `auto_accept: True` in production environments.
        *   **Manual Key Acceptance:** Use `auto_accept: False` in the Master configuration to require manual approval of all minion keys.
        *   **Autosign Grains (Careful Use):** If using `autosign_grains`, ensure the grains used for identification are truly unique and cannot be easily spoofed.  Regularly audit the `autosign_grains` configuration.
        *   **Key Auditing:** Regularly audit the list of accepted minion keys on the Salt Master.  Remove any keys that are no longer needed or are suspicious.
        *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for unauthorized connections to the Salt Master's ports.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure State File Execution](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_state_file_execution.md)

*   **Description:** State files (.sls) containing vulnerabilities or misconfigurations are executed on minions, leading to security compromises.
    *   **How Salt Contributes:** Salt states define the desired configuration of minions.  Insecure states can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A state file contains hardcoded database credentials in plain text. An attacker who compromises a minion can read this file and gain access to the database.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability.  Could range from information disclosure to privilege escalation or remote code execution on the minion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pillar Data:** Use Salt's pillar system to store sensitive data (passwords, API keys, etc.) *outside* of state files.  Pillar data is encrypted and only accessible to specific minions.
        *   **Jinja Templating:** Use Jinja templating to avoid hardcoding values and promote reusability and maintainability of state files.
        *   **Code Review:** Implement a code review process for all state file changes.  Ensure that security best practices are followed.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Design states to grant only the minimum necessary permissions to files, users, and processes.
        *   **Version Control:** Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to state files and facilitate rollbacks.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use a linter or static analysis tool to identify potential security issues in state files (e.g., insecure file permissions, hardcoded secrets).
        *   **Trusted Modules:** Only use Salt modules from trusted sources.  Carefully review any custom modules before deploying them.

## Attack Surface: [4. Execution Module Abuse](./attack_surfaces/4__execution_module_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage Salt's execution modules (functions run on minions) to perform malicious actions.
    *   **How Salt Contributes:** Salt provides powerful execution modules for managing systems.  These modules can be misused if not properly controlled.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with limited access to the Salt Master uses the `cmd.run` module to execute arbitrary shell commands on a target minion, escalating their privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and denial of service on minions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Module Blacklisting/Whitelisting:** Use Salt's `module_blacklist` or `module_whitelist` configuration options to restrict the use of potentially dangerous modules (e.g., `cmd.run`, `cmd.script`).  Prefer whitelisting to blacklisting for a more secure approach.
        *   **Least Privilege (Salt Users):** Define Salt users and roles with the minimum necessary permissions to execute specific modules.  Avoid granting broad access to all modules.
        *   **Auditing:** Enable detailed logging of execution module usage and regularly review logs for suspicious activity.
        *   **Runners (for Privileged Tasks):** Use Salt's `runner` modules (which run on the Master) for tasks that require elevated privileges, rather than running them directly on minions via execution modules. This centralizes privileged operations.
        *   **Input Validation:** If custom execution modules are used, ensure they perform thorough input validation to prevent command injection or other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [5. Salt API Vulnerability Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/5__salt_api_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Salt API to gain unauthorized access to Salt functionality.
    *   **How Salt Contributes:** The Salt API provides programmatic access to Salt.  Vulnerabilities in the API can expose the entire system.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Salt API's web interface. They use this vulnerability to steal an administrator's session cookie and gain control of the Salt Master.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to a compromised Salt Master â€“ complete system compromise, data breaches, and operational disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **API Patching:** Keep the Salt Master software (which includes the API) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   **Strong Authentication (API):** Use strong, unique passwords and MFA for all Salt API access.
        *   **Access Control (API):** Implement strict access controls to limit API access to authorized users and applications.  Use Salt's `client_acl` configuration to define granular permissions.
        *   **Disable if Unused:** If the Salt API is not needed, disable it entirely.
        *   **Reverse Proxy:** If exposing the API, use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) with proper security configurations (TLS, input validation, rate limiting, Web Application Firewall (WAF)).
        *   **Auditing (API):** Enable detailed logging of Salt API usage and regularly review logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [6. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Master-Minion Communication](./attack_surfaces/6__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_master-minion_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between the Salt Master and minions.
    *   **How Salt Contributes:** Salt relies on network communication between the Master and minions.  Without proper encryption, this communication is vulnerable to MitM attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses ARP spoofing to redirect traffic between a minion and the Salt Master. They then intercept sensitive configuration data being sent to the minion.
    *   **Impact:** Data interception, modification of commands and configurations, potential for impersonation of the Master or minions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **TLS Encryption (Mandatory):** Enforce TLS encryption for *all* Master-Minion communication.  This is the primary defense against MitM attacks.  Ensure proper certificate validation is enabled.
        *   **Network Security:** Implement strong network security measures, including network segmentation, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and regular network monitoring.
        *   **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Use secure network devices and protocols.  Avoid using unencrypted protocols (e.g., HTTP) for any Salt-related communication.
