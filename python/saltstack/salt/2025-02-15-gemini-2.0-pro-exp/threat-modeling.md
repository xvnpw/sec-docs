# Threat Model Analysis for saltstack/salt

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution via `salt-api`](./threats/unauthenticated_remote_code_execution_via__salt-api_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution via `salt-api`

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the `salt-api` to execute arbitrary commands on the Salt Master or connected minions *without authentication*.  The attacker sends crafted HTTP requests to the API endpoint, bypassing authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.  The attacker gains full control over the Salt Master and *all* connected minions, allowing data exfiltration, system manipulation, and lateral movement.
    *   **Affected Component:** `salt-api` (REST API), Master's web server configuration, authentication modules (e.g., `netapi_ssl`, `external_auth`).  This is a *direct* Salt component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and *enforce* strong authentication for `salt-api` (e.g., TLS client certificates, strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
        *   Regularly update Salt to the latest version to patch vulnerabilities in `salt-api`.
        *   Restrict network access to the `salt-api` endpoint using firewalls. Only allow access from trusted sources.
        *   Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect and block malicious requests (though this is *less* direct Salt involvement).
        *   Disable `salt-api` if it's not absolutely necessary.
        *   Configure proper authorization using Salt's ACL system to limit API actions, even with authentication.

## Threat: [Command Injection in Custom Salt Modules](./threats/command_injection_in_custom_salt_modules.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection in Custom Salt Modules

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a *custom* Salt execution module or state module where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being passed to a shell command. The attacker crafts malicious input with shell metacharacters to execute arbitrary commands on the target minion.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the targeted minion(s). The attacker gains control, potentially leading to data breaches, system disruption, or lateral movement.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Salt execution modules (`*.py` files in `_modules`), custom state modules (`*.py` files in `_states`), any module using functions like `cmd.run`, `cmd.run_all`, `cmd.exec_code` (or similar) *without* proper input validation. These are *direct* Salt components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization in *all* custom modules. Use whitelisting, not blacklisting. Avoid shell commands if possible.
        *   **Use Salt's Built-in Functions:** Prefer Salt's built-in functions (e.g., `file.managed`, `pkg.installed`) over shell commands.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all custom modules, focusing on security.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Salt minions with the least privileges necessary (avoid root).
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit custom modules and Salt configurations.

## Threat: [Pillar Data Exposure](./threats/pillar_data_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Pillar Data Exposure

    *   **Description:** Sensitive data in Salt Pillar is exposed to unauthorized minions due to misconfiguration. An attacker on a compromised minion accesses Pillar data intended for other minions, revealing credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure. The attacker gains access to sensitive data, used to compromise other systems or escalate privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:** Pillar configuration (`pillar_roots`, `ext_pillar`), Top file (`top.sls`), Minion ID configuration, custom Pillar modules. These are *direct* Salt components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Pillar Grains Targeting:** Target Pillar data to specific minions using grains, minion IDs, or other targeting. Avoid assigning sensitive data to all minions.
        *   **Encrypt Sensitive Pillar Data:** Use GPG or another mechanism to encrypt sensitive Pillar data at rest.
        *   **Use a Secrets Management System:** Integrate Salt with a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and retrieve secrets. Avoid storing secrets directly in Pillar files.
        *   **Regularly Review Pillar Configuration:** Audit Pillar configuration to ensure data is not exposed.
        *   **Restrict Access to Pillar Files:** Only the Salt Master process should have read access to Pillar files on the Master.

## Threat: [ZeroMQ Message Bus Eavesdropping](./threats/zeromq_message_bus_eavesdropping.md)

*   **Threat:** ZeroMQ Message Bus Eavesdropping

    *   **Description:** An attacker with network access intercepts *unencrypted* communication between the Salt Master and minions over the ZeroMQ message bus. The attacker captures sensitive data, including commands, execution results, and potentially Pillar data.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure. The attacker gains access to sensitive data transmitted between the master and minions.
    *   **Affected Component:** ZeroMQ communication, Salt Master and Minion network configuration. This is a *direct* Salt communication mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable TLS Encryption for ZeroMQ:** Configure Salt to use TLS encryption for *all* communication between the master and minions. This is the *primary* and most direct Salt-specific mitigation.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Salt network (less direct, but important).
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Restrict network access to the ZeroMQ ports (4505 and 4506) to authorized hosts (less direct, but important).
        *   **Monitor Network Traffic:** Monitor for suspicious activity (less direct, but important).

## Threat: [Malicious State File Injection](./threats/malicious_state_file_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious State File Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the Salt file server (or the master's file roots) and injects a malicious state file (SLS). When applied, this state file executes arbitrary code on the target minions.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the targeted minion(s).  Attacker gains control.
    *   **Affected Component:** Salt file server (`file_roots`), Master's file system, potentially `salt-cp` if used insecurely.  These are *direct* Salt components related to file distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure the File Server:** Strong authentication and authorization for the Salt file server. Restrict write access.
        *   **Use a Version Control System:** Store state files in a VCS (e.g., Git) and use a secure deployment pipeline.
        *   **Code Review:** Review all state files before deployment.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Consider using digital signatures to verify state file integrity.
        *   **Monitor File System Changes:** Monitor the Salt file server and file roots for unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Salt Module](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_salt_module.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerable Salt Module

    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages a *known vulnerability* in a *built-in* Salt module (e.g., a specific version with a known CVE) to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but could range from information disclosure to *remote code execution*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific vulnerable *built-in* Salt module (e.g., a module listed in a CVE). This is a *direct* Salt component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical, depending on the CVE)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Salt Updated:** *Most important*. Regularly update Salt to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Subscribe to SaltStack security announcements.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use scanners to identify known vulnerabilities (less direct, but important).
        *   **Disable Unused Modules:** If a module isn't needed, disable it.

## Threat: [Compromised Minion Key Leads to Impersonation](./threats/compromised_minion_key_leads_to_impersonation.md)

* **Threat:** Compromised Minion Key Leads to Impersonation

    * **Description:** An attacker gains access to a minion's private key. The attacker can then use this key to *impersonate the minion*, sending malicious commands to the master or receiving sensitive data.
    * **Impact:** The attacker executes commands *as the compromised minion*, potentially escalating privileges or accessing sensitive data.
    * **Affected Component:** Minion key (`/etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pem`), Minion authentication process. These are *direct* Salt components.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Minion Key Storage:** Strict permissions on the minion key file (readable only by the Salt minion process).
        * **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating minion keys. This is a *direct* Salt-related mitigation.
        * **Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS):** Detect unauthorized access to the key file (less direct, but important).
        * **Monitor for Suspicious Minion Activity:** Monitor the Salt Master for unusual commands (less direct, but important).
This refined list focuses on the core, high-impact threats directly related to SaltStack's functionality and components. It emphasizes the importance of securing Salt's own communication, configuration, and code execution mechanisms.
