## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Control Over Managed Systems via SaltStack (Attacker Goal) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_control_over_managed_systems_via_saltstack__attacker_goal___critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means they have achieved unauthorized control over systems managed by SaltStack, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Salt Master (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_salt_master__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

The Salt Master is the central control point. Compromising it grants the attacker significant control over the entire Salt infrastructure and all managed Minions. This is a high-impact and often targeted attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Salt Master Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_salt_master_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves leveraging known or unknown security flaws in the Salt Master software itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CVEs (e.g., RCE, Auth Bypass) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cves__e_g___rce__auth_bypass___high-risk_path_.md)

Identify and Exploit Unpatched Vulnerabilities in Salt Master: Attackers scan for and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the Salt Master software that have not been patched by the administrators. This often leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or authentication bypass, granting full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Salt Master Authentication Weaknesses (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_salt_master_authentication_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

This focuses on weaknesses in how the Salt Master verifies the identity of users or systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_not_changed_.md)

If administrators fail to change the default username and password after installation, attackers can easily gain access using these well-known credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Salt API (if enabled) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_salt_api__if_enabled___high-risk_path_.md)

The Salt API provides a programmatic interface to the Salt Master. If enabled, it presents another attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in API](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_in_api.md)

Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the API verifies user identity or controls access to different API functions. This can allow unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads via API Calls](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads_via_api_calls.md)

Attackers craft malicious input that, when processed by the API, leads to unintended and harmful actions, such as executing arbitrary commands on managed systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Salt Minion(s) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_salt_minion_s___critical_node_.md)

Gaining control over one or more Salt Minions allows attackers to directly interact with the systems they manage. This can be a stepping stone to further attacks or directly impact the target application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Salt Minion Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_salt_minion_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

Similar to the Master, Minions can have vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known CVEs on Minion (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cves_on_minion__high-risk_path_.md)

Identify and Exploit Unpatched Vulnerabilities on Minion: Attackers target known vulnerabilities in the Salt Minion software that have not been patched, potentially leading to remote code execution on the Minion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Minion Authentication Weaknesses (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_minion_authentication_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

This focuses on weaknesses in how Minions authenticate to the Master.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal/Compromise Minion Keys (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/stealcompromise_minion_keys__high-risk_path_.md)

Access Stored Keys on Master or Minion: Attackers attempt to gain access to the cryptographic keys used by Minions to authenticate to the Master. If these keys are compromised (e.g., through filesystem access on the Master or Minion), the attacker can impersonate the Minion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Applications Managed by Salt (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_applications_managed_by_salt__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage Salt's management capabilities to exploit vulnerabilities in the applications it manages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Salt to Deploy Exploits to Vulnerable Applications](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_salt_to_deploy_exploits_to_vulnerable_applications.md)

Once the attacker has control over the Salt infrastructure (Master or Minion), they can use Salt's deployment capabilities to push exploits to vulnerable applications running on managed systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use Salt to Modify Application Configurations for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/use_salt_to_modify_application_configurations_for_malicious_purposes.md)

Attackers can use Salt to alter the configuration of managed applications in a way that introduces vulnerabilities, grants unauthorized access, or disrupts functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Custom Salt Modules/States (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_custom_salt_modulesstates__high-risk_path_.md)

Compromise Development Environment or Source Control: If the development environment where custom Salt modules and states are created is compromised, attackers can inject malicious code into these components. When these compromised modules or states are deployed by Salt, the malicious code will be executed on the managed systems. This can have a widespread and significant impact.
