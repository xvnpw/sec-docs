# Threat Model Analysis for saltstack/salt

## Threat: [Master Key Compromise](./threats/master_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Salt Master's private key file. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities on the master server, social engineering, or insider threats. With the master key, the attacker can impersonate the master and send malicious commands to all connected minions.

**Impact:** Complete control over all managed minions, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, exfiltrate data, and disrupt services across the entire infrastructure. This is a catastrophic failure.

**Affected Component:** Salt Master's key file (`/etc/salt/pki/master/master.pem`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the master server with strong access controls and regular security patching.
*   Implement strict file permissions on the master key file, limiting access to the `salt` user and root.
*   Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) for storing the master key.
*   Implement key rotation policies.
*   Monitor access to the master key file.

## Threat: [Master Process Exploitation](./threats/master_process_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `salt-master` process itself. This could involve exploiting network-exposed services or vulnerabilities in the Salt Master's code. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the master server.

**Impact:** Full control over the Salt Master server, potentially leading to master key compromise and subsequent control over all minions. This can also lead to denial of service against the master.

**Affected Component:** `salt-master` process.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Salt Master software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Harden the master server operating system.
*   Implement network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to the master's ports.
*   Regularly audit the master server's configuration and logs.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Master Interface (API/Web UI)](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_master_interface__apiweb_ui_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Salt Master's API (e.g., via the REST API or ZeroMQ) or the web UI (if enabled). This could be through weak credentials, brute-force attacks, or exploiting authentication vulnerabilities within Salt's API or web UI components. Once authenticated, the attacker can perform actions based on their granted permissions.

**Impact:** Depending on the attacker's permissions, they could manage minions, deploy states, retrieve sensitive information, or disrupt operations.

**Affected Component:** Salt API, Master's web UI (if enabled).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for the Salt API (e.g., using tokens, external authentication providers).
*   Implement robust authorization controls (ACLs) to restrict access to specific functions and targets.
*   Secure the web UI with strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
*   Restrict network access to the API and web UI to authorized clients.
*   Regularly audit API access logs.

## Threat: [Minion Key Compromise](./threats/minion_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Salt Minion's private key file. This could happen through exploiting vulnerabilities on the minion server, insecure storage, or insider threats. With a compromised minion key, the attacker can impersonate that minion and potentially execute commands on the master or other minions if trust relationships exist.

**Impact:** Ability to execute commands on the master as the compromised minion, potentially leading to further compromise of the infrastructure. The attacker can also disrupt services on the compromised minion.

**Affected Component:** Salt Minion's key file (`/etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pem`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure minion servers with strong access controls and regular security patching.
*   Implement strict file permissions on the minion key file, limiting access to the `salt` user and root.
*   Secure the minion provisioning process to prevent key leakage.
*   Implement key rotation policies for minions.
*   Monitor minion authentication attempts.

## Threat: [Minion Process Exploitation](./threats/minion_process_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `salt-minion` process itself. This could involve exploiting network-exposed services or vulnerabilities in the Salt Minion's code. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the minion server.

**Impact:** Full control over the compromised minion server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and lateral movement within the network.

**Affected Component:** `salt-minion` process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Salt Minion software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Harden the minion server operating system.
*   Implement network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to the minion's ports.
*   Regularly audit the minion server's configuration and logs.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the Salt Master and minions. This could be achieved through network sniffing or ARP spoofing. The attacker can then eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged, such as credentials or configuration details, or even inject malicious commands.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, ability to execute unauthorized commands on minions, and potential disruption of SaltStack operations.

**Affected Component:** ZeroMQ communication layer between Master and Minions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable encryption for communication between the master and minions (e.g., using `eauth`).
*   Ensure a secure network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access and interception.
*   Implement mutual authentication between the master and minions.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Execution Modules](./threats/command_injection_via_execution_modules.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input to an execution module that is not properly sanitized. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands that are then executed on the target minion with the privileges of the `salt-minion` process.

**Impact:** Full control over the compromised minion, allowing for arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Specific execution modules (both built-in and custom).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize all input received by execution modules, especially when interacting with the operating system.
*   Avoid using shell commands within execution modules where possible; use Python libraries instead.
*   Implement strict code review processes for custom execution modules.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing execution modules.

## Threat: [Malicious State Files](./threats/malicious_state_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to state files (either directly or through a compromised system) modifies existing state files or introduces new ones containing malicious configurations. When these states are applied, they can compromise the targeted minions.

**Impact:** System compromise, data manipulation, installation of malware, and denial of service on managed minions.

**Affected Component:** Salt State system, state files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls on state file repositories.
*   Use version control for state files to track changes and enable rollback.
*   Implement code review processes for all changes to state files.
*   Consider using a separate, more secure system for managing and deploying state files.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Pillar Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_pillar_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Salt Pillar. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in the Pillar backend, compromising the master server, or through insufficient access controls within Salt's Pillar system.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and other secrets, potentially leading to the compromise of other systems and services.

**Affected Component:** Salt Pillar system, Pillar backends.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls on Pillar data, restricting access to only authorized users and minions.
*   Use secure Pillar backends that offer encryption at rest.
*   Encrypt sensitive data within Pillar using Salt's built-in encryption features or external secret management tools.
*   Regularly audit access to Pillar data.

## Threat: [Salt API Authentication Bypass](./threats/salt_api_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Salt API's authentication mechanism, allowing them to bypass authentication and execute API calls without proper credentials.

**Impact:** Ability to manage minions, execute arbitrary commands, and retrieve sensitive information through the API without authorization.

**Affected Component:** Salt API authentication mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Salt Master software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Implement strong and well-tested authentication mechanisms for the Salt API.
*   Regularly audit the security of the Salt API endpoints.
*   Consider using external authentication providers for the API.
