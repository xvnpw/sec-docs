# Attack Surface Analysis for saltstack/salt

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Salt Master API](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_salt_master_api.md)

*   **Description**: The Salt Master's API (e.g., REST API, ClearFuncs) is exposed without requiring authentication.
    *   **How Salt Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Salt provides options to enable APIs for external interaction. If these are enabled without proper authentication mechanisms, they become direct entry points for attackers.
    *   **Example**: An attacker discovers an open port for the Salt REST API and can directly send commands to the master without providing any credentials.
    *   **Impact**: **Critical**. Attackers can gain full control over the Salt Master, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on all managed minions, steal sensitive data, or disrupt operations.
    *   **Risk Severity**: **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   Enable Authentication: Always enable authentication for the Salt Master API. Use strong authentication mechanisms like eauth (external authentication modules), PAM, or client certificates.
        *   Implement Authorization: Configure proper authorization rules to restrict which users or systems can access specific API endpoints and perform certain actions.
        *   Network Segmentation: Restrict network access to the Salt Master API to only authorized networks or systems. Use firewalls to block unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [Salt Master Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/salt_master_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description**: The master key, used to encrypt communication between the master and minions, is compromised.
    *   **How Salt Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Salt relies on this shared secret for secure communication. If this key is exposed, the entire security model collapses.
    *   **Example**: An attacker gains access to the Salt Master's filesystem and retrieves the master key file.
    *   **Impact**: **Critical**. An attacker with the master key can impersonate the master, send malicious commands to minions, decrypt sensitive data, and potentially gain complete control over the entire Salt infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity**: **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   Secure Key Storage: Store the master key securely with appropriate file system permissions (restrict access to the `salt` user). Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) for enhanced protection.
        *   Regular Key Rotation: Implement a process for regularly rotating the master key. This limits the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Limit access to the Salt Master server and the key file to only necessary personnel.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious State or Pillar Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_state_or_pillar_data_injection.md)

*   **Description**: An attacker manages to inject malicious code or configurations into Salt states or pillar data.
    *   **How Salt Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Salt executes states and uses pillar data to configure minions. If this data is compromised, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Example**: An attacker compromises an external pillar source (e.g., a Git repository) and injects malicious commands into a state file. When this state is applied to a minion, the malicious code is executed.
    *   **Impact**: **High**. Attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on minions, modify system configurations, install malware, or steal data.
    *   **Risk Severity**: **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   Secure Pillar Sources: Secure the sources of pillar data. Use strong authentication and authorization for accessing pillar repositories or APIs.
        *   Input Validation: Implement validation and sanitization of pillar data before it's used in states.
        *   Code Review: Regularly review Salt state files for potential vulnerabilities or malicious code.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege for States: Design states with the principle of least privilege in mind, limiting the actions performed by each state.

## Attack Surface: [Minion Key Compromise and Rogue Minions](./attack_surfaces/minion_key_compromise_and_rogue_minions.md)

*   **Description**: Minion keys are compromised, or attackers register rogue minions to the Salt Master.
    *   **How Salt Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Salt relies on key exchange for authentication between the master and minions. If minion keys are compromised, attackers can impersonate legitimate minions. If auto-acceptance is enabled or the key acceptance process is weak, rogue minions can join the infrastructure.
    *   **Example**: An attacker gains access to a minion's key file or exploits a vulnerability in the key acceptance process to register a malicious minion.
    *   **Impact**: **High**. Attackers can execute commands on legitimate minions by impersonating them or use rogue minions to launch attacks against other systems within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity**: **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   Secure Key Storage on Minions: Protect minion key files with appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Disable Auto-Acceptance: Never use the `auto_accept: True` setting in production environments.
        *   Manual Key Acceptance and Verification: Implement a secure process for manually accepting and verifying minion keys. Verify the fingerprint of the key before acceptance.
        *   Key Revocation: Have a process in place to revoke compromised minion keys.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Salt Modules (Master and Minion)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_salt_modules__master_and_minion_.md)

*   **Description**: Security vulnerabilities exist in the Salt Master or Minion modules (both core and external).
    *   **How Salt Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Salt's functionality is extended through modules. Bugs or security flaws in these modules can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Example**: A vulnerability in a specific Salt module allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the master or a minion by crafting a specific function call.
    *   **Impact**: **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability). Can lead to arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity**: **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   Keep Salt Updated: Regularly update SaltStack to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor Security Advisories: Subscribe to SaltStack security advisories and promptly apply patches.
        *   Review External Modules: If using external modules, carefully review their code and ensure they are from trusted sources.
        *   Disable Unnecessary Modules: Disable any Salt modules that are not actively being used to reduce the attack surface.
