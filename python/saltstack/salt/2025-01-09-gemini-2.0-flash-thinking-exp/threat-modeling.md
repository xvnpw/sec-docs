# Threat Model Analysis for saltstack/salt

## Threat: [Compromised Master Key](./threats/compromised_master_key.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Master Key
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Salt Master's private key. This allows them to impersonate the Master, sending malicious commands to all managed minions. They could install malware, exfiltrate data, or disrupt services across the entire infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the managed infrastructure, data breaches, service outages, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Salt Master process, authentication system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls on the Master server.
        *   Securely store and manage the Master key, using hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management systems if possible.
        *   Regularly rotate the Master key.
        *   Restrict network access to the Master to only authorized systems.
        *   Monitor access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Minion Key Theft and Impersonation](./threats/minion_key_theft_and_impersonation.md)

*   **Threat:** Minion Key Theft and Impersonation
    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a minion's private key. This allows them to impersonate that minion and potentially execute commands on the Master or other minions, depending on configured permissions and targeting. They could use this access to escalate privileges or pivot to other systems.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to specific systems, potential lateral movement within the network, data breaches from compromised minions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Minion process, authentication system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage minion keys.
        *   Implement proper access controls and authorization policies on the Master to limit the impact of a compromised minion.
        *   Consider using key rotation for minions.
        *   Monitor minion activity for unusual commands or behavior.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Salt Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_salt_communication.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Salt Communication
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the Salt Master and minions. Without proper encryption and authentication, they could eavesdrop on sensitive data (credentials, configuration details) or even inject malicious commands.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential execution of unauthorized commands, compromise of Master or minions.
    *   **Affected Component:** ZeroMQ transport, Salt's internal communication protocol.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `transport` setting in Salt configuration is set to `tcp` with encryption enabled (e.g., `aes`).
        *   Verify the integrity of the Salt installation to prevent malicious modifications.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the attacker's ability to intercept traffic.

## Threat: [Exploiting Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Salt Modules](./threats/exploiting_command_injection_vulnerabilities_in_salt_modules.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Salt Modules
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages vulnerabilities in Salt modules (either core or custom) that allow them to inject arbitrary commands that are executed on the Master or minions with the privileges of the Salt process. This could be achieved through crafted arguments or input data.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Master or minions, system compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific Salt modules (e.g., `cmd.run`, custom modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update SaltStack to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Thoroughly audit and sanitize input in custom Salt modules.
        *   Use secure coding practices when developing custom modules.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization in state files where user-provided data is used in commands.
        *   Consider using modules with built-in security features or safer alternatives where available.

## Threat: [Malicious State File Execution](./threats/malicious_state_file_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious State File Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to state files (either directly on the Master or through a compromised source control system) can create or modify state files to execute malicious commands or configurations on minions.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread system compromise, data destruction, service disruption across managed infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** State system, Salt Master file system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on the Salt Master's file system, especially the state file directory.
        *   Use a version control system for managing state files and implement code review processes.
        *   Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of state files before execution (e.g., signing).
        *   Regularly audit state files for suspicious or unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [Pillar Data Injection](./threats/pillar_data_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Pillar Data Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the source of pillar data (e.g., an external data store) and injects malicious data. This data can then be used by state files to configure minions in a harmful way, potentially leading to command execution or security misconfigurations.
    *   **Impact:** Configuration of minions with vulnerabilities, potential execution of malicious code, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Pillar system, external pillar sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the sources of pillar data with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for pillar data before it is used in state files.
        *   Regularly audit pillar data for unexpected or malicious content.
        *   Consider using encrypted communication channels for retrieving pillar data from external sources.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Modules, Returners, or Renderers](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_modules__returners__or_renderers.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Modules, Returners, or Renderers
    *   **Description:** Custom extensions to SaltStack (modules, returners, renderers) might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, path traversal, insecure data handling) that an attacker can exploit.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Master or minions, exposure of sensitive data, compromise of external systems if returners are affected.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom modules, custom returners, custom renderers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom extensions.
        *   Conduct thorough security testing and code reviews of custom extensions.
        *   Keep dependencies of custom extensions up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within custom extensions.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in State or Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_state_or_configuration_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in State or Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** Developers or administrators inadvertently store sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) directly in state files, pillar data, or Salt configuration files without proper encryption or secure storage mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of credentials and other sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** State files, pillar data, Salt configuration files (master.conf, minion.conf).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in state or configuration files.
        *   Use Salt's built-in features for managing secrets securely (e.g., the `secret` module, external secret lookups).
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
        *   Implement access controls on configuration files to restrict who can view or modify them.
