## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via SaltStack **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_saltstack__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Salt Master **[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_salt_master__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**1. Compromise Salt Master [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* **Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Salt Master Process [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Salt Master daemon (salt-master) that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This could involve vulnerabilities in how Salt handles specific data, arguments, or network requests.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Salt Master, granting the attacker full control over the Salt infrastructure and the ability to manage all minions and deploy malicious payloads.

* **Phishing/Social Engineering Salt Administrator [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Deceiving a Salt administrator into revealing their credentials (username and password, API keys, etc.). This can be done through targeted emails, fake login pages, or impersonating trusted individuals.
    * **Impact:** Once the attacker has valid administrator credentials, they can directly access and control the Salt Master, bypassing other security measures.

* **Exploit Web Application Vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) in Salt Master Web Interface:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If SaltGUI or a custom web interface is enabled, exploiting common web application vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to execute malicious scripts in the administrator's browser or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to perform unauthorized actions on the Salt Master.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or the ability to execute Salt commands through the web interface.

* **Execute Malicious Salt States/Modules [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Once authenticated (through compromised credentials or other means), an attacker can create and execute malicious Salt states or modules that perform actions like installing backdoors, modifying configurations, or exfiltrating data on managed minions.
    * **Impact:** Allows the attacker to directly compromise managed systems and potentially the applications they host.

* **Deploy Malicious Packages/Software via Salt [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Using Salt's package management capabilities to deploy compromised or malicious software packages to managed minions.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to widespread compromise of managed systems, installation of malware, or disruption of services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Salt Minion(s) Hosting Application Components **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_salt_minion_s__hosting_application_components__high-risk_path_.md)

**2. Compromise Salt Minion(s) Hosting Application Components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* **Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Salt Minion Process:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Similar to the Master RCE, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Salt Minion daemon (salt-minion) to execute arbitrary commands on the Minion server.
    * **Impact:** Allows the attacker to gain control over the specific Minion, potentially accessing application data, modifying configurations, or disrupting the application.

* **Retrieve Minion Key from Compromised Master:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the Salt Master is compromised, the attacker can retrieve the authentication keys for individual Minions, allowing them to impersonate the Master and control those Minions.
    * **Impact:** Grants control over the targeted Minion, enabling malicious actions.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application Running on Minion [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Once a Minion is compromised (through Salt vulnerabilities or other means), the attacker can leverage that access to exploit vulnerabilities in the application running on that Minion. This is not a direct Salt vulnerability but a consequence of compromising the host.
    * **Impact:** Direct compromise of the application, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other application-specific attacks.

* **Execute Malicious Salt States/Modules (Pushed from Compromised Master):**
    * **Attack Vector:** After compromising the Salt Master, the attacker can push malicious Salt states or modules to specific Minions, instructing them to perform malicious actions.
    * **Impact:** Allows the attacker to control the Minion and potentially the application it hosts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Salt States/Modules in Transit (after MITM) **[CRITICAL]**](./attack_tree_paths/modify_salt_statesmodules_in_transit__after_mitm___critical_.md)

**3. Modify Salt States/Modules in Transit (after MITM) [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the communication channel between the Salt Master and Minions, decrypting the traffic (if encryption is weak or keys are compromised), and then modifying the Salt states or modules being transmitted before they reach the Minion.
* **Impact:** Allows the attacker to inject malicious commands or configurations into the Minion, leading to compromise. This is a highly impactful but often more complex attack.
