### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential XSS vulnerability due to insufficient SVG Sanitization

- **Description:**
    The application allows uploading SVG files and attempts to sanitize them to prevent XSS attacks. However, the sanitization process might be insufficient and could be bypassed by crafted SVG files containing malicious code. An attacker could upload a specially crafted SVG file that bypasses the sanitization and executes Javascript code in the victim's browser when the SVG file is viewed or processed by the application.

- **Impact:**
    Cross-site scripting (XSS). If an attacker successfully uploads a malicious SVG, they could potentially execute arbitrary Javascript code in the browsers of users who view or interact with the uploaded file. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    SVG files are sanitized using custom logic within the `sanitize_svg` function in `filer/validation.py`. The `validate_svg` function in the same file performs basic validation by checking for the presence of `<script>` tags, `javascript:` directives, and event handlers like `onclick`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Strengthen SVG sanitization by replacing the custom logic with a robust and actively maintained library specifically designed for SVG sanitization (e.g., `defusedxml`, `svgcleaner`, or a similar dedicated library). The current custom logic might be easily bypassed.
    - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to further mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if sanitization fails.
    - Consider disabling SVG uploads entirely if the risk outweighs the benefit.
    - Regularly review and update the sanitization and validation logic, or the chosen sanitization library, to address new XSS bypass techniques.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must allow uploading SVG files as `image/svg+xml` mime type.
    - The application must serve or process uploaded SVG files in a way that allows SVG rendering and Javascript execution (e.g., displaying them in the browser, using them in image processing that triggers rendering).
    - The SVG sanitization and validation logic must be vulnerable to bypass.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File Upload and Validation:** When a user uploads a file through the admin interface, specifically using the AJAX upload functionality (e.g., drag and drop upload in folder directory listing), the `ajax_upload` function in `filer/admin/clipboardadmin.py` is invoked.
    ```python
    # filer/admin/clipboardadmin.py
    @csrf_exempt
    def ajax_upload(request, folder_id=None):
        # ... permission checks ...

        if len(request.FILES) == 1:
            # don't check if request is ajax or not, just grab the file
            upload, filename, is_raw, mime_type = handle_request_files_upload(request)
        else:
            # else process the request as usual
            upload, filename, is_raw, mime_type = handle_upload(request)
        # ... file type detection ...
        uploadform = FileForm({'original_filename': filename, 'owner': request.user.pk},
                              {'file': upload})
        uploadform.request = request
        uploadform.instance.mime_type = mime_type
        if uploadform.is_valid():
            try:
                validate_upload(filename, upload, request.user, mime_type) # SVG validation and sanitization is called here
                file_obj = uploadform.save(commit=False)
                # ...
    ```
    2. **`validate_upload` Function:** Inside `ajax_upload`, the `validate_upload` function from `filer/validation.py` is called. This function is responsible for validating and sanitizing the uploaded file based on its mime type. For `image/svg+xml`, it calls `validate_svg` and `sanitize_svg`.
    ```python
    # filer/validation.py
    def validate_upload(file_name: str, file: typing.IO, owner: User, mime_type: str) -> None:
        # ...
        if mime_type == 'image/svg+xml':
            validate_svg(file_name=file_name, file=file, owner=owner, mime_type=mime_type)
            sanitize_svg(file_name=file_name, file=file, owner=owner, mime_type=mime_type)
            return
        # ...
    ```
    3. **`validate_svg` Function:** This function, as previously described, performs a basic check for potential XSS vectors by looking for specific byte strings.
    ```python
    # filer/validation.py
    TRIGGER_XSS_THREAD = (
        # ... (XSS trigger byte strings) ...
        b"<script",
        b"javascript:",
    )

    def validate_svg(file_name: str, file: typing.IO, owner: User, mime_type: str) -> None:
        """SVG files must not contain script tags or javascript hrefs.
        This might be too strict but avoids parsing the xml"""
        content = file.read().lower()
        if any(map(lambda x: x in content, TRIGGER_XSS_THREAD)):
            # If any element of TRIGGER_XSS_THREAD is found in file, raise FileValidationError
            raise FileValidationError(
                _('File "{file_name}": Rejected due to potential cross site scripting vulnerability')
                .format(file_name=file_name)
            )
    ```
    4. **`sanitize_svg` Function:** This function attempts to sanitize SVG files by re-rendering them using `svglib` and `reportlab`.
    ```python
    # filer/validation.py
    def sanitize_svg(file_name: str, file: typing.IO, owner: User, mime_type: str) -> None:
        from easy_thumbnails.VIL.Image import Image
        from reportlab.graphics import renderSVG
        from svglib.svglib import svg2rlg
        drawing = svg2rlg(file)
        if not drawing:
            raise FileValidationError(
                _('File "{file_name}": SVG file format not recognized')
                .format(file_name=file_name)
            )
        image = Image(size=(drawing.width, drawing.height))
        renderSVG.draw(drawing, image.canvas)
        xml = image.canvas.svg.toxml(encoding="UTF-8")  # Removes non-graphic nodes ->  sanitation
        file.seek(0)  # Rewind file
        file.write(xml)  # write to binary file with utf-8 encoding
    ```
    5. **Vulnerability:** The analysis remains the same. The rudimentary checks in `validate_svg` and the re-rendering approach in `sanitize_svg` are likely insufficient to prevent sophisticated SVG-based XSS attacks. Attackers can use various bypass techniques to circumvent these sanitization attempts.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Log in to the admin panel of the django-filer application as a user with file upload permissions.
    2. Create a new folder or navigate to an existing folder where file uploads are allowed.
    3. Craft a malicious SVG file that attempts to bypass the `validate_svg` and `sanitize_svg` sanitization. Example of a malicious SVG using case variation and event handler obfuscation to bypass `validate_svg`:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
        <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
        <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <svg onload="JAVASCRIPT:alert('XSS Vulnerability')"/>
          <rect width="300" height="100" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)"/>
        </svg>
        ```
    4. Upload the crafted malicious SVG file through the file upload interface, preferably using drag and drop upload in the folder directory listing in admin panel to trigger `ajax_upload` view.
    5. After successful upload, attempt to view or process the uploaded SVG file. This might involve viewing the file in the admin panel's file browser or embedding the SVG file into a page managed by django-filer (if that functionality is available).
    6. Observe if the Javascript code embedded in the SVG file is executed in the browser. If an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability" appears, it indicates a successful XSS vulnerability.
