- **Vulnerability Name:** Folder Permission Cache Key Collision  
  - **Description:**  
    The folder permission caching code uses a cache key that is generated using only the permission name (for example, `"filer:perm:can_read"`) rather than a key unique to each user. As a result, when cache entries are updated (or even “polluted”) by one user, the cached permission dictionary becomes shared among multiple users.  
    *Step by step, an attacker could:*  
    1. Log in with a low‑privileged account that can trigger folder operations which update the permission cache.  
    2. Trigger an operation that causes the cache update helper to write a list of folder IDs for a permission (e.g. `"filer:perm:can_read"`)—this list can be manipulated to include additional (restricted) folder IDs.  
    3. Cause a subsequent permission check (using the same key) to use the attacker‑controlled list, thereby erroneously granting access.  
  - **Impact:**  
    Unauthorized access to restricted folders and sensitive files. In the worst case, it may lead to privilege escalation and disclosure of confidential data.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    Although a developer comment in `filer/cache.py` suggests that the cache key should include the user ID, the production code still uses:  
    ```python
    def get_folder_perm_cache_key(user, permission):
        return f"filer:perm:{permission}"
    ```  
    No runtime controls prevent a low‑privileged user from updating the shared cache.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    The cache key should incorporate the user’s identity (e.g. user ID) so that entries remain isolated per user. Additional safeguards on cache update operations would further mitigate the risk.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The attacker must be authenticated (even with minimal privileges) and able to trigger folder permission–updating operations.  
    - The caching backend is shared among sessions so that all users rely on the same cache key.  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In **`filer/cache.py`**, the key is generated as:  
      ```python
      def get_folder_perm_cache_key(user, permission):
          return f"filer:perm:{permission}"
      ```  
      The key depends solely on the permission name.  
    - Both the permission check and cache update functions use this key. A malicious update by one user overwrites the same cache entry used by others.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Setup:**  
       - Create two test accounts: a low‑privileged “attacker” and a victim (or another user whose access rights are normally restricted).  
    2. **Manipulation:**  
       - Log in as the attacker and perform an operation (or directly invoke the helper) that updates the cache via  
         `update_folder_permission_cache(user, "can_read", id_list)`, replacing or merging the proper folder IDs with extra IDs.  
    3. **Verification:**  
       - Initiate a permission check (via `get_folder_permission_cache(user, "can_read")`) from either account and verify that the returned folder IDs include the attacker‑supplied, unauthorized IDs.  
       - In an integration test, attempt to list or access folders that should normally be restricted and observe that access is improperly granted.  
    4. **Expected Result:**  
       - The permission check returns the manipulated folder IDs, granting unauthorized access. With a unique key per user, the attack would fail.

- **Vulnerability Name:** CSRF Protection Bypass on AJAX File Upload Endpoint  
  - **Description:**  
    The AJAX file upload endpoint (implemented in the `ajax_upload` view in `/code/filer/admin/clipboardadmin.py`) is decorated with `@csrf_exempt`, which bypasses Django’s built‑in CSRF protection.  
    *Step by step, an attacker could:*  
    1. Craft a malicious webpage that automatically submits a POST request (with a file payload in the `FILES` field) to the AJAX upload endpoint (for example, `/admin/filer/operations/upload/no_folder/` or `/admin/filer/operations/upload/<folder_id>/`).  
    2. Lure an authenticated user (with the `filer.add_file` permission) to visit this malicious page.  
    3. The user’s browser, carrying valid session cookies, sends the POST request without a CSRF token, causing the file upload to occur without proper verification.  
  - **Impact:**  
    The attacker can force an authenticated user to upload arbitrary files. Malicious files uploaded to the system could serve as a base for further exploitation, such as hosting malware or enabling stored cross‑site scripting (XSS).  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The view verifies that the requesting user has the required permission (`filer.add_file`) and that the target folder allows adding children (`folder.has_add_children_permission(request)`).  
    - These permission checks limit the functionality to authorized users; however, they do not compensate for the missing CSRF protection.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Enforce CSRF token validation on the AJAX endpoint. Either remove the `@csrf_exempt` decorator or integrate a secure AJAX file upload mechanism that validates a CSRF token with each request.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - An attacker must be able to lure an authenticated user (with file‑upload privileges) to a phishing or malicious site.  
    - The AJAX upload endpoint must be publicly reachable within the context of the authenticated session.  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In **`/code/filer/admin/clipboardadmin.py`**, the view is defined as:  
      ```python
      @csrf_exempt
      def ajax_upload(request, folder_id=None):
          ...
      ```  
      This decorator removes all CSRF checks.  
    - After validating file‑upload permissions, the view processes the file (using helpers like `handle_request_files_upload(request)`). No CSRF token is validated, leaving the endpoint open to cross-site forgery.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Setup:**  
       - Use a test account with the `filer.add_file` permission and log in via a browser.  
    2. **Attack:**  
       - Host an external HTML page that automatically submits a POST request to the AJAX file upload endpoint (e.g., `https://<your-domain>/admin/filer/operations/upload/no_folder/`) with a valid file payload. The request intentionally omits any CSRF token.  
    3. **Execution:**  
       - Have the authenticated user (or a simulated environment with valid session cookies) visit the malicious page.  
    4. **Verification:**  
       - Check the file storage or administrative logs to confirm that a new file entry has been created despite the missing CSRF token.  
    5. **Expected Result:**  
       - The file upload completes successfully despite the absence of a valid CSRF token, confirming that the endpoint is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Overwrite via Unvalidated Filename in MultiStorageFileField  
  - **Description:**  
    In `/code/filer/fields/multistorage_file.py`, the custom field `MultiStorageFileField` implements a `to_python` method designed to convert file-upload input provided as a list (with two elements, where the first element is the filename and the second is a base64‑encoded payload). This method takes the provided filename and passes it directly to the storage backend without any sanitization or validation.  
    *Step by step, an attacker could:*  
    1. Exploit the previously identified CSRF Protection Bypass on the AJAX file upload endpoint (or any other file upload mechanism) to submit a malicious file‑upload request.  
    2. Instead of supplying a conventional file object, supply a specially crafted list payload such as:  
       - `[ "../../malicious.txt", "<base64_encoded_payload>" ]`  
       where `"../../malicious.txt"` includes directory traversal sequences designed to escape the intended upload directory.  
    3. The `to_python` method decodes the payload and, without checking the filename, calls:  
       ```python
       if self.storage.exists(filename):
           self.storage.delete(filename)
       self.storage.save(filename, ContentFile(payload))
       ```  
       thereby writing the file to an arbitrary location within the storage backend.  
  - **Impact:**  
    - An attacker may overwrite arbitrary files in the media storage. Depending on the storage configuration and file location, this could lead to a compromise of system integrity or even remote code execution if, for example, a critical file is overwritten.  
    - Even if remote code execution is not immediately achievable, unauthorized file overwrite can be used for further escalation and damage to system integrity.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The method verifies that the input is a list of exactly two elements, but it performs no validation or sanitization on the `filename` element.  
    - It relies on the underlying storage backend for file saving but does not ensure that the storage restricts path traversal or malicious path injections.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Implement strict sanitization and validation on the filename to prevent directory traversal (e.g. using Django’s `get_valid_filename`) and ensure that the file is saved only within a designated safe directory.  
    - Enforce additional checks to verify that the file upload input conforms to the expected format and filename constraints.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The attacker must be able to trigger the file upload process (for example, via the CSRF‑exempt AJAX file upload endpoint).  
    - The storage backend must not independently sanitize or reject filenames containing path traversal patterns.  
    - The file field must accept input in the unvalidated list format that bypasses the usual file object handling.  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In **`/code/filer/fields/multistorage_file.py`**, the `to_python` method is implemented as follows:
      ```python
      def to_python(self, value):
          if isinstance(value, list) and len(value) == 2 and isinstance(value[0], str):
              filename, payload = value
              try:
                  payload = base64.b64decode(payload)
              except TypeError:
                  pass
              else:
                  if self.storage.exists(filename):
                      self.storage.delete(filename)
                  self.storage.save(filename, ContentFile(payload))
                  return filename
          return value
      ```
    - The filename (first element of the list) is used directly in the calls to `self.storage.exists(filename)` and `self.storage.save(filename, ContentFile(payload))` without checking for malicious content (such as directory traversal sequences).  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Setup:**  
       - Ensure that the application (for example, via the AJAX file upload endpoint) is running with the CSRF bypass enabled and that the storage backend is configured to allow writes (preferably in a controlled test environment).  
    2. **Attack:**  
       - Construct a POST request where the file payload is supplied as a list:  
         - `["../../malicious.txt", "<base64_encoded_payload>"]`  
         - Ensure that `<base64_encoded_payload>` is a valid base64 encoding of test file content.  
    3. **Execution:**  
       - Submit the crafted request using an external tool (such as curl or Burp Suite) while the request is made under an authenticated session (courtesy of the CSRF bypass).  
    4. **Verification:**  
       - Check the file storage to determine whether a file named with directory traversal sequences (or its sanitized equivalent, if any) has been created or overwritten in an unintended location.  
       - Confirm that the contents of the file match the supplied payload.  
    5. **Expected Result:**  
       - Without proper sanitization, the storage backend will save the file using the attacker‑supplied filename. With appropriate filename validation, the malicious filename should be rejected or sanitized, thereby preventing the arbitrary file overwrite.
