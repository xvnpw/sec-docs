Based on your instructions, the vulnerability "Tenant Data Leakage via Insecure Schema Cloning" should be included in the updated list because it meets the inclusion criteria and does not fall under the exclusion criteria.

Here is the vulnerability description in markdown format as requested:

### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Tenant Data Leakage via Insecure Schema Cloning

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to create a new tenant (if tenant creation is publicly accessible or after compromising an admin account).
    2. During tenant creation, the system clones an existing schema (e.g., 'empty' schema as seen in `run_tests.sh`) to initialize the new tenant's schema.
    3. If the 'empty' schema contains any sensitive data, or if the cloning process does not properly sanitize or isolate data, the new tenant schema will inherit this data.
    4. Subsequently, users of the newly created tenant can access and potentially exploit this leaked data, which may belong to the template tenant or even the public schema if the template schema was not properly isolated.

* Impact:
    - High: Sensitive data from a template schema (intended to be empty or contain only baseline configurations) or even the public schema can be leaked into newly created tenant schemas. This can lead to unauthorized access to confidential information, privacy violations, and potential compliance issues.
    - Depending on the nature of the leaked data, it could include personally identifiable information (PII), application secrets, or other critical business data.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project provides a `clone_schema` function in `django_tenants/clone.py` which is used to copy schema structure and optionally data.
    - The `run_tests.sh` script uses `clone_tenant` management command with `--clone_from empty --clone_tenant_fields False` options, suggesting an awareness of potential data leakage when cloning tenant specific fields, but not data leakage from the template schema itself.
    - The `clone_tenant` management command provides `--clone_tenant_fields False` option to avoid cloning tenant-specific fields.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Secure Template Schema Isolation:** The project lacks a clear mechanism to ensure that template schemas used for cloning (like 'empty') are genuinely empty of sensitive data and properly isolated. Developers using django-tenants are responsible for creating and maintaining secure template schemas, but the framework itself doesn't enforce this.
    - **Data Sanitization during Cloning:** The `clone_schema` function, by design, can copy data from the template schema. Even when the intention is to clone only the schema structure, there's no explicit step within the framework to sanitize or verify the absence of sensitive data in the template schema before cloning the schema structure. The risk persists that if the template schema is not properly maintained as truly empty, sensitive data will be cloned.
    - **Tenant Creation Access Control:** While not directly related to cloning, if tenant creation is not properly access-controlled (e.g., publicly available without authentication), attackers can more easily exploit this vulnerability by creating numerous tenants and examining the cloned data. The management commands like `create_tenant` and `clone_tenant` should ideally only be accessible to administrators.

* Preconditions:
    - Tenant creation functionality must be available, either publicly or through compromised admin access.
    - The system must be configured to use schema cloning for tenant initialization.
    - A template schema (like 'empty') is used as the source for cloning.
    - The template schema, despite being intended as a template, inadvertently contains sensitive data.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`django_tenants/clone.py` - `clone_schema` function:**
        ```python
        class CloneSchema:
            # ...
            def clone_schema(self, base_schema_name, new_schema_name, set_connection=True):
                # ...
                cursor = connection.cursor()
                # ...
                sql = 'SELECT clone_schema(%(base_schema)s, %(new_schema)s, true, false)' # include_recs=true is used here in example
                cursor.execute(
                    sql,
                    {'base_schema': base_schema_name, 'new_schema': new_schema_name}
                )
                cursor.close()
        ```
        - The `clone_schema` function in `CloneSchema` class utilizes a raw SQL function `clone_schema` (defined within `django_tenants/db/sql/functions/clone_schema.sql`).
        - Critically, the example code in `clone_schema` function itself uses `include_recs=true` as a parameter in the SQL call. This means, by default and as demonstrated in the code, the cloning process includes copying records (data).
        - While the `clone_tenant` management command in `run_tests.sh` uses `--clone_tenant_fields False`, this option is specific to tenant fields and does not prevent the cloning of data from other tables within the template schema because `CloneSchema().clone_schema()` defaults to `include_recs=True`.
        - The SQL function `clone_schema` (within `CLONE_SCHEMA_FUNCTION` in `django_tenants/db/sql/functions.py` and defined in `django_tenants/db/sql/functions/clone_schema.sql`) is designed to copy schema structure, sequences, tables, views, functions, and optionally data based on the `include_recs boolean` parameter.

    2. **`run_tests.sh`:**
        ```bash
        greenprint "Execute clone_tenant"
        PYTHONWARNINGS=d python manage.py clone_tenant \
            --clone_from empty --clone_tenant_fields False \
            --schema_name a-cloned-tenant --name "A cloned tenant" --description "This tenant was created by cloning" \
            --type type1 --domain-domain a-cloned-tenant.example.com --domain-is_primary True
        ```
        - This script demonstrates the usage of `clone_tenant` management command, explicitly setting `--clone_tenant_fields False` to avoid cloning tenant fields. However, it uses 'empty' as the `--clone_from` schema, implying that the developers expect this schema to be genuinely empty. If 'empty' schema is not properly maintained and contains data, this script, and any tenant creation process using cloning, would be vulnerable.

    3. **`django_tenants/management/commands/clone_tenant.py`:**
        ```python
        class Command(TenantCommand):
            help = "Clones a tenant's schema"

            def add_arguments(self, parser):
                super().add_arguments(parser)
                parser.add_argument('--clone_from', required=True, help='Schema name to clone from')
                parser.add_argument('--clone_tenant_fields', action='store_true', dest='clone_tenant_fields',
                                    default=False, help='Clone tenant fields')
                # ...

            def handle_tenant(self, tenant, **options):
                clone_from = options['clone_from']
                clone_tenant_fields = options['clone_tenant_fields']
                verbosity = int(options['verbosity'])

                if schema_exists(tenant.schema_name):
                    raise CommandError("Schema '%s' already exists" % tenant.schema_name)

                clone_schema = CloneSchema()
                clone_schema.clone_schema(clone_from, tenant.schema_name) # include_recs=True is hardcoded in CloneSchema.clone_schema

                if clone_tenant_fields:
                    # Clone tenant fields is not fully implemented and may lead to issues.
                    # It's better to create a new tenant and then clone the schema.
                    # This is left for future implementation.
                    warnings.warn("Cloning tenant fields is not fully implemented and may lead to issues.")
                    # ...
        ```
        - The `clone_tenant` command utilizes `CloneSchema().clone_schema()`. It's crucial to note that `CloneSchema().clone_schema()` in `django_tenants/clone.py` defaults to calling the underlying SQL `clone_schema` function with `include_recs=True`.
        - The `--clone_tenant_fields False` option in the management command only affects the cloning of tenant-specific fields. It does **not** prevent the cloning of data from the template schema itself because `include_recs=True` is hardcoded in `CloneSchema().clone_schema()` and not configurable via the management command. This means that even when using `--clone_tenant_fields False`, all data within the template schema will still be cloned into the new tenant's schema.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a template tenant (e.g., schema name: 'empty') and intentionally insert some sensitive test data into a table within this schema (e.g., a table named 'leaked_data' with a column 'secret_info' and a row containing 'sensitive_value_from_template'). For example, using `dbshell` after setting the schema to 'empty':
          ```sql
          CREATE TABLE leaked_data (secret_info VARCHAR(255));
          INSERT INTO leaked_data (secret_info) VALUES ('sensitive_value_from_template');
          ```
        - Create a new tenant creation endpoint in the application if one doesn't exist, or use an existing admin interface to create tenants. Ensure this endpoint is accessible to an attacker (either publicly or after gaining some level of access). Configure tenant creation to use cloning from the 'empty' schema. If using `clone_tenant` management command directly, ensure you can execute it as an attacker (e.g., via compromised admin access).
    2. **Exploit:**
        - As an attacker, use the tenant creation endpoint or command to create a new tenant (e.g., schema name: 'attacker_tenant'), cloning from the 'empty' schema. When using `clone_tenant` command, use:
          ```bash
          python manage.py clone_tenant --clone_from empty --clone_tenant_fields False --schema_name attacker_tenant --name "Attacker Tenant" --domain-domain attacker-tenant.example.com --domain-is_primary True
          ```
        - Log in to the newly created tenant 'attacker_tenant'.
        - Query the database within the 'attacker_tenant' schema to check for the cloned sensitive data. For example, using `dbshell` after setting the schema to 'attacker_tenant':
          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM leaked_data;
          ```
    3. **Verification:**
        - Verify that the 'leaked_data' table and the row with 'sensitive_value_from_template' from the template schema ('empty') are present in the 'attacker_tenant' schema.
        - If the sensitive data is accessible in the new tenant, the vulnerability is confirmed. The query in step 2.2 should return the 'sensitive_value_from_template'.
