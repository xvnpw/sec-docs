- **Vulnerability Name:** Hard‑coded Django Secret Key
  **Description:**
  The Django settings files (for example, in the tenants’ settings under both the multi‐tenant and test project directories) contain secret keys hard‐coded as plain strings (e.g.,
  `SECRET_KEY = 'as-%*_93v=r5*p_7cu8-%o6b&x^g+q$#*e*fl)k)x0-t=%q0qa'` and a different value in the dts‑test project). An external attacker (or anyone who obtains access to the source code) can use these exposed keys to forge cryptographic signatures, hijack sessions, or tamper with signed data.
  **Impact:**
  - Possibility to forge session cookies and other signed tokens.
  - Risk of privilege escalation, account impersonation, and unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. The secret key is embedded directly in several settings files.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The secret key should be injected from environment variables or an external secrets manager rather than hard‑coded.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The deployed instance uses the provided settings files without overriding the hard-coded SECRET_KEY.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - Several settings files (e.g. in `tenant_multi_types_tutorial/settings.py` and `dts_test_project/dts_test_project/settings.py`) set `SECRET_KEY` to a literal string. No dynamic loading or secret management is applied.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Confirm that the deployed instance is using one of these settings files (for example by checking a misconfigured debug endpoint or source disclosure vulnerability).
  2. Using the known secret key, attempt to forge a session cookie or valid signed token (e.g. for password resets) and submit it with a request.
  3. Verify that the application accepts the forged signature—indicating that the key is being used for critical cryptographic operations.

- **Vulnerability Name:** DEBUG Mode Enabled in Production Settings
  **Description:**
  Multiple settings files (for example in `tenant_tutorial/settings.py` and in `dts_test_project/dts_test_project/settings.py`) set `DEBUG = True`. In a production environment this configuration can cause detailed error pages (stack traces, variable dumps, and internal configuration details) to be displayed when an exception occurs. An attacker could intentionally trigger an error to obtain sensitive internal data.
  **Impact:**
  - Detailed error information disclosure that aids in further exploitation (revealing file paths, settings, database names, etc.).
  - Increases the risk for other attacks by providing internal configuration details.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None; the settings files show a hard‑coded `DEBUG = True`.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - In production, `DEBUG` must be set to `False` (preferably via an environment variable) and error reporting should be appropriately configured.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The instance is deployed with a settings file that has `DEBUG=True` (typically a mis‑configuration for production).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In each relevant settings file, the value of `DEBUG` is set as a literal true value with no conditional override for production.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Force an error (for example, by visiting a deliberately broken URL or triggering an exception in a view).
  2. Verify that the response displays a full debug traceback with sensitive information.
  3. Confirm that this information would enable an attacker to gain insight into the application’s internals.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated User Account Reset via Random Form View
  **Description:**
  The view named `TenantViewRandomForm` (found in both `tenant_type_one_only/views.py` and similarly in `tenant_tutorial/customers/views.py`) uses a form‐processing method that immediately deletes all user accounts using the call `User.objects.all().delete()` before generating random user accounts. Importantly, there is no authentication or authorization check on this view. An attacker (or a victim forced via a CSRF attack) could trigger this endpoint to wipe out all legitimate users and replace them with attacker–controlled random ones.
  **Impact:**
  - Loss of all legitimate user accounts.
  - Potential full account takeover and denial of service for genuine users.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. The view is publicly accessible and does not require any authentication.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Enforce strong authentication (e.g. add a login_required decorator or restrict access via permissions) on sensitive account management views.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The endpoint (e.g. `/sample-random/`) is exposed and an attacker can submit an HTTP POST (possibly via CSRF exploitation if the victim’s credentials are co-opted).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the `form_valid()` method of `TenantViewRandomForm`, the code calls `User.objects.all().delete()` without any check of the user’s privileges or identity.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Simulate a valid POST request to the `/sample-random/` URL (this may require acquiring a valid CSRF token by accessing the GET endpoint first).
  2. Verify that upon successful submission, all existing user records are deleted and new randomly generated user accounts are inserted.
  3. Confirm that this results in loss of legitimate credentials.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  **Description:**
  The view `TenantViewFileUploadCreate` (located in `tenant_type_one_only/views.py` and similarly in `tenant_tutorial/customers/views.py`) is a simple Django CreateView based on the `UploadFile` model. This model uses a `FileField` with an `upload_to` attribute set to store files in the “uploads/” directory, and the view does not enforce any authentication or file‑type/size restrictions. An attacker could use this endpoint to upload a malicious file (for example, a script file) that—if later served directly—could be executed by the web server.
  **Impact:**
  - Allows an attacker to store arbitrary files on the server.
  - In the worst‑case scenario—if the upload directory is served as executable content—this can lead to remote code execution, defacement, or further compromise of the system.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - No custom file type validation or authentication checks are found in the view.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Require user authentication and proper authorization to access file–upload endpoints.
  - Validate the file type, size, and content before storing the file.
  - Store uploaded files outside of web‑accessible directories (or serve them in a non‑executable manner).
  **Preconditions:**
  - The `/upload-file/` endpoint is publicly accessible and the directory “uploads/” is served by the web server.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The `UploadFile` model (in `tenant_type_one_only/models.py`) defines a `FileField` with no extra validators.
  - The CreateView `TenantViewFileUploadCreate` is opened on a public URL (as seen in the URL config), with no authentication added.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Send a multipart POST request to `/upload-file/` with a file having a dangerous extension (e.g., a `.php` or `.py` file) containing malicious code.
  2. After successful upload (verify by checking the database/model), attempt to access the file via its served URL.
  3. Confirm whether the file is served for download or (worse) is executed by the web server.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Default pgAdmin Credentials
  **Description:**
  The Docker Compose configuration (in `docker-compose.yml`) for the pgAdmin service provides default credentials via environment variables. If not overridden by production environment variables, the default email is set to `pgadmin4@pgadmin.org` and the default password to `admin`. An attacker can easily guess these credentials and log in to the pgAdmin interface to gain administrative access to the database.
  **Impact:**
  - Unauthorized access to the database management interface.
  - Potential data theft, modification, or deletion.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The use of environment variable fallbacks (e.g., `${PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL:-pgadmin4@pgadmin.org}`) is present, but the defaults themselves remain weak.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Change the default credentials to strong values via environment variables in production deployments.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The pgAdmin service is deployed on a publicly reachable host/port (e.g., port 5050) without custom credentials.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the `docker-compose.yml` file, pgAdmin is configured with default credentials if no environment variables are specified.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Connect to the pgAdmin web interface using a browser targeting the mapped public port (default 5050).
  2. Attempt to log in using the default credentials (email: `pgadmin4@pgadmin.org`, password: `admin`).
  3. Verify that access is granted and the database administration interface is available.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Default PostgreSQL Credentials
  **Description:**
  In the Docker Compose file, the PostgreSQL service is started with default credentials:
  - `POSTGRES_USER=django_tenants`
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=django_tenants`
  Additionally, the service maps port 5433 on the host to the container’s PostgreSQL port. These well‑known credentials put the database at risk if the port is exposed publicly.
  **Impact:**
  - An attacker may connect to the PostgreSQL service and perform unauthorized queries or data modifications across tenants.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - No mitigation is implemented; the credentials are directly hard‑coded in the docker‑compose configuration.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Use strong, unique credentials for the database by supplying them as secure environment variables.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The PostgreSQL port (mapped to 5433) is open to external (or untrusted network) access, and the defaults remain in place.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The `docker-compose.yml` file under the `db` service clearly specifies these default credentials.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. From an external system, attempt a PostgreSQL connection to the host on port 5433 using the username “django_tenants” and password “django_tenants”.
  2. Run a simple SQL query (e.g., `SELECT current_database();`) to verify that access has been granted.
  3. Confirm that the database is vulnerable to unauthorized access.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposed Redis Service Without Authentication
  **Description:**
  The Docker Compose configuration also maps the Redis service’s port 6379 on the host (via the mapping `"6379:6379"`). No authentication (or password) is configured for Redis. This leaves the Redis instance open to anyone who can reach the mapped port, allowing for arbitrary commands and data manipulation.
  **Impact:**
  - An attacker can connect to Redis and perform commands that delete cached data, manipulate session data or, in some scenarios, deploy techniques to extract or inject data.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - No authentication is configured for the Redis service in the Compose file.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Configure Redis with a strong password (using the “requirepass” option) and restrict network access (for example, via firewall rules or binding only to internal interfaces).
  **Preconditions:**
  - The Redis service is accessible externally through port 6379.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The `docker-compose.yml` file declares a Redis service that simply uses the official image and opens port 6379 without any further authentication parameters.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Use a Redis client from an external host and connect to the exposed port 6379.
  2. Issue a command such as `INFO` or even `FLUSHALL` to check if the attacker can read or clear the cache.
  3. Verify that the Redis instance accepts and executes commands without authentication.

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration
  **Description:**
  Several settings files (for example, in `tenant_multi_types_tutorial/settings.py` and `tenant_tutorial/settings.py`) set
  `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']`. This configuration accepts any host header supplied in an HTTP request. An attacker may exploit such a configuration in host‑header poisoning attacks that could mislead URL generation, bypass security controls, or facilitate phishing schemes.
  **Impact:**
  - Host header poisoning may allow malicious redirection, bypassing of certain security checks, or help an attacker craft phishing pages that appear to belong to the legitimate domain.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None; the settings plainly allow all hosts by using a wildcard.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - In production, restrict ALLOWED_HOSTS to the known, trusted domain names.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The instance is deployed using these settings (i.e. ALLOWED_HOSTS is left as `['*']`) so that any HTTP Host header is accepted.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the settings files (e.g., under `tenant_multi_types_tutorial/settings.py`), the ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration is clearly set as `['*']`.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Send an HTTP request to the application with a custom, attacker‑controlled Host header.
  2. Analyze whether the application uses this header in URL generation or error messages.
  3. Verify that no validation is performed and that the response reflects the malicious host information.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Lack of Tenant Schema Name Validation Leading to Directory Traversal
  **Description:**
  The multi–tenant architecture relies on a tenant’s schema name to dynamically build filesystem paths used in template loading, static file serving, and file storage (e.g. in the construction of storage base paths in `TenantStaticFilesStorage` and template loader directories using `settings.MULTITENANT_TEMPLATE_DIRS`). However, there is no explicit validation or sanitization of tenant schema names when they are created (for example, in the management command `create_tenant.py`) or when they are injected into path formatting operations. An attacker who can supply a malicious schema name (for example, using directory traversal sequences like "`../../`") may manipulate these paths to reference directories and files outside the intended tenant boundaries.
  **Impact:**
  - An attacker may access or modify files outside the designated tenant folder, leading to data disclosure or file manipulation.
  - In the worst case, this could allow uploading, serving, or even execution of arbitrary files located on or written to parts of the filesystem that should remain isolated from tenant operations.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - No input validation or sanitization is performed on tenant schema names in the provided project files.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Enforce a strict whitelist or regular expression (allowing only safe characters such as alphanumeric characters and underscores) when accepting tenant schema names.
  - Sanitize any input used in filesystem path constructions and avoid using raw string formatting to build directory paths.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application allows external creation or alteration of tenants (for example, via a self‑service signup or an admin interface) without enforcing strict rules on the tenant schema name.
  - Filesystem locations (e.g. for static files, media files, and templates) are computed by directly substituting the tenant schema name into a pre‑configured path pattern.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `TenantStaticFilesStorageTestCase` (see file `/code/django_tenants/tests/staticfiles/test_storage.py`), the base location for tenant files is computed using `"{}/{}".format(self.temp_dir, connection.schema_name)` without sanitizing `connection.schema_name`.
  - In the template loader tests (in `/code/django_tenants/tests/template/loaders/test_filesystem.py`), the directory for templates is set via `settings.MULTITENANT_TEMPLATE_DIRS[0] % self.tenant.schema_name`—again relying on the raw value of the tenant schema name.
  - The management command `create_tenant.py` accepts tenant schema names directly from user input without validating that the input conforms to a safe pattern.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Using an available tenant creation mechanism (for example, via the self‑service interface or by simulating the management command), create a new tenant with a malicious schema name such as "`../../evil`".
  2. Verify that the filesystem path computed for this tenant’s static or media files (or for template lookup) is outside the intended directory. For example, if the base path is constructed as `"{}/{}".format(<STATIC_ROOT>, schema_name)`, check that the resolved path escapes `<STATIC_ROOT>`.
  3. Attempt to upload a file (or access a static file) using this tenant’s endpoints.
  4. Confirm that the file is stored or served from an unintended location, demonstrating a directory traversal vulnerability.
  5. Review the application’s response and server logs to ensure that the exploitation did indeed lead to access (read or write) to files outside of the designated tenant directory.
