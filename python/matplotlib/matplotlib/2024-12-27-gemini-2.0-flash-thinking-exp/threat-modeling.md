## High and Critical Matplotlib Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected Matplotlib Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Data Injection Leading to Resource Exhaustion** | An attacker provides crafted, excessively large, or complex datasets as input to the plotting functions. This forces Matplotlib to perform computationally intensive operations, consuming excessive CPU and memory. | Application slowdown, temporary unavailability (DoS), potential server crashes. | `matplotlib.pyplot` (e.g., `plot`, `scatter`, `bar`, `hist`), underlying data handling within Matplotlib. | High | - **Strict Data Validation:** Implement robust input validation to check data types, ranges, and sizes before passing them to Matplotlib. Reject or sanitize data that exceeds acceptable limits. <br> - **Resource Limits:** Implement safeguards to prevent the generation of excessively large or complex plots (e.g., limiting the number of data points, setting timeouts for plot generation). <br> - **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload plot generation to background tasks or separate processes to prevent blocking the main application thread. <br> - **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency of plot generation requests from a single user or source. |
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Image Rendering Libraries** | An attacker provides data that, when processed by Matplotlib, triggers a vulnerability in the underlying image rendering libraries (e.g., FreeType, libpng, Pillow). This could lead to crashes, information disclosure, or even remote code execution. | Application crashes, potential information disclosure, potential remote code execution on the server. | `matplotlib.backends` (specific backend being used, e.g., `Agg`, `PDF`, `SVG`), interaction with underlying image processing libraries. | Critical | - **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Matplotlib and its dependencies (especially image rendering libraries) to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. <br> - **Use Virtual Environments:** Isolate the application's dependencies in a virtual environment to prevent conflicts and ensure consistent versions. <br> - **Consider Alternative Backends:** If security vulnerabilities are frequently found in a specific backend, consider using a more secure alternative if feasible. |
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Interactive Backends (e.g., WebAgg)** | If the application uses an interactive Matplotlib backend like `WebAgg` to display plots in a web browser, vulnerabilities in the backend's implementation could be exploited by an attacker. | Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, information disclosure, or other browser-based attacks. | `matplotlib.backends.backend_webagg` (or other interactive backends). | High | - **Keep Matplotlib Updated:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Matplotlib, which includes security fixes for its backends. <br> - **Secure Deployment:** Deploy interactive backends in a secure environment, following web application security best practices (e.g., proper input sanitization, output encoding). <br> - **Consider Alternatives:** If security is a major concern, consider using static image generation instead of interactive backends. |
