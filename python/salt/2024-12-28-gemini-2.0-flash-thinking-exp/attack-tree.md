## Threat Model: Compromising Application via SaltStack Exploitation - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the SaltStack framework it utilizes.

**Attacker's Goal:** Execute arbitrary code on the application server(s) managed by SaltStack, leading to data breach, service disruption, or other malicious outcomes.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* OR - [CRITICAL NODE] Gain Control of Salt Master [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * AND - [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Master Authentication/Authorization
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed)
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Obtain Master Key through Misconfiguration or Exposure
    * AND - [HIGH RISK PATH] Social Engineering against Salt Master Administrators
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Phishing for Master Credentials
    * AND - [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfigurations on Salt Master
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Master API exposed without proper authentication
* OR - [CRITICAL NODE] Gain Control of a Salt Minion [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * AND - [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Minion Authentication/Authorization
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Default Minion Key (if not accepted/rejected properly)
    * AND - [HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise the Minion Host Directly (Bypassing Salt)
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit weak passwords or other security flaws on the Minion host
    * AND - [HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Actions from a Compromised Master
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Master pushes malicious state or module to the Minion
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Master executes arbitrary commands on the Minion

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Control of Salt Master:**
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Master Authentication/Authorization:**
        * **Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed):** Attackers attempt to log in to the Salt Master using well-known default usernames and passwords that are often present in initial installations if not changed by administrators. This requires very low effort and skill.
        * **Obtain Master Key through Misconfiguration or Exposure:** The Salt Master's private key, crucial for authentication, might be unintentionally exposed due to misconfigurations (e.g., world-readable permissions on the key file) or stored insecurely (e.g., in a public repository). This allows attackers to impersonate the Master.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Social Engineering against Salt Master Administrators:**
        * **Phishing for Master Credentials:** Attackers use deceptive emails or other communication methods to trick administrators into revealing their Salt Master login credentials. This exploits human trust and can be effective even with technical security measures in place.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfigurations on Salt Master:**
        * **Master API exposed without proper authentication:** The Salt Master provides an API for remote management. If this API is exposed to the network without proper authentication mechanisms, attackers can directly interact with it and execute commands.

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Control of a Salt Minion:**
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Minion Authentication/Authorization:**
        * **Exploit Default Minion Key (if not accepted/rejected properly):** When a new Minion connects to the Master, it presents a key for acceptance. If the auto-acceptance feature is enabled or the acceptance process is flawed, attackers can potentially register rogue Minions or hijack legitimate ones using default or predictable keys.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise the Minion Host Directly (Bypassing Salt):**
        * **Exploit weak passwords or other security flaws on the Minion host:** Attackers can bypass SaltStack entirely by exploiting vulnerabilities or weak security practices directly on the Minion's operating system or other services running on it. This includes brute-forcing weak passwords for SSH or other remote access services.
    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Actions from a Compromised Master:**
        * **Master pushes malicious state or module to the Minion:** If the Salt Master is compromised, the attacker can use its control to push malicious Salt states or modules to the Minions. These malicious components can then execute arbitrary code on the Minion.
        * **Master executes arbitrary commands on the Minion:** A compromised Salt Master can directly execute arbitrary commands on any of its managed Minions, providing immediate and complete control over those systems.
