## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high or critical vulnerabilities introduced by the django-cachalot project and triggerable by an external attacker have been identified.

After careful analysis of the code, especially the monkey patching and cache invalidation logic, the project appears to be designed with correctness in mind for its intended purpose as a caching library.

The files primarily consist of:
- Development and CI configurations
- Project setup and documentation
- Core caching library code
- Test suites

No web application code or API endpoints are exposed in these files that would be directly vulnerable to external attacks.

Potential theoretical concerns, such as cache invalidation bypass through highly crafted SQL injection or issues with table introspection, are either mitigated by the project's design or fall under the exclusion criteria of vulnerabilities caused by developers explicitly using insecure coding patterns when using the library.

Therefore, based on the provided files and the given constraints, there are no vulnerabilities to report that meet the criteria of being high or critical rank, valid, not already mitigated, and introduced by the project itself for an external attacker scenario.

It is important to note that this analysis is limited to the provided files. A more comprehensive security assessment would require examining the library in the context of a real-world web application and considering potential integration vulnerabilities or more subtle edge cases in cache invalidation logic that might not be apparent from static code analysis alone.
