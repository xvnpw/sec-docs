Based on your instructions, the provided vulnerability regarding "Incomplete cache invalidation for TRUNCATE TABLE" should be included in the updated list.

Here is the vulnerability list in markdown format, including only the valid vulnerability that meets the specified criteria:

### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Incomplete cache invalidation for TRUNCATE TABLE

* Description:
    When a `TRUNCATE TABLE` command is executed via raw SQL, cachalot's raw SQL invalidation mechanism fails to detect it because the regular expression used to identify data-modifying SQL commands does not include the `TRUNCATE TABLE` keyword. This results in stale cache entries for queries involving the truncated table.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Application executes a database query through Django ORM that is cached by cachalot.
    2. An attacker, or an internal process, executes a raw SQL query `TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>;` targeting the table involved in the cached query. This can be done through a raw SQL execution vulnerability in the application or directly to the database if attacker has access.
    3. Application executes the same database query again through Django ORM.

* Impact:
    Stale cache data. Subsequent queries might return cached results that are inconsistent with the database state after the `TRUNCATE TABLE` operation. This could lead to incorrect application behavior, data integrity issues, and potential information disclosure if cached data is sensitive or if application logic relies on up-to-date data.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None for `TRUNCATE TABLE`. Cachalot attempts to invalidate cache for raw SQL data modification using a regular expression in `cachalot/monkey_patch.py`, but this regex is incomplete and does not include `TRUNCATE TABLE`.

* Missing Mitigations:
    Modify the regular expression `SQL_DATA_CHANGE_RE` in `cachalot/monkey_patch.py` to include the `truncate` keyword. This will ensure that `TRUNCATE TABLE` commands executed via raw SQL are detected and trigger cache invalidation for the affected tables.

* Preconditions:
    1. Cachalot is enabled in the Django project.
    2. Queries involving a specific database table are being cached.
    3. There is a way for an attacker or internal process to execute raw SQL queries against the database, specifically `TRUNCATE TABLE` commands, targeting tables that are being cached by cachalot.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/cachalot/monkey_patch.py`
    2. Locate the `_patch_cursor` function and the `SQL_DATA_CHANGE_RE` regular expression:
    ```python
    SQL_DATA_CHANGE_RE = re.compile(
        '|'.join([
            fr'(\W|\A){re.escape(keyword)}(\W|\Z)'
            for keyword in ['update', 'insert', 'delete', 'alter', 'create', 'drop']
        ]),
        flags=re.IGNORECASE,
    )

    def _patch_cursor_execute(original):
        @wraps(original)
        def inner(cursor, sql, *args, **kwargs):
            try:
                return original(cursor, sql, *args, **kwargs)
            finally:
                connection = cursor.db
                if getattr(connection, 'raw', True):
                    if isinstance(sql, bytes):
                        sql = sql.decode('utf-8')
                    sql = sql.lower()
                    if SQL_DATA_CHANGE_RE.search(sql): # Vulnerability: 'truncate' is missing in regex
                        tables = filter_cachable(
                            _get_tables_from_sql(connection, sql))
                        if tables:
                            invalidate(
                                *tables, db_alias=connection.alias,
                                cache_alias=cachalot_settings.CACHALOT_CACHE)
    ```
    3. The `SQL_DATA_CHANGE_RE` regex is intended to detect data-modifying SQL commands in raw SQL queries. However, the keyword list `['update', 'insert', 'delete', 'alter', 'create', 'drop']` does not include `truncate`.
    4. When a raw SQL query like `TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>;` is executed, `SQL_DATA_CHANGE_RE.search(sql.lower())` will return `None` because 'truncate' is not in the regex.
    5. As a result, the `invalidate()` function is not called, and the cache related to `<table_name>` is not invalidated, leading to stale cache data.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Ensure Django project is set up with cachalot enabled and a cache backend configured (e.g., locmem).
        - Define a Django model, for example, the `Test` model from `/code/cachalot/tests/models.py`.
        - Create an instance of the `Test` model in the database.
    2. Test Steps:
        - Execute a query that should be cached. For example, in Django shell:
          ```python
          from cachalot.tests.models import Test
          list(Test.objects.all()) # First execution, should hit database
          ```
        - Verify that the query is cached by executing it again and checking the number of database queries.
          ```python
          from django.test import TestCase
          class MyTest(TestCase):
              def test_cache_hit(self):
                  with self.assertNumQueries(0): # Expecting 0 queries as it's cached
                      list(Test.objects.all())
          ```
        - Execute a raw SQL `TRUNCATE TABLE` command targeting the table of the `Test` model. Get the table name from `Test._meta.db_table`. In Django shell:
          ```python
          from django.db import connection
          table_name = Test._meta.db_table
          with connection.cursor() as cursor:
              cursor.execute(f'TRUNCATE TABLE {table_name};')
          ```
        - Execute the cached query again:
          ```python
          class MyTest(TestCase):
              def test_stale_cache_after_truncate(self):
                  with self.assertNumQueries(0): # Still expecting 0 queries - STALE CACHE!
                      result = list(Test.objects.all())
                  self.assertNotEqual(len(result), 0) # Expecting stale data, not empty result
          ```
        - Assert that the result of the query is still served from the cache (0 database queries) and that the result is not empty, indicating stale data despite the table being truncated.
    3. Expected Result (Vulnerability): The test `test_stale_cache_after_truncate` should pass, demonstrating that the cache is stale after `TRUNCATE TABLE`. The number of queries should be 0, and the result should not be empty, proving the vulnerability.
    4. Mitigation (To fix the vulnerability): Modify `cachalot/monkey_patch.py` and add `'truncate'` to the `keywords` list in `SQL_DATA_CHANGE_RE` definition.
    5. Retest after Mitigation: After applying the mitigation, rerun the security test case. The test `test_stale_cache_after_truncate` should now fail in the intended way, or the assertion should be adjusted to expect 1 query and an empty result, confirming that the cache is correctly invalidated after `TRUNCATE TABLE`.
