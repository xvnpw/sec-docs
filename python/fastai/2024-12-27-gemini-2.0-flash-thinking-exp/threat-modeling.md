## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving fastai

This table outlines high and critical security threats that directly involve the `fastai` library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected fastai Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Model Loading (Code Execution)** | An attacker provides a crafted model file (e.g., a pickled `.pkl` file) containing malicious code. When the application uses `fastai.learner.load_learner()` to load this model, the malicious code is deserialized and executed on the server. | **Critical:** Full compromise of the application server, potentially leading to data breaches, system takeover, and further attacks. | `fastai.learner.load_learner()` (specifically the underlying `pickle` deserialization) | **Critical** | - **Strictly Control Model Sources:** Only load models from trusted and verified sources. Avoid allowing users to upload or select arbitrary model files. - **Model Signing and Verification:** Implement a mechanism to cryptographically sign and verify the integrity and origin of model files before loading. - **Sandboxing Model Loading:** Load models in a sandboxed environment with limited access to system resources to contain potential damage. - **Consider Alternative Serialization (with caution):** Explore alternative serialization methods if the performance trade-offs are acceptable and they offer better security than `pickle` (this might require significant changes or wrappers around `fastai`). |
| **Vulnerabilities in `fastai` Library Itself (Critical)** | A critical vulnerability is discovered in the `fastai` library itself. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses an affected version of the library. | **Critical:** Could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or complete denial of service depending on the specific vulnerability. | Various modules and functions within the `fastai` library depending on the specific vulnerability. | **Critical** | - **Stay Updated with `fastai` Releases:** Monitor `fastai` release notes and security advisories for any reported critical vulnerabilities and update the library immediately. - **Subscribe to Security Mailing Lists:** Subscribe to relevant security mailing lists or forums to stay informed about potential critical vulnerabilities. |
| **Resource Exhaustion during Model Loading/Inference** | An attacker provides a specially crafted model or input data that, when processed by `fastai`, consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, GPU), leading to a denial of service. | **High:** Application becomes unavailable or performs poorly, impacting users significantly. | `fastai.learner.load_learner()`, `fastai.learner.Learner.predict()`, `fastai.learner.Learner.get_preds()` | **High** | - **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, GPU) for processes involved in model loading and inference. - **Input Validation:** Validate input data before feeding it to the model to prevent unexpected behavior. - **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency of inference requests to prevent abuse. - **Monitoring Resource Usage:** Monitor resource consumption during model loading and inference to detect anomalies. |
| **Vulnerabilities in `fastai` Library Itself (High)** | A high severity vulnerability is discovered in the `fastai` library itself. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses an affected version of the library. | **High:** Could lead to significant data exposure, unauthorized access to certain functionalities, or partial denial of service. | Various modules and functions within the `fastai` library depending on the specific vulnerability. | **High** | - **Stay Updated with `fastai` Releases:** Monitor `fastai` release notes and security advisories for any reported high severity vulnerabilities and update the library promptly. - **Subscribe to Security Mailing Lists:** Subscribe to relevant security mailing lists or forums to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities. |
