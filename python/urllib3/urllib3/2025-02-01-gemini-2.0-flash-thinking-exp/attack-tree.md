## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known CVEs in urllib3 [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: CVE Exploitation]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_cves_in_urllib3__high-risk_path__critical_node_cve_exploitation_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in urllib3.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify applications using vulnerable urllib3 versions (via dependency scanning).
    *   Check urllib3 version against CVE databases to find applicable vulnerabilities.
    *   Craft malicious requests to exploit specific CVEs (e.g., header injection, TLS bypass, DoS).
    *   Send malicious requests through the application using urllib3.
*   **Potential Impacts [CRITICAL NODES: Code Execution, Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service]:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Gain arbitrary code execution on the application server.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data processed or accessible by the application.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupt application availability by exhausting resources or causing crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of urllib3 in Application -> Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration -> Disable Certificate Verification [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODES: Misconfiguration Exploitation, Insecure TLS Config, Disabled Cert Verification]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_urllib3_in_application_-_insecure_tlsssl_configuration_-_disabl_d692992a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit applications that disable TLS/SSL certificate verification in urllib3.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify applications with certificate verification disabled (`cert_verify=False` or `assert_hostname=False`).
    *   Perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack by intercepting network traffic.
    *   Present a malicious server certificate to the application.
*   **Potential Impacts [CRITICAL NODES: MitM Attack, Credential Theft, Malicious Content Injection]:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** Intercept and manipulate communication between the application and target servers.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Steal user credentials or API keys transmitted over the insecure connection.
    *   **Malicious Content Injection:** Inject malicious content into responses from the server, potentially compromising application users or functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of urllib3 in Application -> Improper Input Handling Leading to urllib3 Exploitation -> URL Injection -> Trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODES: Misconfiguration Exploitation, Input Handling Issues, URL Injection, SSRF]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_urllib3_in_application_-_improper_input_handling_leading_to_url_a140837e.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit applications that dynamically construct URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify applications that build URLs from user input and use urllib3 to make requests.
    *   Inject malicious URLs into user input fields.
    *   The application uses urllib3 to access the attacker-controlled malicious URL.
*   **Potential Impacts [CRITICAL NODE: SSRF]:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Force the application server to make requests to internal resources or external attacker-controlled servers. This can lead to:
        *   Access to internal network resources and services.
        *   Data exfiltration from internal systems.
        *   Potential remote code execution on internal systems if vulnerable services are exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of urllib3 in Application -> Improper Input Handling Leading to urllib3 Exploitation -> Header Injection via User-Controlled Input [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODES: Misconfiguration Exploitation, Input Handling Issues, Header Injection]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_urllib3_in_application_-_improper_input_handling_leading_to_url_3e3039e3.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit applications that allow user-controlled input to influence HTTP headers sent by urllib3.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify applications that allow user input to be incorporated into HTTP headers.
    *   Inject malicious headers (e.g., `Host`, `X-Forwarded-For`) through user input.
    *   The application uses urllib3 to send requests with the injected malicious headers.
*   **Potential Impacts [CRITICAL NODES: Access Control Bypass, Cache Poisoning]:**
    *   **Access Control Bypass:** Bypass host-based access controls or other header-dependent security mechanisms.
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Manipulate cached responses by injecting headers that influence caching behavior, potentially affecting other users of the application.
