  - security control: Vulnerability Reporting - The project likely has a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities, although not explicitly documented in the provided context. Implemented: Typically via GitHub issues or security-specific channels.
  - security control: Security Releases - The project releases new versions to address reported security vulnerabilities. Implemented: PyPI release process.
  - security control: HTTPS enforced for website and documentation access. Implemented: Web server configuration for urllib3.readthedocs.io and urllib3.palletsprojects.com.
  - security control: Dependency management - Using `pip` and `requirements.txt` to manage dependencies. Implemented: Project build and development process.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies - Urllib3 relies on other libraries, and vulnerabilities in those dependencies could indirectly affect urllib3.
  - accepted risk: Undiscovered vulnerabilities - Despite security efforts, there is always a risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  - accepted risk: Misuse by users - Users might misuse urllib3 in insecure ways in their applications, which is outside the control of the urllib3 project itself.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities in CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential security flaws in the codebase.
  - security control: Fuzzing - Employ fuzzing techniques to proactively discover potential vulnerabilities by providing unexpected or malformed inputs.
  - security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses.
  - security control: Signed releases - Sign releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of the urllib3 package.
  - security control: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) - Generate and publish SBOM for each release to improve supply chain transparency.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Support for various HTTP authentication schemes (Basic, Digest, Bearer, etc.) to allow users to authenticate requests when needed.
    - Requirement: Secure handling of authentication credentials, avoiding storage in plaintext and promoting secure storage practices for users.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Urllib3 itself does not handle authorization, but it should provide mechanisms for users to implement authorization logic in their applications based on responses from servers.
    - Requirement: Ensure that urllib3 does not inadvertently bypass any authorization mechanisms implemented by users or servers.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Robust parsing and validation of HTTP requests and responses to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Proper handling of various HTTP headers and data formats to avoid unexpected behavior or security issues.
    - Requirement: Protection against common HTTP vulnerabilities like header injection, request smuggling, and others.
  - Cryptography:

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure and reliable HTTP communication for Python applications. This is critical because many applications rely on HTTP for various functionalities, including accessing web services, APIs, and other resources. Failures or vulnerabilities in HTTP communication can disrupt these processes and lead to security incidents.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Data transmitted over HTTP/HTTPS by applications using urllib3. The sensitivity of this data varies greatly depending on the application. It can range from publicly available data to highly sensitive personal or financial information.
  - Examples of sensitive data could include:
    - User credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys)
    - Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
    - Financial transaction data
    - Confidential business data
  - The sensitivity level is application-dependent, but urllib3 must be designed and maintained to handle potentially sensitive data securely in transit.
