# Threat Model Analysis for urllib3/urllib3

## Threat: [Insufficient TLS Certificate Verification](./threats/insufficient_tls_certificate_verification.md)

**Description:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by intercepting network traffic between the application and a remote server. The attacker presents a fraudulent SSL/TLS certificate. If `urllib3` is configured to not properly verify the certificate's authenticity (e.g., checks the signature against a trusted CA, verifies the hostname), it will establish a secure connection with the attacker's server, believing it's the legitimate server. The attacker can then eavesdrop on or modify the communication handled by `urllib3`.

**Impact:** Confidential data transmitted through `urllib3` between the application and the server could be exposed to the attacker. The attacker could also manipulate data in transit, leading to data corruption or unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Component:** `urllib3.connectionpool`, specifically the TLS/SSL handshake process within `HTTPSConnectionPool`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure `cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED'` and `assert_hostname=True` are set when creating `PoolManager` or `HTTPSConnectionPool` instances.
* Provide a valid and up-to-date CA certificate bundle to `urllib3` using the `ca_certs` parameter.
* Avoid disabling certificate verification in `urllib3` unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of the risks.

## Threat: [Hostname Verification Bypass](./threats/hostname_verification_bypass.md)

**Description:** Even if certificate verification is enabled in `urllib3`, an attacker could present a valid certificate for a different domain. If hostname verification is not correctly configured or is bypassed within `urllib3`, the library might accept the connection even though the certificate's hostname doesn't match the intended target host. This allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate server to `urllib3`.

**Impact:** The application, via `urllib3`, could unknowingly communicate with a malicious server, potentially sending sensitive data or receiving malicious responses. This can lead to data breaches, malware infection, or further attacks.

**Affected Component:** `urllib3.util.ssl_`, specifically the hostname matching logic within the TLS/SSL handshake.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure `assert_hostname=True` is set when creating `PoolManager` or `HTTPSConnectionPool` instances. This is enabled by default in recent versions of `urllib3`.
* Do not override or disable hostname verification in `urllib3` unless there's a very specific and well-understood reason.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle via Compromised Proxy](./threats/man-in-the-middle_via_compromised_proxy.md)

**Description:** If the application configures `urllib3` to use a proxy server and that proxy is compromised by an attacker, all traffic routed through the proxy by `urllib3` can be intercepted and manipulated. The attacker can eavesdrop on communications, modify requests and responses, or even inject malicious content handled by `urllib3`.

**Impact:** Confidential data transmitted by `urllib3` can be exposed, data integrity can be compromised, and the application's behavior when using `urllib3` can be manipulated by the attacker.

**Affected Component:** `urllib3.connectionpool`, specifically when using the `proxy_url` parameter in `PoolManager`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only use trusted and well-maintained proxy servers.
* Implement secure authentication and authorization for proxy access.
* Consider using end-to-end encryption (HTTPS) even when using a proxy to protect data in transit handled by `urllib3`.
