# Threat Model Analysis for urllib3/urllib3

## Threat: [TLS/SSL Verification Bypass](./threats/tlsssl_verification_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by intercepting communication between the application and a remote server. This is possible if the application disables or improperly configures TLS/SSL certificate verification within `urllib3`. The attacker can then read or modify sensitive data transmitted over the connection.

**Impact:** Confidential data can be exposed, integrity of data can be compromised, and the application might be tricked into communicating with a malicious server.

**Affected Component:**
*   `urllib3.PoolManager` (when `cert_reqs` is set to `'CERT_NONE'`)
*   `urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPSConnectionPool` (when `assert_hostname` is `False` or `cert_reqs` is `'CERT_NONE'`)
*   `ssl_context` parameter used in `PoolManager` or `HTTPSConnectionPool` if not configured securely.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enable and Enforce Certificate Verification:** Ensure `cert_reqs` is set to `'CERT_REQUIRED'` when creating a `PoolManager` or `HTTPSConnectionPool`.
*   **Provide a Valid CA Bundle:**  Use the `ca_certs` parameter to specify a trusted CA bundle.
*   **Enable Hostname Verification:** Ensure `assert_hostname` is set to `True` (default). Avoid explicitly setting it to `False`.
*   **Securely Configure `ssl_context`:** If using a custom `ssl_context`, ensure it is configured with appropriate security settings, including certificate verification.

## Threat: [Hostname Verification Failure](./threats/hostname_verification_failure.md)

**Description:** An attacker could present a valid TLS certificate for a different hostname than the one being requested. If hostname verification is not performed by `urllib3`, the application might establish a connection with the attacker's server, believing it to be the intended target. This allows for MITM attacks.

**Impact:**  Confidential data can be exposed, integrity of data can be compromised, and the application might be tricked into communicating with a malicious server.

**Affected Component:**
*   `urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPSConnectionPool` (when `assert_hostname` is `False`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enable Hostname Verification:** Ensure `assert_hostname` is set to `True` (default). Avoid explicitly setting it to `False`.
*   **Use Default Settings:** Rely on `urllib3`'s default secure settings for hostname verification.

## Threat: [URL Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/url_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide a maliciously crafted URL that exploits vulnerabilities in `urllib3`'s URL parsing logic. This could lead to unexpected behavior within `urllib3`, such as connecting to an unintended host or bypassing internal security checks within the library itself.

**Impact:** The application, through `urllib3`, might connect to a malicious server, potentially leading to further exploitation or information leakage.

**Affected Component:**
*   `urllib3.util.url` (various functions for parsing URLs)
*   Internal URL parsing mechanisms within `urllib3`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Urllib3 Updated:** Regularly update `urllib3` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing URL parsing vulnerabilities.
*   **Careful URL Construction:** While the primary responsibility lies with `urllib3`'s secure parsing, be cautious when constructing URLs based on external or untrusted input that is then passed to `urllib3`.

## Threat: [Proxy Vulnerabilities](./threats/proxy_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the application uses proxies, vulnerabilities within `urllib3`'s proxy handling could be exploited. An attacker might be able to intercept traffic through a malicious proxy due to flaws in how `urllib3` interacts with proxies, potentially manipulating requests or bypassing intended security measures. This could involve issues with proxy authentication or handling of different proxy protocols within `urllib3`.

**Impact:**  Communication can be intercepted and manipulated, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:**
*   `urllib3.ProxyManager`
*   `urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool` (when using a proxy)
*   `urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPSConnectionPool` (when using a proxy)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use Trusted Proxies:** Only use proxies that are known to be secure and trustworthy.
*   **Secure Proxy Authentication:** If proxy authentication is required, ensure credentials are handled securely and not hardcoded.
*   **Keep Urllib3 Updated:** Update `urllib3` to address any known proxy-related vulnerabilities.
