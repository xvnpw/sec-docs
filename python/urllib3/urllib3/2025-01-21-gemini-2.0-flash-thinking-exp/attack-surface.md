# Attack Surface Analysis for urllib3/urllib3

## Attack Surface: [URL Injection](./attack_surfaces/url_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the target URL by injecting malicious characters or URLs if the application constructs URLs dynamically using unsanitized user input.
    *   **How urllib3 Contributes:** `urllib3` will attempt to connect to the provided URL, regardless of its origin or malicious intent, if the application passes it an attacker-controlled URL.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a website name from user input and constructs a URL like `f"https://{user_input}/path"`. If `user_input` is `evil.com/../../sensitive`, `urllib3` will try to connect to `https://evil.com/../../sensitive`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Access to internal network resources.
        *   Denial-of-service attacks against arbitrary hosts.
        *   Information disclosure by sending requests to attacker-controlled servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it to construct URLs. Use allow-lists or regular expressions to ensure the input conforms to expected patterns.
        *   **URL Parsing and Validation:** Use libraries to parse and validate URLs before passing them to `urllib3`. Ensure the scheme, hostname, and path are as expected.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic URL Construction:** If possible, avoid constructing URLs dynamically from user input. Use predefined URLs or limited, well-defined options.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious HTTP headers if the application allows user-controlled input to be directly inserted into request headers.
    *   **How urllib3 Contributes:** `urllib3` allows setting custom headers in requests. If the application populates these headers with unsanitized user input, `urllib3` will send these malicious headers to the server.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom user-agent. If the user provides `evil\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: vulnerable.com`, `urllib3` will send these injected headers, potentially leading to HTTP Request Smuggling.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   HTTP Response Splitting/Smuggling.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via response headers (less common).
        *   Session fixation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Header Validation:**  Implement strict validation for any user-provided input intended for HTTP headers. Use allow-lists of allowed characters and reject any input containing control characters like `\r` and `\n`.
        *   **Avoid User-Controlled Headers:**  Minimize or eliminate the ability for users to directly control HTTP headers. If necessary, provide a limited set of predefined header options.
        *   **Use Libraries for Header Manipulation:**  Utilize libraries that handle header encoding and escaping correctly to prevent injection.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  The application configures `urllib3` to use insecure TLS/SSL settings, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
    *   **How urllib3 Contributes:** `urllib3` provides options to disable certificate verification or use insecure cipher suites. If the application uses these options inappropriately, it weakens the security of the connection.
    *   **Example:** The application sets `cert_reqs='CERT_NONE'` or uses `ssl_context` with insecure settings when creating a `PoolManager` or `Session`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Interception of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.
        *   Modification of data in transit.
        *   Impersonation of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Certificate Verification:** Always enable certificate verification (`cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED'`) and provide a valid CA certificate bundle (`ca_certs`).
        *   **Use Secure Cipher Suites:**  Allow `urllib3` to use its default secure cipher suites or explicitly configure a strong set of ciphers. Avoid using weak or deprecated ciphers.
        *   **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):**  While not directly a `urllib3` mitigation, respecting and enforcing HSTS headers received from servers can improve security.
        *   **Regularly Update `urllib3`:** Keep `urllib3` updated to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements in TLS/SSL handling.

## Attack Surface: [Hostname Verification Bypass](./attack_surfaces/hostname_verification_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Even with certificate verification enabled, the application might inadvertently bypass hostname verification, allowing MitM attacks if the attacker has a valid certificate for a different domain.
    *   **How urllib3 Contributes:**  Incorrect usage of `urllib3`'s `assert_hostname` or custom `ssl_context` configurations can lead to hostname verification being skipped.
    *   **Example:**  Setting `assert_hostname=False` when creating a `PoolManager` or `Session`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Successful Man-in-the-Middle attacks even with certificate validation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure Hostname Verification is Enabled:**  Do not disable hostname verification. Let `urllib3` handle it by default or explicitly set `assert_hostname=True`.
        *   **Proper `ssl_context` Configuration:** If using a custom `ssl_context`, ensure it is configured to perform hostname verification.
        *   **Review `urllib3` Usage:** Carefully review the application's code to ensure hostname verification is not being bypassed unintentionally.
