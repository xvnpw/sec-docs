# Threat Model Analysis for urllib3/urllib3

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of slow requests (slowloris), requests with extremely large response bodies, or requests that trigger excessive redirects. The attacker's goal is to exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, sockets, file descriptors), making the application unavailable to legitimate users.  `urllib3`'s handling of connections, timeouts, and retries can be exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, potential financial loss.
    *   **Affected urllib3 Component:** `urllib3.connectionpool` (connection management, handling of timeouts and retries), `urllib3.connection` (individual connection handling), `urllib3.request` (request sending).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set appropriate `timeout` values (both connect and read) on all `urllib3` requests (e.g., `urllib3.request('GET', url, timeout=urllib3.Timeout(connect=2.0, read=5.0))`).
        *   Limit the maximum size of response bodies using `preload_content=False` and reading the response in chunks, checking the size at each step. Or, use `decode_content=False` and check the `Content-Length` header before decoding.
        *   Limit the maximum number of redirects using the `redirects` parameter (e.g., `urllib3.request('GET', url, redirects=5)`).
        *   Configure connection pool sizes (`maxsize`) appropriately to prevent excessive connections. Monitor pool usage.
        *   Implement a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter using `urllib3.util.retry.Retry`.
        *   Consider using a circuit breaker pattern.

## Threat: [Header Injection](./threats/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is used to construct HTTP headers without proper sanitization. If this unsanitized input is passed directly to `urllib3`'s `headers` parameter, the attacker can inject arbitrary headers, potentially leading to response splitting, cache poisoning, or bypassing security controls.
    *   **Impact:**  Cache poisoning, security control bypass, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Affected urllib3 Component:** `urllib3.request` (specifically, the `headers` parameter).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input used to construct HTTP headers. Use a whitelist approach.
        *   Avoid directly constructing headers from raw user input. Use `urllib3`'s built-in header management (passing a dictionary to the `headers` parameter), but *still* validate the input.
        *   Encode header values appropriately.

## Threat: [SNI Mismatch (Man-in-the-Middle)](./threats/sni_mismatch__man-in-the-middle_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the connection between the application and the server. If `urllib3`'s certificate verification is disabled or misconfigured, the attacker can present a forged certificate, allowing them to decrypt and modify the traffic. This is a direct threat if the application explicitly disables or incorrectly customizes `urllib3`'s verification.
    *   **Impact:**  Loss of confidentiality and integrity of data, potential for credential theft, complete compromise of the communication.
    *   **Affected urllib3 Component:** `urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection` (TLS handshake and certificate verification), `urllib3.util.ssl_` (SSL/TLS related utilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rely on `urllib3`'s default certificate verification (which includes hostname verification).  Do *not* disable certificate verification (`cert_reqs='CERT_NONE'`) unless absolutely necessary and you fully understand the risks.
        *   If using a custom CA bundle, ensure it's up-to-date and trusted.
        *   If custom certificate verification is *absolutely* required, ensure it correctly validates the hostname against the certificate's CN or SAN.
        *   Consider certificate or public key pinning for critical services.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `urllib3` Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__urllib3__itself.md)

*   **Description:**  A vulnerability could be discovered in `urllib3` itself, allowing an attacker to exploit it. The specific attack would depend on the nature of the vulnerability, but could range from DoS to more severe issues.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially ranging from denial of service to remote code execution (though RCE directly within `urllib3` is less common than DoS).
    *   **Affected urllib3 Component:**  Could be any component, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Varies (High to Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `urllib3` to the latest stable version.
        *   Use a dependency management system that automatically checks for updates and vulnerabilities.
        *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool.

## Threat: [Proxy-Related Issues (if proxies are *misconfigured* through urllib3)](./threats/proxy-related_issues__if_proxies_are_misconfigured_through_urllib3_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `urllib3` with a proxy, and the proxy configuration *within urllib3* is incorrect (e.g., weak or no authentication, incorrect proxy URL), this can lead to issues. This is distinct from using a *malicious* proxy; this is about *misusing* the proxy features of `urllib3`.
        *   **Proxy Authentication Bypass:** If proxy authentication is not configured correctly *within urllib3*, an attacker might bypass it.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to resources, potential for data modification if the proxy is compromised.
    *   **Affected urllib3 Component:** `urllib3.ProxyManager`, `urllib3.connectionpool` (when used with a proxy).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that proxy authentication is implemented securely within the `urllib3` configuration (strong credentials, HTTPS proxy URL if possible). Use the `proxy_headers` parameter correctly.
        *   Validate that the proxy URL provided to `urllib3` is correct and points to the intended proxy.
