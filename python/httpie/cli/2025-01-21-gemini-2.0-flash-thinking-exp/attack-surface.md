# Attack Surface Analysis for httpie/cli

## Attack Surface: [Malicious URLs in Command-line Arguments](./attack_surfaces/malicious_urls_in_command-line_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject crafted URLs as command-line arguments to `httpie`, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in `httpie` itself or the target server *due to how `httpie` processes the URL*.
    *   **How `httpie/cli` Contributes:** `httpie` directly processes URLs provided as arguments, passing them to the underlying `requests` library for processing. Vulnerabilities in `httpie`'s URL handling or how it interacts with `requests` can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted URL with unusual characters or encoding that triggers a bug in `httpie`'s URL parsing logic, leading to unexpected behavior or even a crash.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service against the application using `httpie`, potential vulnerabilities in `httpie` or `requests` being triggered.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid directly passing user-supplied URLs to `httpie` without validation. If necessary, implement strict URL validation and sanitization *before* using them with `httpie`. Ensure `httpie` and `requests` are updated to the latest versions to patch known URL handling vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about executing commands with `httpie` that contain URLs from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Authentication Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_authentication_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Passing authentication credentials directly in the command line exposes them.
    *   **How `httpie/cli` Contributes:** `httpie` allows specifying credentials using the `-a` or `--auth-type` options directly in the command. This is a direct feature of the CLI.
    *   **Example:**  A developer uses `http --auth user:password ...`. These credentials are then visible in process listings and shell history.
    *   **Impact:**  Credential theft, unauthorized access to the target system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Never hardcode credentials in command-line arguments passed to `httpie`. Use secure credential management techniques like environment variables, configuration files with restricted permissions, or dedicated secrets management tools.
        *   **Users:** Avoid using the `-a` or `--auth-type` options with sensitive credentials directly in the command line.

## Attack Surface: [File Path Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/file_path_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths used with options like `--download`, `--output`, or `--multipart` to access or overwrite files *due to how `httpie` handles these paths*.
    *   **How `httpie/cli` Contributes:** `httpie` interacts with the file system based on the paths provided to these options. Insufficient validation within `httpie` could lead to issues.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses `--download` with a path like `../../sensitive_file.txt` to attempt to download files outside the intended download directory.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, arbitrary file overwrite, potential for privilege escalation on the system running `httpie`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Strictly validate and sanitize file paths provided by users before using them with `httpie`. Use absolute paths or restrict operations to specific directories. Ensure `httpie` is updated to address any path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about the file paths you specify when using these options, especially when the source of the path is untrusted.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `httpie`'s dependencies, particularly the `requests` library, can be exploited *through `httpie`'s usage of these libraries*.
    *   **How `httpie/cli` Contributes:** `httpie` relies on these libraries for its core functionality. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies become attack vectors for applications using `httpie`.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in the `requests` library related to TLS certificate validation could be exploited when `httpie` makes a request.
    *   **Impact:**  Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update `httpie` and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
        *   **Users:** Ensure that the `httpie` installation is up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Proxy Usage](./attack_surfaces/malicious_proxy_usage.md)

*   **Description:** Using a malicious proxy server with the `--proxy` option can expose traffic *due to `httpie`'s direct use of the provided proxy*.
    *   **How `httpie/cli` Contributes:** `httpie` allows specifying proxy servers for routing requests. If a malicious proxy is provided, `httpie` will use it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker tricks a user into using their malicious proxy server via the `--proxy` argument, allowing them to intercept and potentially modify network traffic initiated by `httpie`.
    *   **Impact:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks, interception of sensitive data, potential modification of requests and responses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** If the application allows users to configure proxies for `httpie`, provide clear warnings about the risks of using untrusted proxies. Consider restricting the allowed proxy servers or providing a predefined, trusted list.
        *   **Users:** Only use trusted proxy servers with the `--proxy` option. Be cautious about using proxies provided by unknown or untrusted sources.
