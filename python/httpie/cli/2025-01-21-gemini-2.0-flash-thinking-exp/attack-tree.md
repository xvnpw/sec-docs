## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via HTTPie CLI [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_httpie_cli__critical_node_.md)

**Compromise Application via HTTPie CLI [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the root goal and represents the overall objective of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved their aim of compromising the application through HTTPie.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Input Handling [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_input_handling__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Malicious Input Handling [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is a critical entry point because it encompasses vulnerabilities arising from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-provided data before using it with HTTPie.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious URL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_url_injection.md)

**Malicious URL Injection:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf___critical_node_.md)

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses user-provided data to construct URLs for HTTPie without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious URLs. This forces the application's server to make requests to attacker-controlled or internal resources.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal systems, reading sensitive files, performing actions on behalf of the server, potential for further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crafted Headers Injection](./attack_tree_paths/crafted_headers_injection.md)

**Crafted Headers Injection:**

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_tree_paths/http_header_injection.md)

**HTTP Header Injection:**
*   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows user-provided data to be included in HTTP headers sent by HTTPie without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious headers.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking by injecting `Set-Cookie` headers, bypassing security checks by injecting headers like `X-Forwarded-For`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cookie Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/cookie_manipulation.md)

**Cookie Manipulation:**
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting `Set-Cookie` headers, attackers can set malicious cookies in the user's browser (if the application relays these headers) or manipulate cookies used by the application itself.
*   **Impact:** Impersonating users, bypassing authentication mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Data Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_data_payloads.md)

**Malicious Data Payloads:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Injecting Malicious Data in Request Body [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/injecting_malicious_data_in_request_body__critical_node_.md)

**Injecting Malicious Data in Request Body [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses user-provided data to construct the request body for HTTPie without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious payloads.
*   **Impact:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the target application's data processing logic, such as SQL injection or command injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTPie Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_httpie_configuration__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit HTTPie Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:** This node is critical because gaining control over HTTPie's configuration allows attackers to manipulate its behavior for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injecting malicious settings (e.g., custom plugins, proxies)](./attack_tree_paths/injecting_malicious_settings__e_g___custom_plugins__proxies_.md)

**Injecting malicious settings (e.g., custom plugins, proxies):**
*   **Attack Vector:** If an attacker can modify HTTPie's configuration files (or environment variables), they can inject malicious settings. This includes loading malicious plugins or forcing HTTPie to use an attacker-controlled proxy.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution via malicious plugins, interception and modification of network traffic via malicious proxies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTPie's Features for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_httpie's_features_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Exploit HTTPie's Features for Malicious Purposes:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Credential Stuffing via HTTPie](./attack_tree_paths/credential_stuffing_via_httpie.md)

**Credential Stuffing via HTTPie:**
*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses HTTPie to interact with user authentication endpoints, attackers can use HTTPie to automate credential stuffing attacks using lists of known username/password combinations.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abusing Plugin Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/abusing_plugin_functionality__critical_node_.md)

**Abusing Plugin Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is a critical node because it directly enables remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Installing malicious HTTPie plugins](./attack_tree_paths/installing_malicious_httpie_plugins.md)

**Installing malicious HTTPie plugins:**
*   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows loading external HTTPie plugins (either explicitly or implicitly by running HTTPie in a context where plugins can be loaded), attackers can install malicious plugins.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server running the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting vulnerabilities within installed plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_within_installed_plugins.md)

**Exploiting vulnerabilities within installed plugins:**
*   **Attack Vector:** Even if the application doesn't directly facilitate plugin installation, if vulnerable plugins are installed (due to user actions or other means), attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability, but can include remote code execution, information disclosure, etc.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in HTTPie Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_httpie_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Vulnerabilities in HTTPie Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is a critical node because it represents a common and often severe security risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using HTTPie version with known vulnerable dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/using_httpie_version_with_known_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

**Using HTTPie version with known vulnerable dependencies:**

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable dependency allows for remote code execution or other attacks](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_dependency_allows_for_remote_code_execution_or_other_attacks.md)

**Vulnerable dependency allows for remote code execution or other attacks:**
*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses an outdated version of HTTPie, it may rely on dependencies with known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control over the server, or other significant security breaches depending on the specific vulnerability.
