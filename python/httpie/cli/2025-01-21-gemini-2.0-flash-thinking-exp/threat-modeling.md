# Threat Model Analysis for httpie/cli

## Threat: [Command Injection via User-Controlled Input](./threats/command_injection_via_user-controlled_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious commands into the `httpie` invocation if the application constructs the command using unsanitized user input. The attacker might manipulate input fields or parameters that are directly used to build the command string passed to the shell to execute `httpie`. This could involve adding extra flags, options, or even entirely new commands after the `httpie` call.

**Impact:** Full system compromise on the server hosting the application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the application. This can lead to data exfiltration, installation of malware, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `httpie`'s interaction with the operating system's shell when invoked as a subprocess. The vulnerability lies in how the application constructs and passes arguments to the `httpie` executable.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly incorporating user input into `httpie` commands.
* If user input is absolutely necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization using allow-lists and escaping techniques *before* constructing the `httpie` command.
* Consider using a library or wrapper that provides a safer interface to `httpie` or allows for programmatic construction of requests, minimizing direct command-line interaction.
* Employ parameterized commands or similar techniques to separate commands from data.

## Threat: [Path Traversal/Arbitrary File Access via `--download` or `--output`](./threats/path_traversalarbitrary_file_access_via__--download__or__--output_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the `--download` or `--output` parameters of `httpie` if the application allows user control over these options. By providing crafted file paths (e.g., using `../`), the attacker could potentially read sensitive files outside the intended download directory or overwrite critical system files.

**Impact:** Information disclosure by reading sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, database credentials), data corruption or denial of service by overwriting critical system files.

**Affected Component:** `httpie`'s command-line argument parsing and the functionality of the `--download` and `--output` flags.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid allowing user control over the `--download` or `--output` parameters.
* If user control is required, strictly limit the allowed paths to specific, safe directories using allow-lists.
* Implement robust path validation within the application *before* passing the path to `httpie`, to prevent traversal attempts (e.g., checking for `..`, absolute paths, and symbolic links).

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Command-Line Arguments](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_command-line_arguments.md)

**Description:** If the application passes sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens directly as command-line arguments to `httpie`, these arguments might be visible in process listings (e.g., using `ps` command) or system logs. An attacker with access to the server could potentially retrieve this sensitive information.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, leading to unauthorized access to external services or internal resources.

**Affected Component:** The way the application invokes `httpie` and passes arguments. While not a vulnerability *in* `httpie` itself, it's a risk directly related to how the application *uses* `httpie`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid passing sensitive data directly as command-line arguments to `httpie`.
* Utilize `httpie`'s built-in features for handling authentication (e.g., `--auth`, `--session`) or environment variables for storing sensitive credentials, which are then accessed by `httpie`.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in `httpie` Itself](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in__httpie__itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software, `httpie` might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities. If the application uses an outdated version of `httpie`, it could be susceptible to known exploits that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The entire `httpie/cli` codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Can range from Low to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability, but focusing on high/critical potential impacts.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `httpie` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `httpie`.
* Use dependency management tools to track and manage `httpie`'s version.
