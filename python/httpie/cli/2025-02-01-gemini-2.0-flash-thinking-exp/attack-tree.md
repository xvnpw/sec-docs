## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTPie CLI Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_httpie_cli_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the HTTPie CLI tool itself.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Known HTTPie Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Identify Known Vulnerability (CVE, Security Advisory):**
            *   Attacker researches public vulnerability databases and security advisories for known vulnerabilities in the specific version of HTTPie used by the application.
        *   **Exploit Vulnerability (e.g., RCE, arbitrary file access) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attacker leverages identified vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server or access sensitive files. This could be through publicly available exploits or custom-developed exploits.
    *   **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in HTTPie's Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Identify Vulnerable Dependency of HTTPie:**
            *   Attacker identifies vulnerable dependencies used by HTTPie (e.g., through dependency scanning tools or public vulnerability databases).
        *   **Exploit Vulnerability in Dependency (via HTTPie usage) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attacker exploits the vulnerability in the dependency indirectly through HTTPie's usage of that dependency. This might require understanding how HTTPie interacts with the vulnerable dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate HTTPie CLI Input [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_httpie_cli_input__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands or arguments into the HTTPie command constructed and executed by the application.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Command Injection via Unsanitized Input [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Application Constructs HTTPie Command from User Input:**
            *   Application takes user-provided input (e.g., URL, parameters) and directly incorporates it into the HTTPie command string without proper sanitization.
        *   **Input Sanitization is Insufficient or Absent [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Application fails to adequately sanitize or validate user input, allowing injection characters or sequences to pass through.
        *   **Inject Malicious Commands/Arguments into HTTPie Execution [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attacker injects shell commands or additional HTTPie arguments into the user input, which are then executed by the system when the application runs the constructed HTTPie command.
    *   **Argument Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Application Constructs HTTPie Command with Dynamic Arguments:**
            *   Application dynamically builds parts of the HTTPie command arguments based on user input or application logic.
        *   **Attacker Controls or Influences Argument Values [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attacker can manipulate or influence the values of these dynamic arguments through user interface interactions or API calls.
        *   **Inject Malicious Arguments (e.g., `--auth-type=...`, `--proxy=...`, `--output=...`) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attacker injects or modifies HTTPie arguments like `--auth-type`, `--proxy`, `--output`, `--headers`, etc., to alter the intended behavior of the HTTP request, potentially bypassing security controls, redirecting output, or manipulating authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Handling of HTTPie CLI Output [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_handling_of_httpie_cli_output__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application processes the output generated by HTTPie or exposing sensitive data contained within the output.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **Parsing Vulnerabilities in HTTPie Output:**
        *   **Application Parses HTTPie Output (e.g., JSON, text):**
            *   Application parses the response body, headers, or other parts of the output generated by HTTPie to extract data or perform further actions.
        *   **Vulnerability in Parsing Logic (e.g., injection, buffer overflow) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Application's parsing logic contains vulnerabilities such as injection flaws (e.g., if parsing JSON and not handling special characters correctly) or buffer overflows (if parsing text without proper bounds checking).
        *   **Exploit Parsing Vulnerability to Gain Control/Information [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attacker crafts malicious HTTP responses that, when parsed by the vulnerable application, trigger the parsing vulnerability, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or even remote code execution.
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure via HTTPie Output [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **HTTPie Output Contains Sensitive Information (e.g., credentials, tokens):**
            *   HTTPie output, especially when interacting with authenticated APIs, might contain sensitive information like API keys, authentication tokens, or user credentials in headers or response bodies.
        *   **Application Logs or Exposes HTTPie Output Insecurely [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Application logs the raw HTTPie output without proper sanitization or redaction, or exposes it through error messages, debug interfaces, or other insecure channels.
        *   **Access Sensitive Data from Logs/Exposed Output [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attacker gains access to these logs or exposed outputs and retrieves the sensitive information, leading to credential theft or further unauthorized access.
