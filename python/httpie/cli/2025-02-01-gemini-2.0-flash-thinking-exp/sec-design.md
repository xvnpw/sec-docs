# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a user-friendly command-line HTTP client that simplifies interaction with web services.
  - Enhance developer productivity by offering a more intuitive and feature-rich alternative to `curl`.
  - Maintain a widely adopted and actively developed open-source tool within the HTTPie project.
  - Support various HTTP methods, headers, data formats, and authentication schemes.
  - Ensure cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows).
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in HTTPie CLI could lead to exposure of sensitive data transmitted via HTTP requests.
  - Malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities to compromise systems interacting with HTTPie CLI.
  - Reputational damage to the HTTPie project if the CLI tool is perceived as insecure.
  - Loss of user trust and adoption if security incidents occur.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: HTTPS support for secure communication with web servers. Implemented via the `requests` library.
  - security control: Operating System level security features (e.g., process isolation, memory protection) of the environment where HTTPie CLI is executed.
  - security control: Dependency management using `pip` and `requirements.txt` to track and manage external libraries. Described in repository documentation and build scripts.
  - security control: Code review process through GitHub pull requests before merging changes into the main branch. Implemented via GitHub workflow.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of underlying operating system and Python runtime environment.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by HTTPie CLI.
  - accepted risk: User misconfiguration or misuse of HTTPie CLI leading to insecure requests.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement input validation for URLs, headers, and request data to prevent injection attacks.
  - recommended security control: Secure handling of sensitive data such as API keys and authentication tokens, avoiding logging or displaying them unnecessarily.
  - recommended security control: Output sanitization to prevent information leakage or injection vulnerabilities when displaying responses.
  - recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - recommended security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Support various HTTP authentication methods (Basic, Bearer, Digest, etc.).
    - Requirement: Securely handle authentication credentials provided by users, avoiding storage in plain text in logs or configuration files.
    - Requirement: Allow users to manage and securely store authentication tokens or API keys if needed (consider integration with OS credential managers).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: HTTPie CLI itself does not implement authorization, but it must correctly handle and transmit authorization headers provided by users to web services.
    - Requirement: Ensure that HTTPie CLI does not bypass or weaken any authorization mechanisms implemented by target web services.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate user-provided URLs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SSRF).
    - Requirement: Validate user-provided headers to prevent header injection vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Validate user-provided data to prevent injection attacks based on the content type (e.g., SQL injection if sending SQL queries, command injection if sending commands).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Enforce HTTPS by default for all requests where possible.
    - Requirement: Properly handle TLS/SSL certificates and ensure secure communication channels.
    - Requirement: Avoid implementing custom cryptography; rely on well-vetted libraries like `requests` and the Python standard library.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure interaction with web services and APIs is the primary critical process. This involves ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of communication between users and web services via HTTPie CLI.
  - Maintaining the integrity and security of the HTTPie CLI software itself is crucial to prevent compromised versions from being distributed and used.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data transmitted via HTTPie CLI can include sensitive information such as:
    - Authentication credentials (API keys, tokens, usernames, passwords).
    - Personal data in request bodies or URLs.
    - Confidential business data exchanged with APIs.
    - Session cookies and other session-related data.
  - Sensitivity level depends on the specific use case and the data being handled. In many cases, data transmitted via HTTPie CLI should be considered confidential and require protection.
