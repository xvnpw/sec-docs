## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input to HTTPie [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_to_httpie__high_risk_path_.md)

This path encompasses attacks that manipulate the input provided to the HTTPie command. It's high-risk due to the direct control attackers can exert over the requests made by the application.

  - Malicious URL Construction [HIGH RISK PATH]:
    This involves crafting malicious URLs used by HTTPie.
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:
      - Attack Vector: The application uses HTTPie to fetch URLs based on user input without proper validation. An attacker crafts a URL targeting internal services or infrastructure.
      - Impact: Access to internal resources, potential for further compromise of internal systems, data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crafted HTTP Headers [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/crafted_http_headers__high_risk_path_.md)

This involves injecting malicious headers into HTTP requests made by HTTPie.
    - Header Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:
      - Attack Vector: The application allows user-controlled input to be used as HTTP headers in requests made by HTTPie. Attackers inject malicious headers to bypass security checks or manipulate server-side behavior.
      - Impact: Bypassing authentication or authorization, cache poisoning, exploiting vulnerabilities in backend systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Request Body [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_request_body__high_risk_path_.md)

This involves crafting malicious content within the body of HTTP requests made by HTTPie (typically for POST or PUT requests).
    - Payload Injection (if application uses HTTPie for POST/PUT) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:
      - Attack Vector: The application uses HTTPie to send data to an endpoint, and the backend application is vulnerable to injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection) based on the data sent.
      - Impact: Data breaches, unauthorized access, remote code execution on the application server.
    - File Upload Exploitation (if application uses HTTPie for file uploads) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:
      - Attack Vector: The application uses HTTPie to handle file uploads, and it doesn't properly sanitize or validate the uploaded files. Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells).
      - Impact: Remote code execution on the application server, allowing for complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTPie Configuration and Environment [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_httpie_configuration_and_environment__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on manipulating the environment in which HTTPie operates, allowing attackers to influence its behavior.

  - Environment Variable Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]:
    This involves controlling environment variables that affect HTTPie's operation.
    - HTTPie Environment Variables [HIGH RISK PATH]:
      - Attack Vector: The application runs HTTPie in an environment where an attacker can control relevant environment variables (e.g., `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`).
      - Impact: Redirection of HTTP traffic through attacker-controlled proxies, enabling interception of sensitive data (man-in-the-middle attacks).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTPie Plugins (If Applicable) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_httpie_plugins__if_applicable___critical_node_.md)

This path is critical due to the potential for complete control over HTTPie's functionality.

  - Malicious Plugin Installation [CRITICAL NODE]:
    - Attack Vector: The application uses HTTPie with plugin support, and an attacker can install a malicious plugin.
    - Impact: Arbitrary code execution within the context of HTTPie, access to application resources, manipulation of requests and responses, potentially leading to full application compromise.
