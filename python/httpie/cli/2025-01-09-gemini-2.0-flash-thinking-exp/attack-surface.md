# Attack Surface Analysis for httpie/cli

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via User-Controlled Arguments](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_user-controlled_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject arbitrary shell commands by manipulating arguments passed to the `httpie` command if user input is not properly sanitized.
*   **How CLI Contributes:** The `httpie` CLI accepts various arguments that directly influence the command executed by the shell. If user input is used to construct these arguments without proper escaping, it becomes a vector for injection.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a URL. An attacker inputs `; rm -rf /` as the URL, which, if not sanitized, could be executed by the shell running `httpie`.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data loss, denial of service, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into `httpie` command arguments. Use whitelists and regular expressions to enforce allowed characters and formats.
    *   **Parameterization/Safe Argument Construction:** Avoid directly concatenating user input into the command string. Use libraries or methods that handle argument escaping and quoting correctly for the underlying shell.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application and the `httpie` process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful injection.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Controlled URLs](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_user-controlled_urls.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can force the application to make requests to internal or unintended external systems by controlling the URL passed to `httpie`.
*   **How CLI Contributes:** The primary function of `httpie` is to make HTTP requests to specified URLs. If the application allows users to provide this URL, it creates an opportunity for SSRF.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to test a URL. An attacker provides a URL to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`) which the application then accesses via `httpie`.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data leakage, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **URL Whitelisting:** Maintain a strict whitelist of allowed domains or URLs that the application can access via `httpie`.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user-provided URLs to prevent access to internal or blacklisted addresses.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the application environment from internal networks to limit the impact of SSRF.
    *   **Disable Redirection Following (if possible):**  Configure `httpie` to not follow redirects automatically, which can be used to bypass some SSRF protections.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `httpie` or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__httpie__or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `httpie` relies on other libraries, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies can introduce security risks.
*   **How CLI Contributes:** As an application using `httpie`, you inherit the dependency tree of `httpie`. If any of those dependencies have known vulnerabilities, your application is potentially affected.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the `requests` library (a dependency of `httpie`) could be exploited if not patched.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `httpie` and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and receive alerts for updates.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to `httpie` and its dependencies.
