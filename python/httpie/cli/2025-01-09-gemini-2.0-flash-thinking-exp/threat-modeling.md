# Threat Model Analysis for httpie/cli

## Threat: [Command Injection](./threats/command_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into the `httpie` command string if the application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input or data from untrusted sources that are used to construct the `httpie` command. The application might use string concatenation or similar methods to build the command.

**Impact:** Full system compromise on the server where the application is running. The attacker could execute arbitrary code, read sensitive files, modify data, or launch further attacks.

**Affected Component:** The `subprocess` module (or similar mechanism used by the application to execute external commands) executing `httpie`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid constructing commands from raw input when invoking `httpie`.
*   Use parameterized commands or safe command construction libraries if interacting with the shell.
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all input used in `httpie` commands.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Command Output](./threats/information_disclosure_via_command_output.md)

**Description:** The output of the `httpie` command (stdout and stderr) might contain sensitive information such as API keys, authentication tokens, internal server details, or user data. An attacker could potentially access this output if it's logged, displayed to users, or stored insecurely. This directly relates to how `httpie` presents responses and errors.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, which could lead to unauthorized access to other systems or services, identity theft, or further attacks.

**Affected Component:** The output stream (stdout and stderr) generated by `httpie`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid including sensitive data in `httpie` commands directly.
*   Implement secure logging practices and sanitize `httpie` output before logging.
*   Restrict access to `httpie` command output.

## Threat: [Manipulation of HTTP Requests](./threats/manipulation_of_http_requests.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users or external factors to influence the parameters of the `httpie` command (e.g., URLs, headers, request bodies, methods), an attacker could manipulate these parameters to send malicious or unintended HTTP requests using `httpie`.

**Impact:** The attacker could potentially access or modify data on the target server, perform actions on behalf of legitimate users, or cause denial of service on the target by manipulating `httpie`'s request construction.

**Affected Component:** `httpie`'s functionalities for handling URLs, headers, request bodies, and HTTP methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Strict input validation and sanitization for all parameters passed to `httpie`.
*   Whitelisting allowed URLs and headers for `httpie` requests.
*   Immutable configuration for sensitive parameters used with `httpie`.

## Threat: [Exposure of Credentials in Command History/Process Listings](./threats/exposure_of_credentials_in_command_historyprocess_listings.md)

**Description:** If authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, usernames/passwords) are passed directly as command-line arguments to `httpie`, these credentials might be visible in command history files (like `.bash_history`) or process listings (using tools like `ps`). This is a direct consequence of how the application invokes `httpie`.

**Impact:** Compromise of the exposed credentials, allowing attackers to access the targeted API or service with the application's or a user's privileges.

**Affected Component:** The way the application invokes `httpie` with authentication parameters (e.g., using the `--auth` flag with username and password directly).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid passing credentials as command-line arguments to `httpie`.
*   Use more secure methods for providing authentication credentials to `httpie` (e.g., environment variables, configuration files with restricted access, `httpie`'s session or authentication plugins).

## Threat: [Reliance on Insecure `httpie` Configurations](./threats/reliance_on_insecure__httpie__configurations.md)

**Description:** The application might rely on default or user-configured `httpie` settings that introduce security vulnerabilities. For example, disabling SSL certificate verification (`--verify no`) makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks when `httpie` makes requests.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and potentially modify communication initiated by `httpie`.

**Affected Component:** `httpie`'s configuration system, including command-line flags and configuration files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Explicitly configure secure settings for `httpie`, ensuring that SSL certificate verification is enabled.
*   Review `httpie` configurations used by the application.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `httpie` Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__httpie__itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software, `httpie` might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if the application uses a vulnerable version.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in `httpie`. It could range from denial of service to remote code execution on the server running the application through exploiting `httpie`.

**Affected Component:** The core `httpie` library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update `httpie` to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor security advisories related to `httpie`.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (if used)](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes `httpie` plugins, these plugins might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the vulnerability in the plugin. It could lead to code execution within the application's context or other security issues by exploiting the `httpie` plugin system.

**Affected Component:** The `httpie` plugin loading mechanism and the specific plugin(s) being used.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Only use trusted and well-maintained `httpie` plugins.
*   Keep `httpie` plugins updated.
*   Review plugin code if possible.

## Threat: [Local File Inclusion/Exfiltration via `--download`](./threats/local_file_inclusionexfiltration_via__--download_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows user-controlled URLs to be used with `httpie`'s `--download` functionality, an attacker might be able to download local files from the server running the application by providing a `file://` URL to `httpie`.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive local files, including configuration files, source code, or other internal data due to misuse of `httpie`'s download feature.

**Affected Component:** The `--download` functionality of `httpie`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid allowing user-controlled URLs with `httpie`'s `--download` option.
*   Strict URL validation and sanitization if using `--download` with external input.
