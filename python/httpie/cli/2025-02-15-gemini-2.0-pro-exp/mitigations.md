# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for httpie/cli

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Data (CLI Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/use_environment_variables_for_sensitive_data__cli_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine all sensitive information used in `httpie` *commands*, such as API keys, tokens, passwords, and potentially sensitive request bodies.
    2.  **Define Environment Variables:** For each piece of sensitive data, create a corresponding environment variable. Use descriptive names (e.g., `MY_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`).
    3.  **Set Environment Variables:** Set the environment variables in your *current shell session* or your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`) for persistent use.  For temporary use, set them directly in the shell before running `httpie`.
        *   **Example (Bash):** `export MY_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key"`
    4.  **Modify `httpie` Commands:** Replace hardcoded sensitive values in your `httpie` *commands* with the corresponding environment variables.
        *   **Example:** `http POST example.com/api/resource Authorization:"Bearer $MY_API_KEY"`
    5.  **Test:** Verify that the commands work correctly with the environment variables.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Shell History (Severity: High):** Prevents secrets from being stored in plain text in shell history files.
    *   **Accidental Disclosure of Secrets (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of accidentally sharing secrets through screenshots, screen sharing, or copy-pasting commands.
    *   **Credential Theft (Severity: High):** If a system is compromised, secrets stored in environment variables are slightly less directly exposed than those hardcoded in scripts or history.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Shell History:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated if implemented correctly).
    *   **Accidental Disclosure of Secrets:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Risk reduced, although environment variables can still be accessed by processes running with the same user privileges.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Environment variables are used for some API keys in the `integration_tests.sh` script, but not consistently across all scripts and documentation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in `example_usage.sh` script, where API keys are hardcoded.
    *   Missing in documentation examples, which should be updated to demonstrate the use of environment variables.
    *   Missing in some developer workflows; developers may be hardcoding secrets in their local shells.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize `httpie` Sessions (CLI Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize__httpie__sessions__cli_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Recurring Parameters:** Determine which headers, authentication details, and other parameters are frequently used across multiple `httpie` *requests*.
    2.  **Create a Session File:** Use the `--session` flag with `httpie` *on the command line* to create a named session file.  This file will store the specified parameters.
        *   **Example:** `http --session=my-project-session POST example.com/api/login Authorization:"Bearer $INITIAL_TOKEN"`
    3.  **Store Sensitive Data in the Session:** Include authentication headers, cookies, and other persistent data in the initial *command* that creates the session.
    4.  **Use the Session in Subsequent Requests:** Use the `--session=my-project-session` flag (or `-S my-project-session`) in subsequent `httpie` *commands* to automatically include the stored parameters.
        *   **Example:** `http --session=my-project-session GET example.com/api/data`
    5. **Session Naming:** Use descriptive session names to easily identify their purpose when using the *command line*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Shell History (Severity: High):** Keeps sensitive headers and authentication details out of the shell history.
    *   **Accidental Disclosure of Secrets (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of accidentally sharing secrets.
    *   **Repetitive Typing of Credentials (Severity: Low):** Improves developer efficiency and reduces the chance of typos.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Shell History:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Accidental Disclosure of Secrets:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Repetitive Typing of Credentials:** Risk eliminated.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. No session files are currently used in the project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing entirely.  The project should adopt sessions for all API interactions that require authentication or persistent headers.  This should be documented and enforced in development guidelines.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement `--check-status` (or `-c`) (CLI Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/implement__--check-status___or__-c____cli_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Operations:** Determine which `httpie` *commands* perform actions that could have significant consequences if they fail (e.g., `DELETE`, `PUT`, `PATCH`).
    2.  **Add `--check-status`:** Include the `--check-status` (or `-c`) flag in these critical `httpie` *commands* *typed on the command line*.
        *   **Example:** `http --check-status DELETE example.com/api/resource/123`

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion (Severity: Medium):** Helps prevent unintended changes if the API returns an error (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request).
    *   **Silent Failures (Severity: Medium):** Ensures that errors are not ignored, allowing for proper error handling and logging.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion:** Risk reduced, but not eliminated (it only checks the HTTP status code, not the actual response body).
    *   **Silent Failures:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.  `httpie` commands are not consistently checked for their status codes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in all scripts and command-line usage.  Should be added to all critical operations (especially `DELETE`, `PUT`, `PATCH`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Confirmation Prompts (Wrapper Script - CLI Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/confirmation_prompts__wrapper_script_-_cli_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a Wrapper Script:** Write a shell script (e.g., `myhttp.sh`) that wraps the `httpie` command.  This script *will be used on the command line instead of `httpie` directly*.
    2.  **Identify Destructive Verbs:**  Within the script, identify HTTP verbs that are considered destructive (e.g., `DELETE`, `PUT`, `PATCH`).
    3.  **Implement Confirmation Logic:**  For these verbs, add logic to prompt the user for confirmation before executing the `httpie` command.
        *   **Example (Bash):**
            ```bash
            myhttp() {
              if [[ "$1" == "DELETE" || "$1" == "PUT" || "$1" == "PATCH" ]]; then
                read -r -p "Are you sure you want to proceed with $1 to $2? [y/N] " response
                if [[ "$response" =~ ^([yY][eE][sS]|[yY])$ ]]; then
                  http "$@"
                else
                  echo "Operation cancelled."
                fi
              else
                http "$@"
              fi
            }
            ```
    4.  **Handle User Input:**  Process the user's response (e.g., "y" or "n").  If the user confirms, execute the `httpie` command.  Otherwise, cancel the operation.
    5.  **Pass Arguments:** Ensure the wrapper script correctly passes all arguments to the underlying `httpie` command.
    6.  **Source or Alias:** Source the wrapper script in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`) or create an alias to make it easily accessible *from the command line*.
        *   **Example (Bash):** `alias myhttp=~/path/to/myhttp.sh`

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion (Severity: High):** Provides a final safeguard against unintended destructive actions.
    *   **Typos in Commands (Severity: Medium):** Gives the user a chance to review the command before execution.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Typos in Commands:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. No wrapper script with confirmation prompts exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing entirely.  A wrapper script should be created and documented for all developers to use.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `--verify=no` (or `--insecure`) (CLI Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__--verify=no___or__--insecure____cli_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Existing Usage:** When using `httpie` *on the command line*, consciously avoid using `--verify=no` or `--insecure`.
    2.  **Use `--verify=<path/to/cert>` (if needed):** If you *must* use a custom CA certificate or a self-signed certificate for *command-line testing*, use the `--verify` option with the path to the certificate file.
        *   **Example:** `http --verify=/path/to/my-ca.pem GET https://example.com`
    3. **Understand the Risks:** Be fully aware of the security implications of disabling certificate verification before even considering it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Severity: High):** Ensures that `httpie` verifies the server's SSL/TLS certificate, preventing MITM attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated if certificate verification is enabled and properly configured).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Mostly implemented.  `--verify=no` is not used in the main codebase, but it might be used in ad-hoc testing or by developers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing explicit documentation and automated checks to prevent the use of `--verify=no` in production.  Developer guidelines should explicitly forbid its use except in controlled testing environments.
