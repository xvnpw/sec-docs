# Threat Model Analysis for httpie/cli

## Threat: [Threat 1: Command Injection via Unsanitized URL](./threats/threat_1_command_injection_via_unsanitized_url.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious URL containing shell commands as part of the URL. The application directly interpolates this URL into the `httpie` command string without proper escaping or sanitization. The attacker's injected commands are executed on the system running the application, leveraging the shell execution context that `httpie` is invoked within.  Example: `http://example.com; rm -rf /`.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application. Potential for data theft, system destruction, or further network compromise.
*   **Affected CLI Component:** The core command-line parsing and execution mechanism *of the calling application*.  The vulnerability lies in how the application constructs the command string passed to the operating system's shell (e.g., via `subprocess.run` in Python), *not* within `httpie` itself. However, `httpie` is the vehicle for the injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **1.  Argument List:** Use the subprocess library's API to pass arguments as a *list* of strings, *never* a concatenated string. (e.g., `subprocess.run(["http", "http://example.com"], ...)`).
    *   **2.  Input Validation:**  Rigorously validate the URL using a robust URL parsing library. Ensure it conforms to expected schemes, has a valid hostname, and contains *no* shell metacharacters.
    *   **3.  Whitelisting:** If feasible, whitelist allowed URLs or URL patterns.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Command Injection via Unsanitized Options](./threats/threat_2_command_injection_via_unsanitized_options.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows users to specify `httpie` options. An attacker injects malicious options or option values to alter `httpie`'s behavior.  This leverages `httpie`'s features for malicious purposes. Examples include `--output /etc/passwd` (overwriting a system file), `--download` (saving a malicious file), or using `--form` with crafted input to bypass intended data formatting.
*   **Impact:** Varies. Could include data disclosure (reading arbitrary files), file system modification (overwriting/creating files), denial of service (disk space exhaustion), or potentially elevation of privilege.
*   **Affected CLI Component:** `httpie`'s option parsing and handling. Specifically, options that control file I/O (`--output`, `--download`), request modification (`--headers`, `--form`, `--auth`), and similar features.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **1.  Option Whitelisting:** Strictly control which `httpie` options are allowed. Whitelist permitted options and their allowed values. Reject any unapproved options.
    *   **2.  Argument Validation:** For allowed options, validate the user-provided arguments.  For example, if `--output` is allowed, ensure the filename is safe and avoids path traversal (e.g., `../`).
    *   **3.  Configuration-Driven:** Define allowed `httpie` invocations in a configuration file, rather than dynamically constructing them from user input.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Environment Variable Manipulation](./threats/threat_3_environment_variable_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker influences the environment variables of the process running the application. They modify `httpie`-related environment variables (`HTTPIE_CONFIG_DIR`, `HTTPIE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS`, `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`) to alter `httpie`'s behavior.  Example: Setting `HTTPIE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` to include `--output /tmp/malicious.txt` or changing proxy settings.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the manipulated variable. Can lead to file system modification, data disclosure, or bypassing security controls (like proxy settings).
*   **Affected CLI Component:** `httpie`'s reliance on environment variables for configuration. Components that read these variables (config loading, proxy handling, default option handling).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **1.  Environment Sanitization:** Before invoking `httpie`, explicitly clear or set relevant environment variables to known-good values. Do *not* rely on the inherited environment.
    *   **2.  Restricted Environment:** Run `httpie` in a restricted environment (e.g., a container) with minimal environment variables.
    *   **3.  Configuration File:** Use a configuration file for `httpie` settings, rather than environment variables.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Session File Exposure](./threats/threat_4_session_file_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses `httpie`'s session features (`--session` or `--session-read-only`). Session files (containing cookies, authentication data) are stored insecurely (e.g., world-readable directories) or with weak permissions. An attacker accesses these files.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking. The attacker can read the session file and impersonate the authenticated user, gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Affected CLI Component:** `httpie`'s session management (`--session`, `--session-read-only`). Components that read/write session data to files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **1.  Secure Storage:** Store session files in secure, restricted directories with appropriate permissions (only readable/writable by the application's user).
    *   **2.  Dedicated Storage:** Consider a secure storage mechanism (database, key-value store) instead of files.
    *   **3.  Ephemeral Sessions:** Use ephemeral (in-memory) sessions when possible.
    *   **4.  Short-Lived Sessions:** Configure sessions to expire quickly.

## Threat: [Threat 5: Proxy Bypass](./threats/threat_5_proxy_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** The application intends to use a proxy, but an attacker manipulates `httpie`'s options or environment to bypass it. This could involve injecting `--no-proxy` or modifying `http_proxy`/`https_proxy` environment variables.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls. The attacker communicates directly with the target, potentially bypassing firewalls, intrusion detection, or other proxy-enforced security.
*   **Affected CLI Component:** `httpie`'s proxy handling, influenced by options (`--proxy`, `--no-proxy`) and environment variables (`http_proxy`, `https_proxy`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **1.  Explicit Proxy Configuration:** Set proxy settings explicitly in the application's code, *not* relying on environment variables or user input.
    *   **2.  Disable Proxy Options:** Prevent users from controlling proxy-related options.
    *   **3.  Environment Sanitization:** Clear or explicitly set `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` before invoking `httpie`.
