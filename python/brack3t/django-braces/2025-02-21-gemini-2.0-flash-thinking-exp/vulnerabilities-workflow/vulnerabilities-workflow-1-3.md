## Vulnerability List for django-braces Project

There are no identified vulnerabilities with a rank of high or critical in the django-braces project based on the provided project files that are introduced by the project itself and not due to developer misuse, missing documentation, or denial of service.

After a thorough review of the source code and project files, focusing on potential security issues introduced by the library's mixins, no exploitable vulnerabilities that meet the specified criteria were found. The mixins primarily provide convenience and code reusability for Django class-based views, focusing on access control, AJAX handling, form processing, and query optimization.

The analysis considered potential risks such as:
- **SQL Injection:** In `OrderableListMixin`, the validation against `orderable_columns` prevents direct SQL injection, assuming developers correctly populate `orderable_columns` with safe column names.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** No mixins directly handle user input rendering in templates in a way that would introduce XSS. Template rendering and input sanitization are Django's responsibility, not the mixins'.
- **Open Redirects:** While mixins like `AnonymousRequiredMixin` and `CanonicalSlugDetailMixin` involve redirects, the redirect URLs are either developer-configured or constructed using Django's URL reversing, which are not directly vulnerable to open redirects without developer misconfiguration.
- **CSRF Bypass:** `CsrfExemptMixin` explicitly disables CSRF protection, which is a security consideration, but it is a feature provided for specific use cases and not a vulnerability in itself. Developers are expected to use it consciously.
- **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Access control mixins (`LoginRequiredMixin`, `PermissionRequiredMixin`, etc.) rely on Django's authentication and authorization framework. They correctly implement checks based on user authentication, permissions, and group memberships. No inherent bypass vulnerabilities were identified in these mixins.
- **Header Injection:** `HeaderMixin` allows setting custom headers, but the header values are expected to be set by the developer, not directly from user input, thus preventing header injection vulnerabilities in the library itself.

In summary, `django-braces` appears to be a reasonably secure library. The mixins provide useful abstractions without introducing high or critical vulnerabilities when used as intended. Any potential security issues would likely stem from misconfiguration or misuse of the library by developers, which falls outside the scope of vulnerabilities introduced by the project itself as per the prompt's criteria.

Therefore, based on the provided files and the prompt's constraints, there are no vulnerabilities to list for the django-braces project.
