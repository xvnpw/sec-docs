### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Predictable Django SECRET_KEY in default docker-compose configuration
- Description:
    - The default `docker-compose.yml` file sets the Django `SECRET_KEY` environment variable to `local`.
    - If a user deploys a project generated by this cookiecutter template to a production environment using the default `docker-compose.yml` without changing this value, the Django application will be using a publicly known and easily guessable secret key.
    - An attacker can exploit this predictable `SECRET_KEY` to compromise the application's security.
- Impact:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can forge session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts without needing credentials.
    - **CSRF Bypass:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection can be bypassed, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
    - **Data Tampering:** If the application uses the `SECRET_KEY` for cryptographic signing or encryption (e.g., in custom code or third-party libraries), attackers can forge signatures or decrypt sensitive data.
    - **Unpredictable behavior:** Some Django applications or third-party libraries might rely on the `SECRET_KEY` for security in unexpected ways, leading to further vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The default template configuration directly introduces this vulnerability.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Strong SECRET_KEY Generation during Project Setup:** The cookiecutter template should automatically generate a strong, random `SECRET_KEY` during project scaffolding and configure the project to use this generated key.
    - **Documentation Warning:** The documentation should explicitly warn users against using the default `docker-compose.yml` configuration in production and strongly emphasize the critical need to change the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` to a strong, randomly generated value.
    - **Secure Default docker-compose.yml:** The `docker-compose.yml` should be modified to either:
        - Not include a default `SECRET_KEY` at all, forcing users to explicitly set it.
        - Instruct users to set the `SECRET_KEY` via environment variables from outside the `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., using `.env` files or system environment variables), making it less likely to be accidentally committed to version control with a default value.
- Preconditions:
    - The application is deployed to a publicly accessible instance.
    - The deployed instance is running with the default `docker-compose.yml` configuration without modification of the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/{{cookiecutter.github_repository_name}}/docker-compose.yml`
    - Line:
      ```yaml
      - DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=local
      ```
    - Analysis:
        - The `docker-compose.yml` file, intended for local development and easily mistaken for production deployment configuration, directly sets the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` environment variable to the weak and predictable value `local`.
        - Django's security relies heavily on the secrecy of the `SECRET_KEY`. This setting makes the `SECRET_KEY` publicly known as it is part of the template repository.
        - An attacker can easily find this default configuration by inspecting the template repository or by simply guessing common default values.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Deploy the Application:** Generate a project using the `cookiecutter-django-rest` template with default settings. Deploy this generated application to a publicly accessible server using the provided `docker-compose.yml` without modifying the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    2. **Access the Application:** Open a web browser and access the deployed application.
    3. **Obtain a CSRF Token (Optional but illustrative):**  If there is a form in the application, inspect the HTML source code of the page. Look for a CSRF token, usually within a hidden input field named `csrfmiddlewaretoken`. Copy the value of this token. While not strictly necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability, this step can be used to later show how CSRF protection is compromised.
    4. **Predict the SECRET_KEY:** The `SECRET_KEY` is predictably `local` as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.
    5. **Attempt to Forge a Session (Advanced and depends on application specifics):**  This step is more complex and requires knowledge of Django's session signing mechanism. Using the known `SECRET_KEY` (`local`), attempt to forge a Django session cookie. If successful, you could potentially gain access to the application as another user.
    6. **Attempt CSRF Bypass (Advanced and depends on application specifics):** If the application has CSRF protection enabled (which is default in Django), try to bypass it. For example, if you obtained a CSRF token in step 3, try to submit a form without this token or with a modified token, and observe if the application still processes the request due to the compromised `SECRET_KEY`.
