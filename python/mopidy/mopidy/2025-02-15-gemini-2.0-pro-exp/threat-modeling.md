# Threat Model Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Threat: [Malicious Extension Impersonating Spotify](./threats/malicious_extension_impersonating_spotify.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Mopidy extension that mimics the official `mopidy-spotify` extension. The attacker distributes this extension through a compromised third-party repository or via social engineering, tricking users into installing it. The malicious extension intercepts Spotify login credentials entered by the user.
*   **Impact:** Theft of user's Spotify credentials, potential unauthorized access to the user's Spotify account, and potential for further attacks using the stolen credentials.
*   **Affected Component:** `mopidy.ext` (extension loading mechanism), potentially any extension interacting with external services (e.g., `mopidy-spotify`, `mopidy-youtube`, etc.). Specifically, the `setup()` function within a malicious extension.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement a mechanism for verifying extension signatures or checksums before loading. Provide a curated list of trusted extensions.
    *   **User:** Only install extensions from the official Mopidy extension registry or trusted sources. Verify the extension's author and reviews before installation. Manually inspect the extension's source code (if possible) for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering - Audio Output Redirection](./threats/configuration_file_tampering_-_audio_output_redirection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Mopidy configuration file (typically `~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf`) and modifies the `[audio]` section, specifically the `output` setting. They change the output to a remote server or a null sink, effectively hijacking or silencing the audio stream.
*   **Impact:** Loss of audio output, potential for the attacker to record the audio stream if redirected to a malicious server. Disruption of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `mopidy.config` (configuration parsing and handling), `mopidy.audio` (audio output management). Specifically, the `output` setting within the `[audio]` section of the configuration file.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement file integrity monitoring for the configuration file. Consider using a more secure configuration storage mechanism (e.g., encrypted configuration).
    *   **User:** Restrict file system permissions on the configuration file and its parent directory (e.g., `chmod 600 ~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf`). Regularly back up the configuration file. Use a configuration management tool to enforce a secure baseline.

## Threat: [DoS via Malformed Playlist - Resource Exhaustion](./threats/dos_via_malformed_playlist_-_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted playlist to the Mopidy server. This playlist might contain an extremely large number of tracks, tracks with invalid URIs, or tracks that trigger known bugs in specific backend extensions (e.g., `mopidy-local`, `mopidy-spotify`). The goal is to consume excessive CPU, memory, or network bandwidth, causing Mopidy to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service; Mopidy becomes unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Affected Component:** `mopidy.core.tracklist` (playlist management), `mopidy.backend` (various backend implementations), potentially specific backend extensions (e.g., `mopidy-local` if handling local files, `mopidy-spotify` if handling Spotify tracks). Functions related to adding tracks to the tracklist and resolving URIs are particularly vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement input validation for playlists (limit the number of tracks, validate URIs). Implement resource limits and quotas for playlist processing. Thoroughly test backend extensions for robustness against malformed input. Use a robust asynchronous processing model to prevent blocking operations from affecting the entire server.
    *   **User:** If using a web interface, ensure it implements rate limiting and input validation for playlist submissions.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure - API Key Leakage in Logs](./threats/information_disclosure_-_api_key_leakage_in_logs.md)

*   **Description:** A Mopidy extension (e.g., `mopidy-spotify`, `mopidy-youtube`) logs API keys or other sensitive credentials in plain text during normal operation or when encountering errors. An attacker gains access to the Mopidy log files (e.g., `~/.cache/mopidy/mopidy.log`).
*   **Impact:** Exposure of API keys, potentially leading to unauthorized access to external services and compromise of user accounts.
*   **Affected Component:** Any extension that interacts with external services requiring authentication (e.g., `mopidy-spotify`, `mopidy-youtube`, `mopidy-soundcloud`). Specifically, any logging statements within these extensions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** *Never* log API keys or other sensitive credentials. Use secure methods for storing and handling credentials (e.g., environment variables, a dedicated secrets management system). Implement log redaction or masking to prevent sensitive data from being written to logs. Thoroughly review extension code for any logging of sensitive information.
    *   **User:** Restrict file system permissions on the log files. Regularly rotate and archive log files. Consider using a centralized logging system with access controls.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Vulnerable Extension](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_vulnerable_extension.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Mopidy extension (e.g., a buffer overflow, command injection, or path traversal vulnerability) to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Mopidy process. If Mopidy is running as a privileged user (e.g., root), the attacker could gain full control of the system.
*   **Impact:** Potential for complete system compromise, depending on the privileges of the Mopidy process.
*   **Affected Component:** Any vulnerable extension. The specific vulnerable function or code within the extension would depend on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if Mopidy runs as root), High (if Mopidy runs as a non-root user with significant privileges)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Follow secure coding practices when developing extensions (avoid buffer overflows, validate input, sanitize output, etc.). Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of extensions. Run Mopidy and its extensions with the least privilege necessary. Implement sandboxing or containerization to isolate extensions.
    *   **User:** Run Mopidy as a dedicated, non-privileged user. Regularly update extensions to receive security patches. Carefully vet extensions before installation.
