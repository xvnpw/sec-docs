# Attack Surface Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Attack Surface: [Malicious/Vulnerable Extensions](./attack_surfaces/maliciousvulnerable_extensions.md)

**Description:** Mopidy's extension system allows third-party code to run within the Mopidy process. This is the most significant Mopidy-specific attack vector.
    *   **How Mopidy Contributes:** Mopidy's core architecture is built around extensions. This is a *direct* contribution.
    *   **Example:** A malicious extension, disguised as a legitimate backend, steals user credentials or exfiltrates local files. A legitimate extension with a remote code execution vulnerability is exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, credential theft, lateral movement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Rigorous code reviews, security testing, secure coding practices, least privilege, sandboxing (if feasible).
        *   **User:** Install only from trusted sources, review permissions, keep extensions updated, remove unused extensions, monitor system behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Manipulation (with Mopidy-specific consequences)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_manipulation__with_mopidy-specific_consequences_.md)

**Description:** Attackers with write access to `mopidy.conf` can alter Mopidy's behavior, *specifically* impacting Mopidy's internal operation.
    *   **How Mopidy Contributes:** Mopidy's reliance on the configuration file for core settings (backends, frontends, extensions) is a direct contribution. The *way* Mopidy uses this file is key.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies `mopidy.conf` to *disable* security-related extensions or to *load* a malicious extension, bypassing normal installation procedures. This is distinct from simply changing a backend's URL (which is more about the backend than Mopidy itself).
    *   **Impact:** Disabling security features, loading malicious code, altering core Mopidy behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Secure default configurations, document secure practices, consider tamper detection.
        *   **User:** Strict file permissions, dedicated user account, regular audits, configuration management, read-only mount (if feasible).

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated/Weakly Authenticated Frontends (Mopidy-provided)](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticatedweakly_authenticated_frontends__mopidy-provided_.md)

**Description:** Mopidy frontends (HTTP, MPD) *provided by Mopidy or its extensions* that lack proper authentication are vulnerable.
    *   **How Mopidy Contributes:** Mopidy (or its extensions) *implements* these frontends. This is a direct contribution.
    *   **Example:** The `Mopidy-HTTP` extension, if not configured with authentication, allows anyone on the network to control Mopidy. The `Mopidy-MPD` extension, with weak or no authentication, allows unauthorized MPD clients to connect.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized control of Mopidy, access to connected services (indirectly, through Mopidy), potential for further exploitation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Strong authentication by default, clear documentation, secure coding practices.
        *   **User:** Enable authentication, strong passwords, reverse proxy (for added security), firewall restrictions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Frontend Protocol Implementations (Mopidy-provided)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_frontend_protocol_implementations__mopidy-provided_.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the *implementation* of frontend protocols (MPD, HTTP) within Mopidy or its extensions.
    *   **How Mopidy Contributes:** Mopidy (or its extensions) *writes the code* that handles these protocols. This is a direct contribution.
    *   **Example:** A command injection vulnerability in the `Mopidy-MPD` extension's handling of MPD commands allows remote code execution. A buffer overflow in the `Mopidy-HTTP` extension's handling of HTTP requests.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure (if the vulnerability leaks internal Mopidy data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Input validation, secure coding practices, error handling, security audits, penetration testing, keep dependencies updated.
        *   **User:** Keep Mopidy and extensions updated, monitor advisories, firewall, reverse proxy.
