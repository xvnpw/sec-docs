# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Extension Selection and Management](./mitigation_strategies/careful_extension_selection_and_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Policy:** Create a written policy for extension selection, outlining criteria like source trustworthiness, maintenance activity, and security reputation.
    2.  **Source Verification:** Only download extensions from the official Mopidy extension registry or well-known, reputable GitHub repositories.
    3.  **Maintenance Check:** Before installing, check the extension's repository for recent commits, open issues, and responsiveness from the maintainer.  Avoid extensions with no recent activity.
    4.  **Community Review:** Search for discussions or reviews of the extension online (forums, Reddit, etc.) to gauge its reputation and identify any known issues.
    5.  **Staging Environment:** Install and test new extensions in a separate, isolated staging environment *before* deploying them to the production Mopidy instance. This could involve a separate Mopidy instance with a different configuration.
    6.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review the list of installed extensions (`mopidyctl config` can help) and remove any that are no longer needed or have become unmaintained.
    7.  **Dependency Auditing:** Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` regularly. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline if you have one.  For example: `pip install pip-audit && pip-audit -r requirements.txt`. This checks the dependencies *of* Mopidy and its extensions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Malicious extensions could run arbitrary code.
    *   **Data Leakage (Severity: High/Critical):** Extensions could leak sensitive data.
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: High):** Poorly written extensions could cause crashes.
    *   **Command Injection (Severity: High):** Extensions might be vulnerable to command injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk reduced (extension-dependent).

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Basic policy documented in the project's README.
    *   `requirements.txt` file lists core dependencies.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   No formal process for reviewing new extensions.
    *   No staging environment.
    *   Dependency auditing is not automated.
    *   No regular audits of installed extensions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Mopidy Configuration (mopidy.conf)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_mopidy_configuration__mopidy_conf_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Interface Binding:** In `mopidy.conf`, set the `mpd/hostname` and `http/hostname` options to `127.0.0.1` (or `::1` for IPv6) if Mopidy only needs to be accessed locally.  If remote access is *required*, use a specific, trusted IP address instead of `0.0.0.0` (which listens on all interfaces).  This is a *direct* Mopidy configuration change.
    2.  **MPD Authentication:** If using the MPD protocol and allowing remote access, set a strong password in the `mpd/password` option in `mopidy.conf`. This is a *direct* configuration setting within Mopidy.
    3.  **TLS/SSL for HTTP (If Using Mopidy's Built-in HTTP Server):**  If using Mopidy's *built-in* HTTP frontend (not a reverse proxy), obtain a valid SSL certificate and configure Mopidy to use it.  Set the `http/scheme` to `https` and configure the `http/cert_file` and `http/key_file` options in `mopidy.conf`.  This is a *direct* configuration of Mopidy's HTTP server.
    4. **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Instead of storing API keys, passwords, and other secrets directly in `mopidy.conf`, use environment variables. For example, instead of `spotify/client_id = your_client_id`, set an environment variable `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id` and use `$SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` in `mopidy.conf`. Mopidy supports environment variable substitution.
    5. **File Permissions:** Set permissions on `mopidy.conf` to `600` (or `rw-------`) on Linux/macOS. This is technically an OS-level setting, but it *directly* protects the Mopidy configuration file. Use `chmod 600 /path/to/mopidy.conf`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High/Critical):** Attackers could gain control if Mopidy is exposed without authentication or proper interface binding.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Severity: High):** Without TLS/SSL, attackers could intercept communication (only relevant if using Mopidy's built-in HTTP server).
    *   **Credential Theft (Severity: High/Critical):** Attackers could read `mopidy.conf` and steal API keys.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (Severity: Medium/High):** Attackers could modify the configuration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk dramatically reduced.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk eliminated (with TLS/SSL on Mopidy's HTTP server).
    *   **Credential Theft:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Configuration Tampering:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Mopidy is bound to `0.0.0.0`.
    * File permissions set to 644.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   No TLS/SSL encryption for the built-in HTTP frontend.
    *   No MPD password configured.
    *   Secrets (API keys) are stored directly in `mopidy.conf`.
    *   File permissions are too permissive.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits (for the Mopidy Process)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits__for_the_mopidy_process_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`ulimit` (Linux):** If running Mopidy directly on a Linux system (not in a container), use the `ulimit` command to set resource limits for the Mopidy process.  This can be done in the systemd service file (if using systemd) or in a startup script.  For example:
        *   `ulimit -n 1024` (limits the number of open file descriptors)
        *   `ulimit -u 100` (limits the number of processes the Mopidy user can create)
        *   `ulimit -v 1048576` (limits virtual memory size to 1GB, in KB)
    2.  **systemd Service Configuration (Recommended for systemd systems):** If Mopidy is managed by systemd, use the resource control directives in the service file (`/etc/systemd/system/mopidy.service` or similar).  Examples:
        ```
        [Service]
        ...
        LimitNOFILE=1024
        LimitNPROC=100
        MemoryLimit=1G
        CPUQuota=50%
        ```
    3. **Containerization (Docker, etc.):** If running Mopidy within a container, use the container runtime's resource limiting features (e.g., Docker's `--memory`, `--cpus` options). While this isn't *directly* modifying Mopidy, it *is* directly controlling the resources available to the Mopidy process.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: High):** Attackers could flood the server, consuming resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   No resource limits set via `ulimit` or systemd.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation in Extensions (Indirect, but Mopidy-Related)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_in_extensions__indirect__but_mopidy-related_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Extension Code Review (If Possible):** If you develop your *own* Mopidy extensions, or if you have the resources to review third-party extensions, examine how they handle any form of input.
    2. **Sanitize Input (Within Extensions):** Within *your own* extensions, *always* sanitize any data used to interact with external systems or construct commands. Use appropriate escaping or encoding.
    3. **Principle of Least Privilege (for the Mopidy User):** Ensure that the Mopidy process, and therefore its extensions, run with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Don't run Mopidy as root. This limits damage from injection vulnerabilities. This is an OS-level setting, but it *directly impacts* the security of Mopidy and its extensions.
    4. **Parameterized Queries (If Applicable, Within Extensions):** If an extension interacts with a database, use parameterized queries.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Command Injection (Severity: High):** Attackers could inject commands.
    * **SQL Injection (Severity: High/Critical):** Attackers could inject SQL code.
    * **Other Injection Vulnerabilities (Severity: Varies):**

* **Impact:**
    * **Injection Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced by careful coding within extensions and least privilege.

* **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *  Unknown (depends on each individual extension).

* **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *  No formal code review process for extensions (especially custom ones).
    *  No guidelines for secure coding for extension developers.
