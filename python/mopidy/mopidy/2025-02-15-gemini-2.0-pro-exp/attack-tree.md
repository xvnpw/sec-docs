## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Weak/No Authentication on JSON-RPC Interface](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_weakno_authentication_on_json-rpc_interface.md)

*   **Description:**  The Mopidy JSON-RPC interface, if exposed without proper authentication, allows *anyone* with network access to send commands to the server. This is the most direct and easiest attack vector.
    *   **Sub-Steps:**
        *   **1.1.1.1 Send Play/Pause/Skip Commands:**  An attacker can directly control playback, starting, stopping, pausing, and skipping tracks.
        *   **1.1.1.2 Modify Playlists (Add/Remove Tracks):**  An attacker can add or remove tracks from playlists, potentially disrupting service or injecting malicious content (if the playlist is used to load files).
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if default config or misconfigured)
    *   **Impact:** High (full control of playback)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (basic network tools)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if monitoring network traffic or API calls) / Hard (if no monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Weak/No Authentication (same as 1.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_weakno_authentication__same_as_1_1_1_.md)

*   **Description:**  The same lack of authentication on the JSON-RPC interface allows an attacker to access sensitive information, such as the tracklist and playlists.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if default config or misconfigured)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (exposure of user's music library)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium / Hard (same as 1.1.1)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Send Large Number of Requests to Mopidy Core API](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_send_large_number_of_requests_to_mopidy_core_api.md)

*   **Description:**  A simple denial-of-service attack where the attacker floods the Mopidy server with requests, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory).
    *   **Sub-Steps:**
        *   **3.1.1.1 Overload Server Resources (CPU, Memory):**  The server becomes unresponsive due to the high volume of requests.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium (temporary service disruption)
    *   **Effort:** Low (basic scripting)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (high traffic volume)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Mopidy Versions](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_mopidy_versions.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in unpatched versions of Mopidy or its dependencies.
    *   **Sub-Steps:**
        *   **1.1.3.1 CVE-XXXX-YYYY (Example):**  A specific vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow) is exploited to gain control.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on vulnerability and patch status)
    *   **Impact:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability, could be High or Very High)
    *   **Effort:** Variable (depends on vulnerability, could be Low to High)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert (depends on vulnerability)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable (depends on vulnerability and monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Directory Traversal Vulnerability in a Backend (e.g., Local Files)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_directory_traversal_vulnerability_in_a_backend__e_g___local_files_.md)

*   **Description:**  If a backend (like the "local" file backend) has a directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker could access files *outside* the intended music directory.
    *   **Sub-Steps:**
        *   **2.1.2.1 Access Files Outside of Intended Music Directory:**  The attacker uses crafted requests to navigate the file system and access sensitive files.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires a specific vulnerability in a backend)
    *   **Impact:** High (potential access to arbitrary files)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (requires finding and exploiting the vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires file access monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 If Config File is Accessible via a Vulnerable Backend or Extension](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_if_config_file_is_accessible_via_a_vulnerable_backend_or_extension.md)

*   **Description:**  If the Mopidy configuration file (which might contain API keys, passwords, etc.) is accessible through a vulnerability, the attacker can gain highly sensitive information.
    *   **Sub-Steps:**
        *   **2.2.1.1 Retrieve API Keys, Passwords, etc.:**  The attacker obtains credentials that can be used to access other services or gain further control.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires multiple vulnerabilities)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (exposure of API keys, passwords, etc.)
    *   **Effort:** High (requires chaining vulnerabilities)
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires deep system monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (as in 1.1.3)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_exploit_known_vulnerabilities__as_in_1_1_3_.md)

*   **Description:** Same as 1.1.3, but focused on causing a denial of service by crashing Mopidy.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (same as 1.1.3)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (service disruption)
    *   **Effort:** Variable (same as 1.1.3)
    *   **Skill Level:** Variable (same as 1.1.3)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable (same as 1.1.3)

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1 Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1_remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:**  A very serious vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running Mopidy.
    *   **Sub-Steps:**
        *   **4.1.1.1 Gain Shell Access to the Host System:**  The attacker gains a command shell on the server, giving them full control.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (rare, but high impact)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires advanced intrusion detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2 If Mopidy Runs with Excessive Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_if_mopidy_runs_with_excessive_privileges.md)

*   **Description:** If Mopidy is running as root or with other unnecessary privileges, any compromise of Mopidy gives the attacker those same privileges.
    *   **Sub-Steps:**
        *   **4.2.1 Access System Resources Beyond Mopidy's Needs:** The attacker can access and modify system files, install software, etc.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (depends on configuration)
    *   **Impact:** High (potential for significant damage)
    *   **Effort:** Low (if Mopidy is already compromised)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires system monitoring)
