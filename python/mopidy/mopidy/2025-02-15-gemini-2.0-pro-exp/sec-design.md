Okay, let's create a design document for the Mopidy project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Mopidy is an open-source music server.  It's designed to be extensible and flexible, allowing users to play music from various sources (local files, streaming services, etc.) through a variety of outputs.  The primary business goals appear to be:

*   Provide a stable and reliable music playback experience.
*   Enable a wide range of integrations through a plugin architecture.
*   Maintain a vibrant and active open-source community.
*   Offer a user-friendly experience, even for users with limited technical expertise (within the context of a server application).

Based on these goals, the most important business risks are:

*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or instability.  This is particularly crucial for an open-source project that relies on community trust.
*   Loss of user base due to poor performance, lack of features, or difficulty of use.
*   Inability to attract and retain contributors due to a complex codebase or lack of clear direction.
*   Exposure of user data (though the data at risk is likely limited to music library metadata and potentially streaming service credentials, depending on the plugins used).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the GitHub repository, the following security controls and accepted risks are identified:

*   security control: Plugin Architecture: Mopidy's core is relatively small, with most functionality provided by extensions. This limits the attack surface of the core application. Location: Core design principle.
*   security control: Community Code Review: As an open-source project, Mopidy benefits from community code review, which can help identify and address vulnerabilities. Location: GitHub repository and contribution guidelines.
*   security control: Use of Python: Python is a generally memory-safe language, reducing the risk of certain types of vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows) compared to languages like C/C++. Location: Project codebase.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Plugin Security: The security of Mopidy is heavily dependent on the security of the plugins used.  Mopidy itself cannot guarantee the security of third-party extensions.
*   accepted risk: Local Network Exposure: Mopidy is typically run on a local network, and its security relies heavily on the security of that network.  It's not designed to be directly exposed to the public internet.
*   accepted risk: Limited Authentication/Authorization: The core Mopidy server has limited built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms. Security often relies on network-level controls or frontend implementations.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   Implement a security review process specifically for plugins, even if they are community-maintained. This could involve static analysis, guidelines for secure coding practices, and a reporting mechanism for vulnerabilities.
*   Provide clear documentation on security best practices for users, including recommendations for network configuration, plugin selection, and credential management.
*   Consider adding optional authentication/authorization mechanisms to the core server, even if they are basic (e.g., a simple password-based system).

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The system should provide a mechanism for authenticating users, at least optionally. This could be through a local password, integration with an existing authentication system, or through specific frontend implementations.
    *   Authentication mechanisms should be configurable and extensible via the plugin system.
*   Authorization:
    *   The system should provide a mechanism for controlling access to resources (e.g., specific music files, playlists, or streaming services). This is likely to be implemented primarily through frontend applications and plugins.
    *   Authorization mechanisms should be configurable and extensible via the plugin system.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from external sources (e.g., network requests, plugin data) should be validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. This is particularly important for plugins that interact with external services.
    *   The core Mopidy server should provide a framework or guidelines for input validation to be used by plugins.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If sensitive data (e.g., streaming service credentials) is stored or transmitted, it should be protected using appropriate cryptographic techniques.
    *   The specific cryptographic methods used should be configurable and up-to-date.
    *   Plugins handling sensitive data should be carefully reviewed for secure credential management.

## DEPLOYMENT

Mopidy can be deployed in several ways:

1.  **Manual Installation:** Installing Mopidy and its dependencies directly on the host operating system (e.g., using `pip`).
2.  **Docker Container:** Running Mopidy within a Docker container. This provides isolation and simplifies dependency management.
3.  **Systemd Service:** Running Mopidy as a systemd service on Linux systems. This allows Mopidy to start automatically on boot and provides process management.

We'll describe the **Docker Container** deployment in detail, as it's a common and recommended approach.

## BUILD

Mopidy's build process primarily involves packaging the Python code and its dependencies. While the core repository doesn't have a complex CI/CD pipeline, many Mopidy extensions and related projects do. Here's a general overview, focusing on security aspects:

1.  **Development:** Developers write code and commit it to the GitHub repository.
2.  **Testing:** Unit tests and integration tests are run to ensure code quality. These tests are often automated using tools like `pytest` and `tox`.
3.  **Packaging:** The Python code is packaged into a distributable format (e.g., a wheel or source distribution) using tools like `setuptools`.
4.  **Publication:** The package is published to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

    GitHubRepository -- "Triggers" --> Testing
    Testing -- "Passes" --> Packaging

```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   security control: Code Review: All code changes are subject to review before being merged into the main branch.
*   security control: Automated Testing: Unit and integration tests help identify bugs and vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Dependencies are managed using `requirements.txt` or similar mechanisms, allowing for tracking and updating of dependencies.
*   security control: (Recommended) Static Analysis: Incorporate static analysis tools (e.g., Bandit for Python) into the build process to automatically detect potential security issues.
*   security control: (Recommended) Dependency Scanning: Use tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., safety, Dependabot).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Providing a reliable and stable music playback experience.
    *   Maintaining a healthy and active open-source community.
*   Data to Protect:
    *   Music library metadata (low sensitivity, but could reveal user preferences).
    *   Streaming service credentials (high sensitivity, if stored by plugins).  This is the most critical data to protect.
    *   User configuration data (low sensitivity).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   What specific frontend applications are commonly used with Mopidy? This will influence the threat model, as frontends handle user interaction and often authentication/authorization.
    *   Are there any plans to add more built-in security features to the core Mopidy server?
    *   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported in Mopidy or its extensions?
    *   What level of network security is assumed for typical deployments? (e.g., home network behind a firewall, public-facing server)
    *   What are the most popular Mopidy extensions, and have they undergone any security review?

*   Assumptions:
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: Mopidy is primarily used in home environments, not in high-security or enterprise settings. The primary concern is user experience and community reputation, not strict compliance with security regulations.
    *   SECURITY POSTURE: Users are responsible for securing their own networks and choosing trustworthy plugins. Mopidy's core provides a basic level of security, but relies heavily on external factors.
    *   DESIGN: The plugin architecture is a core design principle and will not be fundamentally changed. The focus is on providing a flexible and extensible platform, with security being a shared responsibility between the core, plugins, and users.
