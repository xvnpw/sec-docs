**5. Component Details**

*   **Core Mopidy Server:**
    *   The central processing unit of the music server.
    *   Manages the overall playback state (playing, paused, stopped), the current playlist, and the music library (aggregated from backends).
    *   Provides a well-defined API for frontends to send commands and receive status updates.
    *   Orchestrates interactions between frontends and backends, routing requests appropriately.
    *   Emits events to notify frontends about changes in playback state, track information, and other relevant occurrences.

*   **Extension Manager:**
    *   Responsible for discovering, loading, initializing, and managing extensions (both frontends and backends).
    *   Handles dependencies between extensions, ensuring that required components are available.
    *   Provides a registration mechanism for extensions to expose their functionality to the core and other extensions.
    *   Manages the lifecycle of extensions, including starting, stopping, and reloading them.

*   **Settings/Configuration:**
    *   Stores all configuration parameters for the Mopidy server and its extensions.
    *   Typically loaded from configuration files (e.g., `mopidy.conf`) upon server startup.
    *   Provides an API for accessing and potentially modifying settings (though direct modification is less common during runtime).
    *   Includes settings for enabling/disabling extensions, configuring backend accounts, network settings, and more.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   Provides the user interface through which users interact with Mopidy.
    *   Examples include:
        *   **MPD (Music Player Daemon) Clients:** Utilize a text-based protocol over TCP to send commands and receive status.
        *   **Web Clients:** Browser-based interfaces communicating via HTTP for initial page load and WebSockets for real-time updates and commands.
        *   **Mobile Apps:** Applications using custom protocols or existing Mopidy APIs to interact with the server.
    *   Translates user actions into commands for the Core Mopidy Server.
    *   Receives and displays state updates and data from the Core Mopidy Server to the user.

*   **Backend:**
    *   Provides the interface to specific music sources.
    *   Examples include:
        *   **Spotify Backend:** Connects to the Spotify streaming service using their API, handling authentication and playback.
        *   **Local Files Backend:** Accesses and plays music files stored on the server's local file system.
        *   **SoundCloud Backend:** Integrates with the SoundCloud streaming platform.
        *   **Internet Archive Backend:** Allows access to audio content from the Internet Archive.
        *   **TuneIn Backend:** Provides access to internet radio streams.
    *   Handles authentication and authorization with the respective music source, securely managing credentials.
    *   Retrieves metadata about tracks, albums, and artists from the source.
    *   Provides the actual audio stream data to the Core Mopidy Server for playback.

**6. Data Flow**

The following details the typical data flow patterns within the Mopidy system, providing more specific examples:

*   **User Initiated Playback of a Spotify Track:**
    1. A user interacts with a **Web Client Frontend**, clicking the "play" button for a Spotify track.
    2. The **Web Client Frontend** sends a command (e.g., `core.playback.play`, with the Spotify track URI) to the **Core Mopidy Server** via a WebSocket message.
    3. The **Core Mopidy Server** parses the command and identifies the **Spotify Backend** as the relevant source based on the track URI.
    4. The **Core Mopidy Server** requests the audio stream for the specified track from the **Spotify Backend**.
    5. The **Spotify Backend** authenticates with the Spotify service (if necessary) and retrieves the audio stream URL or data.
    6. The **Spotify Backend** provides the audio stream (or a URL to it) to the **Core Mopidy Server**.
    7. The **Core Mopidy Server** utilizes a multimedia framework (like GStreamer) to handle the audio output.
    8. The **Core Mopidy Server** sends a state update (e.g., `state: "playing"`, current track information) to the **Web Client Frontend** via a WebSocket message.
    9. The **Web Client Frontend** updates the user interface to reflect the playing status and track details.

*   **Browsing the Local Files Library:**
    1. A user interacts with an **MPD Client**, sending a command to browse the library.
    2. The **MPD Client** sends a browse request (e.g., `list album`) to the **Core Mopidy Server** via the MPD protocol.
    3. The **Core Mopidy Server** identifies the **Local Files Backend** as the relevant source for local files.
    4. The **Core Mopidy Server** requests a list of albums from the **Local Files Backend**.
    5. The **Local Files Backend** scans the configured local music directories and retrieves metadata about the albums.
    6. The **Local Files Backend** returns the album metadata to the **Core Mopidy Server**.
    7. The **Core Mopidy Server** formats the results according to the MPD protocol.
    8. The **Core Mopidy Server** sends the library data back to the **MPD Client**.
    9. The **MPD Client** displays the list of albums to the user.

*   **Mopidy Startup and Extension Loading:**
    1. When Mopidy starts, the **Core Mopidy Server** reads the configuration from the **Settings/Configuration**.
    2. The **Core Mopidy Server** initializes the **Extension Manager**.
    3. The **Extension Manager** uses the configuration to identify enabled frontends and backends.
    4. The **Extension Manager** loads the code for each enabled extension.
    5. Extensions register their functionality (e.g., backend capabilities, frontend API endpoints) with the **Core Mopidy Server**.
