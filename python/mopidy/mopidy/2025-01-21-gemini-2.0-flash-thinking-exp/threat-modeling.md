# Threat Model Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Extension](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_extension.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could create or compromise a Mopidy extension and trick a user or administrator into installing it. Upon loading, this malicious extension could execute arbitrary Python code within the Mopidy process. This could involve running system commands, installing malware, or accessing sensitive data on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server hosting Mopidy, data breaches, denial of service, potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mopidy.ext` module (extension loading mechanism), the entire Mopidy process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install extensions from trusted sources.
        *   Implement a review process for extensions before installation.
        *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of compromised extensions.
        *   Regularly audit installed extensions for suspicious activity.
        *   Run Mopidy with minimal privileges.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Vulnerable Extension](./threats/information_disclosure_via_vulnerable_extension.md)

*   **Description:** A poorly written or malicious extension could access sensitive information accessible to the Mopidy process, such as configuration details (including backend credentials), environment variables, or even data from other processes running under the same user. The attacker could then exfiltrate this data or use it for further attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials for backend services (e.g., Spotify, local file paths), potential for account takeover on other platforms, exposure of internal system information.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Individual extensions, the `mopidy.config` module, potentially backend modules accessed by the extension.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet extensions for their permissions and data access patterns.
        *   Implement strict permission management for extensions.
        *   Regularly review extension code for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor extension network activity for unusual outbound connections.

## Threat: [Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Control Interface](./threats/lack_of_authenticationauthorization_on_control_interface.md)

*   **Description:** If Mopidy's control interface (e.g., the HTTP or WebSocket interface) is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, anyone with network access could control the music server. An attacker could start/stop playback, change volume, add tracks, or perform other actions, potentially disrupting service or using it for malicious purposes.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized control of music playback, potential for denial of service, unauthorized access to any functionalities exposed through the control interface.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mopidy.http`, `mopidy.mpd` (if enabled), any other control interface implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms on the control interface (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Implement authorization policies to control which users or applications can perform specific actions.
        *   Ensure the control interface is not publicly accessible without proper security measures.
