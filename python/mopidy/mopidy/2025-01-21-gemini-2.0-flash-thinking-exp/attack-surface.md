# Attack Surface Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Mopidy Extensions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_mopidy_extensions.md)

*   **Description:**  Third-party Mopidy extensions, while adding functionality, can contain malicious code or vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Mopidy Contributes:** Mopidy's architecture encourages extensibility, allowing users to install extensions from various sources, increasing the potential for introducing malicious code.
    *   **Example:** A seemingly harmless extension for a new music source could contain code that exfiltrates Mopidy's configuration file or executes arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the Mopidy instance and potentially the underlying server, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install extensions from trusted and reputable sources.
        *   Review the extension's code before installation if possible.
        *   Implement a process for vetting and approving extensions within the development team.
        *   Regularly update extensions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for running Mopidy if extension security is a major concern.

## Attack Surface: [Web Interface Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/web_interface_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Mopidy's web interface (if enabled) that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Mopidy Contributes:** Mopidy provides a built-in web interface or allows for custom ones. If input is not properly sanitized or output is not correctly encoded, XSS vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript that, when visited by an authenticated user, steals their session cookie or performs actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized actions, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding in the web interface code.
        *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly update Mopidy and any custom web interface components to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [API Input Validation Issues](./attack_surfaces/api_input_validation_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  Mopidy's API (e.g., JSON-RPC over WebSocket or HTTP) might not properly validate user-supplied input, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Mopidy Contributes:** Mopidy exposes an API for controlling its functionality. If this API doesn't rigorously check input parameters, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** Sending a specially crafted request to the API could cause a buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service or potentially remote code execution. Another example is path traversal if file paths are not validated.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution, access to sensitive files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on all API endpoints, checking data types, formats, and ranges.
        *   Avoid directly using user-supplied input in system commands or file paths.
        *   Regularly audit the API code for potential input validation vulnerabilities.
