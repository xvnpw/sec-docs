## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Web Interface Vulnerabilities (If Web Interface Enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_web_interface_vulnerabilities__if_web_interface_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If a web interface is used to interact with Mopidy (common for frontends), it becomes a primary attack surface. This path encompasses common web application vulnerabilities that can be present in the frontend code or how it interacts with Mopidy.

    *   **Critical Node: 1.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into the web interface, typically through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the interface, performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user, potentially gaining further access to the application or system.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs in the frontend code.
            *   Encode outputs properly to prevent script execution in the browser.
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
            *   Regularly review frontend code for XSS vulnerabilities.

    *   **Critical Node: 1.2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Tricking a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the Mopidy application without their knowledge. This is done by crafting malicious requests that the user's browser automatically sends to the application.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Modifying application state (e.g., adding/removing playlists, changing settings), disrupting service, potentially gaining further unauthorized access depending on the actions that can be performed.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Implement CSRF protection mechanisms, such as synchronizer tokens, in the frontend for state-changing requests.
            *   Ensure proper session management and authentication practices.

    *   **Critical Node: 1.3. Authentication/Authorization Bypass (If Authentication Implemented)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of the web interface. This could include weak or default credentials, insecure session management, or flaws in the authorization logic.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Gaining unauthorized administrative access to the Mopidy application, controlling application functionality, accessing sensitive data, potentially escalating privileges.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., strong passwords, multi-factor authentication if feasible).
            *   Use secure session management practices.
            *   Enforce proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources and actions they are permitted to.
            *   Avoid default credentials and regularly review authentication/authorization code.

    *   **Critical Node: 1.4. Input Validation Vulnerabilities**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting insufficient input validation in the web interface when handling user requests. This could lead to vulnerabilities like path traversal (accessing files outside intended paths) or, less likely in core Mopidy but possible in custom extensions, command injection.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Reading arbitrary files on the server, potentially executing commands on the server (depending on the specific vulnerability and context), information disclosure, system compromise.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Strictly validate all user inputs received by the web interface.
            *   Use secure coding practices to avoid vulnerabilities like path traversal and command injection.
            *   Limit file system access and command execution capabilities of the web interface backend.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Backend Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_backend_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Mopidy's plugin architecture, while extensible, introduces risk because plugins are often developed by third parties and may not undergo the same level of security scrutiny as the core Mopidy code. Vulnerabilities in plugins can directly impact the Mopidy application and potentially the underlying system.

    *   **Critical Node: 2.2. Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in installed third-party plugins. This could range from simple bugs to critical security flaws like buffer overflows, code injection, or authentication bypasses within the plugin code.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin's functionality and the nature of the vulnerability. This could include data breaches (accessing music library data, user credentials if stored by the plugin), denial of service, code execution on the server, or even system compromise.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Carefully vet and audit third-party plugins before installation.
            *   Choose plugins from reputable sources with active maintenance and security records.
            *   Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement plugin sandboxing or isolation if possible (though Mopidy's plugin system may not offer strong sandboxing).
            *   Monitor plugin activity and logs for suspicious behavior.

    *   **Critical Node: 2.3. Plugin Configuration Vulnerabilities**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguring plugins in a way that introduces security weaknesses. This could include exposing sensitive information in plugin settings (e.g., API keys, credentials), setting overly permissive file paths, or enabling insecure features.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Information disclosure (leaking sensitive credentials or configuration details), creating new attack vectors that can be exploited, weakening the overall security posture of the application.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Follow security best practices when configuring plugins.
            *   Avoid storing sensitive information in plugin configuration files if possible (use environment variables or secure secret management).
            *   Regularly review plugin configurations for insecure settings.
            *   Implement configuration validation and auditing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Extension Vulnerabilities (Similar to Plugins)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_extension_vulnerabilities__similar_to_plugins_.md)

*   **Description:** Extensions in Mopidy, similar to plugins, can introduce vulnerabilities. This is especially true for web extensions that handle user input or interact with external resources.

    *   **Critical Node: 3.1. Vulnerable Extensions Themselves**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the code of installed extensions, including both core extensions and web extensions.  Similar to plugin vulnerabilities, these could be bugs or security flaws leading to various impacts.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Similar to plugin vulnerabilities, ranging from data breaches and denial of service to code execution and system compromise, depending on the extension's functionality and the vulnerability.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Apply the same mitigation strategies as for vulnerable third-party plugins: vetting, auditing, regular updates, sandboxing (if possible), and monitoring.
            *   Pay extra attention to the security of web extensions, especially those handling user input or interacting with the frontend.

    *   **Critical Node: 3.2. Extension Configuration Issues**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguring extensions, leading to security weaknesses. This is analogous to plugin configuration vulnerabilities and can involve exposing sensitive information or creating attack vectors through insecure settings.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Similar to plugin configuration vulnerabilities: information disclosure, weakened security posture, creation of new attack vectors.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Apply the same mitigation strategies as for plugin configuration vulnerabilities: secure configuration practices, avoiding storing secrets in configuration files, regular configuration reviews, and validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration File Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_file_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Critical Node: 4.2. Misconfiguration in Configuration Files**

    *   **Attack Vector:** Insecure settings within Mopidy's main configuration file (`mopidy.conf`) or plugin/extension configuration files. This could include enabling debug modes in production, setting overly permissive access controls, or other insecure configurations.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Exposing more information about the application and system to attackers, weakening security measures, potentially creating pathways for further exploitation.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security hardening guidelines for Mopidy configuration.
        *   Disable debug modes and unnecessary features in production.
        *   Regularly review configuration files for insecure settings.
        *   Implement configuration management and version control.

*   **Critical Node: 4.3. Access Control to Configuration Files**

    *   **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to Mopidy's configuration files due to lax file permissions on the server.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Reading sensitive information stored in configuration files (e.g., credentials, API keys, file paths), modifying configuration to introduce backdoors, disable security features, or disrupt service.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to configuration files to only the Mopidy process user and authorized administrators.
        *   Set appropriate file permissions using OS-level access control mechanisms.
        *   Regularly audit file permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mopidy Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mopidy_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Critical Node: 5.2. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Core Mopidy**

    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting resource exhaustion vulnerabilities or other weaknesses in the Mopidy core to crash or overload the service, making it unavailable. This could involve sending malformed requests, exploiting resource leaks, or overwhelming the server with traffic.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Disruption of music playback service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users, impacting user experience and potentially business operations if the application is critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
        *   Configure resource limits for the Mopidy process.
        *   Monitor system resources and Mopidy logs for signs of DoS attacks.
        *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) or intrusion prevention system (IPS) if the Mopidy service is exposed to the internet.

*   **Critical Node: 5.1. Code Injection in Core Mopidy (Less likely, but critical if found)**

    *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting code injection vulnerabilities directly within the Mopidy core code. This is less likely due to the maturity of the project, but could occur in specific data handling routines, network protocol implementations, or other areas.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Code execution on the server running Mopidy, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and complete control over the application and server.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Mopidy updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Report any suspected code injection vulnerabilities to the Mopidy project maintainers responsibly.
        *   Implement security monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect suspicious activity.

*   **Critical Node: 5.3. Privilege Escalation (If Mopidy runs with elevated privileges)**

    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from the Mopidy process to a higher-level account, such as root or administrator. This is only relevant if Mopidy is incorrectly run with elevated privileges, which is generally not recommended.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Full system compromise, gaining root or administrator access, complete control over the server and all its resources.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never run Mopidy with elevated privileges (e.g., as root).** Run it as a dedicated, low-privileged user.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege throughout the system.
        *   Regularly audit system configurations and user privileges.

*   **Critical Node: 5.4. Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (Buffer overflows, etc.)**

    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting memory corruption bugs, such as buffer overflows, in the Mopidy core or its dependencies (especially C extensions). These vulnerabilities can be triggered by malformed input or specific network interactions.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, unpredictable application behavior, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Mopidy and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
        *   Report any suspected memory corruption vulnerabilities to the Mopidy project maintainers.
