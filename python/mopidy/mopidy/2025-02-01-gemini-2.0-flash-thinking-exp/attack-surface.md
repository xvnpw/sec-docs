# Attack Surface Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured HTTP Frontend](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_http_frontend.md)

*   **Description:** Mopidy's HTTP frontend (Mopidy-HTTP) can be configured to serve content over unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS, exposing communication to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Mopidy Contribution:** Mopidy provides the HTTP frontend as a core component, and if not explicitly configured for HTTPS, it defaults to unencrypted HTTP communication.
*   **Example:** A user connects to a Mopidy web interface over HTTP on a public Wi-Fi network. An attacker on the same network can eavesdrop on the communication, intercepting control commands and potentially any sensitive data exposed by Mopidy extensions.
*   **Impact:** Eavesdropping, Man-in-the-middle attacks, Exposure of control commands, Potential exposure of sensitive data from extensions, Unauthorized control of the Mopidy server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable HTTPS:** Configure Mopidy-HTTP to use HTTPS by setting up TLS/SSL certificates within Mopidy's configuration.
    *   **Use a Reverse Proxy:** Deploy Mopidy behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) that handles HTTPS termination and forwards secure requests to Mopidy over HTTP on a secured internal network.
    *   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the HTTP frontend to trusted networks or users using firewalls or access control mechanisms at the network level.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Mopidy's extensibility relies on third-party extensions, which may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the Mopidy server and the underlying system.
*   **Mopidy Contribution:** Mopidy's architecture is designed to be extended through plugins, inherently relying on external, potentially untrusted code to enhance its functionality.
*   **Example:** A user installs a popular Mopidy extension from an untrusted source. This extension contains a vulnerability, such as insecure handling of user input or a dependency with a known security flaw, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Mopidy server.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, Privilege escalation, Denial of service, Information disclosure, Full system compromise depending on Mopidy's and the extension's privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and extension's access to system resources)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Extension Auditing and Selection:** Carefully vet and audit the code of third-party extensions before installation. Prioritize extensions from reputable developers and sources.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Mopidy:** Run Mopidy and its extensions with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a compromised extension. Consider using containerization or dedicated user accounts.
    *   **Regular Updates and Monitoring:** Keep Mopidy and all installed extensions updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Monitor for security advisories related to Mopidy and its extensions.
    *   **Dependency Scanning for Developers:** For developers creating Mopidy applications, implement dependency scanning for extensions and their dependencies to identify and mitigate known vulnerabilities proactively.

## Attack Surface: [Media File Parsing Vulnerabilities (Local Backend)](./attack_surfaces/media_file_parsing_vulnerabilities__local_backend_.md)

*   **Description:** When using local file backends (like Mopidy-Local), Mopidy relies on external libraries to parse media files. Vulnerabilities in these parsing libraries can be exploited by malicious media files to compromise the Mopidy server.
*   **Mopidy Contribution:** Mopidy's architecture includes support for local media file playback, which necessitates the use of media parsing libraries to handle various audio file formats.
*   **Example:** A user adds a maliciously crafted MP3 file to their Mopidy library. When Mopidy attempts to scan or play this file using a vulnerable media parsing library, it triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability, leading to denial of service or potentially remote code execution on the Mopidy server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, Remote code execution, Potential for full system compromise if Mopidy has sufficient privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **System Updates:** Ensure the operating system and all system libraries, including media parsing libraries used by Mopidy, are regularly updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Mopidy relies on system-level libraries for media handling.
    *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Run Mopidy in a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of a potential exploit triggered by malicious media files. This can restrict the attacker's ability to move beyond the Mopidy process.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited):** While direct validation of media file content is complex, consider validating file types and sources of media files added to the library. Avoid adding media from untrusted or unknown sources.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via MPD or WebSocket Frontends](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_mpd_or_websocket_frontends.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the command parsing logic of Mopidy's MPD or WebSocket frontends could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands if user-provided data within commands is not properly sanitized.
*   **Mopidy Contribution:** Mopidy's core design includes command-based frontends (MPD, WebSocket) that interpret and execute commands received from clients. Flaws in the parsing of these commands can introduce injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in the MPD frontend's command parsing. An attacker crafts a malicious MPD command containing shell commands within a parameter that is not properly sanitized by Mopidy. When Mopidy processes this command, it executes the injected shell commands on the server, potentially granting the attacker full control.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, Full system compromise, Data breach, Denial of service, Complete control over the Mopidy server and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Sanitization:** Implement thorough input sanitization and validation for all data received from MPD and WebSocket frontends, especially command parameters. This should be a priority in Mopidy's core development.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Mopidy:** Run Mopidy with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the damage if command injection is exploited.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting Mopidy's frontend command handling logic to identify and fix potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Stay Updated:** Keep Mopidy and its dependencies updated to benefit from security patches that address command injection or other vulnerabilities. Report any suspected vulnerabilities to the Mopidy development team.
