# BUSINESS POSTURE

Mopidy is an extensible music server that plays music from various sources. The primary business priority is to provide a reliable and feature-rich music server that users can customize and extend to fit their needs. The goal is to offer a flexible platform that integrates different music sources into a unified playback experience.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of service unavailability due to software bugs or security vulnerabilities.
- Risk of data breaches if user credentials or personal data are compromised.
- Risk of intellectual property infringement if the system is used to illegally distribute copyrighted music.
- Risk of reputational damage if the software is perceived as unreliable or insecure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Use of Python, which has a relatively mature ecosystem and security tooling. Implemented in: Project codebase.
- security control: Dependency management using `pip` and `setuptools`. Implemented in: `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`.
- security control: Open source nature allows for community review and contributions to identify and fix security issues. Implemented in: GitHub repository and community forums.
- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party extensions, which may introduce security vulnerabilities. Accepted risk is mitigated by community review and user discretion in choosing extensions.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Provide guidelines for secure extension development to the community.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and input validation on API endpoints if exposed.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: For remote access and control, implement authentication to verify the identity of clients. Consider API keys or token-based authentication for external clients.
- Authorization: Implement authorization to control access to different functionalities and resources based on user roles or permissions, especially if user management is introduced in the future.
- Input validation: Validate all inputs from users and external systems to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, path traversal). This is crucial for handling user-provided search queries, configuration settings, and API requests.
- Cryptography: Use cryptography to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest, such as user credentials or API keys. Consider HTTPS for API communication and encryption for configuration files if they contain sensitive information.

## DEPLOYMENT

Mopidy can be deployed in various environments, including:

- **Personal Computer:** Directly installed on a user's laptop or desktop operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Home Server/NAS:** Deployed on a dedicated home server or Network Attached Storage (NAS) device for centralized music access within a home network.
- **Cloud Server (e.g., VPS):** Deployed on a virtual private server in the cloud for remote access and potentially wider accessibility.
- **Containerized (Docker):** Deployed as a Docker container for easier management and portability across different environments.

Let's focus on the **Dockerized deployment** for detailed description.

Deployment Diagram Elements:

- Element:
  - Name: Docker Host
  - Type: Infrastructure - Server/VM
  - Description: Physical or virtual machine running the Docker daemon.
  - Responsibilities: Hosting and managing Docker containers. Providing resources (CPU, memory, network, storage) for containers.
  - Security controls: Host OS security hardening. Regular patching and updates. Access control to Docker daemon. Network security controls (firewall, network segmentation).

- Element:
  - Name: Docker
  - Type: Software - Container Runtime
  - Description: Docker engine responsible for running and managing containers.
  - Responsibilities: Container lifecycle management, resource isolation, image management, networking for containers.
  - Security controls: Docker security features (namespaces, cgroups, seccomp profiles). Image security scanning. Container runtime security best practices.

- Element:
  - Name: Mopidy Container
  - Type: Container - Docker Container
  - Description: Docker container running the Mopidy Server application.
  - Responsibilities: Running Mopidy Core, API, Backends, and Extensions. Playing music.
  - Security controls: Container image security scanning. Minimal base image. Principle of least privilege for container user. Resource limits for container. Input validation within Mopidy application.

- Element:
  - Name: Web Client Container (Optional)
  - Type: Container - Docker Container
  - Description: Optional Docker container running a web client for Mopidy (e.g., Mopidy-Web). Can be deployed separately or within the same Docker Compose setup.
  - Responsibilities: Serving web UI for Mopidy control.
  - Security controls: Container image security scanning. Minimal base image. Principle of least privilege. HTTPS enabled for web interface. Input validation in web client application.

- Element:
  - Name: Music Storage (Volume Mount)
  - Type: Infrastructure - Storage Volume
  - Description: Persistent storage volume mounted into the Mopidy container to access music files. Can be a local directory on the Docker host or a network volume.
  - Responsibilities: Storing music files persistently.
  - Security controls: File system permissions on the host and within the container. Access control to the storage volume. Encryption at rest if required.

- Element:
  - Name: Network
  - Type: Infrastructure - Network
  - Description: Network infrastructure connecting the Docker host, control clients, and potentially external music services.
  - Responsibilities: Providing network connectivity for Mopidy and its clients.
  - Security controls: Network segmentation. Firewall rules to restrict access to Mopidy ports. VPN or SSH tunneling for remote access. HTTPS for web client communication.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Music playback functionality: Ensuring users can reliably play music from their chosen sources.
- System availability: Maintaining the Mopidy server uptime and responsiveness.
- User configuration and settings: Protecting user preferences and configurations.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- User credentials for music services (e.g., Spotify API keys, SoundCloud tokens): High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and music libraries.
- User configuration data (e.g., music library paths, extension settings): Medium sensitivity. Compromise could lead to service disruption or unauthorized modifications.
- Logs and operational data: Low sensitivity. May contain information about usage patterns and potential issues.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- Are there any specific compliance requirements for Mopidy (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?
- Is there any user authentication or user management planned for Mopidy in the future?
- What is the expected scale and user base for Mopidy deployments?
- Are there any specific threat actors or attack vectors that are of particular concern?

Assumptions:
- Mopidy is primarily used in personal or home environments, with a moderate risk appetite.
- Security is important, but ease of use and extensibility are also key priorities.
- Users are expected to have some technical knowledge to set up and configure Mopidy.
- The primary goal is to provide a functional and customizable music server, not to handle highly sensitive data or operate in a high-security environment.
