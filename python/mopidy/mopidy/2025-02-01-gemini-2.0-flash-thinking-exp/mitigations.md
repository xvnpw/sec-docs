# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication for Remote Interfaces](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_for_remote_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Open the `mopidy.conf` configuration file. This file is typically located in `~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf` or `/etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf`.
    2.  Locate the `[http]` and `[websocket]` sections. If they don't exist, create them.
    3.  Within the `[http]` section, add or modify the line `password = your_strong_http_password`. Replace `your_strong_http_password` with a strong, unique password.
    4.  Within the `[websocket]` section, add or modify the line `password = your_strong_websocket_password`. Replace `your_strong_websocket_password` with a strong, unique password.  It's recommended to use a different password than the HTTP password.
    5.  Save the `mopidy.conf` file.
    6.  Restart the Mopidy service for the changes to take effect.  Use the command `sudo systemctl restart mopidy` or `sudo service mopidy restart` depending on your system.
