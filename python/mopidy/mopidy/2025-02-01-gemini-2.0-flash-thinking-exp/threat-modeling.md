# Threat Model Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Threat: [Exposed Mopidy Configuration](./threats/exposed_mopidy_configuration.md)

**Description:** Attacker gains access to Mopidy configuration files (e.g., `mopidy.conf`) due to misconfigured web server or insecure file permissions. They can read sensitive information like API keys or backend credentials. This allows them to potentially compromise connected backend services or gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, potential for further attacks using exposed credentials, unauthorized access to backends.

**Affected Mopidy Component:** Configuration Files (`mopidy.conf`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement strict file permissions on configuration files (e.g., 600 or 400, readable only by the Mopidy user).
* Store sensitive credentials outside configuration files using environment variables or secure secrets management solutions.
* Regularly review and sanitize configuration files, removing any unnecessary sensitive information.
* Ensure web servers are properly configured to prevent direct access to configuration files.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious API Requests](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_api_requests.md)

**Description:** Attacker floods Mopidy's API (HTTP, MPD, etc.) with a large volume of requests, overwhelming the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This leads to service disruption and denial of service for legitimate users of the Mopidy service.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), service unavailability, degraded performance for legitimate users.

**Affected Mopidy Component:** HTTP API (or other frontends), Request Handling

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement rate limiting and request throttling on Mopidy frontends or using a reverse proxy.
* Use resource monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to DoS attacks.
* Consider using a reverse proxy or CDN to absorb malicious traffic and provide caching.
* Optimize Mopidy configuration and resource allocation to handle expected load.

## Threat: [Extension Instability or Bugs](./threats/extension_instability_or_bugs.md)

**Description:** A poorly written, buggy, or malicious Mopidy extension introduces instability, memory leaks, crashes, or unexpected behavior in Mopidy. This can lead to denial of service or unpredictable application behavior, impacting the availability and reliability of the music service.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), service instability, unpredictable application behavior.

**Affected Mopidy Component:** Mopidy Core (due to extension integration), Specific Extension Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Carefully vet and select Mopidy extensions from trusted and reputable sources.
* Prioritize extensions that are actively maintained and have a good security track record.
* Regularly update extensions to patch known bugs and security vulnerabilities.
* Implement monitoring and restart mechanisms for Mopidy to automatically recover from crashes.
* Consider running extensions in isolated processes or containers to limit the impact of extension failures.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Mopidy Core or Extensions (RCE)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mopidy_core_or_extensions__rce_.md)

**Description:** Mopidy core or its extensions contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection, buffer overflows, insecure deserialization) that can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows for complete system compromise and unauthorized control.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise, data breach, full control over the Mopidy server.

**Affected Mopidy Component:** Mopidy Core, Specific Extension Module, Vulnerable Code Path

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Keep Mopidy and all extensions up-to-date with the latest security patches and releases.
* Subscribe to security advisories for Mopidy and its dependencies to be informed of vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review and audit Mopidy and extension code if possible, or use static/dynamic analysis tools.
* Implement security scanning and vulnerability management processes to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom extensions or modifying Mopidy code.
