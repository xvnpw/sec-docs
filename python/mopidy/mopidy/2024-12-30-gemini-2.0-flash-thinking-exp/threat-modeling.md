### High and Critical Mopidy Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Extension Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could trick a user or administrator into installing a crafted Mopidy extension. This could be achieved through social engineering, compromised extension repositories, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the extension installation process. Once installed, the extension code executes with Mopidy's privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration (including potentially sensitive information accessible by Mopidy), denial of service, or use of the server for malicious activities (e.g., botnet participation).
    *   **Affected Component:** Extension loading mechanism, potentially the `mopidy.ext` module and the extension installation process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install extensions from trusted sources.
        *   Implement a mechanism for verifying the integrity and authenticity of extensions (e.g., digital signatures).
        *   Regularly review installed extensions and remove any that are no longer needed or are suspicious.
        *   Run Mopidy with the least privileges necessary.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Extension Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a security vulnerability within a legitimate Mopidy extension. This could involve sending specially crafted requests to the extension's API or exploiting weaknesses in its code.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution within the Mopidy process, information disclosure, denial of service, or the ability to manipulate Mopidy's functionality in unintended ways.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable extension and its associated modules and functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep all installed extensions up-to-date.
        *   Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities in Mopidy extensions.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in extensions.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within extensions.

*   **Threat:** Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** Mopidy or its extensions use default credentials that are not changed after installation.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can easily gain unauthorized access to Mopidy's functionalities or the extension's features using these default credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication mechanisms within Mopidy or specific extensions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if default credentials grant significant access)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Force users to change default credentials upon initial setup.
        *   Document the importance of changing default credentials.
        *   Avoid using default credentials in the first place during development.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Mopidy's Web Interface
    *   **Description:** Mopidy's built-in web interface (or a web extension) fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages served by Mopidy.
    *   **Impact:** When other users access the compromised page, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Component:** The web interface components responsible for rendering user-provided content, potentially within the `mopidy.http` extension or specific web extensions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper input validation and output encoding/escaping in the web interface.
        *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly scan the web interface for XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** API Vulnerabilities in Mopidy's HTTP API
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in Mopidy's HTTP API endpoints, allowing attackers to send specially crafted requests to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to unauthorized music control, modification of playlists, access to internal Mopidy data, or even remote code execution if a critical vulnerability exists.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `mopidy.http` extension and the specific API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit and test the HTTP API for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing API endpoints.
        *   Keep Mopidy updated to the latest version with security patches.

*   **Threat:** Injection Attacks through Mopidy's APIs
    *   **Description:** Mopidy doesn't properly sanitize input received through its APIs (e.g., when adding tracks or searching), allowing attackers to inject malicious commands or code.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the context, this could lead to command injection, where the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, or other forms of exploitation.
    *   **Affected Component:** API endpoints that process user input, potentially within the `mopidy.core` or extension modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints.
        *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Mopidy Running with Elevated Privileges
    *   **Description:** Mopidy is run with unnecessary elevated privileges (e.g., as root).
    *   **Impact:** If a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker gains the privileges of the Mopidy process, potentially leading to full system compromise if running as root.
    *   **Affected Component:** The process under which Mopidy is running.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Run Mopidy with the least privileges necessary. Create a dedicated user account for Mopidy with only the required permissions.
        *   Use systemd or similar tools to manage Mopidy's privileges.
