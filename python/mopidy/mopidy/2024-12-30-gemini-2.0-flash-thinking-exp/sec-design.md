```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant "HTTP Frontend" as HTTP
    participant Core
    participant "Library Manager" as LM
    participant "Spotify Backend" as SB

    Client->>HTTP: Search request (e.g., "artist:Beethoven")
    activate HTTP
    HTTP->>Core: Forward search query
    activate Core
    Core->>LM: Delegate search to backends
    activate LM
    LM->>SB: Query Spotify API for "Beethoven"
    activate SB
    SB-->>LM: Return search results (track metadata)
    deactivate SB
    LM-->>Core: Aggregate search results
    deactivate LM
    Core-->>HTTP: Return search results (JSON)
    deactivate Core
    HTTP-->>Client: Display search results
    deactivate HTTP

    Client->>HTTP: Play request (track URI: spotify:track:...)
    activate HTTP
    HTTP->>Core: Forward play command
    activate Core
    Core->>LM: Resolve track URI
    activate LM
    LM->>SB: Get streaming URL for spotify:track:...
    activate SB
    SB-->>LM: Return streaming URL
    deactivate SB
    LM-->>Core: Return streaming URL
    deactivate LM
    Core->>"Playback Manager": Initiate playback with streaming URL
    activate "Playback Manager"
    "Playback Manager"->>SB: Request audio stream
    activate SB
    SB-->>"Playback Manager": Audio stream
    deactivate SB
    "Playback Manager"-->>"Audio Output": Play audio
    deactivate "Playback Manager"
    deactivate Core
    HTTP-->>Client: Playback started confirmation
    deactivate HTTP
```

Key data flows and security considerations:

*   **User Commands:** Transmitted from clients to frontends. Security depends on the frontend's authentication and authorization mechanisms and the transport security (HTTPS).
*   **Search Queries:** Passed from frontends to the Core and then to backends. Sensitive information might be included in search terms.
*   **Library Metadata:** Retrieved from backends and cached by the Library Manager. The integrity of this data is important.
*   **Track URIs:** Used to identify and request specific tracks. Their format and handling can have security implications.
*   **Streaming URLs:** Obtained from backends and used by the Playback Manager. These URLs might be time-limited or require authentication.
*   **Audio Streams:** Transmitted from backends to the Playback Manager. The security of these streams depends on the backend and the protocols used.
*   **Credentials and API Keys:** Used by backends to authenticate with external services. Secure storage and handling are paramount.

## 6. Key Technologies

*   **Data Storage Security:**
    *   **Credentials:** How are API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials stored (e.g., in configuration files)? Are they encrypted at rest?
    *   **Session Data:** If the HTTP frontend stores session data, how is it protected?
    *   **Cached Data:** Does cached metadata contain sensitive information that needs protection?
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Are dependencies regularly updated to patch known vulnerabilities?
    *   Is there a process for tracking and addressing security vulnerabilities in dependencies?
*   **Denial of Service:**
    *   Are there rate limiting mechanisms in place to prevent abuse of the HTTP API or other interfaces?
    *   Can malicious clients overload the server with requests?
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Do error messages or logs expose sensitive information?
    *   Are API responses filtered to prevent the disclosure of unnecessary data?

## 9. Future Considerations

*   **Enhanced Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing more robust and modern authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 for the HTTP Frontend.
*   **Secure MPD Protocol Extension:** Exploring options for securing the MPD protocol or providing secure alternatives.
