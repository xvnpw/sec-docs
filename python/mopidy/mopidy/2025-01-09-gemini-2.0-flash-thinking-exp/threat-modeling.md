# Threat Model Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Threat: [Malicious Extension Installation](./threats/malicious_extension_installation.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains the ability to install a crafted or compromised Mopidy extension. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in Mopidy's extension loading mechanism or by gaining unauthorized access to the server's file system where extensions are located. Once installed, the extension can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Mopidy process.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, including data exfiltration, installation of backdoors, denial of service, and potentially lateral movement to other systems on the network.

**Affected Component:** Extension loading mechanism, Extension API.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict whitelisting of allowed extensions within the application's configuration.
* If possible, verify the source and integrity of extensions before installation.
* Restrict file system access for the Mopidy process to prevent unauthorized modification of extension directories.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Extension](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_extension.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a security vulnerability within a legitimately installed Mopidy extension. This could involve sending specially crafted requests or data to the extension through Mopidy's extension API to trigger remote code execution, information disclosure, or other malicious actions *within the Mopidy process*.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability and the extension's capabilities. It could range from information disclosure (e.g., leaking API keys used by the extension) to remote code execution within the Mopidy process, potentially leading to broader system compromise.

**Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable extension and its interaction with Mopidy's Extension API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Mopidy and all installed extensions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories for Mopidy and its extensions.
* Consider disabling extensions that are no longer maintained or have known vulnerabilities without available patches.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Mopidy Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_mopidy_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Mopidy's configuration files (e.g., `mopidy.conf`). These files might contain sensitive information such as API keys for music services or other secrets managed by Mopidy itself. Access could be gained through file system vulnerabilities or misconfigurations affecting the Mopidy process.

**Impact:** Compromise of external accounts and services linked to the exposed credentials. Potential for further attacks using the leaked information.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loading module, settings storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store sensitive configuration data securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system instead of plain text in Mopidy's configuration files.
* Restrict file system permissions for Mopidy configuration files to the Mopidy user and administrators only.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Mopidy HTTP API](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_mopidy_http_api.md)

**Description:** If Mopidy's HTTP API is configured without authentication, an attacker on the network can directly interact with the API to control music playback, access library information, or trigger actions exposed by installed extensions *through Mopidy's core API*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized control over the music server, potentially leading to disruption of service, unauthorized access to media libraries, or the execution of malicious actions via extensions if their APIs are also exposed without authentication.

**Affected Component:** HTTP API endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always enable and configure authentication for the Mopidy HTTP API (e.g., using password protection).
* Ensure the network on which Mopidy's API is exposed is trusted or use a secure tunnel (e.g., SSH tunnel, VPN).
