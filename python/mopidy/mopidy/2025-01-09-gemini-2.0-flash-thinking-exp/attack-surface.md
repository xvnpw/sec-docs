# Attack Surface Analysis for mopidy/mopidy

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Extension Installation and Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_extension_installation_and_execution.md)

* **Description:** Malicious Extension Installation and Execution
    * **How Mopidy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mopidy's core design includes an extension loading mechanism that, if not secured, allows for the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the Mopidy process. This is a direct feature of Mopidy.
    * **Example:** An attacker could craft a malicious extension that, upon installation, grants them remote access to the server, exfiltrates sensitive data managed by Mopidy, or disrupts its operation.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the Mopidy server, potentially leading to data breaches, system disruption, or use of the server for further malicious activities.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strong extension verification and signing mechanisms within Mopidy core. Provide a secure and curated extension repository.
        * **Users:** Only install extensions from highly trusted sources. Carefully review extension code before installation if possible. Consider using containerization or sandboxing to limit the impact of potentially malicious extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Core API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_core_api_access.md)

* **Description:** Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Core API Access
    * **How Mopidy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mopidy exposes a core API that allows control and management of the music server. The security of this API (or lack thereof) is a direct responsibility of Mopidy.
    * **Example:** Without proper authentication, an attacker on the network could remotely control playback, access library information, or modify Mopidy settings, potentially disrupting service or gaining unauthorized access to data.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized control of the music server, potential disclosure of library metadata, and denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for the core API within Mopidy. Provide options for different authentication methods and avoid default credentials.
        * **Users:** Configure strong authentication for the Mopidy API. Restrict network access to the API to trusted sources using firewalls or network segmentation.
