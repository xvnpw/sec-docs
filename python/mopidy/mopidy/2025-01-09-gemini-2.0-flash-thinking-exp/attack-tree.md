## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Mopidy Extension Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_mopidy_extension_vulnerability.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerability in a Specific Extension [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers target vulnerabilities within the code of individual Mopidy extensions.
    *   Focus: Identifying and exploiting flaws like buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities, or insecure handling of external data within the extension's logic.
    *   Criticality: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Mopidy process.
    *   Example: A vulnerability in the Spotify extension allows for execution of arbitrary commands by crafting a specific Spotify URI.
*   **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Exploiting insecure deserialization practices within an extension.
    *   Focus: Crafting malicious serialized data that, when deserialized by the extension, leads to code execution.
    *   Criticality: Deserialization vulnerabilities are notoriously dangerous and often provide a direct path to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Upload and Install a Malicious Extension](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_upload_and_install_a_malicious_extension.md)

*   **Upload and Install a Malicious Extension [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Tricking the system into installing a deliberately malicious Mopidy extension.
    *   Focus: Exploiting weaknesses in the extension installation process, such as a lack of verification or sandboxing.
    *   Criticality: A malicious extension can be designed to perform any action on the server, including executing arbitrary code, stealing data, or compromising other systems.
*   **Exploit Lack of Extension Verification/Sandboxing [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Capitalizing on the absence of proper checks on the integrity and safety of extensions before installation.
    *   Focus: Bypassing any security measures meant to prevent the installation of untrusted code.
    *   Criticality: This lack of security allows for the easy introduction of malicious code into the Mopidy environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Mopidy Core Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_mopidy_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Exploit API Endpoint Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Targeting vulnerabilities in Mopidy's core API endpoints.
    *   Focus: Identifying flaws in how the API handles requests, parameters, or authentication.
    *   Criticality: Successful exploitation can grant unauthorized access or allow for malicious actions.
*   **Command Injection via API Call [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious shell commands into API parameters that are not properly sanitized.
    *   Focus: Crafting API calls that, when processed by the server, execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
    *   Criticality: Command injection is a severe vulnerability that directly leads to code execution.
*   **Authentication Bypass or Authorization Flaw [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Circumventing Mopidy's authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    *   Focus: Exploiting weaknesses in how Mopidy verifies user identity or grants permissions to access resources and functionalities.
    *   Criticality: Successful bypass can grant attackers administrative privileges, allowing them to perform any action within Mopidy.
*   **Exploit Configuration Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Targeting vulnerabilities related to Mopidy's configuration files and parsing.
    *   Focus: Identifying weaknesses in how Mopidy loads, interprets, or protects its configuration.
    *   Criticality: Configuration files often contain sensitive information or control critical system behavior.
*   **Inject Malicious Code into Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious code directly into Mopidy's configuration files.
    *   Focus: Exploiting insecure configuration parsing or gaining unauthorized write access to configuration files.
    *   Criticality: Malicious code injected into configuration files can be executed when Mopidy starts or reloads its configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Mopidy](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_mopidy.md)

*   **Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Mopidy's Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Attack Vector: Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that Mopidy relies on.
    *   Focus: Identifying publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Mopidy's dependencies and crafting attacks that leverage these weaknesses through Mopidy's usage of the vulnerable library.
    *   Criticality: Many dependency vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution or other severe consequences.
