- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Test Settings Configuration

  - **Description:**
    The file `/code/tests/settings.py` configures the Django application for testing by setting
    - `DEBUG = True`
    - `SECRET_KEY = "abc123"`
    Although these values are appropriate for tests, if an external attacker is able to access an instance deployed with these settings (for example, if the test settings are mistakenly used in production), the attacker can trigger detailed debug error pages and potentially craft forged session cookies.
    **Step by step how it can be triggered:**
    1. An attacker discovers that the publicly deployed instance is running with test settings (possibly because the test configuration was accidentally deployed).
    2. The attacker visits an invalid URL or forces an error in the application, causing Djangoâ€™s debug error page to be rendered (since `DEBUG=True`).
    3. The detailed error page discloses stack traces and sensitive configuration details.
    4. Knowing the SECRET_KEY value (`"abc123"`), the attacker may attempt to forge session cookies and impersonate users.

  - **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** Detailed error pages expose stack traces, database queries, and internal configuration details that aid an attacker in mounting further attacks.
    - **Session Tampering:** The use of a weak, hardcoded secret key enables an attacker to forge session cookies, potentially hijacking authenticated sessions.
    - **Expanded Attack Surface:** The combination of debug information and a predictable secret key may lead to the discovery and exploitation of additional vulnerabilities in the application.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There are no mitigations in `/code/tests/settings.py`; the insecure test settings are intended only for development and testing, but no automated safeguard prevents their accidental deployment in production.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Separation of Settings:** There should be a strict separation between production settings and test settings, with deployment processes ensuring that the insecure test configuration is never used in production.
    - **Secure Production Settings:** Production configuration must explicitly set `DEBUG = False` and derive the `SECRET_KEY` from a secure, unpredictable source (for example, environment variables or a secrets manager).
    - **Deployment Safeguards:** Implement automated checks and environment-sensitive configuration management to verify that test settings are not activated in live deployments.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The instance deployed on the public Internet must (mistakenly) be running the test settings from `/code/tests/settings.py` (or a configuration derived from it).
    - The attacker must have network access to the affected instance and be able to trigger error pages (for example, by requesting a nonexistent URL).

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `/code/tests/settings.py`, the configuration sets `DEBUG = True` and hardcodes `SECRET_KEY = "abc123"`.
    2. When `DEBUG` is enabled, Django returns detailed stack traces and environment information on errors.
    3. The known secret key compromises the cryptographic signing mechanism for cookies, making it possible for an attacker to forge session data.
    4. There is no enforcement (at the application or deployment level) that prevents these settings from being used outside isolated test environments.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Deployment Test:** Deploy the application using the test settings from `/code/tests/settings.py` on an environment that is publicly accessible.
    2. **Triggering an Error:** Visit a URL that does not exist (e.g., `/nonexistent`) to force an error, then verify that the resulting page displays a detailed debug stack trace containing internal variables and configuration details.
    3. **Cookie Forgery:** Observe the session cookie format and use the known secret key (`"abc123"`) to attempt forging a session cookie. Send a request with the forged cookie and check if the application accepts it (indicative of weak signing).
    4. **Observation:** Confirm that the application exposes sensitive error details and that session integrity can be compromised using the weak, publicly known secret key.
