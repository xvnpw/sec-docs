*   **Threat:** Metric Path Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious metric paths within graph requests (e.g., in the `target` parameter of a URL or API call). This allows them to potentially access metrics they are not authorized to view by manipulating path components, or cause the server to perform unintended actions like accessing internal resources (SSRF).
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (access to sensitive metrics), potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) leading to further internal network compromise, Denial of Service (DoS) by crafting resource-intensive queries.
    *   **Affected Component:** `webapp/content.py` (handling graph requests), `graphite.render.views` (rendering logic), potentially backend data retrieval functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all metric path parameters.
        *   Use whitelisting or regular expressions to enforce allowed characters and structures in metric paths.
        *   Avoid directly passing user-provided input to backend data retrieval functions without validation.
        *   Implement robust error handling to prevent information leakage through error messages.

*   **Threat:** Template Injection
    *   **Description:** If Graphite-Web uses a templating engine (like Jinja2) for rendering dashboards or other dynamic content and user-controlled data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, an attacker can inject malicious code. This code could be executed on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server, data exfiltration, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Template rendering engine (e.g., Jinja2 integration), any modules responsible for rendering dynamic content based on user input (e.g., dashboard rendering logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper escaping of user-provided data when rendering templates.
        *   Use templating engines in a secure configuration, avoiding direct execution of arbitrary code.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed templating environment if dynamic content generation is necessary.
        *   Regularly update the templating engine to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Graphite-Web's authentication mechanisms could allow an attacker to bypass the login process and gain unauthorized access without providing valid credentials. This could be due to flaws in session management, cookie handling, or integration with external authentication systems.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Graphite-Web, allowing the attacker to view sensitive metrics, modify configurations, or potentially disrupt the service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `graphite.account.views` (login and authentication logic), authentication middleware, session management components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   Use secure session management techniques (e.g., HTTPOnly and Secure flags for cookies).
        *   Regularly review and audit authentication code for vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
        *   Ensure proper handling of authentication tokens and prevent leakage.

*   **Threat:** Authorization Flaws
    *   **Description:** Even after successful authentication, vulnerabilities in the authorization logic could allow a user to access or modify resources or perform actions that they are not permitted to based on their assigned roles or permissions.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, allowing users to access sensitive data or perform administrative actions they shouldn't, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authorization middleware, access control logic within various modules (e.g., dashboard management, user management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a well-defined and tested role-based access control (RBAC) model.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly review and audit access control configurations.
        *   Ensure consistent enforcement of authorization checks across all relevant functionalities.

*   **Threat:** API Key Management Issues
    *   **Description:** If Graphite-Web uses API keys for authentication, vulnerabilities in how these keys are generated, stored, or managed could lead to unauthorized access. This includes weak key generation algorithms, insecure storage of keys, or lack of proper key revocation mechanisms. An attacker could steal or guess API keys to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Graphite-Web's API, allowing attackers to retrieve metrics, create or modify dashboards, or perform other actions depending on the API's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** API authentication mechanisms, API key generation and storage logic, user management modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use cryptographically secure methods for generating API keys.
        *   Store API keys securely (e.g., using hashing and salting).
        *   Implement mechanisms for API key rotation and revocation.
        *   Consider using scoped API keys with limited permissions.
        *   Protect API keys in transit using HTTPS.
