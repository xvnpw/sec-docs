# Attack Surface Analysis for fastapi/fastapi

## Attack Surface: [Pydantic Validation Bypass](./attack_surfaces/pydantic_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass input validation defined by Pydantic models, injecting malicious or unexpected data into the application.
*   **FastAPI Contribution:** FastAPI relies heavily on Pydantic for request body parsing and validation. Incorrectly defined or exploited Pydantic models become a direct entry point facilitated by FastAPI's data handling.
*   **Example:**
    *   A Pydantic model for user creation has a field `username` with a maximum length validation. An attacker crafts a request with a username exceeding this length, but due to a flaw in the validation logic or a bypass, the application processes it anyway, leading to database errors or unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, security vulnerabilities due to processing invalid data, potential for further exploitation if bypassed data is used in critical operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly define and test Pydantic models:** Ensure all input fields have appropriate validation rules (type, length, format, custom validators).
    *   **Use Pydantic's built-in validators effectively:** Leverage features like `constr`, `conint`, `confloat`, `EmailStr`, `HttpUrl` to enforce constraints.
    *   **Implement custom validators for complex logic:** When built-in validators are insufficient, create robust custom validation functions.
    *   **Regularly review and update Pydantic models:** As application requirements evolve, ensure validation rules remain relevant and effective.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting flaws in the deserialization process of request bodies (JSON, etc.) to inject malicious code or manipulate application state.
*   **FastAPI Contribution:** FastAPI automatically deserializes request bodies using Pydantic and underlying libraries. Vulnerabilities in these processes, which are integral to FastAPI's request handling, can be exploited.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload that exploits a vulnerability in the JSON deserialization library used by Pydantic. This payload could trigger arbitrary code execution on the server when FastAPI attempts to parse it.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the deserialization vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Pydantic and underlying libraries updated:** Regularly update dependencies to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Minimize reliance on complex deserialization features:** Avoid overly complex or custom deserialization logic if possible.
    *   **Implement input sanitization even after deserialization:**  While Pydantic validates types, consider additional sanitization for specific fields if needed, especially when dealing with user-provided strings that might be used in sensitive operations.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Injection Flaws](./attack_surfaces/dependency_injection_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from the dependency injection system, such as manipulating dependencies or injecting malicious ones.
*   **FastAPI Contribution:** FastAPI's powerful dependency injection system, a core feature of the framework, if misused or misconfigured, can become an attack vector.
*   **Example:**
    *   An endpoint relies on a dependency that fetches user data based on a user ID provided in the request. If the dependency injection system allows an attacker to somehow manipulate or replace this dependency with a malicious one, they could potentially bypass authorization checks or gain access to data they shouldn't.
*   **Impact:** Authorization bypass, privilege escalation, information disclosure, arbitrary code execution if malicious dependencies are injected.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully design and review dependencies:** Ensure dependencies are well-defined, secure, and perform only their intended functions.
    *   **Limit the scope and access of dependencies:**  Restrict the permissions and capabilities of dependencies to the minimum necessary.
    *   **Avoid overly complex dependency injection logic:** Keep dependency injection configurations clear and understandable to minimize potential misconfigurations.
    *   **Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities:**  Scan dependencies for known security issues and update them promptly.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of Security Utilities](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_security_utilities.md)

*   **Description:** Improper configuration or implementation of FastAPI's security utilities (e.g., `HTTPBasic`, `HTTPBearer`, `OAuth2PasswordBearer`) leading to authentication or authorization bypasses.
*   **FastAPI Contribution:** FastAPI provides security utilities as part of its framework to simplify security implementation. Misconfiguration of these *FastAPI provided* utilities directly leads to vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**
    *   Using `HTTPBasic` authentication with weak or default credentials. Or, incorrectly configuring `OAuth2PasswordBearer` with insecure token generation or validation, allowing attackers to bypass authentication.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly understand and correctly configure security utilities:** Carefully read the documentation and examples for each security utility and ensure proper configuration.
    *   **Use strong and unique credentials:** Avoid default or weak passwords. Implement robust password policies.
    *   **Securely manage API keys and tokens:** Store API keys and tokens securely and use secure methods for generation and validation.
    *   **Implement proper OAuth2/OIDC flows:** Follow best practices for OAuth2/OIDC implementation, including secure token handling, scope management, and redirect URI validation.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization Logic (Indirectly related to FastAPI's structure)](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization_logic__indirectly_related_to_fastapi's_structure_.md)

*   **Description:**  Lack of proper authorization checks in application code, allowing users to access resources or perform actions they are not permitted to. While authorization logic is developer-defined, FastAPI's structure and dependency injection can influence how authorization is implemented and potentially lead to flaws if not carefully considered in the context of the framework.
*   **FastAPI Contribution:** FastAPI's structure encourages modular design and dependency injection, which *can* simplify authorization implementation, but also *can* lead to vulnerabilities if authorization logic is not correctly integrated within the framework's components (dependencies, middleware, endpoint handlers).  The ease of use might lead to overlooking crucial authorization steps.
*   **Example:**
    *   An endpoint requires user authentication, but after authentication (handled perhaps using FastAPI's security utilities), it doesn't properly check if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. An attacker could authenticate as a regular user and still access admin-level functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement robust authorization logic:** Design and implement comprehensive authorization checks for all sensitive endpoints and actions.
    *   **Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC):** Implement access control mechanisms to manage user permissions effectively.
    *   **Enforce the principle of least privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required for their roles.
    *   **Regularly review and test authorization logic:** Conduct thorough security testing to ensure authorization logic is correctly implemented and effective.
    *   **Integrate authorization checks within FastAPI's dependency injection or middleware:** Leverage FastAPI's features to enforce authorization consistently across endpoints.
