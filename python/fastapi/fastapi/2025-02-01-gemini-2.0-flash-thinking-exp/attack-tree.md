## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Security Schemes Definition (Bypass Authentication) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_security_schemes_definition__bypass_authentication___high-risk_path___critical_node_effe155e.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Weak or missing security requirements defined in FastAPI's security schemes. This could involve:
    *   Making authentication optional when it should be mandatory.
    *   Using overly permissive security scopes or roles.
    *   Failing to apply security schemes to all relevant endpoints.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker identifies endpoints that are intended to be protected but lack proper security scheme enforcement due to misconfiguration.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources and functionalities.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint intended for authenticated users is accidentally configured without a `security_scopes` requirement, allowing anyone to access it without providing credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inconsistent Security Dependency Usage (Bypass Authorization) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inconsistent_security_dependency_usage__bypass_authorization___high-risk_path___critical_nod_f80dd965.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Inconsistent application of security dependencies across different API endpoints. Developers might forget to apply authorization dependencies to some endpoints, leaving them unprotected.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker discovers API endpoints that lack authorization checks, even though they should be protected based on the application's intended access control.
*   **Impact:** Authorization bypass, allowing unauthorized access to resources and functionalities, potentially leading to privilege escalation if unprotected endpoints handle sensitive operations.
*   **Example:** In a complex API with many endpoints, a developer might apply an authorization dependency to most endpoints but miss a few critical ones, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if custom Pydantic validators are flawed) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_custom_pydantic_validators_are_flawed___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Unsafe deserialization practices within custom Pydantic validators. If validators use functions like `pickle.loads` or other insecure deserialization methods on user-provided data, it can lead to code execution.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker crafts malicious serialized data (e.g., a pickled object) and sends it as input to an API endpoint that uses a vulnerable Pydantic validator.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Example:** A custom validator attempts to deserialize a JSON string using `pickle.loads` for some reason. An attacker can send a specially crafted JSON payload that, when deserialized with `pickle.loads`, executes arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Attacks (SQL, Command, etc.) due to insufficient input sanitization *after* Pydantic validation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/injection_attacks__sql__command__etc___due_to_insufficient_input_sanitization_after_pydantic_validat_10ee561f.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization *after* Pydantic validation. Developers might mistakenly believe that Pydantic's type validation is sufficient to prevent injection attacks. However, Pydantic primarily focuses on data type and format, not necessarily on preventing malicious payloads in backend operations.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker injects malicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection code, command injection commands) into input fields that pass Pydantic validation but are then used unsafely in backend operations (database queries, system commands).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Data breach, data manipulation, authentication bypass.
    *   **Command Injection:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   **Other Injection Types:** Varying impacts depending on the injection type and vulnerable context.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint takes user input validated by Pydantic. The validated input is then directly used in an SQL query without proper parameterization or escaping, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (if templates are used insecurely) [HIGH-RISK PATH - if templates used] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__if_templates_are_used_insecurely___high-risk_path_-_if_templates_use_eaf9909b.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Direct embedding of user-controlled input into server-side templates (e.g., Jinja2) without proper escaping or sanitization.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker injects template code into input fields. When the application renders the template, the injected code is executed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Example:** A FastAPI application uses Jinja2 templates to generate dynamic content. User input is directly inserted into the template without escaping. An attacker can inject Jinja2 template code in the input, which will be executed by the server when rendering the template.

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Request Flooding (DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/http_request_flooding__dos___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Lack of rate limiting or other Denial of Service (DoS) protection mechanisms in the FastAPI application or its underlying infrastructure.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker sends a large volume of HTTP requests to the application, overwhelming server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a botnet or simple scripting tools to send thousands of requests per second to a public API endpoint, causing the server to become overloaded and unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [OpenAPI/Swagger UI Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/openapiswagger_ui_resource_exhaustion__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** OpenAPI/Swagger UI enabled in production and accessible without restrictions. The documentation endpoint itself can become a DoS target.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker sends excessive requests specifically to the OpenAPI documentation endpoint (`/openapi.json` or `/docs`), overloading the server resources responsible for serving the documentation.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, specifically impacting the availability of the API documentation and potentially affecting the overall application performance if documentation service shares resources with the main application.
*   **Example:** An attacker targets the `/docs` endpoint of a production FastAPI application with a flood of requests, causing the documentation service to become slow or crash, and potentially impacting the main application if resources are shared.

## Attack Tree Path: [Slowloris/Slow POST Attacks [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/slowlorisslow_post_attacks__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Potential vulnerability of the underlying server (Uvicorn in this case) to slow connection attacks like Slowloris or Slow POST. These attacks exploit the server's connection handling limits.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker sends slow, incomplete HTTP requests to the server, keeping connections open for extended periods without fully completing the request. This exhausts the server's connection pool, preventing legitimate users from establishing new connections.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses Slowloris tools to send slow, incomplete HTTP headers to the FastAPI application, gradually exhausting the server's connection limits and preventing new connections from being established.

## Attack Tree Path: [Verbose Error Messages in Production (Information Disclosure) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/verbose_error_messages_in_production__information_disclosure___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Running the FastAPI application in production with debug mode enabled or with default verbose error handling. FastAPI's default error responses can expose sensitive information.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker triggers errors in the application (e.g., by sending invalid requests or exploiting other vulnerabilities) and analyzes the verbose error responses.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, revealing sensitive details about the application's internal structure, file paths, code snippets, dependency versions, and potentially database connection strings or API keys if accidentally logged in error messages. This information can be used to plan further, more targeted attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a malformed request to an API endpoint, causing an exception. The production application, running in debug mode, returns a detailed traceback in the error response, revealing internal file paths and code structure to the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [OpenAPI/Swagger UI Information Leakage (Information Disclosure) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/openapiswagger_ui_information_leakage__information_disclosure___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** OpenAPI/Swagger UI enabled in production, exposing detailed API documentation to the public.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker accesses the OpenAPI documentation and analyzes it to understand the API's endpoints, parameters, data models, authentication schemes, and internal logic.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, revealing valuable information about the API's attack surface, making it easier for attackers to identify potential vulnerabilities and plan attacks. Sensitive details about business logic or data structures might also be unintentionally exposed in the documentation.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the `/docs` endpoint of a production API and uses the Swagger UI to explore all available endpoints, understand the expected request and response formats, and identify potential weaknesses in the API design or implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Version Disclosure [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_version_disclosure__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Application or server configuration that exposes dependency versions in HTTP headers or error messages.
    *   **Exploitation:** Attacker observes HTTP headers or error responses to identify the versions of FastAPI and other dependencies used by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, allowing attackers to identify known vulnerabilities associated with the specific dependency versions. This information can be used to target the application with exploits for those known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** The `Server` header in HTTP responses reveals the Uvicorn version. The attacker checks public vulnerability databases for known vulnerabilities in that specific Uvicorn version and attempts to exploit them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exposure through API Responses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/data_exposure_through_api_responses__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Returning sensitive data in API responses without proper masking or filtering. Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information in API responses that should not be exposed to all users.
*   **Exploitation:** Attacker observes API responses and identifies sensitive data being returned (e.g., personal information, internal IDs, financial data).
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, potentially leading to privacy violations, data breaches, and reputational damage.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint designed to return user profiles accidentally includes social security numbers or credit card details in the response, which are then exposed to any user who can access the endpoint.
