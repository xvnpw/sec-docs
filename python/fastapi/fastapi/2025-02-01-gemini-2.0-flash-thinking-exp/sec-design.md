# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
  - Enhance developer productivity and reduce development time.
  - Promote code quality and maintainability through type hints and automatic data validation.
  - Foster a strong and active community around the framework.
- Business risks:
  - Adoption risk: If developers do not find FastAPI compelling or easy to use, adoption may be limited.
  - Community risk: Reliance on open-source community for support, contributions, and security updates.
  - Security risk: Vulnerabilities in the framework could impact applications built with FastAPI, damaging reputation and user trust.
  - Dependency risk: Reliance on underlying libraries and frameworks (e.g., Starlette, Pydantic) for functionality and security.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: HTTPS enforcement in deployed applications (developer responsibility, recommended in documentation).
  - security control: Input validation using Pydantic (built-in feature, described in documentation).
  - security control: Dependency management using `pip` and `requirements.txt` (standard Python practice, repository files).
  - security control: Security considerations documentation (partially covered in FastAPI documentation, e.g., CORS, HTTPS).
- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in user-provided application code built on FastAPI.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies (addressed by dependency updates, but inherent risk).
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration of deployed applications by users (mitigated by documentation and examples).
- Recommended security controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in FastAPI's CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the framework itself.
  - recommended security control: Provide more comprehensive security documentation, including best practices for secure API development with FastAPI, common security pitfalls, and hardening guidelines.
  - recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process for the FastAPI project.
  - recommended security control: Encourage and facilitate community security audits and contributions.
- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - FastAPI provides tools and examples for implementing various authentication mechanisms (OAuth2, JWT, API keys, HTTP Basic Auth) using dependencies and security utilities.
    - Security requirement: Applications built with FastAPI must implement appropriate authentication mechanisms based on their specific needs.
  - Authorization:
    - FastAPI allows for implementing authorization logic within application code using dependencies and security utilities.
    - Security requirement: Applications built with FastAPI must implement proper authorization to control access to resources and functionalities.
  - Input validation:
    - FastAPI leverages Pydantic for automatic data validation based on type hints and schemas.
    - Security requirement: Applications built with FastAPI should define comprehensive Pydantic models to validate all user inputs and prevent injection attacks.
  - Cryptography:
    - FastAPI itself does not provide built-in cryptography primitives but relies on standard Python libraries and user-implemented cryptography.
    - Security requirement: Applications built with FastAPI should use secure cryptography practices for sensitive data handling, such as password hashing, encryption, and secure communication.

  - FastAPI package artifacts (on PyPI): Sensitivity - Medium (Integrity and availability are important to prevent supply chain attacks).
  - User applications built with FastAPI (code and data): Sensitivity - High (Depends on the application, can include sensitive user data, business logic, etc.).
- Data sensitivity:
  - FastAPI framework code and packages: Primarily integrity and availability are important.

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a widely adopted, high-quality, and developer-friendly web framework. Security is important for maintaining trust and adoption.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is considered important but is primarily addressed through standard software development practices and user responsibility. More proactive security measures could be beneficial.
  - DESIGN: FastAPI is designed as a framework/library, and its security relies heavily on how it is used and deployed by developers. The deployment environment is assumed to be a modern cloud-based container platform for detailed deployment diagram. Build process is assumed to be using GitHub Actions and PyPI for package distribution.
