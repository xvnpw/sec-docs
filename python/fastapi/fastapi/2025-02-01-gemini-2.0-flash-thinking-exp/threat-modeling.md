# Threat Model Analysis for fastapi/fastapi

## Threat: [Validation Bypass due to Pydantic Vulnerabilities](./threats/validation_bypass_due_to_pydantic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the Pydantic library, which FastAPI uses for data validation. By crafting malicious input data, they can bypass FastAPI's validation mechanisms. This allows them to send data that should be rejected, potentially leading to injection attacks, application errors, or security bypasses.
    *   **Impact:**  Data corruption, application malfunction, unauthorized access, data breaches, or potentially remote code execution if the bypassed data is processed unsafely.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** Pydantic Integration (data validation using Pydantic models).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Pydantic updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Regularly monitor Pydantic's security advisories and apply patches promptly.
        *   Implement additional input validation layers beyond Pydantic for critical data.
        *   Use static analysis tools to detect potential Pydantic usage vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization via Pydantic](./threats/insecure_deserialization_via_pydantic.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious serialized data that is deserialized by Pydantic models in FastAPI. If Pydantic or custom deserialization logic is vulnerable, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server or cause other malicious actions during deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption, or unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** Pydantic Integration (data deserialization using Pydantic models).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        *   Sanitize and validate data *before* deserialization, especially for complex or custom formats.
        *   Use secure deserialization practices and libraries. Avoid deserializing arbitrary code.
        *   Regularly audit custom Pydantic models and deserialization logic for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Security Dependencies](./threats/misconfiguration_of_security_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** FastAPI's built-in security utilities (e.g., `security` parameter, `HTTPBearer`, `OAuth2PasswordBearer`) are misconfigured. This leads to authentication or authorization bypasses, granting unauthorized access to protected endpoints and resources. Misconfigurations can include weak secrets or incorrect OAuth2 setup.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass, Unauthorized Access to protected resources, Data Breach.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** Security Utilities (FastAPI's built-in security features).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand and correctly configure FastAPI's security utilities.
        *   Follow security best practices for authentication and authorization.
        *   Use strong, randomly generated secrets for JWTs and other cryptographic operations.
        *   Regularly review security configurations and use security testing tools to identify misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Undisclosed Vulnerabilities in FastAPI or Starlette](./threats/undisclosed_vulnerabilities_in_fastapi_or_starlette.md)

*   **Description:**  FastAPI or its underlying framework Starlette may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities before patches are available, potentially gaining full control of the application or server.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely, potentially including Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Data Breach, complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** Core Framework (FastAPI and Starlette framework code).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest FastAPI and Starlette releases and security advisories.
        *   Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for vulnerability announcements.
        *   Apply security patches promptly as soon as they are released.
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to potentially mitigate exploitation attempts.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Publicly Accessible Documentation](./threats/information_disclosure_via_publicly_accessible_documentation.md)

*   **Description:** The automatically generated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation (`/docs`, `/redoc` endpoints) is publicly accessible without authentication. Attackers can access this documentation to learn about API endpoints, parameters, and authentication schemes, gaining valuable reconnaissance information to plan attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, aiding attacker reconnaissance and potentially leading to further exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** Automatic API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI generation and serving).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the `/docs` and `/redoc` endpoints to authorized users or internal networks.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for accessing documentation endpoints.
        *   Consider disabling documentation generation in production if not needed externally.
        *   Use network firewalls or access control lists to limit access to documentation.

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Endpoints or Sensitive Data in Documentation](./threats/exposure_of_internal_endpoints_or_sensitive_data_in_documentation.md)

*   **Description:** Developers inadvertently include internal or administrative endpoints or sensitive data models in the FastAPI application, which are then exposed in the automatically generated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. This can reveal internal functionality or sensitive data details to unauthorized users.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, potential unauthorized access to internal functionalities or sensitive data, aiding attacker reconnaissance and exploitation.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** Automatic API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI generation and content).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review generated documentation to ensure only intended endpoints and data models are exposed.
        *   Separate public and internal endpoints using FastAPI's routing and dependency injection.
        *   Use OpenAPI schema customization to hide or redact sensitive information from documentation.
        *   Implement code reviews to prevent accidental inclusion of internal endpoints in public API routers.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Complex Validation](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_complex_validation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends excessively complex input data to a FastAPI endpoint. While technically valid according to Pydantic models, this data consumes excessive server resources during validation. Repeated requests can overwhelm the server, causing a Denial of Service.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation for legitimate users, service disruption.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** Pydantic Integration (data validation process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement request size limits to restrict the size of incoming requests.
        *   Apply rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
        *   Consider more efficient validation strategies or custom validation for complex data.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
        *   Implement timeouts for request processing to prevent long-running validation from blocking resources.
