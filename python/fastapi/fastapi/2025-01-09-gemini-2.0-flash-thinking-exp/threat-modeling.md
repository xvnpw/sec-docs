# Threat Model Analysis for fastapi/fastapi

## Threat: [Schema Validation Bypass](./threats/schema_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Schema Validation Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request payload that exploits vulnerabilities or edge cases in Pydantic's validation logic (tightly integrated with FastAPI). This allows them to send data that bypasses the intended validation rules and is processed by the application's FastAPI route handler.
    *   **Impact:** Processing invalid data can lead to data corruption, unexpected application behavior, security vulnerabilities, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fastapi.routing` (route handling), `pydantic` (data validation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust and comprehensive Pydantic schemas.
        *   Regularly update Pydantic.
        *   Add custom validation logic within route handlers.
        *   Implement input sanitization and encoding.

## Threat: [Compromised Dependency Injection](./threats/compromised_dependency_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Dependency Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency that is injected into a FastAPI route handler using the `Depends` function. This could involve exploiting a vulnerability in the dependency itself or replacing the legitimate dependency with a malicious one. FastAPI's dependency injection mechanism facilitates this.
    *   **Impact:** A compromised dependency can perform arbitrary actions within the context of the application, including accessing sensitive data, modifying application state, or executing malicious code on the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fastapi.dependencies.utils.get_dependant` (dependency resolution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all dependencies.
        *   Use dependency management tools to pin versions.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement software composition analysis (SCA).
        *   Consider using a private package repository.

## Threat: [Vulnerable or Malicious Middleware](./threats/vulnerable_or_malicious_middleware.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable or Malicious Middleware
    *   **Description:** Custom middleware or third-party middleware added to the FastAPI application using `app.add_middleware()` might contain security vulnerabilities or be intentionally malicious. This middleware, integrated directly into the FastAPI request/response cycle, can intercept and modify requests and responses.
    *   **Impact:** Vulnerable middleware can introduce various security flaws. Malicious middleware can perform arbitrary actions, including stealing credentials or injecting malicious content.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fastapi.applications.FastAPI.add_middleware` (middleware integration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all middleware.
        *   Keep middleware dependencies up-to-date.
        *   Implement input and output validation within middleware.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for middleware.

## Threat: [Middleware Execution Order Issues](./threats/middleware_execution_order_issues.md)

*   **Threat:** Middleware Execution Order Issues
    *   **Description:** The order in which middleware is added to the FastAPI application using `app.add_middleware()` is crucial. Incorrect ordering might lead to security checks being bypassed or unexpected behavior within the FastAPI request/response pipeline.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as authentication bypasses or authorization failures.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fastapi.applications.FastAPI.add_middleware` (middleware ordering).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan and document the intended execution order of middleware.
        *   Thoroughly test the application with different middleware configurations.

## Threat: [Misuse of Security Utilities](./threats/misuse_of_security_utilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Misuse of Security Utilities
    *   **Description:** Developers might misuse FastAPI's built-in security utilities like `HTTPBasic` or `HTTPBearer` provided within the `fastapi.security` module, leading to insecure authentication or authorization implementations.
    *   **Impact:** Can result in weak authentication, exposure of credentials, or unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fastapi.security` (security utilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand the intended usage of FastAPI's security utilities.
        *   Always use HTTPS for secure communication.
        *   Follow security best practices for credential handling.
        *   Consider using more robust authentication frameworks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Security Utilities](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_security_utilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Security Utilities
    *   **Description:** While less likely, potential vulnerabilities might exist within FastAPI's built-in security utilities provided in the `fastapi.security` module.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to authentication bypasses or other security flaws that compromise the application's security.
    *   **Affected Component:** `fastapi.security` (security utilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a vulnerability is found)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with FastAPI releases and security advisories.
        *   Monitor for reports of vulnerabilities in FastAPI.
        *   Consider using well-established third-party security libraries for critical security functions.
