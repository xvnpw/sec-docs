## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise FastAPI Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_fastapi_application__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and thus the most critical node. Success here signifies a complete breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Validation Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_validation_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

This node is critical because successful exploitation can lead to various severe consequences, including data breaches and code execution, by bypassing intended security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data__critical_node_.md)

This node is critical as it represents a direct pathway to several high-impact injection attacks. Successfully injecting malicious data can directly compromise the database or the server itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This node is critical because it allows attackers to potentially substitute legitimate components with malicious ones, leading to full control over application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Dependency [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_dependency__critical_node_.md)

This node is a critical sub-node within dependency injection vulnerabilities, representing the point where malicious code is introduced into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Path/Query Parameters (if used for DB interaction) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in_pathquery_parameters__if_used_for_db_interaction___high-risk__cbfd48a4.md)

* Attack Vector: Attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within path or query parameters. If the application directly uses these parameters in SQL queries without proper sanitization, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even complete database takeover.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [NoSQL Injection (if using NoSQL databases) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/nosql_injection__if_using_nosql_databases___high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: Similar to SQL injection, but targeting NoSQL databases. Attackers inject malicious queries or commands specific to the NoSQL database being used. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
    * Likelihood: Low
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input Passed to System Calls [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input_passed_to_system_calls__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: Attacker injects malicious commands into input fields that are later used in system calls (e.g., using Python's `subprocess` module). If input is not properly sanitized, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system.
    * Likelihood: Low
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Override Default Dependencies with Malicious Implementations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/override_default_dependencies_with_malicious_implementations__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers exploit the dependency injection mechanism in FastAPI to replace legitimate dependencies with malicious ones. This could involve manipulating configuration or exploiting vulnerabilities in how dependencies are loaded or resolved. Once a malicious dependency is injected, the attacker can control the execution flow and potentially gain full control of the application.
    * Likelihood: Low
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: High

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service by Flooding Asynchronous Tasks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_by_flooding_asynchronous_tasks__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers send a large number of requests that trigger resource-intensive asynchronous tasks. If the application does not have proper rate limiting or resource management in place, this can overwhelm the server, leading to a denial of service.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (DoS)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
