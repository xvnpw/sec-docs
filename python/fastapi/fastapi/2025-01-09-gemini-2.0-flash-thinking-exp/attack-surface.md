# Attack Surface Analysis for fastapi/fastapi

## Attack Surface: [Path Parameter Injection/Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_parameter_injectiontraversal.md)

- **Description:** Attackers manipulate path parameters to access unauthorized resources or execute unintended actions by injecting special characters or relative paths.
    - **How FastAPI Contributes:** FastAPI's routing relies on defining path parameters. If these parameters are directly used to access files or resources without proper validation, it creates an opportunity for injection.
    - **Example:** A route defined as `/files/{filename}` might be accessed with `/files/../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read the system's password file.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for remote code execution depending on how the path is used.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement strict input validation on path parameters, allowing only expected characters and formats.
        - Avoid directly using path parameters to construct file paths. Use an index or mapping to translate user-provided identifiers to internal resource paths.
        - Employ path sanitization techniques to remove or escape potentially malicious characters.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the dependency injection system to inject malicious dependencies or manipulate the application's behavior.
    - **How FastAPI Contributes:** FastAPI's built-in dependency injection system allows for reusable code and easier testing but can introduce risks if not managed carefully.
    - **Example:**  An attacker might find a way to influence the dependency resolution process to inject a malicious database connection or authentication service.
    - **Impact:**  Compromise of application logic, data breaches, potential for privilege escalation.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Carefully manage and secure dependencies. Use specific versions and verify their integrity.
        - Avoid overly complex dependency injection configurations that might be difficult to audit.
        - Ensure dependencies themselves are secure and follow secure coding practices.
        - Limit the scope and permissions of injected dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [CORS Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/cors_misconfiguration.md)

- **Description:** Incorrectly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies allow unintended origins to access the API, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or data breaches.
    - **How FastAPI Contributes:** FastAPI provides tools for managing CORS. Misconfiguration of these settings can create vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** Setting `allow_origins=["*"]` in production allows any website to make requests to the API.
    - **Impact:** Enables malicious websites to interact with the API on behalf of users, potentially stealing data or performing actions without their consent.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Carefully configure CORS settings, explicitly listing allowed origins instead of using wildcards in production.
        - Understand the implications of different CORS headers and their values.
        - Regularly review and update CORS configurations.
