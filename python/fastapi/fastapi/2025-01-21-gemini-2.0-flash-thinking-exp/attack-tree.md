## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Validation Weaknesses -> Injection Attacks via Validated Fields -> SQL Injection through validated string fields [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_validation_weaknesses_-_injection_attacks_via_validated_fields_-_sql_injection_through__f92241c5.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Data Validation Weaknesses -> Injection Attacks via Validated Fields -> SQL Injection through validated string fields [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** Even though FastAPI uses Pydantic for data validation, if the validated string data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection.
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL code within the input string, which bypasses the type validation (as it's still a string) but is then executed by the database.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
    * **Mitigation:**  Use ORM or database abstraction layers with parameterized queries. Avoid constructing SQL queries using string concatenation of user-provided data, even if validated for type.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Dependency Injection -> Dependency Poisoning -> Compromise a dependency used by the application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_dependency_injection_-_dependency_poisoning_-_compromise_a_dependency_used_by_the_application__8affab9b.md)

**High-Risk Path: Abuse Dependency Injection -> Dependency Poisoning -> Compromise a dependency used by the application [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** If a dependency used by the FastAPI application has known vulnerabilities, or if an attacker can compromise the dependency supply chain, they can inject malicious code into the application.
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker either exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency or manages to replace a legitimate dependency with a malicious one.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust dependency management practices. Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions. Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Verify the integrity of dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Request Handling -> Query Parameter Exploitation -> Injection attacks via query parameters [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_request_handling_-_query_parameter_exploitation_-_injection_attacks_via_query_parameters__8689a054.md)

**High-Risk Path: Manipulate Request Handling -> Query Parameter Exploitation -> Injection attacks via query parameters [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** Query parameters are directly exposed in the URL and are a common target for injection attacks if not properly sanitized and validated.
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker crafts malicious payloads within the query parameters, such as SQL injection code, command injection attempts, or other malicious scripts.
    * **Potential Impact:** Depending on the injection type, this can lead to database compromise (SQL injection), arbitrary code execution on the server (command injection), or other vulnerabilities.
    * **Mitigation:**  Always sanitize and validate query parameters. Use parameterized queries for database interactions. Avoid directly executing system commands based on query parameter values. Implement input validation based on expected data types and formats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Functionality -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization Middleware -> Find vulnerabilities in custom authentication/authorization middleware [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_functionality_-_bypass_authenticationauthorization_middleware_-_find_vulnerabilit_c3c98cfe.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Middleware Functionality -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization Middleware -> Find vulnerabilities in custom authentication/authorization middleware [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application implements custom middleware for authentication or authorization, vulnerabilities in this middleware can allow attackers to bypass security controls.
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker identifies flaws in the custom middleware logic, such as incorrect token verification, flawed session management, or logic errors that grant unauthorized access.
    * **Potential Impact:** Complete bypass of authentication and authorization, allowing the attacker to access sensitive resources and perform actions as a legitimate user or administrator.
    * **Mitigation:** Thoroughly review and test custom authentication and authorization middleware. Follow security best practices for authentication and authorization (e.g., use established security protocols like OAuth 2.0, use strong and properly implemented cryptography). Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the middleware. Avoid implementing custom authentication/authorization logic if well-established and secure libraries can be used.
