# Threat Model Analysis for fastapi/fastapi

## Threat: [Data Validation Bypass through Complex Schemas](./threats/data_validation_bypass_through_complex_schemas.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request payload that exploits vulnerabilities or edge cases in overly complex or poorly defined Pydantic schemas *used within FastAPI routes* for request body validation. This allows them to send data that bypasses intended validation rules enforced by FastAPI.

**Impact:** The FastAPI application might process invalid or malicious data, leading to unexpected behavior, data corruption, security vulnerabilities, or even application crashes.

**Affected Component:** `fastapi.routing` (handling request routing and data parsing), `pydantic` (data validation library tightly integrated with FastAPI).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Pydantic schemas simple and well-defined within FastAPI route definitions.
*   Thoroughly test schemas with various valid and invalid inputs, including edge cases and boundary conditions, specifically within the context of FastAPI request handling.
*   Utilize Pydantic's features for strict validation (e.g., `strict=True`) when defining schemas used in FastAPI.
*   Consider using custom Pydantic validators for complex validation logic within FastAPI routes.
*   Regularly review and update schemas as the FastAPI application evolves.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Complex Request Body Validation (DoS)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_complex_request_body_validation__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted requests with extremely large or deeply nested JSON payloads to FastAPI endpoints. This exploits the resource consumption of Pydantic's validation process *within FastAPI's request handling*, leading to high CPU and memory usage, potentially causing a denial of service.

**Impact:** The FastAPI application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.

**Affected Component:** `fastapi.routing` (for handling incoming requests), `pydantic` (for validating request bodies within FastAPI).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement request size limits within the FastAPI application or using a reverse proxy.
*   Consider using more efficient validation techniques for very large or complex data structures if necessary within the FastAPI context.
*   Implement rate limiting using FastAPI middleware or external tools to prevent excessive requests to FastAPI endpoints.
*   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity when running the FastAPI application.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Dependency Injection Cycles](./threats/denial_of_service_through_dependency_injection_cycles.md)

**Description:** An attacker (or even accidental code) introduces circular dependencies in the FastAPI dependency injection system. This can lead to infinite loops or excessive resource consumption during FastAPI application startup or request processing, causing a denial of service.

**Impact:** The FastAPI application fails to start or becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.

**Affected Component:** `fastapi.dependencies.models` (for managing dependencies within FastAPI), `fastapi.dependencies.utils` (for dependency resolution in FastAPI).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design dependencies within the FastAPI application and avoid circular dependencies.
*   Utilize linters and static analysis tools to detect potential dependency cycles in the FastAPI codebase.
*   Thoroughly test the FastAPI application's startup and dependency injection logic.
*   FastAPI might detect some cycles and raise errors, but robust design is key to prevent this.

## Threat: [Middleware Misconfiguration Leading to Authentication/Authorization Bypass](./threats/middleware_misconfiguration_leading_to_authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Improperly configured or ordered middleware *within the FastAPI application* can create vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass authentication or authorization checks. For example, if an authentication middleware is placed after a routing middleware that handles sensitive endpoints in FastAPI, those endpoints might be accessible without proper authentication.

**Impact:** Unauthorized users can access protected resources or perform actions they are not permitted to within the FastAPI application, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other security compromises.

**Affected Component:** `fastapi.applications` (for managing middleware in FastAPI), `starlette.middleware` (the underlying middleware framework used by FastAPI).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure and order middleware within the FastAPI application to ensure authentication and authorization checks are performed before accessing protected resources.
*   Thoroughly test middleware configurations in the FastAPI application to ensure they function as intended and do not introduce security gaps.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access controls within the FastAPI application.
