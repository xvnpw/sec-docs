# Attack Surface Analysis for fastapi/fastapi

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities via Request Body (Pydantic)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_via_request_body__pydantic_.md)

*   **Description:** FastAPI relies on Pydantic for request body parsing and validation. Vulnerabilities in Pydantic or the underlying serialization libraries (like `json`) could be exploited by sending crafted data.
*   **How FastAPI Contributes:** FastAPI's tight integration with Pydantic makes it a key component in handling request bodies, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in Pydantic or its dependencies.
*   **Example:** Sending a specially crafted JSON payload that exploits a known vulnerability in the JSON deserializer, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Pydantic and its dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Carefully review Pydantic model definitions to avoid overly permissive schemas that might allow unexpected data structures that could trigger vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using alternative serialization libraries if specific vulnerabilities are identified and FastAPI allows for such customization (though Pydantic is deeply integrated).

## Attack Surface: [CORS Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/cors_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings can allow unauthorized access to the API from different origins, potentially leading to data breaches or other attacks.
*   **How FastAPI Contributes:** FastAPI provides middleware (`CORSMiddleware`) for handling CORS, and its configuration directly determines the allowed origins, methods, and headers. Misconfiguration within this FastAPI component leads to the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Setting `allow_origins=["*"]` in the `CORSMiddleware` allows any website to make requests to the API, potentially exposing sensitive data or functionality.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, data theft, unauthorized API access, session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure CORS with the most restrictive settings possible, explicitly listing allowed origins.
    *   Avoid using wildcard (`*`) for `allow_origins` in production environments.
    *   Carefully review and understand the implications of each CORS setting within the `CORSMiddleware` configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Exploitation (Specifically if FastAPI exacerbates it)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusionexploitation__specifically_if_fastapi_exacerbates_it_.md)

*   **Description:** If the FastAPI application relies on external dependencies with known vulnerabilities, these vulnerabilities can be exploited. Dependency confusion can occur if an attacker can introduce a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency.
*   **How FastAPI Contributes:** While not solely a FastAPI issue, the framework's reliance on external libraries makes it susceptible. If FastAPI's dependency management or import mechanisms create specific scenarios that make exploitation easier, it directly contributes.
*   **Example:** A FastAPI application using an outdated version of a library with a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability through interactions with the FastAPI application.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update dependencies to their latest secure versions using tools like `pip` or `poetry`.
    *   Use dependency management tools with lock files to ensure consistent and known dependency versions.
    *   Implement security scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies within the FastAPI project.
    *   For dependency confusion, consider using private package repositories or namespace packages to reduce the risk of malicious package substitution.
