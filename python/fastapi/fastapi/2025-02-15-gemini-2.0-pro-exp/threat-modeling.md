# Threat Model Analysis for fastapi/fastapi

## Threat: [Dependency Injection Hijacking](./threats/dependency_injection_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in FastAPI's dependency injection system to inject malicious code or override legitimate dependencies.  They might achieve this by:
    *   Finding a way to influence the dependency resolution process (e.g., through user input that affects dependency selection, *if* dependencies are resolved dynamically based on user input â€“ this is a bad practice and should be avoided).
    *   Exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party dependency *that is used as a FastAPI dependency* and allows code execution. This is less *direct*, but the dependency injection system is the mechanism of exploitation.
    *   Compromising a package repository and publishing a malicious version of a dependency *that is used as a FastAPI dependency*. Again, less *direct*, but the dependency injection system is how it's leveraged.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Execution:** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application.
    *   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data can be accessed and exfiltrated.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The application can be made unavailable.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker might gain elevated privileges within the application or the underlying system.
*   **Affected Component:** FastAPI's dependency injection system (`fastapi.Depends`, dependency resolution logic). This is a *core* FastAPI feature.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (Poetry, Pipenv) with strict version pinning and checksum verification.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant dependencies only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Resolution:** *Crucially*, minimize or eliminate dynamic dependency resolution based on user input. This is the most direct attack vector.
    *   **Security Linters:** Use static analysis tools to detect potential dependency injection issues.
    *   **Dependency Freezing:** Consider freezing dependencies for deployment.

## Threat: [Pydantic Model Validation Bypass (Leading to Severe Consequences)](./threats/pydantic_model_validation_bypass__leading_to_severe_consequences_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that bypasses the validation rules defined in Pydantic models.  While *any* validation bypass is a concern, this threat focuses on bypasses that lead to *high or critical* impacts. This requires a combination of a Pydantic bypass *and* a subsequent vulnerability that the bypass enables. Examples:
    *   Bypassing a Pydantic validation that was intended to prevent NoSQL injection, leading to data exfiltration.
    *   Bypassing a Pydantic validation that was intended to prevent a path traversal attack, leading to file system access.
    *   Bypassing a length check on a field that is later used in a format string, leading to a format string vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach (Severe):**  If the bypass enables an injection attack (e.g., NoSQL injection) or other data exfiltration vulnerability.
    *   **Code Execution (Severe):** If the bypass enables a format string vulnerability or other code execution vulnerability.
    *   **System Compromise (Severe):** If the bypass enables a path traversal attack that allows access to sensitive system files.
*   **Affected Component:** Pydantic models used for request and response validation (`pydantic.BaseModel`, validation logic) *in conjunction with* other vulnerable code that relies on the Pydantic validation. This highlights the importance of defense in depth.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability enabled by the bypass)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Comprehensive Validation:** Define *extremely* strict and thorough validation rules in Pydantic models, going beyond basic type checking.
    *   **Avoid `extra = 'allow'`:** Use `extra = 'forbid'` to prevent unexpected fields.
    *   **Regular Pydantic Updates:** Keep Pydantic updated to the latest version.
    *   **Extensive Testing:** Thoroughly test models with valid and *invalid* input, including fuzzing, specifically targeting potential bypasses that could lead to severe consequences.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** *Crucially*, implement additional validation and security checks at *other* application layers. Do *not* rely solely on Pydantic for security-critical validation.  For example, if using a NoSQL database, implement explicit NoSQL injection prevention *in addition to* Pydantic validation.
    *   **Understand Pydantic Limitations:** Be acutely aware of what Pydantic *doesn't* protect against, and implement appropriate safeguards.
    * **Sanitize after validation:** Even after Pydantic validation, sanitize data before using it in sensitive operations (e.g., database queries, file system operations).
