# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for fastapi/fastapi

## Mitigation Strategy: [Precise Pydantic Model Definitions within FastAPI Endpoints and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/precise_pydantic_model_definitions_within_fastapi_endpoints_and_dependencies.md)

1.  **Identify Input:**  Identify all data entering the application through FastAPI endpoints (request bodies, query parameters, path parameters, headers) and through dependencies used via `Depends()`.
2.  **Create Pydantic Models:**  For *every* input point, create a corresponding Pydantic model.  This includes models for:
    *   Request bodies (used as type hints in endpoint functions).
    *   Query parameters (using `Query()` within `Depends()` or as function parameters).
    *   Path parameters (using `Path()` within `Depends()` or as function parameters).
    *   Headers (using `Header()` within `Depends()` or as function parameters).
    *   Data passed *between* dependencies (use Pydantic models as type hints within `Depends()` functions).
3.  **Strict Typing:**  Within each Pydantic model:
    *   Use the most specific data types possible (e.g., `int`, `str`, `EmailStr`, `HttpUrl`, `UUID`, `datetime`). Avoid `Any` or overly broad types like `dict` without specific key/value type constraints.
    *   Utilize Pydantic's constrained types: `conint`, `constr`, `confloat`, `conlist`, `conset`, `conbytes`, `condecimal`, `concurrency`.  These allow you to specify precise constraints (e.g., `conint(gt=0, lt=100)` for an integer greater than 0 and less than 100).
    *   Define regular expressions for string validation using `constr(regex=...)`, but *carefully* review these for potential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities.  Use tools to test your regexes.
4.  **Custom Validators:**  Implement custom validation logic using Pydantic's `@validator` decorator.  This allows you to enforce application-specific rules that go beyond basic type checking and constraints.  For example:
    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

    class Item(BaseModel):
        name: str
        price: float

        @validator("price")
        def price_must_be_positive(cls, value):
            if value <= 0:
                raise ValueError("Price must be positive")
            return value
    ```
5.  **Field Aliases:** Use the `alias` parameter in `Field()` to map external field names (e.g., from a request) to internal field names. This can help prevent attackers from guessing internal field names, which could be useful in some attack scenarios.
6. **Apply in Endpoints and Dependencies:**
    *   Use the Pydantic models as type hints in your FastAPI endpoint function parameters.  FastAPI automatically handles validation and error responses.
    *   Within dependencies (functions decorated with `@app.depends`), use Pydantic models as type hints for parameters that receive data originating from user input.
7. **Handle Validation Errors:** FastAPI automatically returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity error with details when validation fails.  You can customize this error handling using exception handlers if needed, but the default behavior is generally sufficient.

    **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Injection Attacks (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.) (Severity: Critical):  Precise validation prevents malicious code from being injected through input fields.
        *   **Threat:** Data Corruption (Severity: High):  Ensures only valid data is accepted, preventing corruption of the data store.
        *   **Threat:** Business Logic Errors (Severity: Medium):  Enforces data constraints that align with business rules.
        *   **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Severity: Medium):  Careful review and testing of regular expressions within Pydantic models mitigates this.
        *   **Threat:** Data Type Mismatch (Severity: Low):  Pydantic enforces strict type checking.
        *   **Threat:** Oversized Payload (Severity: Medium): Constrained types (e.g., `constr(max_length=...)`) can limit the size of input data.

    **Impact:**
        *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.  Pydantic's validation, especially with custom validators and constrained types, makes injection attacks much harder.
        *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.  Only valid data conforming to the defined models is accepted.
        *   **Business Logic Errors:** Risk reduced.  Data conforms to expected formats and constraints.
        *   **ReDoS:** Risk reduced (but requires careful regex design).
        *   **Data Type Mismatch:** Risk eliminated.
        *   **Oversized Payload:** Risk reduced.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Pydantic models are used for request body validation in all API endpoints (e.g., `models/request.py`, `routes/items.py`).

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The `external_api` dependency (`services/external_service.py`) does not use a Pydantic model to validate data received from the external API.  This is a critical gap.
        *   Custom validators are missing for some business logic checks in the `order_service` dependency (`services/order.py`).
        *   Review and potentially add more constrained types to existing Pydantic models throughout the application.
        *   Pydantic models are not consistently used within dependencies for data validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Conditional OpenAPI Documentation Exposure using `openapi_url`](./mitigation_strategies/conditional_openapi_documentation_exposure_using__openapi_url_.md)

1.  **Environment Variable:**  Use an environment variable (e.g., `ENVIRONMENT`) to determine the current environment (development, staging, production).
2.  **FastAPI App Initialization:**  When initializing the `FastAPI` application instance, conditionally set the `openapi_url` parameter:
    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    import os

    env = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development")  # Default to development

    if env == "production":
        app = FastAPI(openapi_url=None)  # Disable OpenAPI
    else:
        app = FastAPI()  # Enable OpenAPI (default behavior)
    ```
    This code disables the OpenAPI documentation (Swagger UI and Redoc) in the production environment by setting `openapi_url` to `None`.  In other environments, it's enabled by default.
3. **Alternative: Custom Route:** Instead of disabling entirely, you could create a custom route that serves the OpenAPI JSON only under specific conditions (e.g., based on authentication or environment). This gives more flexibility.

    **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):  OpenAPI documentation can reveal sensitive information about the API's internal structure, endpoints, and data models.
        *   **Threat:** Attack Surface Expansion (Severity: Low):  Makes it easier for attackers to understand the API's attack surface.
        *   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Internal Endpoints (Severity: Medium):  Endpoints intended for internal use might be inadvertently exposed.

    **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk eliminated in production (or restricted to authorized users if using a custom route).
        *   **Attack Surface Expansion:** Risk significantly reduced in production.
        *   **Accidental Exposure of Internal Endpoints:** Risk eliminated in production.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   The `openapi_url` is set to `None` in the production environment configuration (`config/production.py`).

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   None. This strategy is fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Selective Endpoint Inclusion in OpenAPI using `include_in_schema`](./mitigation_strategies/selective_endpoint_inclusion_in_openapi_using__include_in_schema_.md)

1.  **Identify Sensitive Endpoints:**  Identify any API endpoints that should *not* be included in the automatically generated OpenAPI documentation.  These might be internal endpoints, administrative endpoints, or endpoints that handle particularly sensitive data.
2.  **Use `include_in_schema`:**  For each sensitive endpoint, set the `include_in_schema` parameter to `False` in the route decorator:
    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/public")
    async def public_endpoint():
        return {"message": "This is a public endpoint"}

    @app.get("/internal", include_in_schema=False)  # Hide this endpoint
    async def internal_endpoint():
        return {"message": "This is an internal endpoint"}
    ```
    This prevents the `/internal` endpoint from appearing in the Swagger UI and Redoc documentation.
3. **Apply Consistently:** Apply this consistently to *all* endpoints that should be excluded from the documentation.

    **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):  Prevents specific sensitive endpoints from being exposed in the documentation.
        *   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Internal Endpoints (Severity: Medium):  Explicitly hides internal endpoints.

    **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced for the specific endpoints that are excluded.
        *   **Accidental Exposure of Internal Endpoints:** Risk eliminated for the excluded endpoints.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `include_in_schema=False` is used for the `/admin` endpoint (`routes/admin.py`).

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Review all endpoints and ensure that `include_in_schema` is used appropriately for any other sensitive endpoints.  There may be other internal routes that should be hidden.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Dependency Injection with FastAPI's `Depends`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dependency_injection_with_fastapi's__depends_.md)

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure each dependency injected via `Depends()` has only the *minimum* necessary permissions.  Avoid granting broad access within dependencies.
2.  **Input Validation within Dependencies:** If a dependency receives data that ultimately originates from user input (even indirectly), validate that data *within the dependency itself* using Pydantic models.  This creates defense in depth.
    ```python
    from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
    from pydantic import BaseModel, PositiveInt

    app = FastAPI()

    class UserId(BaseModel):
        user_id: PositiveInt

    async def get_user_id(user_id: UserId = Depends()):
        # user_id.user_id is already validated as a PositiveInt
        return user_id.user_id

    @app.get("/users/{user_id}")
    async def read_user(user_id: int = Depends(get_user_id)):
        return {"user_id": user_id}
    ```
3.  **Context Managers:** Use Python's `with` statement (context managers) within dependencies that interact with external resources (databases, files, network connections) to ensure proper resource cleanup, even if exceptions occur. This is particularly important for database connections.
    ```python
    from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
    # Assume get_db is a function that returns a database connection

    app = FastAPI()

    async def get_db(): #Simplified example
        db = ... # Get DB connection
        try:
            yield db
        finally:
            db.close()

    async def get_user(db = Depends(get_db)):
        with db.cursor() as cursor: # Example using context manager
            cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
    ```
4.  **Avoid Global State:** Dependencies should ideally be stateless or manage state very carefully.  Avoid using global variables within dependencies, as this can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues in concurrent requests.
5. **Secrets Management:** Do *not* inject secrets directly using `Depends()`. Instead, inject a service that *retrieves* secrets from a secure store (environment variables, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
6. **Review Dependencies:** Regularly review all dependencies, including those used within the DI system, for known vulnerabilities and security best practices.

    **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: High):  Dependencies with excessive privileges could be exploited to access sensitive data.
        *   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):  A compromised dependency with broad access could be used to gain control of the application.
        *   **Threat:** Injection Attacks (Severity: Critical):  Unvalidated input within dependencies can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Threat:** Resource Leaks (Severity: Medium):  Dependencies that don't properly manage resources (e.g., database connections) can lead to resource exhaustion.
        *   **Threat:** Data Corruption (Severity: High): Incorrect handling of shared state within dependencies can lead to data corruption.
        *   **Threat:** Secrets Exposure (Severity: Critical): Directly injecting secrets makes them vulnerable to exposure.

    **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk significantly reduced by limiting dependency privileges.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced by validating input within dependencies.
        *   **Resource Leaks:** Risk reduced by using context managers for resource management.
        *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced by avoiding global state and using proper synchronization.
        *   **Secrets Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced by using a secrets management service.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   The `database` dependency (`db/database.py`) uses a context manager to manage database connections.
        *   Basic input validation is implemented in the `user_service` dependency (`services/user.py`).

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The `external_api` dependency (`services/external_service.py`) does not validate input and has unrestricted network access.
        *   Review and potentially restrict permissions for other dependencies.
        *   Ensure consistent use of Pydantic models for input validation within all dependencies.
        *   Implement a secrets management solution and refactor dependencies to use it.
