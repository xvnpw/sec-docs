## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Injection](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_injection.md)

1.  **Dependency Injection**
    *   **DI Hijacking:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the application to inject a malicious dependency instead of the intended one. This typically happens when user input directly controls which dependency is used.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Potential for RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Never allow user input to directly determine which dependency is injected. Use a whitelist or factory pattern.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Operations](./attack_tree_paths/path_operations.md)

2.  **Path Operations**

    *   **`[*** Path Traversal ***]`:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker uses ".." sequences or absolute paths in a path parameter to access files or directories outside the intended directory. This occurs when the developer uses user input to construct file paths without proper sanitization.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (File system access, data exfiltration, potential RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Never construct file paths directly from user input. Use a whitelist of allowed paths or store files in a database and access them by ID.

## Attack Tree Path: [Request Validation (Pydantic)](./attack_tree_paths/request_validation__pydantic_.md)

3.  **Request Validation (Pydantic)**

    *   **`[*** Request Body Type Confusion ***]`:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker sends unexpected data types in the request body that bypass validation because the developer used `Any` or overly broad types in the Pydantic model.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on how the data is used)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Use specific Pydantic types whenever possible. Avoid `Any` or overly broad types.

    *   **`[*** Request Body Data Leak ***]`:**
        *   **Description:** Sensitive data included in Pydantic models is unintentionally exposed in API responses because the developer did not carefully control the response structure (e.g., using the same model for request and response).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the sensitivity of the data)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:** Use separate Pydantic models for request and response bodies. Explicitly define which fields are returned.

## Attack Tree Path: [Background Tasks](./attack_tree_paths/background_tasks.md)

4.  **Background Tasks**

    *   **Background Task Code Injection:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker is able to inject and execute arbitrary code within a background task. This is a severe vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Never allow user input to directly control the code executed in a background task. Use a predefined set of allowed tasks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Starlette Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/starlette_vulnerabilities.md)

5.  **Starlette Vulnerabilities**

    *   **Starlette RCE:**
        *   **Description:** A vulnerability in the Starlette framework (upon which FastAPI is built) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Varies (Could be very low if a public exploit exists)
        *   **Skill Level:** Varies (Could be beginner if a public exploit exists)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Starlette (and all dependencies) up-to-date. Monitor security advisories.
