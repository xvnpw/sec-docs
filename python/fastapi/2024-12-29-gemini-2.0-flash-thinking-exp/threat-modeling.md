Here are the high and critical threats directly involving FastAPI:

*   **Threat:** Bypassing Validation through Custom Data Types
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in poorly implemented custom Pydantic data types used within a FastAPI application to bypass validation logic. This allows them to send invalid or malicious data that the application processes.
    *   **Impact:** Allows the attacker to send invalid or malicious data that the application processes, potentially leading to various security issues like data corruption, unauthorized access, or code execution depending on how the bypassed data is used.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** `Pydantic`'s custom data type functionality within FastAPI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom Pydantic data types.
        *   Ensure custom types correctly handle all possible input variations and edge cases.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom data types.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Dependencies in Dependency Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker benefits from vulnerabilities present in dependencies injected into FastAPI route handlers using the `Depends` function. This could be through known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used as dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service affecting the FastAPI application.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** `FastAPI`'s dependency injection system (`Depends`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit and update all project dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Bypass Vulnerabilities in Security Utilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits vulnerabilities in the implementation of FastAPI's built-in security utilities (e.g., `HTTPBasic`, `HTTPBearer`), allowing them to bypass authentication or authorization checks enforced by FastAPI.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities within the FastAPI application.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** FastAPI's security utility classes (e.g., `fastapi.security`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with FastAPI releases and security advisories to patch any identified vulnerabilities in the security utilities.
        *   Consider using well-established and thoroughly vetted third-party authentication and authorization libraries for complex requirements instead of relying solely on built-in utilities.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Uploads
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file names during upload to a FastAPI application to write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical files or uploading executable code. This exploits how FastAPI handles uploaded files.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data loss, or remote code execution on the server hosting the FastAPI application.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** `UploadFile` and the handling of uploaded files in FastAPI route handlers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate uploaded file names within the FastAPI route handler.
        *   Store uploaded files in a dedicated location and avoid using user-provided file names directly.
        *   Implement strict access controls on the upload directory.

*   **Threat:** Malicious File Execution after Upload
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a script) to a FastAPI application and then finds a way to execute it on the server. This is a risk if FastAPI doesn't properly isolate or handle uploaded files.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, remote code execution on the server hosting the FastAPI application.
    *   **Affected FastAPI Component:** `UploadFile` and the handling of uploaded files within the FastAPI application, as well as any subsequent processing of those files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation within the FastAPI route handler.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root.
        *   Consider using sandboxing or virus scanning for uploaded files.
        *   Avoid directly executing uploaded files based on user input or without thorough security checks.
