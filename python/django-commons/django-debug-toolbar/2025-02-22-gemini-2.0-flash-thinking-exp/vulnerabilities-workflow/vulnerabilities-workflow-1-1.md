- vulnerability name: SQL Injection in SQL Panel Views (`sql_select`, `sql_explain`, `sql_profile`)
  description: |
    The Django Debug Toolbar's SQL panel provides functionality to execute SQL queries directly through the `sql_select`, `sql_explain`, and `sql_profile` views. These views, located in `/code/debug_toolbar/panels/sql/views.py` (not provided in PROJECT FILES, but context from previous analysis remains valid), process user-provided SQL queries and parameters via a signed form (`SignedDataForm`) and `SQLSelectForm`. If `SQLSelectForm` fails to properly sanitize or parameterize the SQL queries before execution, it becomes susceptible to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `raw_sql` parameter to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The file `/code/debug_toolbar/panels/sql/forms.py` shows that `SQLSelectForm` performs only basic validation, checking if the query starts with `SELECT`, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This can result in:
    - **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data by directly querying database tables.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to data integrity issues.
    - **Database Compromise:** In severe cases, complete control over the database server, potentially allowing for further attacks on the underlying system.
  vulnerability rank: critical
  currently implemented mitigations: |
    The project uses `SignedDataForm` to sign the data sent in requests to the SQL panel views. This signature verifies that the data has not been tampered with during transit, aiming to prevent basic request manipulation. However, this measure does not prevent SQL Injection if the server-side processing of the SQL query within `SQLSelectForm` is flawed. As seen in `/code/debug_toolbar/panels/sql/forms.py`, the validation in `SQLSelectForm` is limited to checking if the query starts with `SELECT`, which is not a sufficient mitigation against SQL injection.
  missing mitigations: |
    The primary missing mitigation is proper SQL query parameterization and input sanitization within the `SQLSelectForm` and the SQL execution logic in the views (`sql_select`, `sql_explain`, `sql_profile`). The application should use parameterized queries to ensure that user-provided data is treated as data, not as executable SQL code. Input validation should also be implemented to restrict the types of SQL operations allowed and to detect and reject potentially malicious SQL syntax.
  preconditions: |
    - The Django Debug Toolbar must be enabled and accessible. This typically requires `DEBUG=True` in Django settings and the attacker's IP address to be either within `INTERNAL_IPS` or able to bypass these restrictions if misconfigured.
    - The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the Debug Toolbar and access the SQL panel.
    - The attacker must be able to initiate requests to the vulnerable SQL panel views (`sql_select`, `sql_explain`, `sql_profile`).
  source code analysis: |
    - File: `/code/debug_toolbar/panels/sql/views.py` (not provided, context from previous analysis remains valid)
    - The `sql_select`, `sql_explain`, and `sql_profile` views use `SQLSelectForm` to process user input.
    - File: `/code/debug_toolbar/panels/sql/forms.py`
    - The `SQLSelectForm` in `/code/debug_toolbar/panels/sql/forms.py` is used to handle SQL queries.
    - The `clean_raw_sql` method in `SQLSelectForm` checks if the input starts with `SELECT`:
      ```python
      def clean_raw_sql(self):
          value = self.cleaned_data["raw_sql"]

          if not is_select_query(value):
              raise ValidationError("Only 'select' queries are allowed.")

          return value
      ```
      This validation is insufficient to prevent SQL injection as it does not sanitize or parameterize the SQL query.
    - The `clean_params` method in `SQLSelectForm` only validates if the `params` input is valid JSON:
      ```python
      def clean_params(self):
          value = self.cleaned_data["params"]

          try:
              return json.loads(value)
          except ValueError as exc:
              raise ValidationError("Is not valid JSON") from exc
      ```
      This also does not contribute to SQL injection prevention.
    - The `cursor` property in `SQLSelectForm` simply retrieves a database cursor without any sanitization:
      ```python
      @cached_property
      def cursor(self):
          return self.connection.cursor()
      ```
    - The vulnerability lies in the potential execution of unsanitized `raw_sql` and `params` within the view using `cursor.execute(sql, params)`. Without seeing the view code in `/code/debug_toolbar/panels/sql/views.py`, we rely on the previous analysis context that indicates this vulnerable pattern.
  security test case: |
    1. **Setup:** Deploy a Django application with Django Debug Toolbar enabled (`DEBUG=True`, IP address in `INTERNAL_IPS`). Ensure the application executes some SQL queries so that the SQL panel is populated.
    2. **Access SQL Panel:** Access the Django Debug Toolbar in the browser and navigate to the SQL Panel.
    3. **Select Query for Exploitation:** Identify a SQL query listed in the panel. Click the "Select", "Explain", or "Profile" button associated with this query. This action will typically open a detailed view or prepare a form for further interaction with the query.
    4. **Intercept Request:** Use browser developer tools or a proxy (like Burp Suite) to intercept the request generated when submitting the form (or clicking the button) for "Select", "Explain", or "Profile". The request will be sent to URLs like `/__debug__/sql_select/`, `/__debug__/sql_explain/`, or `/__debug__/sql_profile/`.
    5. **Modify `raw_sql` Parameter:** In the intercepted request's POST data, locate the `raw_sql` parameter. Modify this parameter to inject malicious SQL code. For example, if the original query was `SELECT * FROM auth_user WHERE id = %s`, replace the content of `raw_sql` with:
       ```sql
       SELECT * FROM auth_user WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE auth_user; --
       ```
       Ensure that you maintain a valid `signed` parameter. If re-signing is too complex for initial testing, focus on less destructive injection attempts first, like using `UNION SELECT` to extract data.
    6. **Send Modified Request:** Forward the modified request to the server.
    7. **Verify SQL Injection:**
        - **Check for Errors:** Observe the response from the server. An error message related to the database after injecting SQL might indicate successful injection (though not always).
        - **Database State (If Destructive Injection):** If you attempted a destructive query like `DROP TABLE`, check the database directly (using a database client) to see if the table was indeed dropped. **Warning**: Perform destructive tests only in a controlled, non-production environment.
        - **Data Exfiltration (If `UNION SELECT` Injection):** If you used `UNION SELECT` to try and extract data, examine the response HTML content for signs of the injected data being displayed.
    8. **Success Confirmation:** If you can observe database changes resulting from your injected SQL code or successfully extract unauthorized data, the SQL injection vulnerability is confirmed.

- vulnerability name: Information Disclosure via Settings Panel
  description: |
    The Settings panel in the Django Debug Toolbar, located in `/code/debug_toolbar/panels/settings.py` (not provided in PROJECT FILES, but context from previous analysis remains valid), is designed to display a comprehensive list of Django project settings. While intended for development and debugging, if the Debug Toolbar is inadvertently or intentionally enabled in a production environment (`DEBUG=True`), this panel becomes a significant information disclosure vulnerability. Attackers gaining access to this panel can view sensitive configuration details. The file `/code/example/settings.py` demonstrates how easily `DEBUG = True` can be set, and how the Debug Toolbar is enabled based on this setting.
  impact: |
    Exposure of Django settings can lead to critical information disclosure, including:
    - **Database Credentials:** Usernames, passwords, hostnames, and ports for database access, allowing attackers to directly access and manipulate the database.
    - **Secret Keys:** The `SECRET_KEY`, crucial for cryptographic operations, if exposed, can lead to session hijacking, CSRF bypass, and other security breaches.
    - **API Keys and Service Credentials:** Exposure of API keys for external services, email server credentials, and other sensitive service integrations, enabling unauthorized access to these services.
    - **Internal Application Structure:** Insights into the application's internal configuration, which can aid in planning further, more targeted attacks.
  vulnerability rank: high
  currently implemented mitigations: |
    The Django Debug Toolbar is intended for development use only, and the primary intended mitigation is that it should not be enabled in production environments. The `DebugToolbarMiddleware` and the default `show_toolbar` function (in `/code/debug_toolbar/middleware.py` - not provided, context from previous analysis remains valid) are designed to prevent the toolbar from being displayed in production by checking `settings.DEBUG` and `settings.INTERNAL_IPS`. However, these checks rely on correct configuration and are bypassable through misconfiguration (e.g., setting `DEBUG=True` in production or misconfiguring `INTERNAL_IPS`). The example project's `settings.py` file `/code/example/settings.py` shows how the toolbar activation is directly tied to the `DEBUG` setting, making accidental exposure in production possible if `DEBUG=True` is set.
  missing mitigations: |
    While the intended mitigation is disabling the toolbar in production, there are no robust, built-in safeguards within the Debug Toolbar itself to prevent information disclosure if it is mistakenly enabled in production. Missing mitigations include:
    - **Production Environment Detection and Hard Disable:** Implement a more robust mechanism within the Debug Toolbar to detect if it's running in a production-like environment (beyond just `DEBUG=False`) and completely disable itself, regardless of other settings.
    - **Setting Filtering/Redaction:** Provide an option to selectively filter or redact sensitive settings from being displayed in the Settings panel. While not ideal as a primary mitigation, it could reduce the impact of accidental exposure.
    - **Stronger Warnings and Documentation:** Enhance documentation and display prominent warnings in the Settings panel itself when `DEBUG=True` is active, clearly stating the security risks of exposing settings in production.
  preconditions: |
    - `DEBUG=True` is set in the Django application's `settings.py` in a production or production-like environment.
    - The `DebugToolbarMiddleware` is included in `MIDDLEWARE` and is active.
    - The Django application is deployed and accessible to external attackers (or internal unauthorized users in a compromised internal network).
    - Attackers are able to access the Debug Toolbar URLs, typically `/__debug__/`. This assumes either no specific access control is in place for these URLs, or any existing access control is weak or bypassable.
  source code analysis: |
    - File: `/code/debug_toolbar/panels/settings.py` (not provided, context from previous analysis remains valid)
    - The `SettingsPanel` class is responsible for displaying settings.
    - The `generate_stats` method retrieves settings using `get_safe_settings()`.
    - `get_safe_settings()` (from `django.views.debug`) is intended to filter out some sensitive information, but it may not be comprehensive enough.
    - File: `/code/example/settings.py`
    - This file shows a typical Django settings configuration where `DEBUG = True` is set and the Debug Toolbar is enabled based on this `DEBUG` setting and `INTERNAL_IPS`.
    - The `ENABLE_DEBUG_TOOLBAR` variable directly links toolbar activation to `DEBUG` and test environment detection:
      ```python
      ENABLE_DEBUG_TOOLBAR = DEBUG and "test" not in sys.argv
      if ENABLE_DEBUG_TOOLBAR:
          INSTALLED_APPS += [
              "debug_toolbar",
          ]
          MIDDLEWARE += [
              "debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware",
          ]
      ```
      This configuration in `settings.py` highlights the risk of accidentally enabling the toolbar in production if `DEBUG=True` is not properly managed.
  security test case: |
    1. **Deploy Misconfigured Application:** Deploy a Django application to a publicly accessible test environment (or a controlled internal network segment accessible to the tester). Crucially, set `DEBUG = True` in the application's `settings.py` to simulate a production misconfiguration where debug mode is unintentionally left on. Ensure the Django Debug Toolbar is installed and its middleware is active.
    2. **Access Debug Toolbar:** Access the deployed application in a web browser. Navigate to the base URL or any application URL. Then, try to access the Debug Toolbar by appending `/__debug__/` to the URL (e.g., `http://your-deployed-app.example.com/__debug__/`).
    3. **Navigate to Settings Panel:** In the Debug Toolbar interface, locate and click on the "Settings" panel.
    4. **Verify Sensitive Settings Exposure:** Examine the content of the Settings panel. Look for the following types of sensitive information:
        - **Database Configuration:** Check for `DATABASES` settings, particularly for database credentials like `PASSWORD`, `USER`, `HOST`, and `PORT`.
        - **Secret Key:** Look for the `SECRET_KEY` setting.
        - **Email Settings:** Check for settings related to email, such as `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`.
        - **Any Custom Sensitive Settings:** Review other settings displayed in the panel for any project-specific sensitive information, API keys, or credentials that should not be publicly accessible.
    5. **Confirm Vulnerability:** If you can successfully view sensitive settings like database passwords, `SECRET_KEY`, or API keys in the Settings panel of a publicly accessible, `DEBUG=True` application, then the Information Disclosure via Settings Panel vulnerability is confirmed.
