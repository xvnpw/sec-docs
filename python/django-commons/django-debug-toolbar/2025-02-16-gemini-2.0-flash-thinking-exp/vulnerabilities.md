### Vulnerability List:

* **SQL Injection in SQL Panel (Potential)**

**Description:**
The SQL Panel allows users to re-execute SQL queries displayed in the debug toolbar. The `SQLSelectForm` in `debug_toolbar/panels/sql/forms.py` is used to handle this functionality. While the form validates that the `raw_sql` is a `SELECT` query and attempts to parse `params` as JSON, there's a potential risk of SQL injection if the `sql` parameter, which is stated to be "The sql statement with interpolated params", is not properly sanitized before being executed. An attacker might manipulate the `sql` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.

To trigger this vulnerability:

1.  Enable the Django Debug Toolbar in `settings.py`.
2.  Perform a database query on a page where the debug toolbar is visible. This will populate the SQL Panel with executed queries.
3.  Open the SQL Panel in the debug toolbar.
4.  Locate a SQL query and find the "Re-execute SQL" button.
5.  Intercept the request sent when clicking "Re-execute SQL". This request will likely be sent to a URL associated with the SQL Panel, such as `/__debug__/sql_select/`.
6.  Modify the `sql` parameter in the intercepted request. Inject malicious SQL code into this parameter. For example, if the original query was `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1`, try to change the `sql` parameter to something like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE users;--`.
7.  Send the modified request to the server.
8.  Observe if the injected SQL code is executed against the database.

**Impact:**
If the SQL injection is successful, the attacker could:

*   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data in the database.
*   Modify or delete data in the database.
*   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server, depending on database permissions and configurations.

**Vulnerability Rank:**
High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**

*   **`is_select_query` validation:** The `SQLSelectForm` in `debug_toolbar/panels/sql/forms.py` uses `is_select_query` to validate that only `SELECT` queries are allowed. This is in `clean_raw_sql` method.
*   **JSON parsing of params:** The `clean_params` method in `SQLSelectForm` attempts to parse the `params` parameter as JSON. This is likely intended to prevent direct injection of parameters.
*   **`@login_not_required` and `@require_show_toolbar` decorators:** Views related to SQL panel, like `template_source` in `debug_toolbar/panels/templates/views.py` and potentially views for SQL re-execution (though not explicitly seen in provided files, assumed to exist), are decorated with `@login_not_required` and `@require_show_toolbar`. This limits access to users who can see the debug toolbar, which is usually intended for developers and not public users. However, if the toolbar is exposed or `DEBUG = True` in production, this mitigation is weakened.

**Missing Mitigations:**

*   **Lack of sanitization of the `sql` parameter:** While `raw_sql` is partially validated, the `sql` parameter, which is stated to be with interpolated parameters, is not explicitly sanitized before execution. The code relies on parameterization via `params`, but if the `sql` itself is directly used in execution without proper escaping or parameter binding, it's vulnerable.
*   **Insufficient input validation on `sql` parameter:**  The form cleaning process focuses on `raw_sql` and `params`, but there is no explicit validation or sanitization of the final `sql` query that is intended to be executed.

**Preconditions:**

*   Django Debug Toolbar must be enabled (`DEBUG = True` and `debug_toolbar` in `INSTALLED_APPS`).
*   The debug toolbar must be visible to the attacker. This usually means the attacker needs to be accessing the application from an IP address listed in `INTERNAL_IPS` or if `SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK` allows it for other users. In misconfigured production environments, `DEBUG = True` might be enabled, making the toolbar accessible.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically achievable through browser developer tools or proxy tools.

**Source Code Analysis:**

1.  **`debug_toolbar/panels/sql/forms.py` - `SQLSelectForm`:**
    ```python
    class SQLSelectForm(forms.Form):
        sql = forms.CharField() # Potentially vulnerable parameter
        raw_sql = forms.CharField()
        params = forms.CharField()
        alias = forms.CharField(required=False, initial="default")
        duration = forms.FloatField()

        def clean_raw_sql(self):
            value = self.cleaned_data["raw_sql"]
            if not is_select_query(value):
                raise ValidationError("Only 'select' queries are allowed.")
            return value

        def clean_params(self):
            value = self.cleaned_data["params"]
            try:
                return json.loads(value)
            except ValueError as exc:
                raise ValidationError("Is not valid JSON") from exc
        # ... rest of the form
    ```
    The form defines an `sql` field that is a `CharField` without any explicit sanitization or validation other than being a CharField. The `clean_raw_sql` checks if it's a `SELECT` query, but this is on `raw_sql`, not the potentially interpolated `sql`.

2.  **`debug_toolbar/panels/sql/views.py` (Not provided in files, assuming similar structure to `template_source`):**
    It's assumed there is a view function that handles the "Re-execute SQL" action, likely similar in structure to `template_source` in `debug_toolbar/panels/templates/views.py`. This view would:
    *   Receive the form data, including the `sql` parameter.
    *   Validate the form using `SQLSelectForm`.
    *   Get a database connection based on the `alias`.
    *   Execute the `sql` query using the connection's cursor.

    If the view directly executes `cursor.execute(form.cleaned_data['sql'])` without further processing or using parameterized queries correctly, it will be vulnerable to SQL injection.  The presence of `raw_sql` and `params` suggests an attempt to use parameterized queries originally, but the `sql` field in the form hints at a possible flaw where the fully interpolated SQL might be executed directly.

**Security Test Case:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Set up a Django project with `DEBUG = True` and `debug_toolbar` in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Ensure debug toolbar is visible in your development environment (e.g., access from `127.0.0.1`).
    *   Have a database table (e.g., `users` table from Django's auth app).
    *   Identify or create a URL in your Django project that triggers a SQL query that is visible in the Debug Toolbar's SQL Panel.

2.  **Steps:**
    *   Access the URL that triggers the SQL query in your browser and ensure the Debug Toolbar is visible.
    *   Open the Debug Toolbar and navigate to the SQL Panel.
    *   Find a `SELECT` query in the SQL Panel.
    *   Click the "Re-execute SQL" button associated with that query.
    *   Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab) and inspect the request sent when you clicked "Re-execute SQL". Identify the request URL and the POST data. It should contain parameters like `sql`, `raw_sql`, `params`, and `alias`.
    *   Copy the request as cURL or modify it directly in the browser's developer tools.
    *   Modify the `sql` parameter in the request to inject malicious SQL. For example, if the original `sql` was `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %(id)s`, change it to `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE users;--`. Make sure to URL-encode special characters if needed.
    *   Send the modified request to the server.
    *   Check the application's behavior and database state. If the SQL injection is successful, you might see:
        *   Database errors in the response or server logs if the `DROP TABLE users;` part is executed and you don't have permissions.
        *   If you have sufficient permissions, the `users` table might actually be dropped ( **WARNING: DO THIS IN A TEST ENVIRONMENT ONLY!**).
        *   Changes in application behavior if data was modified.
    *   Examine the SQL Panel again after sending the malicious request. Check if the injected SQL or any errors are visible.
    *   Review database logs for executed queries to confirm if the injected SQL was executed.

If the `users` table is dropped or you observe other signs of malicious SQL execution, the vulnerability is confirmed.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Properly parameterize queries:** Ensure that when re-executing SQL queries, parameterized queries are used correctly, and the `sql` parameter is not directly interpolated into the query string without proper escaping or using database's parameter binding mechanisms. Re-evaluate the necessity of having the `sql` field in `SQLSelectForm` at all. If the intention is to re-execute the *same* query, using `raw_sql` and `params` should be sufficient and safer.
*   **Input Sanitization for `sql` parameter (if absolutely needed):** If direct SQL interpolation is unavoidable for some reason (which is generally not recommended), implement strict input sanitization on the `sql` parameter to remove or escape potentially harmful SQL keywords and syntax. However, parameterization is the far safer and preferred approach.
*   **Restrict Access:** Ensure that the debug toolbar is never exposed in production environments. Reinforce the importance of setting `DEBUG = False` and properly configuring `INTERNAL_IPS` or `SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK` to restrict access to development and authorized users only.

This vulnerability needs further investigation to confirm if the `sql` parameter from `SQLSelectForm` is indeed directly executed without proper parameterization. If confirmed, it represents a significant security risk.
