    *   "Backend Service": Server-side applications and microservices written in various languages, integrated with relevant Sentry SDKs.

*   **Sentry Platform:**
    *   "Sentry SDKs": Language-specific libraries integrated into client applications to capture and transmit error and performance events. They handle formatting, basic data enrichment, and secure transmission.
    *   "Ingestion API Gateway": The entry point for events sent by the Sentry SDKs. It handles authentication, basic validation, and routing of incoming data.
    *   "Rate Limiter": Protects the Sentry platform from abuse and overload by controlling the rate of incoming events from different sources.
    *   "Message Queue (e.g., Kafka, Redis Streams)": A distributed message broker used to decouple the ingestion layer from processing workers, ensuring resilience and enabling asynchronous processing of events.
    *   "Event Processing Workers": A pool of worker processes that consume events from the message queue and perform core processing tasks, including:
        *   Normalization and enrichment of event data.
        *   Stack trace parsing and grouping of similar errors.
        *   Applying filters and integrations.
        *   Storing processed data in the data stores.
    *   "Data Stores (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Blob Storage)": Persistent storage for various types of Sentry data:
        *   PostgreSQL: Stores metadata, user information, project configurations, and aggregated data.
        *   ClickHouse: Optimized for storing and querying high-volume event data for analytics and performance monitoring.
        *   Blob Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage): Used for storing large payloads like source maps and debug symbols.
    *   "Web Application (Frontend)": The user interface built with technologies like React, providing users with dashboards, error details, issue management tools, and configuration options.
    *   "Web Application (Backend API)": The API layer powering the frontend and providing programmatic access to Sentry's functionalities. Handles authentication, authorization, and data retrieval.
    *   "Alerting & Notification Engine":  Evaluates event data against defined rules and triggers notifications through various channels when specific conditions are met.
    *   "Symbolication & Source Map Processing":  Processes stack traces by resolving function names and file paths using debug symbols and source maps, making errors more understandable, especially for minified JavaScript code.
    *   "Admin & Configuration UI":  A section of the web application dedicated to administrative tasks, such as user management, organization settings, project configuration, and integration management.
    *   "Public API": A documented API allowing external applications and services to interact with Sentry programmatically for tasks like sending events, retrieving data, and managing projects.

*   **External Services:**
    *   "Email Service": Used for sending email notifications related to alerts, user invitations, and other system events.
    *   "Issue Tracking (Jira, GitHub Issues)": Integrations with external issue tracking systems, allowing users to create and link Sentry issues to their existing workflows.
    *   "Notification Services (Slack, MS Teams)": Integrations with messaging platforms to deliver real-time alerts and notifications to development teams.

**5. Data Flow**

The typical lifecycle of an error or performance event within Sentry involves the following steps:

1. An error, exception, or performance event occurs within a "Client Application".
2. The integrated "Sentry SDKs" capture detailed information about the event, including stack traces, context variables, user details, and timestamps.
3. The SDK transmits the event data to the "Ingestion API Gateway" over a secure HTTPS connection, often including authentication credentials.
4. The "Ingestion API Gateway" authenticates the request and performs basic validation of the event data.
5. The "Rate Limiter" assesses the incoming event against configured limits to prevent abuse and ensure platform stability.
6. The event is then enqueued into the "Message Queue".
7. Available "Event Processing Workers" consume events from the queue.
8. Workers process the event, potentially utilizing the "Symbolication & Source Map Processing" service to enhance stack trace information.
9. The processed event data is persisted in the appropriate "Data Stores" (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Blob Storage).
10. Users interact with the "Web Application (Frontend)" which fetches data from the "Web Application (Backend API)" to view and analyze the collected events.
11. The "Alerting & Notification Engine" continuously evaluates incoming events against defined rules.
12. When an alert condition is met, the "Alerting & Notification Engine" triggers notifications.
13. Notifications are dispatched via the configured external services: "Email Service", "Issue Tracking", or "Notification Services".
14. External applications can also interact with Sentry through the "Public API" to send events or retrieve data.
