# Attack Surface Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of the DSN (Data Source Name)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_the_dsn__data_source_name_.md)

* **Description:** The DSN contains credentials needed to send data to a specific Sentry project. If exposed, unauthorized parties can send arbitrary error reports.
    * **How Sentry Contributes:** Sentry requires the DSN for authentication. Its presence is essential for the integration to function.
    * **Example:** The DSN is hardcoded in client-side JavaScript, committed to a public repository, or accidentally included in an error message displayed to the user.
    * **Impact:** Spoofing error reports, potentially overwhelming the Sentry instance, injecting misleading data, and potentially exposing the Sentry project to unauthorized access if the DSN allows more than just data submission.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store the DSN securely on the server-side and avoid exposing it in client-side code.
        * Use environment variables or secure configuration management to manage the DSN.
        * Implement server-side error reporting mechanisms to proxy data to Sentry.
        * Regularly rotate DSNs if possible (though Sentry's DSN rotation is not a standard feature).

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Transmission of Sensitive Data](./attack_surfaces/accidental_transmission_of_sensitive_data.md)

* **Description:** Sentry captures contextual data with error reports. If not configured carefully, this can include sensitive information.
    * **How Sentry Contributes:** Sentry's design is to capture rich context to aid debugging, which inherently involves collecting data.
    * **Example:**  Error messages include user passwords, API keys are passed in request parameters, or PII is present in local variables captured in stack traces.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, violation of privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA), reputational damage, potential for identity theft.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust data scrubbing and sanitization techniques *before* sending data to Sentry.
        * Configure Sentry's data scrubbing options to redact sensitive fields (e.g., using `before_send` hooks).
        * Avoid logging sensitive information in the first place.
        * Educate developers on the risks of including sensitive data in error contexts.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Management for Sentry Integration (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/api_key_management_for_sentry_integration__if_applicable_.md)

* **Description:** If the application interacts with the Sentry API directly, managing API keys securely is crucial.
    * **How Sentry Contributes:** Sentry provides an API for programmatic interaction, requiring API keys for authentication.
    * **Example:** API keys are hardcoded in the application, committed to version control, or stored insecurely.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Sentry project data, ability to modify Sentry settings, potential for data breaches or denial of service against the Sentry instance.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store API keys securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
        * Restrict API key permissions to the minimum necessary.
        * Regularly rotate API keys.
