# Threat Model Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Error Payload](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_error_payload.md)

**Description:** An attacker, with access to the Sentry project, views error reports containing inadvertently logged sensitive data (PII, secrets, etc.) within the error message, context, or breadcrumbs. This access could be due to compromised Sentry credentials or overly permissive access controls within the Sentry organization.

**Impact:**  Data breach, privacy violations, compliance issues, reputational damage.

**Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry Web UI (Error Details view), Sentry API (for retrieving error details), Sentry Storage (where error data is persisted).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict filtering and sanitization of error messages and context data *before* sending to Sentry.
*   Utilize Sentry's data scrubbing features (e.g., `before_send` hook in SDKs).
*   Regularly review logged data in Sentry for accidental exposure.
*   Enforce the principle of least privilege for Sentry user roles and permissions.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication for Sentry accounts.

## Threat: [Malicious Error Injection via Compromised DSN](./threats/malicious_error_injection_via_compromised_dsn.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a Sentry Data Source Name (DSN) â€“ often found hardcoded, in version control, or leaked. They use this DSN to send fabricated or malicious error reports to the Sentry project. This could be used to flood the system, mask real errors, or potentially trigger alerts and actions based on the injected data.

**Impact:**  Denial of service on error tracking, masking of genuine issues, potential for misleading operational insights, resource exhaustion on the Sentry platform (potentially leading to increased costs).

**Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry API - Ingestion Endpoint (used by the SDKs to send data).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store and manage Sentry DSNs (use environment variables, secrets management systems).
*   Implement monitoring for unusual error reporting patterns.
*   Regularly rotate DSNs.
*   Consider using Sentry's rate limiting features.
*   Implement server-side validation of error data before sending to Sentry (if feasible).

## Threat: [Account Takeover of Sentry User Accounts](./threats/account_takeover_of_sentry_user_accounts.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's or administrator's Sentry account through methods like phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting weak passwords.

**Impact:**  Access to sensitive error data, ability to modify Sentry project settings, potential for deleting or manipulating error reports, and potentially gaining insights into application vulnerabilities.

**Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry Authentication System, Sentry Web UI (user account management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies for Sentry accounts.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Sentry users.
*   Regularly review and audit user access to the Sentry organization and projects.
*   Educate users about phishing and social engineering attacks.

## Threat: [Data Breach at Sentry's Infrastructure](./threats/data_breach_at_sentry's_infrastructure.md)

**Description:** Although outside the direct control of the application developers, a security breach at Sentry's own infrastructure could expose the error data collected from various applications, including yours.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive error information, potentially including details about application vulnerabilities and internal operations.

**Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry Storage, Sentry Backend Systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Choose reputable error tracking platforms with a strong security track record.
*   Review Sentry's security policies and certifications.
*   Understand Sentry's data retention policies.
*   Minimize the amount of sensitive data sent to Sentry.
