# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Scrubbing and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/data_scrubbing_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Scrubbing and Sanitization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:**  Developers must first identify all categories of sensitive data handled by the application.
    2.  **Configure Sentry SDK Scrubbing:**  Within the Sentry SDK initialization code, configure the `beforeSend` hook or dedicated scrubbing options (like `defaultIntegrations` with `RewriteFrames` and `Breadcrumbs` integrations, or specific options like `send_default_pii=False` and `request_bodies='none'`).
    3.  **Define Scrubbing Rules:** Implement custom scrubbing rules using regular expressions or functions within the SDK configuration to target and mask or remove identified sensitive data patterns.
    4.  **Test Scrubbing Rules:** Thoroughly test the scrubbing rules in a development or staging environment to ensure they effectively remove sensitive data without impacting error reports.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update:**  Periodically review and update scrubbing rules as the application evolves.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure in Error Reports (High Severity):** Sensitive data accidentally included in error messages, stack traces, request bodies, or context data could be exposed in Sentry.
    *   **Internal Data Leakage (Medium Severity):**  Overly detailed error reports with sensitive internal information could be accessible to authorized Sentry users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure in Error Reports (High Reduction):** Effectively implemented scrubbing significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure in error reports.
    *   **Internal Data Leakage (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the amount of sensitive internal information available in Sentry.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic scrubbing using `send_default_pii=False` is enabled in the application's Sentry SDK initialization.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing custom scrubbing rules for application-specific sensitive data beyond default PII.
    *   Lack of regular review and testing process for scrubbing rules.
    *   Need to implement more granular scrubbing for request bodies and breadcrumbs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Sampling](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_sampling.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting and Sampling
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Client-Side Rate Limiting (Sentry SDK):**  Configure the Sentry SDK's `beforeSend` hook to implement client-side rate limiting for Sentry events.
    2.  **Utilize Sentry Sampling Options:** Configure the `sampleRate` option in the Sentry SDK to reduce the percentage of events sent to Sentry.
    3.  **Adjust Rate Limiting and Sampling Dynamically:**  Consider implementing dynamic rate limiting or sampling based on application load or error rates, configurable through Sentry SDK settings.
    4.  **Monitor Rate Limiting Effectiveness:**  Monitor Sentry's performance and error reporting to ensure rate limiting and sampling are not overly aggressive.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Error Flooding (Medium Severity):**  A vulnerability or attack could trigger a flood of errors, potentially overwhelming Sentry.
    *   **Data Exposure due to Excessive Logging (Low Severity):**  In extreme error scenarios, excessive logging could inadvertently capture and send more data to Sentry than intended.
    *   **Sentry Quota Exhaustion (Low Severity):**  Uncontrolled error reporting can quickly exhaust Sentry quotas.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Error Flooding (Medium Reduction):** Rate limiting and sampling can significantly reduce the impact of error flooding by controlling the volume of events sent to Sentry.
    *   **Data Exposure due to Excessive Logging (Low Reduction):**  Reduces the potential for excessive data capture in extreme error scenarios.
    *   **Sentry Quota Exhaustion (Medium Reduction):**  Helps manage Sentry quota usage and prevent unexpected costs or service disruptions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic sampling is configured in the Sentry SDK with a default `sampleRate`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No client-side rate limiting using Sentry SDK's `beforeSend` hook is implemented.
    *   Sampling rate is static and not dynamically adjusted based on application conditions via Sentry SDK configuration.
    *   No monitoring or review process for rate limiting and sampling effectiveness within Sentry context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Sentry API Key Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_sentry_api_key_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Sentry API Key Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Hardcoding API Keys:**  Never hardcode Sentry DSN or API keys directly into the application's source code.
    2.  **Use Environment Variables:** Store Sentry DSN and API keys as environment variables, accessed by the application and Sentry SDK.
    3.  **Secure Configuration Management:** Utilize secure configuration management systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or similar services to store and manage Sentry credentials used by the application and potentially Sentry integrations.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Access:**  Restrict access to systems storing Sentry credentials to only authorized personnel.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Access:**  Regularly audit access logs for configuration management systems related to Sentry credentials.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **API Key Compromise via Code Exposure (High Severity):** Hardcoded API keys in source code are easily discoverable.
    *   **API Key Compromise via Configuration File Leakage (Medium Severity):** API keys stored in insecure configuration files can be compromised.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sentry Data (Medium Severity):** Compromised API keys can grant unauthorized access to Sentry data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **API Key Compromise via Code Exposure (High Reduction):** Using environment variables and secure configuration management eliminates the risk of hardcoded keys in the codebase.
    *   **API Key Compromise via Configuration File Leakage (Medium Reduction):** Secure configuration management systems significantly reduce the risk of configuration file leakage and key compromise.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sentry Data (Medium Reduction):**  Secure key management and access control limit the potential for unauthorized access via compromised keys.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Sentry DSN is configured using environment variables in production deployments.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   API keys are still potentially stored in less secure configuration files in development environments.
    *   No formal secure configuration management system is currently used for Sentry credentials.
    *   Access control to environment variables and configuration files needs to be strengthened and audited specifically for Sentry credentials.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular API Key Rotation](./mitigation_strategies/regular_api_key_rotation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular API Key Rotation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Rotation Policy:** Define a policy for regular rotation of Sentry API keys.
    2.  **Automate Key Rotation Process:**  Automate the API key rotation process as much as possible, potentially using Sentry's API for programmatic key management.
    3.  **Update Application Configuration:**  When rotating keys, ensure that the application's Sentry SDK configuration is updated with the new API keys.
    4.  **Invalidate Old Keys:**  After successful rotation, invalidate or revoke the old Sentry API keys within the Sentry platform.
    5.  **Document Rotation Process:**  Document the API key rotation process clearly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **API Key Compromise - Extended Exposure Window (Medium Severity):** If an API key is compromised, regular rotation limits the window of opportunity for attackers.
    *   **Insider Threat - Reduced Impact (Low Severity):**  Regular rotation reduces the long-term impact of potential insider threats or accidental key leaks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **API Key Compromise - Extended Exposure Window (Medium Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk associated with long-term key compromise.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to define a key rotation policy and frequency for Sentry API keys.
    *   Need to develop and automate the API key rotation process, including key generation, configuration updates within the application and invalidation of old keys in Sentry.
    *   Documentation for the Sentry key rotation process is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for API Keys](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_api_keys.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for API Keys
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Permissions:**  For each use case of Sentry API keys, identify the minimum set of permissions required within Sentry.
    2.  **Create Project-Specific Keys:**  Instead of using organization-wide API keys, create project-specific API keys whenever possible within Sentry.
    3.  **Grant Minimal Permissions:** When creating API keys in Sentry, grant only the necessary permissions. For application SDKs, typically only "Store" permission is needed.
    4.  **Regularly Review Key Permissions:** Periodically review the permissions granted to existing Sentry API keys and ensure they still adhere to the principle of least privilege within the Sentry platform.
    5.  **Avoid Using Admin Keys in Applications:**  Never use organization-level admin API keys in application SDKs or scripts, utilize project-specific keys from Sentry instead.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **API Key Compromise - Scope of Impact (Medium Severity):** If a Sentry API key is compromised, limiting its permissions reduces the potential impact.
    *   **Insider Threat - Reduced Potential Abuse (Low Severity):**  Least privilege reduces the potential for accidental or intentional misuse of API keys by authorized users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **API Key Compromise - Scope of Impact (Medium Reduction):** Significantly reduces the potential damage from a compromised API key by limiting its capabilities within Sentry.
    *   **Insider Threat - Reduced Potential Abuse (Low Reduction):**  Reduces the risk of abuse by limiting the permissions available to users within Sentry.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Project-specific DSNs are used, which inherently limit scope to a project within Sentry.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   API keys are not explicitly created with minimal permissions within Sentry. Default key creation might grant more permissions than strictly necessary.
    *   No formal review process for Sentry API key permissions is in place.
    *   Need to ensure that only "Store" permission is granted to application SDK API keys in Sentry and other keys are configured with minimal necessary permissions within Sentry.
