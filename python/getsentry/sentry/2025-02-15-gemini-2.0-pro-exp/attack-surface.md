# Attack Surface Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Internal Services (Self-Hosted)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_internal_services__self-hosted_.md)

*Description:* Unintentionally exposing Sentry's internal services (PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, Kafka, etc.) to the public internet.
*Sentry Contribution:* Sentry's architecture relies on these services; improper deployment exposes them. This is a *direct* consequence of how Sentry is built and deployed.
*Example:* A misconfigured firewall allows direct access to the PostgreSQL database port (5432) from the internet.
*Impact:* Complete compromise of Sentry data, potential lateral movement to other systems, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Sentry's internal services on a private network.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Strict firewall rules to block all external access to internal service ports.
    *   **Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy) to handle external traffic.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit network configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Sentry Version (Self-Hosted)](./attack_surfaces/outdated_sentry_version__self-hosted_.md)

*Description:* Running an outdated version of Sentry with known security vulnerabilities.
*Sentry Contribution:* Sentry, as a software product, has vulnerabilities that are addressed in updates. This risk is *directly* tied to the Sentry software itself.
*Example:* Using a Sentry version with a known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability.
*Impact:* Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (if a known RCE exists), **High** (otherwise)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Update Process:** Establish a clear process for updating Sentry.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor Sentry's release notes and security advisories.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test updates before deploying to production.
    *   **Automated Updates (with caution):** Consider, but only after rigorous testing.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Database Credentials (Self-Hosted)](./attack_surfaces/weak_database_credentials__self-hosted_.md)

*Description:* Using default or easily guessable passwords for the databases used by Sentry.
*Sentry Contribution:* Sentry *requires* and directly uses these databases; weak credentials directly impact Sentry's security.
*Example:* Using "postgres" as the password for the PostgreSQL database.
*Impact:* Complete compromise of Sentry data.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, randomly generated passwords.
    *   **Password Rotation:** Regularly rotate database passwords.
    *   **Database Access Control:** Implement database-level access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Leakage in Error Reports](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_leakage_in_error_reports.md)

*Description:* Accidentally including sensitive information (PII, API keys, secrets) in error reports sent to Sentry.
*Sentry Contribution:* Sentry's *core function* is to collect error data, making it the direct recipient of this potentially sensitive information.
*Example:* An error message containing a user's full credit card number is sent to Sentry.
*Impact:* Data breaches, privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Data Scrubbing (Server-Side):** Configure Sentry's server-side data scrubbing.
    *   **SDK Configuration (Client-Side):** Configure the Sentry SDK to exclude sensitive data.
    *   **Code Review:** Review code to prevent sensitive data inclusion in errors.
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Logs:** Avoid logging sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Authentication to Sentry (Self-Hosted and SaaS)](./attack_surfaces/weak_authentication_to_sentry__self-hosted_and_saas_.md)

*Description:* Using weak passwords or not enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Sentry user accounts.
*Sentry Contribution:* Sentry *provides and relies on* its own user authentication system (or integrates with external ones). Weak authentication directly compromises Sentry access.
*Example:* A Sentry user account with the password "password123" and no MFA.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access to Sentry data and configuration, potential data breaches.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for all users.
    *   **SSO/Identity Provider Integration:** Integrate with an existing identity provider.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Secret DSN](./attack_surfaces/exposed_secret_dsn.md)

*Description:* The *secret* Sentry DSN is exposed.
*Sentry Contribution:* The secret DSN is used for authentication with Sentry.
*Example:* The secret DSN is hardcoded in a JavaScript file that is publicly accessible or missconfigured in server.
*Impact:* Attackers could send fake or malicious events to your Sentry project, potentially causing noise, exceeding quotas, or triggering a denial of service. Attackers can reconfigure Sentry instance.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables or server-side configuration to inject the DSN into the application, rather than hardcoding it in client-side code or server configuration.
    *  **Secrets Management:** Use secrets management system.
