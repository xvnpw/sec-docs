**2. Security Implications of Key Components**

Let's break down the security implications of each component, considering potential threats and the effectiveness of inferred security controls:

*   **Web Application (UI)**

    *   **Threats:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  Attackers inject malicious scripts into the UI to steal user cookies, redirect users to phishing sites, or deface the application.
        *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Attackers trick users into performing unintended actions on the Sentry UI.
        *   Session Hijacking/Fixation: Attackers steal or manipulate user sessions to gain unauthorized access.
        *   Broken Authentication/Authorization: Weak password policies, lack of MFA, or vulnerabilities in the authentication/authorization logic could allow attackers to gain access to user accounts.
        *   Sensitive Data Exposure:  Displaying sensitive data (e.g., API keys, error details) in the UI without proper authorization checks.
    *   **Inferred Security Controls:** Authentication, authorization, session management, input validation, XSS protection (likely using a framework like React with built-in protection and Content Security Policy (CSP)).
    *   **Analysis:**  Sentry likely uses a modern front-end framework (React) that provides some built-in XSS protection.  However, rigorous input validation and output encoding are crucial.  CSP is essential to mitigate XSS and other injection attacks.  Robust session management (secure cookies, short session timeouts, protection against fixation) is critical.  MFA and strong password policies are essential for authentication.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP):**  This is the most important mitigation for XSS.  The CSP should be carefully configured to allow only necessary resources and prevent inline scripts.
        *   **Regularly audit the UI for XSS vulnerabilities:** Use automated scanners and manual code review.
        *   **Implement robust CSRF protection:** Use anti-CSRF tokens and ensure they are properly validated.
        *   **Ensure secure session management:** Use HTTP-only and secure cookies, implement session timeouts, and protect against session fixation.
        *   **Enforce strong password policies and require MFA:**  This is crucial to prevent account compromise.
        *   **Implement least privilege access in the UI:**  Users should only see data and functionality they are authorized to access.

*   **API**
