# Deep Analysis: Weak Database Credentials (Self-Hosted Sentry)

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Weak Database Credentials" attack surface for self-hosted Sentry deployments.  This includes understanding the specific vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, the impact of successful exploitation, and to refine and expand upon the provided mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for development and operations teams to minimize this risk.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the database credentials used by a *self-hosted* Sentry instance.  It encompasses:

*   **Supported Databases:** PostgreSQL, ClickHouse (and any other databases officially supported by Sentry).  The analysis will primarily focus on PostgreSQL as it's the most common.
*   **Credential Types:**  Usernames and passwords used by Sentry to connect to and interact with the database.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Analysis of how Sentry stores and accesses these credentials (e.g., `config.yml`, environment variables).
*   **Deployment Methods:**  Consideration of various deployment methods (Docker, bare metal, Kubernetes) and their impact on credential management.
*   **Sentry Versions:** While focusing on current best practices, we'll acknowledge potential differences in older Sentry versions if relevant to credential handling.
* **Exclusion:** We will not cover the security of the database server itself (e.g., OS-level vulnerabilities, network-level attacks *not* directly related to Sentry's database credentials).  We assume the database server is managed and secured separately, although we will touch on database-level access controls.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review (Targeted):**  Examine relevant sections of the Sentry codebase (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand how database connections are established and credentials are handled.  This will be a *targeted* review, focusing on connection logic rather than a full codebase audit.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Thorough review of official Sentry documentation, including installation guides, configuration options, and security best practices.
*   **Configuration Analysis:**  Analysis of default configuration files and recommended settings related to database credentials.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attack scenarios and vectors that could exploit weak database credentials.
*   **Best Practice Research:**  Research industry best practices for database security and credential management.
*   **Vulnerability Database Search:** Check for any known CVEs related to Sentry and database credential handling (though unlikely, given the nature of this attack surface).

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Weak Database Credentials

### 4.1. Vulnerability Details

The core vulnerability is the use of weak, default, or easily guessable credentials for the database user account that Sentry utilizes.  This includes:

*   **Default Credentials:**  Using the default username/password combinations provided by the database software (e.g., `postgres`/`postgres` for PostgreSQL).
*   **Common Passwords:**  Using easily guessable passwords like "password," "123456," "admin," or variations thereof.
*   **Company-Related Passwords:**  Using passwords related to the company name, Sentry instance name, or other easily obtainable information.
*   **Unchanged Default Credentials:** Failing to change the default credentials after the initial Sentry installation.
* **Hardcoded Credentials:** Storing credentials directly within the Sentry configuration files without using environment variables or a secure secret management solution.

### 4.2. Attack Vectors

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through several vectors:

*   **Network-Based Attacks:** If the database server is exposed to the internet (or an untrusted network) *and* weak credentials are used, an attacker could directly connect to the database and gain unauthorized access.  This is the most direct and severe attack vector.
*   **Internal Threats:**  A malicious insider (employee, contractor) with network access to the database server could exploit weak credentials.
*   **Compromised Application Server:** If the server hosting the Sentry application itself is compromised (through a different vulnerability), the attacker could potentially access the Sentry configuration files or environment variables and retrieve the database credentials.
*   **Configuration File Exposure:**  Accidental exposure of Sentry configuration files (e.g., through misconfigured web servers, source code repositories, backups) could reveal the database credentials.
*   **Brute-Force/Dictionary Attacks:**  Even if the database is not directly exposed, attackers might attempt brute-force or dictionary attacks against the database port if it's accessible.

### 4.3. Impact of Successful Exploitation

The impact of successful exploitation is **critical**, as stated in the initial assessment.  A compromised database grants the attacker:

*   **Complete Data Access:**  Full read access to all data stored in the Sentry database, including event data, user information, project details, and potentially sensitive information contained within error reports.
*   **Data Modification:**  The ability to modify or delete data within the Sentry database, potentially disrupting Sentry's functionality or causing data loss.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The ability to steal all data stored in the Sentry database, leading to data breaches and potential privacy violations.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:**  The compromised database credentials could potentially be used to gain access to other systems if the same credentials are reused (which is a highly discouraged practice).
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could intentionally corrupt or delete the database, rendering Sentry unusable.

### 4.4. Code and Configuration Analysis (Targeted)

Examining the Sentry codebase and documentation reveals the following:

*   **`config.yml`:**  This file typically contains database connection settings, including the database URL, which often embeds the username and password.  This is a *high-risk area* if not properly secured.
*   **Environment Variables:** Sentry *strongly recommends* using environment variables (e.g., `SENTRY_DB_USER`, `SENTRY_DB_PASSWORD`) to store sensitive credentials instead of hardcoding them in `config.yml`.  This is a crucial best practice.
*   **`sentry.conf.py`:** In older or custom configurations, database settings might be found in this Python configuration file.
*   **Docker Compose:**  When using Docker Compose, environment variables are often defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file or in separate `.env` files.
* **Kubernetes:** When using Kubernetes, secrets should be used to store sensitive credentials.

**Example (Illustrative - DO NOT USE THESE CREDENTIALS):**

**Vulnerable `config.yml` (BAD):**

```yaml
db.host: 'localhost'
db.port: 5432
db.name: 'sentry'
db.user: 'sentryuser'
db.password: 'weakpassword'
```

**Improved `config.yml` (using environment variables):**

```yaml
db.host: 'localhost'
db.port: 5432
db.name: 'sentry'
db.user: ${SENTRY_DB_USER}
db.password: ${SENTRY_DB_PASSWORD}
```

**Environment Variables (set separately):**

```bash
export SENTRY_DB_USER=sentryuser
export SENTRY_DB_PASSWORD=StrongRandomlyGeneratedPassword!
```

### 4.5. Refined Mitigation Strategies

The initial mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but we can expand and refine them:

1.  **Strong, Unique Passwords (Mandatory):**
    *   Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for *each* database user.
    *   Enforce a minimum password length (e.g., 16 characters or more).
    *   Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   Avoid using dictionary words, names, or easily guessable patterns.
    *   **Never reuse passwords** across different systems or services.

2.  **Regular Password Rotation (Mandatory):**
    *   Implement a policy for regular password rotation (e.g., every 90 days).
    *   Automate the password rotation process whenever possible.
    *   Ensure that old passwords are not reused.

3.  **Database-Level Access Control (Mandatory):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the Sentry database user *only* the necessary privileges to perform its tasks.  Do *not* grant superuser or overly permissive roles.
    *   **Network Restrictions:** Configure the database server to only accept connections from the Sentry application server's IP address (or a limited range of trusted IP addresses).  Use firewall rules to enforce this.
    *   **`pg_hba.conf` (PostgreSQL):**  Use the `pg_hba.conf` file to configure host-based authentication and restrict access based on IP address, user, and authentication method.  Prefer `md5` or `scram-sha-256` authentication over `trust` or `password`.

4.  **Secure Credential Storage (Mandatory):**
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Always use environment variables to store database credentials, *never* hardcode them in configuration files.
    *   **Secret Management Solutions:** For more advanced deployments (especially in cloud environments), consider using a dedicated secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager.  These tools provide secure storage, access control, and auditing for sensitive credentials.
    * **Kubernetes Secrets:** If deploying Sentry on Kubernetes, use Kubernetes Secrets to manage database credentials.

5.  **Monitoring and Auditing (Highly Recommended):**
    *   Enable database auditing to track all database connections and queries.
    *   Monitor database logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts or unusual queries.
    *   Set up alerts for any security-related events.

6.  **Regular Security Audits (Highly Recommended):**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the Sentry deployment, including the database configuration and credential management practices.
    *   Consider penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

7. **Database Connection Security (Mandatory):**
    * Use TLS/SSL encryption for all database connections. This protects credentials in transit. Configure both the database server and Sentry to require encrypted connections.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Weak Database Credentials" attack surface represents a critical vulnerability for self-hosted Sentry deployments.  By diligently implementing the refined mitigation strategies outlined above, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of a successful attack and protect their Sentry data.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Never use default or weak passwords.**
