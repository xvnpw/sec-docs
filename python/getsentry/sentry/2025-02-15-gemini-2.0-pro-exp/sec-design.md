Okay, let's create a design document for Sentry, based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Sentry is an established, widely-used error tracking and performance monitoring platform. It's a critical tool for many organizations, ranging from startups to large enterprises.  The primary business goals are:

*   Provide a reliable and scalable service for tracking errors and performance issues in software applications.
*   Enable developers to quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve issues, improving software quality and user experience.
*   Offer a platform that integrates with a wide variety of programming languages, frameworks, and development tools.
*   Maintain customer trust by ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive data.
*   Provide different tiers of service, including a free tier for small projects and paid tiers for larger organizations with more advanced needs.

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:

*   Service Outages: Any downtime or performance degradation of the Sentry platform directly impacts customers' ability to monitor their applications, potentially leading to delayed issue resolution and negative user experiences.
*   Data Breaches: Sentry handles sensitive data, including error details, stack traces, and potentially user information. A data breach could expose this information, leading to reputational damage, legal liabilities, and loss of customer trust.
*   Data Loss: Loss of customer data, whether due to hardware failure, software bugs, or malicious attacks, would be catastrophic for Sentry and its users.
*   Scalability Issues: As Sentry's user base grows, the platform must be able to scale to handle increasing volumes of data and traffic without impacting performance or reliability.
*   Compliance Violations: Sentry must comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and industry standards. Failure to do so could result in fines, legal action, and reputational damage.
*   Compromised Customer Credentials: If customer accounts are compromised, attackers could gain access to sensitive data or disrupt the service for other users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Sentry likely employs a comprehensive set of security controls, given its role and the sensitivity of the data it handles. Based on the repository and common practices, we can infer the following:

*   security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC): Sentry's development process likely includes security considerations at each stage, from design and coding to testing and deployment. This includes practices like code reviews, security testing, and vulnerability management. (Evidenced by the presence of security-related documentation, testing infrastructure, and dependency management tools in the repository).
*   security control: Input Validation: Sentry must rigorously validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. This includes sanitizing user input, validating API requests, and handling data from various sources securely. (Evidenced by the use of frameworks and libraries that provide input validation features, and likely custom validation logic).
*   security control: Authentication and Authorization: Sentry implements robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities and authorization controls to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles and permissions. (Evidenced by the presence of authentication-related code and configuration files).
*   security control: Encryption: Sentry likely encrypts data both in transit (using TLS/SSL) and at rest (using database encryption and potentially other encryption mechanisms). (Evidenced by configuration files and code related to HTTPS and encryption libraries).
*   security control: Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Sentry likely undergoes regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. (Inferred from industry best practices and Sentry's position as a security-focused company).
*   security control: Incident Response Plan: Sentry has a documented incident response plan to handle security incidents effectively and minimize their impact. (Inferred from industry best practices and Sentry's position as a security-focused company).
*   security control: Data Backup and Recovery: Sentry implements robust data backup and recovery procedures to ensure data availability and prevent data loss. (Inferred from industry best practices and the use of cloud infrastructure).
*   security control: Monitoring and Alerting: Sentry continuously monitors its systems and infrastructure for security threats and anomalies, and has alerting mechanisms in place to notify administrators of potential issues. (Inferred from the nature of the Sentry service and its use of monitoring tools).
*   security control: Compliance with Regulations: Sentry is designed to comply with relevant data privacy regulations and industry standards. (Evidenced by documentation and features related to GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations).
*   security control: Access Control: Access to production systems and sensitive data is strictly controlled and limited to authorized personnel. (Inferred from industry best practices).
*   security control: Dependency Management: Sentry uses dependency management tools to track and update third-party libraries, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities introduced through dependencies. (Evidenced by the presence of dependency management files in the repository).
*   security control: Rate Limiting: Sentry likely implements rate limiting to protect against denial-of-service attacks and abuse. (Inferred from industry best practices and the nature of the service).
*   security control: Web Application Firewall (WAF): A WAF is likely used to protect against common web application attacks. (Inferred from industry best practices).
*   accepted risk: Given the nature of error tracking, Sentry inherently handles potentially sensitive data within error reports. While mitigation's are in place (data scrubbing, encryption), there's an accepted risk that some sensitive data may be present in error reports. This is mitigated by user education and data minimization practices.
*   accepted risk: Sentry relies on third-party services and libraries. While efforts are made to vet these dependencies, there's an accepted risk of vulnerabilities in these external components. This is mitigated by regular updates and security scanning.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   Implement a robust secrets management solution to securely store and manage API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information.
*   Enhance data scrubbing capabilities to automatically identify and remove sensitive data from error reports before they are stored.
*   Implement a comprehensive vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities.
*   Consider implementing end-to-end encryption for sensitive data within error reports, providing an additional layer of protection.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Secure session management, including protection against session hijacking and fixation.
    *   Integration with common identity providers (e.g., SAML, OAuth).
*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to data and functionality based on user roles.
    *   Fine-grained permissions to control access at the project and resource level.
    *   Audit logging of all user actions and access attempts.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    *   Validation of data received from external sources, including SDKs and integrations.
    *   Data sanitization to remove or encode potentially harmful characters.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA).
    *   Secure key management practices, including regular key rotation.
    *   Encryption of data in transit using TLS/SSL.
    *   Encryption of data at rest using appropriate encryption mechanisms.
*   Data Loss Prevention:
    *   Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the Sentry platform without authorization.

## DEPLOYMENT

Sentry is a complex application with multiple deployment options. Here are a few possibilities:

1.  **Self-Hosted (On-Premise):** Customers can deploy Sentry on their own infrastructure, using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. This provides maximum control over data and infrastructure but requires more operational overhead.
2.  **Sentry-Hosted (SaaS):** Sentry offers a fully managed SaaS solution, where they handle the infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance. This is the easiest option for most customers.
3.  **Hybrid:** A combination of self-hosted and Sentry-hosted components is possible, although less common.

We'll describe the **Sentry-Hosted (SaaS)** deployment model in detail, as it's the most common and relevant for understanding Sentry's overall architecture.
