# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Minimization via Strict Allowlist (within Sentry SDK)](./mitigation_strategies/data_minimization_via_strict_allowlist__within_sentry_sdk_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowlist:** Create a precise list of data fields *explicitly permitted* to be sent to Sentry.  This is done *within your application code*, not within the Sentry UI.
    2.  **Implement `beforeSend` (Sentry SDK):** Utilize the `beforeSend` callback function provided by the Sentry SDK. This is a *Sentry-provided* mechanism.
    3.  **Filter Event Data (within `beforeSend`):** Write code *within the `beforeSend` callback* to remove any data not in the allowlist. This leverages the Sentry SDK's functionality.
    4.  **Return Modified Event (Sentry SDK):** The `beforeSend` function (part of the Sentry SDK) returns the filtered data to the Sentry SDK for transmission.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data (PII, Credentials, API Keys) – *via Sentry*.
        *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Threat:** Data Leakage Due to Code Changes – *affecting data sent to Sentry*.
        *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Threat:** Over-Collection of Data – *by Sentry*.
        *   **Severity:** Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (High impact) – *by controlling what the Sentry SDK sends*.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced (High impact) – *by limiting what the Sentry SDK can transmit*.
    *   **Over-Collection:** Risk significantly reduced (High impact) – *by restricting data sent to Sentry*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Frontend (JavaScript): Partially. `beforeSend` is used, but not with a strict allowlist.
    *   Backend (Python): Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Backend (Python): Implement `beforeSend` (Sentry SDK feature) with a strict allowlist.
    *   Frontend (JavaScript): Refactor `beforeSend` (Sentry SDK feature) to use a strict allowlist.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization and Redaction (within Sentry SDK)](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_and_redaction__within_sentry_sdk_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Patterns:** Create a list of regular expressions for sensitive data.
    2.  **Implement within `beforeSend` (Sentry SDK):** *After* allowlist filtering, add code to the Sentry SDK's `beforeSend` callback.
    3.  **Iterate and Redact (within `beforeSend`):** Loop through allowed fields and use the regular expressions to replace sensitive data with placeholders. This happens *within the Sentry SDK's callback*.
    4.  **Handle Stack Traces (Sentry SDK):** Apply redaction to stack trace strings, potentially using Sentry's stack trace processing options (if available in the SDK).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data *within allowed fields sent to Sentry*.
        *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Threat:** Data Leakage Due to Developer Error *in data sent to Sentry*.
        *   **Severity:** Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (High impact) – *by cleaning data before the Sentry SDK sends it*.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced (Medium impact) – *by sanitizing data within the Sentry SDK's control*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Frontend (JavaScript): Partially. Basic redaction, but not comprehensive.
    *   Backend (Python): Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Backend (Python): Implement within `beforeSend` (Sentry SDK feature).
    *   Frontend (JavaScript): Expand redaction rules and testing (within the Sentry SDK's `beforeSend`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Sentry.io (SaaS) Security Settings](./mitigation_strategies/configure_sentry_io__saas__security_settings.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Data Scrubbing (Sentry UI):** Enable and configure Sentry's *built-in* data scrubbing features *within the Sentry.io web interface*. This is a *Sentry-provided* setting.
    2.  **IP Address Filtering (Sentry UI):** Configure IP address filtering *within the Sentry.io web interface* to restrict access. This is a *Sentry-provided* setting.
    3.  **Audit Logs (Sentry UI):** Review Sentry's audit logs *within the Sentry.io web interface*. This uses Sentry's *built-in* logging.
    4.  **Data Retention Policies (Sentry UI):** Configure data retention policies *within the Sentry.io web interface*. This is a *Sentry-provided* setting.
    5.  **Compliance Features (Sentry UI):** Enable relevant compliance features (GDPR, HIPAA) *within the Sentry.io web interface*.  These are *Sentry-provided* settings.
    6.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (Sentry UI):** Enable and *require* 2FA for all users *within your Sentry.io organization settings*. This uses Sentry's *built-in* authentication.
    7.  **Single Sign-On (SSO) (Sentry UI):** If available, configure SSO *within the Sentry.io web interface*. This integrates with Sentry's authentication system.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Sentry Organization – *specifically, the Sentry.io platform*.
        *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Threat:** Data Breach at Sentry.io – *mitigating the impact*.
        *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Threat:** Compliance Violations – *related to data stored in Sentry*.
        *   **Severity:** Medium to High

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced (High impact) – *by using Sentry.io's security controls*.
    *   **Data Breach:** Impact reduced (High impact) – *by leveraging Sentry.io's data handling features*.
    *   **Compliance:** Risk reduced (Medium to High impact) – *by using Sentry.io's compliance tools*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Data Scrubbing: Partially (some basic rules).
    *   2FA: Partially (enabled, but not required).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   IP Address Filtering: Not implemented (within Sentry.io).
    *   Audit Logs: Not fully utilized (within Sentry.io).
    *   Data Retention: Need to be configured (within Sentry.io).
    *   Compliance Features: Need review and enabling (within Sentry.io).
    *   Enforce 2FA for all users (within Sentry.io).
    *   Consider SSO (within Sentry.io).
