# Threat Model Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Threat: [1. Sensitive Data Exposure via Sentry](./threats/1__sensitive_data_exposure_via_sentry.md)

*   **Threat:**  PII/PHI/Credential Leakage in Sentry Error Reports
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Sentry interface (either legitimately through compromised credentials or illegitimately through a vulnerability) and examines error reports, stack traces, and event context.  They specifically target data inadvertently sent to Sentry by the application, such as user credentials, API keys, database connection strings, session tokens, or customer data. The attacker exploits Sentry as the *primary source* of this sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of user accounts.
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.
        *   Data breaches and regulatory fines (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA).
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Sentry Component Affected:**
        *   Sentry SDK (specifically, the error reporting mechanism and any custom event data sent *to* Sentry).
        *   Sentry Server (data storage and access control).
        *   Sentry Web Interface (data visualization and access).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pre-Submission Scrubbing (Server-Side):** Implement robust server-side data scrubbing *before* sending *any* data to Sentry. Use regular expressions, custom functions, and Sentry's `beforeSend` callback (in the SDK) to remove or redact sensitive data. This is the most crucial mitigation.
        *   **PII Filtering (SaaS):** Configure and *extensively customize* Sentry's built-in PII filtering rules (if using the SaaS offering). Do not rely solely on the defaults.
        *   **Code Review & Secure Coding Training:** Conduct mandatory code reviews focusing on logging and error handling *specifically in relation to Sentry integration*. Train developers on secure coding practices to prevent accidental inclusion of sensitive data in data sent to Sentry.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit *Sentry data* for unexpected sensitive information. Automate this process where possible.
        *   **Data Minimization:** Only send the *absolute minimum* data to Sentry required for effective debugging. Avoid sending entire request bodies or large data structures *to Sentry*.

## Threat: [2. Sentry Instance Compromise](./threats/2__sentry_instance_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unauthorized Access to the Sentry Instance
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Self-Hosted:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the self-hosted Sentry software itself, the underlying operating system, or network infrastructure to gain *direct* access to the Sentry instance. This is a direct attack *on Sentry*.
        *   **SaaS:** An attacker compromises a Sentry user account (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or weak passwords) or exploits a vulnerability in Sentry's SaaS platform *itself*. This gives them access to the Sentry interface and all data within.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Full access to all error data stored within Sentry, including potentially sensitive information.
        *   Ability to modify Sentry configurations (e.g., disable error reporting, redirect data, change access controls).
        *   Potential use of the compromised Sentry instance as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Sentry Component Affected:**
        *   Sentry Server (entire instance, including data storage, access control, and configuration).
        *   Sentry Web Interface (access point).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Self-Hosted Hardening:**
            *   Apply all security updates to *Sentry* and the underlying OS promptly.
            *   Follow *Sentry's* security best practices for deployment and configuration.
            *   Use a strong firewall and intrusion detection/prevention systems, configured specifically to protect the Sentry instance.
            *   Regularly audit the security of the hosting environment *hosting Sentry*.
            *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms *for Sentry*.
        *   **SaaS Account Security:**
            *   Use strong, unique passwords for *Sentry* accounts.
            *   Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all Sentry users*.
            *   Regularly review user access and permissions within *Sentry* (least privilege).
            *   Monitor *Sentry's* security advisories and announcements.
        *   **Audit Logs:** Enable and regularly review *Sentry's* audit logs (if available) to detect suspicious activity within Sentry.
        *   **Sentry's Security Posture (SaaS):** Review *Sentry's* security documentation and certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001) to understand *their* security practices.

## Threat: [3. SDK Vulnerability Exploitation (Directly Affecting Sentry Data)](./threats/3__sdk_vulnerability_exploitation__directly_affecting_sentry_data_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Exploiting Sentry SDK Bugs to Manipulate Sentry Data or Inject Code
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Sentry SDK *itself* or one of its dependencies.  This vulnerability allows the attacker to:
        *   Inject malicious code that is then executed within the context of the application *and sent to Sentry*.
        *   Manipulate the error data being sent *to Sentry*, potentially to mislead investigations or hide other malicious activity.
        *   Cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly, with the malicious activity reflected in *Sentry's reports*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could include:
            *   Injection of malicious data into Sentry.
            *   Tampering with error reports in Sentry.
            *   Potential for further exploitation of the application, leveraging Sentry as a vector.
    *   **Sentry Component Affected:**
        *   Sentry SDK (the specific vulnerable component or dependency).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the *Sentry SDK* and all its dependencies up to date. Subscribe to security advisories for the *Sentry SDK* and related libraries.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system (e.g., npm, pip, Maven) to track and manage dependencies. Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities, *specifically focusing on the Sentry SDK*.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the application and its dependencies, *paying close attention to the Sentry SDK*.

## Threat: [4. SDK Misconfiguration Leading to Data Exposure in Sentry](./threats/4__sdk_misconfiguration_leading_to_data_exposure_in_sentry.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Sentry SDK Setup
    *   **Description:** The Sentry SDK is incorrectly configured, *directly* leading to security issues *within Sentry*. Examples include:
        *   Using an insecure DSN (e.g., exposed in client-side code, allowing attackers to send arbitrary data to the Sentry instance).
        *   Disabling important security features (e.g., data scrubbing within the SDK).
        *   Sending excessive or unnecessary data *to Sentry*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive data *within Sentry*.
        *   Increased attack surface *of the Sentry instance*.
        *   Potential for data breaches *originating from Sentry*.
    *   **Sentry Component Affected:**
        *   Sentry SDK (configuration settings).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configuration Review:** Carefully review the *Sentry SDK* configuration and ensure it adheres to best practices. Use a checklist specific to Sentry.
        *   **Documentation:** Refer to the official *Sentry* documentation for guidance on secure configuration.
        *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the *Sentry* integration in a non-production environment to ensure it is working as expected and not introducing security issues *related to Sentry*.
        *   **DSN Protection:**
            *   **Never** embed the full DSN directly in client-side code.
            *   If the DSN must be accessible client-side, use a proxy server or a server-side endpoint to retrieve it dynamically. The client should only receive a temporary, limited-access token *for Sentry*.
            *   Store the DSN securely (e.g., in environment variables, a secrets management system), and treat it as a sensitive credential *for Sentry*.
        *   **Least Privilege (DSN):** If possible, use a DSN with limited permissions (e.g., a DSN that can only send events to Sentry, not read data).
