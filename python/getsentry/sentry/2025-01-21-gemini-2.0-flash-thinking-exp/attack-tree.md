```


## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JavaScript via Error Message](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_via_error_message.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts an error message containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Exploitation:** The application fails to sanitize the error message received from Sentry before displaying it to users.
*   **Consequence:** The malicious JavaScript executes in the user's browser, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session hijacking, or other client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing Sentry User](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_sentry_user.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a deceptive email or message to a Sentry user, tricking them into revealing their login credentials.
*   **Exploitation:** The user, believing the communication is legitimate, provides their username and password on a fake login page or directly to the attacker.
*   **Consequence:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the Sentry dashboard.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credential Stuffing](./attack_tree_paths/credential_stuffing.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uses a list of previously compromised usernames and passwords (obtained from other breaches) to attempt to log into Sentry accounts.
*   **Exploitation:** If a Sentry user reuses their password across multiple services, their credentials might be valid on the Sentry platform.
*   **Consequence:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the Sentry dashboard.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hardcoded DSN in Source Code](./attack_tree_paths/hardcoded_dsn_in_source_code.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The Sentry Data Source Name (DSN), which contains sensitive authentication information, is directly embedded within the application's source code.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker gains access to the source code (e.g., through a public repository or by decompiling the application).
*   **Consequence:** The attacker obtains the DSN, granting them full control over the application's Sentry project, allowing them to view error data, send fake errors, or potentially disrupt the application's monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stored DSN in Unsecured Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/stored_dsn_in_unsecured_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The Sentry DSN is stored in a configuration file that is not adequately protected (e.g., world-readable permissions, stored in a public location).
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker gains access to the server or the configuration files through vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
*   **Consequence:** The attacker obtains the DSN, granting them full control over the application's Sentry project.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Specific SDK Version](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_sdk_version.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application uses an outdated version of the Sentry SDK that has known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker identifies the specific SDK version being used and leverages publicly available exploits for those vulnerabilities.
*   **Consequence:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server or other severe compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Sentry SDK](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_sentry_sdk.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The Sentry SDK relies on other third-party libraries (dependencies) that contain security vulnerabilities.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker identifies vulnerable dependencies used by the Sentry SDK and exploits those vulnerabilities.
*   **Consequence:** Similar to exploiting SDK vulnerabilities, this can lead to RCE or other compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Sentry](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sentry.md)

This is the root goal and represents the overall objective of the attacker. Success at this node means the application's security has been breached through the Sentry integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Sentry Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sentry_data_manipulation.md)

This node represents a category of attacks where the attacker manipulates data flowing through Sentry to compromise the application. Success here can lead to code injection or triggering unintended application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payload via Sentry](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payload_via_sentry.md)

This node represents the specific tactic of injecting harmful code or data into Sentry events. Success here directly leads to the execution of malicious code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Sentry Data Access](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sentry_data_access.md)

This node represents a category of attacks where the attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive information stored or transmitted through Sentry. Success here can lead to data breaches and further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Information via Sentry Dashboard](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_information_via_sentry_dashboard.md)

This node represents the tactic of directly accessing the Sentry platform to view sensitive data. Success here provides the attacker with valuable information about the application and its users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Sentry Account Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_sentry_account_credentials.md)

This node represents the critical step of gaining unauthorized access to a legitimate Sentry user account. Success here grants broad access to the Sentry project.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Information via Application's Sentry Integration](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_information_via_application's_sentry_integration.md)

This node represents the tactic of accessing sensitive information through vulnerabilities in how the application interacts with Sentry. Success here can expose sensitive data without directly compromising the Sentry platform itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Sentry DSN Storage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_sentry_dsn_storage.md)

This node represents a common vulnerability where the sensitive Sentry DSN is not properly protected. Success here grants the attacker full control over the application's Sentry project.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Sentry SDK/Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sentry_sdkintegration_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents a category of attacks that exploit weaknesses in the Sentry SDK itself or how the application integrates with it. Success here can lead to severe compromises like RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Sentry SDK](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_sentry_sdk.md)

This node represents the specific tactic of leveraging known or dependency vulnerabilities within the Sentry SDK. Success here can have significant security implications for the application.
