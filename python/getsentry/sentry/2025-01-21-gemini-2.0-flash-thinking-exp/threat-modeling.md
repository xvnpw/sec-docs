# Threat Model Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Threat: [Data Breach on Sentry's Infrastructure](./threats/data_breach_on_sentry's_infrastructure.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker successfully breaches Sentry's infrastructure and gains unauthorized access to the stored error data of multiple organizations, including the application's data. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in Sentry's systems or through social engineering attacks targeting Sentry employees.
*   **Impact:** Large-scale exposure of application errors, potentially revealing vulnerabilities, business logic, and indirectly, sensitive user data across many organizations. The specific impact on the application depends on the sensitivity of the data sent to Sentry.
*   **Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry Platform (Data Storage, Backend Systems).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on Sentry's security practices and certifications. Understand their data security policies and incident response procedures.
    *   Consider the sensitivity of the data being sent to Sentry and whether self-hosted options are necessary for extremely sensitive applications where third-party risk is unacceptable.
    *   Implement strong security practices within the application itself to minimize the potential damage even if error data is exposed (e.g., strong encryption, secure coding practices).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Sentry Project](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_sentry_project.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's Sentry project. This could be through compromised user credentials (phishing, credential stuffing), exploiting vulnerabilities in Sentry's authentication mechanisms, or through insider threats.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can view error reports, potentially gleaning sensitive information and understanding application vulnerabilities. They might also be able to manipulate Sentry settings, delete error data, or invite malicious users to the project.
*   **Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry Web UI (Authentication and Authorization), Sentry API (Authentication and Authorization).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for Sentry users.
    *   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Sentry users.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to team members.
    *   Regularly review and audit user permissions within the Sentry project.
    *   Monitor login activity for suspicious patterns.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Sentry SDK](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_the_sentry_sdk.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a security vulnerability within the Sentry SDK library itself. If the application uses a vulnerable version of the SDK, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code within the application's context.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry SDK (within the application).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the Sentry SDK to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to the Sentry SDK and other dependencies.
    *   Implement dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable libraries.
