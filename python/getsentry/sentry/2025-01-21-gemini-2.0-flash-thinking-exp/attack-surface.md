# Attack Surface Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data via Sentry Events](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_via_sentry_events.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII, internal system details) is unintentionally included in error messages, breadcrumbs, or context data sent to Sentry.

**How Sentry Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sentry's purpose is to collect and store error data. If the application sends sensitive data within this error information, Sentry becomes the repository for this exposed data.

**Example:** An exception handler logs the full request object, including authorization headers containing API keys, which are then sent to Sentry.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or further attacks on internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict data sanitization and filtering before sending data to Sentry.
* Avoid logging full request/response bodies or sensitive environment variables.
* Utilize Sentry's data scrubbing features to automatically remove sensitive patterns.
* Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of exposing sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Sentry DSN (Data Source Name)](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_sentry_dsn__data_source_name_.md)

**Description:** The DSN, which authenticates the application to the Sentry project, is exposed or leaked.

**How Sentry Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The DSN is the key to sending data to a specific Sentry project. Its compromise allows unauthorized parties to inject data.

**Example:** The DSN is hardcoded in client-side JavaScript or accidentally committed to a public repository.

**Impact:** Attackers can send malicious or fabricated error events, leading to data pollution, denial of service on the Sentry project, or potentially misleading error analysis. They might also be able to infer information about the application's structure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store the DSN securely, preferably in environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
* Avoid hardcoding the DSN in client-side code.
* Regularly rotate DSNs as a security precaution.
* Implement monitoring for unusual activity on the Sentry project.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Sentry SDKs](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sentry_sdks.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within the Sentry SDKs used by the application.

**How Sentry Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The SDK is the interface between the application and Sentry. Vulnerabilities in this interface can be exploited.

**Example:** A bug in the SDK allows for arbitrary code execution within the application's context when processing a specially crafted error event.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or other security breaches within the application.

**Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Sentry SDKs up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Subscribe to Sentry's security advisories and monitor for reported vulnerabilities.
* Follow secure coding practices when integrating and configuring the Sentry SDK.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Sentry User Accounts](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_sentry_user_accounts.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Sentry user accounts.

**How Sentry Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sentry stores sensitive error data and project configurations. Compromised accounts provide access to this information.

**Example:** An attacker uses stolen credentials or exploits a vulnerability in Sentry's authentication system to log in to a Sentry account with access to the application's project.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive error data, potential modification of project settings, disabling of error tracking, or access to integrated services if configured.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for Sentry user accounts.
* Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Sentry users.
* Regularly review and manage user permissions within the Sentry organization and projects.
* Monitor Sentry account activity for suspicious logins or actions.
