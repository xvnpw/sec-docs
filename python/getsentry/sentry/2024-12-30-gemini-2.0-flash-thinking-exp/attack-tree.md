## Threat Model: Compromising Application via Sentry Exploitation - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Sentry integration.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   Compromise Application via Sentry Exploitation
    *   *** Exploit Data Sent to Sentry ***
        *   *** Inject Malicious Payloads into Error Data ***
            *   *** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Error Messages ***
                *   *** Trigger XSS in Sentry UI [CRITICAL] ***
                *   *** Trigger XSS in Integrated Systems (e.g., Slack, Email) ***
    *   *** Exploit Sentry's Data Storage and Access ***
        *   Unauthorized Access to Sentry Data [CRITICAL]
            *   Compromise Sentry Instance (Self-Hosted) [CRITICAL]
            *   *** Compromise Sentry User Accounts [CRITICAL] ***
        *   *** Data Exfiltration from Sentry [CRITICAL] ***
    *   Exploit Sentry's Integration with Application
        *   Manipulate Sentry Configuration within Application [CRITICAL]
            *   Gain Access to Sentry DSN/API Keys [CRITICAL]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Data Sent to Sentry -> Inject Malicious Payloads -> XSS via Error Messages -> Trigger XSS in Sentry UI/Integrated Systems**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious error messages or event data containing JavaScript code.
*   **Trigger XSS in Sentry UI [CRITICAL]:**
    *   If Sentry's user interface does not properly sanitize error data, the injected JavaScript can execute in the context of a Sentry user's browser.
    *   This allows the attacker to potentially:
        *   Steal the Sentry user's session cookies, granting them unauthorized access to the Sentry platform.
        *   Steal Sentry API keys, allowing them to interact with the Sentry API on behalf of the compromised user.
        *   Perform actions within the Sentry UI as the compromised user, such as modifying settings or accessing sensitive data.
*   **Trigger XSS in Integrated Systems (e.g., Slack, Email):**
    *   If Sentry is integrated with other systems like Slack or email for notifications, and these systems do not properly sanitize the error data received from Sentry, the injected JavaScript can execute within these platforms.
    *   This can be used for:
        *   Phishing attacks, where malicious links or forms are displayed to users of the integrated system, attempting to steal their credentials for other services.
        *   Credential harvesting by injecting scripts that capture user input within the integrated system's interface.

**High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Sentry's Data Storage and Access -> Compromise Sentry User Accounts -> Data Exfiltration**

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to gain unauthorized access to the sensitive data stored within Sentry by compromising legitimate user accounts.
*   **Compromise Sentry User Accounts [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** The attacker uses lists of known username/password combinations (often obtained from previous data breaches on other platforms) to attempt to log into Sentry accounts.
    *   **Phishing Sentry Users:** The attacker crafts deceptive emails or messages that appear to be legitimate Sentry communications, tricking users into revealing their login credentials.
*   **Data Exfiltration from Sentry [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Once a Sentry user account is compromised, the attacker can access the error and event data stored within the Sentry project.
    *   This data may contain sensitive application information that was inadvertently logged in error messages, such as:
        *   API keys and secrets.
        *   Database credentials.
        *   User data (e.g., usernames, email addresses, potentially more sensitive information depending on the application's logging practices).

**Critical Node: Unauthorized Access to Sentry Data**

*   This node represents the point where an attacker gains the ability to view and potentially manipulate the data stored within Sentry.
*   **Compromise Sentry Instance (Self-Hosted) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   If the application uses a self-hosted Sentry instance, attackers can directly target the Sentry application itself or the underlying infrastructure.
    *   This can involve exploiting:
        *   Known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Sentry being used.
        *   Misconfigurations in the Sentry application or its hosting environment.
        *   Vulnerabilities in the operating system, web server, or database used by the Sentry instance.
    *   Successful compromise grants the attacker complete access to all Sentry data and potentially the server itself.

**Critical Node: Manipulate Sentry Configuration within Application -> Gain Access to Sentry DSN/API Keys**

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to gain access to the Sentry Data Source Name (DSN) or API keys that are used to configure the Sentry integration within the application.
*   **Gain Access to Sentry DSN/API Keys [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers may target:
        *   Configuration files where the DSN or API keys are stored (e.g., `config.py`, `.env` files).
        *   Environment variables where these credentials might be defined.
        *   Source code repositories if the keys are inadvertently committed.
        *   Memory dumps of the application process.
    *   With the DSN or API keys, the attacker can:
        *   Send malicious data directly to the Sentry project, bypassing the application's intended usage and potentially injecting false errors or malicious payloads.
        *   Retrieve data from the Sentry project using the API keys.
        *   Potentially modify Sentry project settings if they have sufficient privileges associated with the obtained keys.
