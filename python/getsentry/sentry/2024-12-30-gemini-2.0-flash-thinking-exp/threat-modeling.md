* **Threat:** Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Data in Error Reports
    * **Description:** Developers might unintentionally log sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data, internal system details) within error messages, stack traces, or user context that is sent to Sentry. An attacker gaining access to Sentry could then view this data.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of credentials leading to further compromise, violation of privacy regulations, reputational damage.
    * **Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry SDK (data capture), Sentry Web UI (data display), Sentry API (data access).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust data scrubbing and filtering within the Sentry SDK configuration.
        * Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of including sensitive data in error reports.
        * Regularly review Sentry error logs for accidental inclusion of sensitive information.
        * Utilize Sentry's data redaction features.
        * Implement code reviews to identify potential logging of sensitive data.

* **Threat:** Compromise of Sentry Credentials Leading to Data Access
    * **Description:** If an attacker gains access to Sentry credentials (e.g., API keys, authentication tokens, user accounts), they can directly access the collected error data, potentially including sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to application error history, potential for manipulating Sentry data.
    * **Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry API (authentication), Sentry Web UI (authentication).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Securely store and manage Sentry API keys and authentication tokens (e.g., using secrets management tools).
        * Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for Sentry user accounts.
        * Regularly rotate Sentry API keys.
        * Monitor Sentry access logs for suspicious activity.
        * Follow Sentry's security best practices for credential management.

* **Threat:** Manipulation of Sentry Configuration After Credential Compromise
    * **Description:** An attacker who has compromised Sentry credentials could modify Sentry project settings, integrations, alert rules, or data scrubbing configurations. This could disable alerts, redirect notifications, or expose previously protected data.
    * **Impact:** Disruption of error monitoring, potential exposure of sensitive data, masking of malicious activity.
    * **Affected Sentry Component:** Sentry Web UI (configuration), Sentry API (configuration).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong access controls within the Sentry organization, limiting who can modify critical settings.
        * Enable audit logging within Sentry to track configuration changes.
        * Regularly review Sentry configurations for unauthorized modifications.
        * Use multi-factor authentication for Sentry accounts with administrative privileges.
