## 4. Key Components

This section provides a more detailed breakdown of the major components within the Sentry system.

### 4.1. Client SDKs

* **Functionality:** Language-specific libraries integrated directly into client applications to automatically or manually capture errors, exceptions, breadcrumbs (user actions leading to an error), and performance data (transactions, spans).
* **Responsibilities:**
    * **Automatic Instrumentation:** Intercept unhandled exceptions and errors based on language conventions.
    * **Manual Instrumentation:** Provide APIs for developers to explicitly capture events, log messages, and performance metrics.
    * **Context Collection:** Gather rich contextual information such as stack traces (with in-app frames), local variables (where supported), user information (ID, email, IP address), environment details (OS, browser, device), release information (version control), and tags.
    * **Event Formatting and Enrichment:** Format collected data into a standardized JSON payload adhering to the Sentry protocol.
    * **Secure Transmission:** Transmit events to the Ingest Service over HTTPS, often with configurable options for proxy settings and certificate pinning.
    * **Buffering and Retry Mechanisms:** Implement strategies to buffer events locally and retry transmission in case of network issues.
    * **Rate Limiting and Sampling:** Implement client-side rate limiting and sampling to control the volume of events sent to Sentry, preventing overload.
* **Examples:** `sentry-python`, `sentry-javascript`, `sentry-java`, `sentry-ruby`, `sentry-go`, and many more community-supported SDKs.

### 4.2. Ingest Service (API Gateway)

* **Functionality:** The primary entry point for receiving events from client SDKs, acting as an API gateway for the Sentry backend.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * **Load Balancing:** Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the Ingest Service for scalability and resilience.

4. **Ingest Service Processing:** The Ingest Service receives the event, authenticates the request, validates the payload, and applies rate limiting.
5. **Event Queueing:** The validated event is placed onto the Message Queue (e.g., Kafka).
6. **Worker Consumption:** Data Processing Workers consume events from the Message Queue.
7. **Symbolication (if applicable):** Workers retrieve necessary symbol files from the Symbolication Cache (or fetch them if missing) to symbolicate stack traces.
8. **Data Processing and Enrichment:** Workers process the event, group it with similar issues, and enrich it with additional metadata.
9. **Event Storage:** The processed and enriched event data is stored in the Event Database (e.g., ClickHouse).
10. **Alert Evaluation:** The Alerting & Notification Service continuously monitors the stream of processed events.
11. **Alert Triggering (Conditional):** If an event matches a configured alert rule, the Alerting & Notification Service triggers a notification.
12. **Notification Delivery:** Notifications are sent to the configured notification channels (e.g., email, Slack).
13. **User Access and Analysis:** Users access and analyze the stored event data and performance metrics through the Web Application's UI or API.
