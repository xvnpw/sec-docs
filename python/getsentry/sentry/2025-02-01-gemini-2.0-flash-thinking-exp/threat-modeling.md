# Threat Model Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Error Reports](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_error_reports.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally log sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII, tokens, connection strings) in error messages or stack traces. Attackers could gain access to this data by compromising Sentry access or if Sentry data is exposed.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data leading to account compromise, data breaches, and privacy violations.
*   **Sentry Component Affected:** Sentry SDK (data capture), Sentry Backend (data storage), Sentry Dashboard (data display).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust data scrubbing and masking within the Sentry SDK configuration.
    *   Review and sanitize error logging practices in application code to avoid logging sensitive data.
    *   Utilize Sentry's data redaction features to remove sensitive information before it's sent.
    *   Regularly audit error reports for accidental data exposure.
    *   Educate developers on secure logging practices and data sensitivity.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sentry Data through Dashboard Access](./threats/exposure_of_sentry_data_through_dashboard_access.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient access control on the Sentry dashboard allows unauthorized users (internal or external) to view sensitive error reports and performance data. Attackers could exploit weak access controls or compromised accounts to gain access.
*   **Impact:** Confidential information leakage, reconnaissance by attackers, unauthorized access to application insights, potential data breaches.
*   **Sentry Component Affected:** Sentry Dashboard (access control, data display).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong role-based access control (RBAC) within Sentry.
    *   Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Sentry users.
    *   Regularly review and audit Sentry user permissions and access logs.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting Sentry access.
    *   Educate users on secure password practices and account security.

## Threat: [Data Breach at Sentry's Infrastructure (SaaS version)](./threats/data_breach_at_sentry's_infrastructure__saas_version_.md)

*   **Description:** If using Sentry SaaS, a data breach at Sentry's infrastructure could expose all collected data. Attackers could target Sentry's infrastructure directly.
*   **Impact:** Large-scale data breach, reputational damage, legal liabilities, compromise of application secrets if exposed in error reports.
*   **Sentry Component Affected:** Sentry SaaS Infrastructure (data storage, security).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Choose reputable SaaS providers with strong security certifications and practices.
    *   Review Sentry's security policies and incident response plans.
    *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data sent to Sentry.
    *   Consider self-hosting Sentry for greater control over data and infrastructure (but increased responsibility).
    *   Implement strong data scrubbing and masking to reduce the impact of a potential breach.

## Threat: [Weak Sentry API Keys/DSN Security](./threats/weak_sentry_api_keysdsn_security.md)

*   **Description:** Sentry API keys (DSN) are not properly secured and are exposed. Attackers finding exposed DSNs can send data to the Sentry project, potentially including malicious or excessive data.
*   **Impact:** Data injection, spamming Sentry with irrelevant data, potentially sending malicious data, resource exhaustion, and potentially gaining insights into application behavior.
*   **Sentry Component Affected:** Sentry SDK (configuration), Sentry Backend (authentication).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store Sentry DSNs securely, using environment variables or secrets management systems.
    *   Avoid hardcoding DSNs in public code repositories or client-side code without restrictions.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict where DSNs can be used from.
    *   Regularly rotate Sentry API keys/DSNs.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control on Sentry Dashboard](./threats/insufficient_access_control_on_sentry_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** (Repeated for clarity). Weak access control on the Sentry dashboard. Attackers exploit weak controls or compromised accounts to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized configuration changes, disruption of monitoring, and potential manipulation of Sentry data.
*   **Sentry Component Affected:** Sentry Dashboard (access control).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement RBAC, MFA, regular audits, least privilege, user education (as detailed in previous responses).

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Data Scrubbing/Data Masking](./threats/misconfiguration_of_data_scrubbingdata_masking.md)

*   **Description:** Sentry's data scrubbing/masking features are misconfigured, leading to sensitive data not being properly removed from error reports. Configuration errors by developers.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data despite attempts to mitigate it, data breaches, privacy violations, and compliance failures.
*   **Sentry Component Affected:** Sentry SDK (data scrubbing configuration), Sentry Backend (data processing).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test and validate data scrubbing and masking configurations.
    *   Regularly review and audit scrubbing configurations to ensure effectiveness.
    *   Use automated testing to verify data scrubbing rules.
    *   Provide clear documentation and training to developers on proper scrubbing configuration.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Sentry Configuration](./threats/insecure_storage_of_sentry_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Sentry configuration (API keys, DSNs, tokens) is stored insecurely (plain text files, unencrypted variables). Attackers gaining access to configuration files can compromise Sentry access and potentially the application's Sentry integration.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Sentry, potential data breaches, ability to manipulate Sentry settings, disruption of monitoring, and potentially wider application compromise if configuration contains other secrets.
*   **Sentry Component Affected:** Application Configuration Management, Sentry SDK (configuration loading).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store Sentry configuration securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   Encrypt configuration files at rest.
    *   Implement access controls for configuration files, restricting access to authorized personnel only.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Sentry SDK or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sentry_sdk_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities are discovered in the Sentry SDK or its dependencies. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities in applications using vulnerable SDK versions to compromise the application or its Sentry integration.
*   **Impact:** Potential application compromise, depending on the vulnerability. This could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Sentry Component Affected:** Sentry SDK, Sentry SDK Dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical, depending on vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Sentry SDK and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Sentry and its dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process for third-party libraries.

## Threat: [Compromised Sentry SDK Packages](./threats/compromised_sentry_sdk_packages.md)

*   **Description:** Sentry SDK packages on package repositories are compromised (malware injected). Attackers compromise package repositories or developer accounts to inject malicious code into the SDK packages.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise through malicious dependencies, supply chain attack, potentially leading to full control of the application or data exfiltration.
*   **Sentry Component Affected:** Sentry SDK Packages (distribution).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use trusted package repositories and verify package integrity (e.g., using checksums).
    *   Implement dependency scanning tools to detect malicious code in dependencies.
    *   Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
    *   Consider using private package repositories for greater control over dependencies and supply chain.
