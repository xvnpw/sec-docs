# Attack Surface Analysis for getsentry/sentry

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Error Context](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_in_error_context.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional leakage of highly sensitive information (PII, secrets, credentials, critical internal data) within error reports sent to Sentry.
*   **Sentry Contribution:** Sentry's core function of capturing error context, if not carefully managed, can lead to the inclusion and transmission of sensitive data to Sentry servers.
*   **Example:** A developer's error handling code captures and logs the entire user object, which includes sensitive fields like social security numbers or unhashed passwords. This data is then sent to Sentry as part of the error report.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** Data breach, severe privacy violations, legal and regulatory penalties (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), significant reputational damage, potential for identity theft and financial loss if credentials or PII are exposed.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Data Scrubbing:** Implement and enforce strict data scrubbing rules using Sentry's features (e.g., `beforeSend` hooks, data sanitization) to automatically and aggressively redact known sensitive data patterns and fields *before* data is sent to Sentry.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege Context:**  Train developers to meticulously minimize the error context captured. Only include absolutely necessary data for debugging and avoid broad data dumps like entire request/response objects.
    *   **Automated Sensitive Data Detection:** Integrate automated tools (static analysis, linters) into the development pipeline to detect potential sensitive data logging in error handling code *before* deployment.
    *   **Regular Security Audits & Data Flow Mapping:** Conduct frequent security audits specifically focused on Sentry integration and data flow. Map out what data is being captured and sent to Sentry to identify and eliminate sensitive data leaks.
    *   **Data Minimization Policies:** Establish and enforce clear data minimization policies for error reporting, explicitly defining what types of data are permissible and prohibited in Sentry reports.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side SDK Vulnerabilities (XSS, Information Disclosure leading to Account Takeover)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_sdk_vulnerabilities__xss__information_disclosure_leading_to_account_takeover_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical security vulnerabilities within the Sentry client-side SDK code itself, or its dependencies, that can be exploited to execute malicious code or leak sensitive information, leading to severe consequences.
*   **Sentry Contribution:** Integrating the Sentry SDK introduces a new client-side dependency. Critical vulnerabilities in this SDK can directly compromise the security of the application and its users.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability in the Sentry JavaScript SDK allows an attacker to craft a malicious error payload that, when processed by the SDK, results in arbitrary JavaScript execution (XSS) within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or account takeover. Alternatively, a vulnerability could leak sensitive tokens or user data from the browser's memory.
*   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to account takeover, session hijacking, malware injection, or defacement. Information disclosure of sensitive client-side data, potentially including authentication tokens or user credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability and its exploitability, especially if leading to RCE or account takeover).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate SDK Updates for Security Patches:** Establish a process for immediately updating Sentry SDKs whenever security vulnerabilities are announced and patches are released. Prioritize security updates above feature updates.
    *   **Proactive Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to Sentry's security advisories and monitor security mailing lists and vulnerability databases for reports related to Sentry SDKs and their dependencies.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning & Alerting:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools that specifically check for vulnerabilities in Sentry SDK dependencies and trigger immediate alerts for critical findings.
    *   **Robust Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to significantly limit the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities, even those originating from SDKs. Use CSP to restrict script sources and inline script execution.
    *   **Regular Penetration Testing & Security Audits:** Include client-side security testing, specifically targeting potential SDK vulnerabilities, in regular penetration testing and security audit cycles.

## Attack Surface: [Sentry Server Vulnerabilities (Self-Hosted - Leading to Data Breach or Server Compromise)](./attack_surfaces/sentry_server_vulnerabilities__self-hosted_-_leading_to_data_breach_or_server_compromise_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical security vulnerabilities in the self-hosted Sentry server application, its underlying operating system, or infrastructure components that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, leading to data breaches or complete server compromise.
*   **Sentry Contribution:** Self-hosting Sentry places the full responsibility for securing the Sentry server infrastructure on the user. Critical vulnerabilities in Sentry itself or its environment can have severe consequences.
*   **Example:** A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability is discovered in the self-hosted Sentry server application. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain shell access to the server, allowing them to exfiltrate all error data, including sensitive information, and potentially pivot to other systems within the network.
*   **Impact:** **Critical** Data breach of all error data stored in Sentry, including potentially sensitive information. Complete compromise of the Sentry server, potentially leading to further attacks on internal infrastructure. Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Sentry service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rapid Patching & Updates (Sentry Server & Infrastructure):** Implement a system for rapid patching and updating of the Sentry server application, operating system, database, and all other infrastructure components. Prioritize security updates and have a process for emergency patching.
    *   **Security Hardening & Configuration Management:** Implement comprehensive security hardening measures for the Sentry server environment, following security best practices for OS, web server, database, and network configurations. Use configuration management tools to ensure consistent and secure configurations.
    *   **Network Segmentation & Access Control:** Isolate the Sentry server within a tightly controlled network segment with strict firewall rules and access control lists. Limit access to the server to only authorized personnel via secure channels (e.g., SSH with key-based authentication).
    *   **Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy and actively monitor Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems to detect and block malicious activity targeting the Sentry server.
    *   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning & Penetration Testing:** Conduct frequent vulnerability scans and penetration testing of the self-hosted Sentry server and its environment to proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses.
    *   **Consider Managed Sentry (SaaS):**  For organizations lacking dedicated security expertise or resources for self-hosting, strongly consider using Sentry's SaaS offering to offload the responsibility of securing the Sentry server infrastructure to Sentry's security team.
