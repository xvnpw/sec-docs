- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Cross‐Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Phone Number Raw Input
  **Description:**
  • An attacker can supply a deliberately malformed phone number string (for example, `<script>alert('xss')</script>`) via a publicly exposed input (such as a form field) that uses the django‐phonenumber‑field.
  • When the supplied phone number is invalid, the library’s `PhoneNumber.__str__` method returns the original raw input without any sanitization.
  • If the application later renders this phone number in a web page without enforcing autoescaping (or if a developer explicitly marks this value as “safe”), the malicious script may be executed by the browser.
  **Impact:**
  • The attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users’ browsers. This may lead to theft of session data, redirection to malicious sites, or further client‐side compromise.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The code assumes that Django’s template engine (with autoescaping enabled by default) will safely escape output.
  • There is no internal sanitization in the library itself because it expects caller code to handle output encoding.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Explicit sanitization of the raw phone number input (e.g. filtering or encoding dangerous characters) within the `__str__` method.
  • Documentation and/or warnings advising developers never to override autoescaping or to mark phone numbers as safe before proper sanitization.
  **Preconditions:**
  • An attacker must be able to submit a malicious phone number (via a public form or API).
  • The application must render the phone number without proper autoescaping (for example, by disabling autoescaping or by using a “safe” filter on the phone number output).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In `phonenumber_field/phonenumber.py`, the `__str__` method is defined as follows:
  ```python
  def __str__(self):
      if self.is_valid():
          format_string = getattr(settings, "PHONENUMBER_DEFAULT_FORMAT", "E164")
          fmt = self.format_map[format_string]
          return self.format_as(fmt)
      else:
          return self.raw_input
  ```
  • When an invalid phone number (i.e. one that does not pass the parser’s checks) is provided, the method simply returns the user‑supplied string without any sanitization.
  **Security Test Case:**
  • In a test environment, create a phone number instance by submitting a value such as `<script>alert('xss')</script>`.
  • Save this phone number via a view or API endpoint that uses django‐phonenumber‑field.
  • Render a template (or return an API response) that displays the phone number, deliberately disabling autoescaping (or simulating a scenario in which the value is marked “safe”).
  • Verify that the returned HTML contains the unsanitized payload and (manually or via an automated test) confirm that the browser would execute the injected script.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unpinned Dependency Versions Leading to Supply Chain Risk
  **Description:**
  • The project’s dependency declarations in `pyproject.toml` use open‑ended version specifiers (for example, `Django>=4.2` and `phonenumbers >= 7.0.2`) rather than pinning to a known–good version or using a lock file.
  • This configuration allows the automatic installation of any future version that satisfies the version constraints—even if such a version has not been vetted by the project maintainers.
  • An attacker who compromises a dependency (or publishes a malicious version that meets the specifier) could thus inject malicious code into the application without the library’s authors’ knowledge.
  **Impact:**
  • A compromised dependency could lead to supply chain attacks including remote code execution, data exfiltration, or wider compromise of the production environment.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The repository includes a Dependabot configuration (in `.github/dependabot.yml`) to help monitor and update GitHub Action dependencies, but the production dependency versions in `pyproject.toml` remain unpinned.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Pinning dependencies to exact versions or managing them with a lock file (such as via Poetry, Pipenv, or a generated requirements file) to ensure that only vetted versions are deployed.
  • A formal dependency security review process to verify that updates within the allowed range do not introduce vulnerabilities.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The application is deployed with an automated dependency resolver that picks the highest available version (or a malicious version) within the allowed range from the public repositories.
  • No additional deployment–side dependency management (such as a locked requirements file) is in place to restrict the versions installed.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In `pyproject.toml`, the project dependency section contains, for example:
  ```toml
  [project]
  dependencies = ["Django>=4.2"]

  [project.optional-dependencies]
  phonenumbers = ["phonenumbers >= 7.0.2"]
  ```
  • There is no accompanying lock file in the repository to restrict the dependency versions.
  **Security Test Case:**
  • In a controlled testing environment, simulate the availability of a “malicious” version of one of the dependencies (for example, a compromised version of the phonenumbers package) that still satisfies the version specifier.
  • Perform a fresh installation of the project and observe the resolved dependency versions.
  • Run the application and exercise core functionality of django‑phonenumber‑field to detect any abnormal behavior (for example, unexpected code execution or logging).
  • Repeat the installation with stricter version pinning, and verify that the malicious version is no longer installed.
