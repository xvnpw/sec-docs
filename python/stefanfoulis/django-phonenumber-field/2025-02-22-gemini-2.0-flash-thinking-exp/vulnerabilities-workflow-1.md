## Combined Vulnerability List for django-phonenumber-field

This list combines identified vulnerabilities from the provided reports, removing duplicates and standardizing the format.

### Region Validation Bypass

**Description:**
The `django-phonenumber-field` library might not strictly enforce region validation in all scenarios, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass intended region restrictions. This could lead to the application processing phone numbers under incorrect region assumptions, even if a valid region is provided by the attacker, or if the region validation is expected to be implicitly handled by the library but is not consistently applied server-side.

**Step-by-step trigger:**
1. Identify an application using `django-phonenumber-field` that implements region-specific logic based on the validated phone number's region (e.g., applying different formatting or routing rules based on region).
2. Locate an endpoint (e.g., user registration, profile update) where a phone number and region can be submitted as parameters, or where the application infers the region from the user's input or session.
3. Craft a request to this endpoint. Include a valid phone number that is clearly associated with a specific region (e.g., a US number like +1-555-123-4567).
4. Attempt to manipulate the region parameter in the request (if it exists and is directly controllable) to specify a different, unexpected region (e.g., 'GB' instead of 'US'), or provide an invalid region code (e.g., 'ZZ'). Alternatively, if the region is inferred, try to manipulate other input parameters that might influence the region inference logic to force an incorrect region association.
5. Submit the crafted request to the application.
6. Observe if the application processes the phone number as valid and applies region-specific logic based on the *manipulated or incorrect* region, rather than the actual region implied by the phone number itself or the intended region.

**Impact:**
High. If the application relies on accurate region information for phone number processing, bypassing region validation can lead to:
- Incorrect application behavior: Features relying on region-specific logic may malfunction or behave unexpectedly.
- Business logic bypass: Region-based restrictions or features might be circumvented.
- Potential security implications: In scenarios where region context is used for access control or security policies, a bypass could lead to unauthorized actions or information disclosure. For example, if SMS verification codes are sent with region-specific gateways and the region is manipulated, delivery issues or cost implications might arise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- Input validation using `phonenumbers` library, which includes basic region validation checks during phone number parsing.
- Potentially, some applications might implement their own region validation logic on top of `django-phonenumber-field`.
- Input validation using `phonenumbers` library to ensure phone numbers are valid.
- Region validation to ensure provided regions are valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.
- Test suite covering various aspects of phone number handling and validation.
- Static analysis checks (ruff, mypy) in CI.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Strict Server-Side Region Enforcement:** Ensure that the application consistently and strictly validates the region on the server-side, regardless of client-provided or inferred region information. Ideally, the server should re-validate or derive the region directly from the parsed phone number object using the `phonenumbers` library and not solely rely on external or easily manipulated region inputs.
- **Clear Documentation and Best Practices:** Provide developers with clear guidelines and examples on how to correctly handle region information when using `django-phonenumber-field`, emphasizing the importance of server-side validation and consistent region handling throughout the application logic.

**Preconditions:**
- The target application uses `django-phonenumber-field` and relies on the region information associated with phone numbers for some aspect of its functionality.
- An endpoint is accessible to external attackers that processes phone numbers and region information, either directly as input parameters or indirectly through region inference mechanisms.
- The application's server-side region validation is either insufficient, bypassable, or inconsistent in its enforcement when using `django-phonenumber-field`.

**Source Code Analysis:**
*(Note: This is a general analysis as specific project files are not provided. A real analysis would require examining the application's code and how it uses `django-phonenumber-field`.)*

1. **Django Model/Form Definition:** The developer defines a `PhoneNumberField` in a Django model or form, potentially with options like `region` or `default_region`.
2. **Form Processing and Validation:** When a form is submitted, Django's form validation framework calls the `PhoneNumberField`'s `clean` method. This method internally uses the `phonenumbers` library to parse and validate the phone number and potentially considers the provided region.
3. **Potential Weakness in Application Logic:** After the form is validated by `django-phonenumber-field`, the application logic might:
    - **Incorrectly assume region validity:** The application might assume that if `django-phonenumber-field` validation passes, the region is always correctly validated and enforced, which might not be true in all scenarios, especially if the application relies on external region inputs.
    - **Prioritize external region input over phone number's region:** The application's code might prioritize a user-provided region parameter over the region derived by the `phonenumbers` library from the phone number itself. This could lead to using an attacker-controlled region even if it's inconsistent with the phone number.
    - **Lack of Server-Side Re-validation:** The application might not re-validate the region or consistently use the validated region information throughout its processing logic, especially in subsequent steps after initial form validation.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup Test Environment:** Deploy a test instance of the Django application that uses `django-phonenumber-field` and has a feature that is region-sensitive (e.g., displaying phone number format based on region, or routing SMS messages based on region).
2. **Identify Target Endpoint:** Find a publicly accessible endpoint (e.g., user profile update form) that includes a phone number field and ideally also a region selection or input.
3. **Inspect Request:** Use browser developer tools or a proxy to capture the request when submitting a valid phone number and region (e.g., a US number and 'US' region). Analyze the request parameters.
4. **Craft Malicious Request:**
    - Prepare a valid phone number from a specific region (e.g., +1-555-123-4567 - US).
    - Modify the request parameters to submit this US phone number but specify a different region, such as 'GB', or an invalid region code like 'ZZ'. If region is inferred, try to manipulate other inputs to influence region inference incorrectly.
5. **Send Malicious Request:** Submit the crafted request to the application.
6. **Observe Application Behavior:**
    - Check if the application accepts the request as valid without rejecting it due to region mismatch or invalid region.
    - Verify if the region-sensitive feature in the application now behaves based on the *incorrect* region you provided in the request (e.g., displays the phone number in GB format, attempts to send SMS via a GB gateway if applicable), rather than the correct US region implied by the phone number.
    - If the application proceeds with the incorrect region, this confirms a region validation bypass vulnerability.

### Potential Cross‐Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Phone Number Raw Input

**Description:**
An attacker can supply a deliberately malformed phone number string (for example, `<script>alert('xss')</script>`) via a publicly exposed input (such as a form field) that uses the `django‐phonenumber‐field`. When the supplied phone number is invalid, the library’s `PhoneNumber.__str__` method returns the original raw input without any sanitization. If the application later renders this phone number in a web page without enforcing autoescaping (or if a developer explicitly marks this value as “safe”), the malicious script may be executed by the browser.

**Step-by-step trigger:**
1. Find a form or API endpoint that uses `django-phonenumber-field` to process phone number inputs.
2. Craft a malicious input string that is not a valid phone number but contains XSS payload, for example: `<script>alert('xss')</script>`.
3. Submit this malicious string as the phone number input through the identified endpoint.
4. Observe how the application handles and stores this invalid phone number.
5. Identify a page or API response where this stored phone number is rendered in the HTML output.
6. Check if the template rendering context disables autoescaping for this phone number output, or if the developer incorrectly marks the phone number as safe.
7. Access the page or API response in a browser and verify if the JavaScript code from the malicious payload is executed, typically by observing an alert box.

**Impact:**
High. The attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users’ browsers. This may lead to theft of session data, redirection to malicious sites, or further client‐side compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The code assumes that Django’s template engine (with autoescaping enabled by default) will safely escape output.
- There is no internal sanitization in the library itself because it expects caller code to handle output encoding.
- Input validation using `phonenumbers` library to ensure phone numbers are valid (but this does not prevent storing and rendering invalid input).
- Test suite covering various aspects of phone number handling and validation.
- Static analysis checks (ruff, mypy) in CI.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Explicit sanitization of the raw phone number input (e.g. filtering or encoding dangerous characters) within the `__str__` method.
- Documentation and/or warnings advising developers never to override autoescaping or to mark phone numbers as safe before proper sanitization.

**Preconditions:**
- An attacker must be able to submit a malicious phone number (via a public form or API).
- The application must render the phone number without proper autoescaping (for example, by disabling autoescaping or by using a “safe” filter on the phone number output).

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `phonenumber_field/phonenumber.py`, the `__str__` method is defined as follows:
  ```python
  def __str__(self):
      if self.is_valid():
          format_string = getattr(settings, "PHONENUMBER_DEFAULT_FORMAT", "E164")
          fmt = self.format_map[format_string]
          return self.format_as(fmt)
      else:
          return self.raw_input
  ```
- When an invalid phone number (i.e. one that does not pass the parser’s checks) is provided, the method simply returns the user‑supplied string without any sanitization.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup Test Environment:** Deploy a test Django application that uses `django-phonenumber-field` and renders phone numbers in templates. Ensure that in the vulnerable scenario, autoescaping is disabled or the phone number is marked as safe during rendering.
2. **Identify Target Endpoint:** Find a publicly accessible endpoint (e.g., user profile update form) that includes a phone number field.
3. **Craft Malicious Request:** Prepare a malicious phone number input like `<script>alert('xss')</script>`.
4. **Send Malicious Request:** Submit the crafted request to the application via the target endpoint.
5. **Trigger Rendering:** Navigate to or trigger the view that renders the stored phone number in HTML, ensuring autoescaping is disabled for this specific rendering context.
6. **Observe Browser Behavior:** Verify that the browser executes the injected JavaScript code, confirming the XSS vulnerability.

### Unpinned Dependency Versions Leading to Supply Chain Risk

**Description:**
The project’s dependency declarations in `pyproject.toml` use open‑ended version specifiers (for example, `Django>=4.2` and `phonenumbers >= 7.0.2`) rather than pinning to a known–good version or using a lock file. This configuration allows the automatic installation of any future version that satisfies the version constraints—even if such a version has not been vetted by the project maintainers. An attacker who compromises a dependency (or publishes a malicious version that meets the specifier) could thus inject malicious code into the application without the library’s authors’ knowledge.

**Step-by-step trigger:**
1. Identify the project's `pyproject.toml` or similar dependency declaration file.
2. Observe the use of open-ended version specifiers (e.g., `>=` or `>`) for dependencies like `Django` and `phonenumbers`.
3. Simulate a scenario where a malicious version of one of these dependencies becomes available in the public package repository, while still satisfying the open-ended version specifier.
4. Set up a fresh environment to install the project's dependencies.
5. During the dependency resolution process, the package manager (e.g., pip) might pick up the malicious version if it's the latest available within the specified range.
6. If the malicious dependency is installed, any code within the application that relies on this dependency could be compromised.

**Impact:**
High. A compromised dependency could lead to supply chain attacks including remote code execution, data exfiltration, or wider compromise of the production environment.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- The repository includes a Dependabot configuration (in `.github/dependabot.yml`) to help monitor and update GitHub Action dependencies, but the production dependency versions in `pyproject.toml` remain unpinned.
- Test suite covering aspects of the library's functionality indirectly mitigating by detecting unexpected behavior if a compromised dependency causes issues.
- Static analysis checks (ruff, mypy) in CI, which might detect some types of issues introduced by dependency updates, but are not specifically designed for supply chain security.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Pinning dependencies to exact versions or managing them with a lock file (such as via Poetry, Pipenv, or a generated requirements file) to ensure that only vetted versions are deployed.
- A formal dependency security review process to verify that updates within the allowed range do not introduce vulnerabilities.
- Regular dependency scanning and vulnerability checks using tools that identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

**Preconditions:**
- The application is deployed with an automated dependency resolver that picks the highest available version (or a malicious version) within the allowed range from the public repositories.
- No additional deployment–side dependency management (such as a locked requirements file) is in place to restrict the versions installed.
- The development environment or CI/CD pipeline also uses dependency resolution that is susceptible to picking up unvetted or malicious versions.

**Source Code Analysis:**
- In `pyproject.toml`, the project dependency section contains, for example:
  ```toml
  [project]
  dependencies = ["Django>=4.2"]

  [project.optional-dependencies]
  phonenumbers = ["phonenumbers >= 7.0.2"]
  ```
- There is no accompanying lock file in the repository to restrict the dependency versions.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup Test Environment:** Create a controlled environment for testing dependency installation, ideally isolated from production and development setups.
2. **Simulate Malicious Dependency:** In the test environment, simulate the availability of a “malicious” version of one of the dependencies (for example, a compromised version of the `phonenumbers` package) that still satisfies the version specifier (e.g., publish a higher version number than the currently used one). This might involve using a local package index or a controlled PyPI mirror.
3. **Fresh Installation:** Perform a fresh installation of the project in this environment using `pip install .` or similar, ensuring that the dependency resolver is allowed to access the simulated malicious package.
4. **Verify Malicious Version Installation:** Check the installed versions of the dependencies to confirm that the malicious version was indeed installed due to the open version specifiers. Tools like `pip list` or `pip show <dependency_name>` can be used.
5. **Run Application and Observe Behavior:** Run the application's test suite or exercise core functionality of `django‑phonenumber‑field` to detect any abnormal behavior or signs of compromise introduced by the malicious dependency. This might involve looking for unexpected code execution, altered output, or new log entries.
6. **Repeat with Version Pinning:** Repeat steps 3-5, but this time, modify the `pyproject.toml` to pin dependency versions to specific known-good versions (e.g., `Django==4.2.1`, `phonenumbers==7.0.2`). Verify that with pinned versions, the malicious package is no longer installed, and the application behaves as expected.
