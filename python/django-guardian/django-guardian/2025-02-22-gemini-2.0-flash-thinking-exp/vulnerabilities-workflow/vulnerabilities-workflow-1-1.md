### Insecure Direct Object Reference in Permission Checks

**Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Direct Object Reference in Permission Checks

**Description:**
If `django-guardian` is used in a way that relies on direct object IDs from URL parameters or request data to perform permission checks without proper validation of object ownership or access rights beyond the ID itself, an external attacker could potentially manipulate these object IDs to attempt to access or modify objects they are not authorized to interact with.

For example, consider an application using URLs like `/objects/<object_id>/edit/` and `django-guardian` checking permissions based on this `object_id`. If the permission check only verifies that the user has *some* permission on *an* object of that type, and not specifically on the object identified by `<object_id>`, an attacker could try to increment or decrement `<object_id>` to guess IDs of other objects and potentially gain unauthorized access to them.

**Step-by-step trigger:**
1. An attacker identifies a URL in the application that uses an object ID to access a resource protected by `django-guardian`, for example: `/documents/123/view/`.
2. The attacker understands that `django-guardian` is likely used to control access to these documents.
3. The attacker might have legitimate access to view document `123`.
4. The attacker then attempts to access other documents by modifying the `object_id` in the URL, for example, changing `123` to `124`, `125`, etc., or trying sequential IDs.
5. If `django-guardian` permission checks are not properly validating if the user is authorized to access the *specific* object ID requested (e.g., document `124`), but only checking if the user has *any* 'view_document' permission, the attacker might successfully bypass the intended access control and view document `124` even if they should not have permission for it.

**Impact:**
Unauthorized access to sensitive objects. This can lead to:
- **Data leakage:** Attackers can view confidential information they are not supposed to see.
- **Data modification:** In more severe cases, if the vulnerability exists in endpoints allowing modifications (e.g., `/objects/<object_id>/edit/`), attackers could modify or delete data they are not authorized to manage.
- **Integrity compromise:** Unauthorized modifications can compromise the integrity and reliability of the application's data.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
- None identified in `django-guardian` core related to preventing insecure direct object reference in application usage. `django-guardian` provides tools for permission checking, but the responsibility of correctly implementing secure object-level checks falls on the application developer.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- **Guidance and best practices in documentation:** `django-guardian` documentation should strongly emphasize the importance of implementing robust object-level permission checks that go beyond just checking for the existence of *a* permission and explicitly validate access to the *specific* object being accessed.
- **Example code snippets and patterns:** Provide examples of how to correctly use `django-guardian` to prevent insecure direct object references, showcasing how to validate object ownership or specific access rights within permission checks.

**Preconditions:**
- Application uses `django-guardian` for permission management.
- Application URLs or request data rely on direct object IDs to access resources.
- `django-guardian` permission checks in the application are not implemented to specifically validate access to the requested object ID, but instead rely on broader permission checks that might be bypassed by manipulating object IDs.

**Source Code Analysis:**
`django-guardian` itself does not inherently cause this vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from how developers *use* `django-guardian` in their applications.

Let's illustrate a vulnerable code pattern (example in Django view):

```python
# Vulnerable View Example (Conceptual - Not from django-guardian core)
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from django.http import HttpResponseForbidden
from guardian.decorators import permission_required

def document_view(request, document_id):
    document = get_object_or_404(Document, pk=document_id) # Get document by ID
    if not request.user.has_perm('view_document', document): # Check general 'view_document' permission
        return HttpResponseForbidden("You do not have permission to view this document.")
    return render(request, 'document_view.html', {'document': document})
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability in Example:**
1. The view retrieves a `Document` object based on `document_id` from the URL.
2. It then uses `request.user.has_perm('view_document', document)`.  While `has_perm` uses `django-guardian` to check permissions, if the `view_document` permission is granted too broadly (e.g., to all authenticated users or based on group membership without object-level context), it becomes vulnerable.
3. The issue is that `has_perm('view_document', document)` might only check if the user has *any* 'view_document' permission related to *documents* in general, but not specifically for *this* `document` object.
4. An attacker who has 'view_document' permission (perhaps for a different document) could potentially access *any* document by simply changing the `document_id` in the URL, as the permission check does not ensure they are authorized for *that specific document*.

**Corrected Code Pattern (Example):**

```python
# Mitigated View Example (Conceptual)
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from django.http import HttpResponseForbidden
from guardian.decorators import permission_required

def document_view(request, document_id):
    document = get_object_or_404(Document, pk=document_id)
    if not request.user.has_perm('view_document', document): # Still using has_perm
        return HttpResponseForbidden("You do not have permission to view this document.")
    # ADDITIONALLY, perform object-level check if needed, depending on application logic
    # For example, check if document belongs to user's organization, etc.
    if not document.organization in request.user.organizations.all(): # Example object-level check
        return HttpResponseForbidden("You do not have permission to view documents from this organization.")
    return render(request, 'document_view.html', {'document': document})
```

**Explanation of Mitigation:**
- The corrected example *adds* an explicit object-level check after the `django-guardian` permission check.
- `document.organization in request.user.organizations.all()` is a placeholder for a more specific application-dependent check.  This check ensures that even if the user has a general 'view_document' permission, they are still only allowed to view documents belonging to their organization.
- The specific object-level check will vary based on the application's access control requirements.  It might involve checking object ownership, group membership related to the object, or other relevant criteria.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Setup:** Create two users, User A and User B. Create two Document objects, Document 1 (ID: 1) and Document 2 (ID: 2). Configure permissions such that User A should only have 'view_document' permission for Document 1, and User B should not have 'view_document' permission for either document (or has 'view_document' for a different document, ID: 3, for example, to simulate a user with some legitimate permission).
2. **Login as User A.**
3. **Access Document 1:** Navigate to `/documents/1/view/`. Verify that User A can successfully view Document 1.
4. **Attempt to access Document 2:** Navigate to `/documents/2/view/`.
5. **Expected Result:** User A should *not* be able to view Document 2. The application should either return a 403 Forbidden error or redirect to a permission denied page. If User A *can* view Document 2, it indicates an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability.
6. **Login as User B.**
7. **Attempt to access Document 1 and Document 2:** Navigate to `/documents/1/view/` and `/documents/2/view/`.
8. **Expected Result:** User B should *not* be able to view either Document 1 or Document 2.  If User B *can* view either document, it further confirms the Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability and highlights a broader permission bypass.
