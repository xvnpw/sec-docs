## Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability: Insecure Default Configuration in Example Project Settings (DEBUG True & Weak SECRET_KEY)**
  - **Description:**
    The example project’s settings file defines dangerous defaults that could easily be left unmodified when deploying to production. In particular:
    - `DEBUG` is set to `True`, which causes full stack traces and sensitive configuration details to be exposed when errors occur.
    - `SECRET_KEY` is hard-coded to a weak placeholder value (for example, `'CHANGE_THIS_TO_SOMETHING_UNIQUE_AND_SECURE'`) that is predictable.
    An external attacker can deliberately trigger errors (or otherwise exploit debugging output) to extract sensitive internal details and may compromise session integrity because all signing is done using this insecure key.
  - **Impact:**
    - Disclosure of sensitive application and configuration details via debug error pages.
    - Increased risk of session hijacking, cryptographic attacks, and unauthorized access due to the use of a predictable secret key.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Inline comments and documentation in the settings file advise developers to change the default secret key.
    - The insecure defaults are intended solely as a starting point for development, not for a production environment.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No runtime enforcement (for example, through environment‑based configuration or production startup checks) that prevents running with `DEBUG=True` or with the weak default secret key.
    - No fallback mechanism to automatically load a secure, random key from environment variables when deployed in production.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed in a production or publicly accessible environment without overriding the default insecure configuration values.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In the example project’s settings file (e.g. `/code/example_project/settings.py`), you will see the following:
      ```python
      DEBUG = True
      SECRET_KEY = 'CHANGE_THIS_TO_SOMETHING_UNIQUE_AND_SECURE'
      ```
    - No runtime or startup-time checks ensure that these values have been overridden before deployment.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the project “as is” without modifying the `DEBUG` and `SECRET_KEY` settings.
    2. Navigate to a URL known to trigger an exception or internal error.
    3. Confirm that the error page displays a full stack trace along with internal configuration details.
    4. Inspect session cookies and any signed tokens to verify that they are signed using the known default (and insecure) secret key.
    5. A positive result confirms that an attacker could exploit these defaults to gather sensitive information or compromise session integrity.

- **Vulnerability: Orphaned Object Permissions Leading to Unauthorized Access**
  - **Description:**
    The object‑level permission system is implemented using generic associations—permission records are stored with fields such as `object_pk` and are not tightly bound via enforced foreign key constraints to the target objects. This design means that when a target object or user/group is deleted, its corresponding permission records are not automatically removed. If a new object (or user/group) is later created and receives an identifier that collides with a deleted one, the orphaned permission records may inadvertently grant access to this new entity.
  - **Impact:**
    - An attacker with the capability to trigger or influence deletion operations could indirectly cause stale permissions to apply to a new object.
    - Sensitive resources might be exposed or operations performed without proper authorization if orphaned permission entries persist.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The documentation alerts developers to the risk and recommends manually connecting Django signals or invoking manual cleanup routines.
    - A management command (`clean_orphan_obj_perms`) is provided to allow system administrators to remove orphaned permission entries.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no built‑in automatic cascading or background cleanup process that prevents orphaned permission records from persisting.
    - No runtime signals or scheduled tasks are installed by default to enforce the removal of orphaned permission entries.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An object (or user/group) that has object‑level permissions is deleted without its associated permission records being removed.
    - Subsequently, a new object (or user/group) is created that reuses the same primary key or identifier used before, leading to an unintended permission grant.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In the guardian code (see `/code/guardian/utils.py`), the function `clean_orphan_obj_perms()` iterates over permission records:
      ```python
      for perm in chain(UserObjectPermission.objects.all().iterator(),
                        GroupObjectPermission.objects.all().iterator()):
          if perm.content_object is None:
              logger.debug("Removing %s (pk=%d)" % (perm, perm.pk))
              perm.delete()
      ```
    - Because the deletion of the target object does not automatically cascade to delete the associated generic permission record, these “orphaned” entries continue to exist until manually cleaned.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled test environment, create an object (or user/group) and assign it an object‑level permission.
    2. Delete that object (or user/group) using Django’s ORM so that the permission record remains.
    3. Manually create (or force the creation of) a new object (or user/group) with the same identifier as the deleted one.
    4. Log in using the credentials that originally held the permission and attempt to access or operate on the new object.
    5. If the permission check erroneously grants access, the vulnerability has been successfully reproduced.

- **Vulnerability: Unverified Monkey Patching of User and Group Models**
  - **Description:**
    To support object‑level permissions easily, the library performs monkey patching on Django’s User and Group models at runtime. This is done by directly assigning convenience methods (e.g. `get_anonymous`, `add_obj_perm`, `del_obj_perm`) to the model classes without performing any subsequent integrity or authenticity verifications. If an attacker (or an insider with write access to the deployment) manages to influence the module load order or modify the patched methods on disk, they could replace or alter the permission-checking functionality.
  - **Impact:**
    - An attacker could override these critical methods to assign or revoke permissions without proper verification, thereby bypassing authorization checks.
    - Such an exploit could lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access across the application.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The patching behavior is controlled by configuration settings (e.g. `GUARDIAN_MONKEY_PATCH_USER` and `GUARDIAN_MONKEY_PATCH_GROUP`), which allow administrators to disable monkey patching.
    - The patching is executed only once during application startup.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no runtime integrity verification of the patched methods after they are applied.
    - No built‑in safeguards (for example, cryptographic signing or rigorous hash checking) exist to detect if the patched functions have been altered during runtime.
    - The system relies solely on external filesystem and deployment security, with no internal defense against patch manipulation.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed with monkey patching enabled (the default is typically enabled when not explicitly disabled).
    - An attacker is able to influence module load order or modify files on disk (via a compromised dependency or misconfigured file permissions) such that the patched methods can be replaced or altered.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In the library’s initialization code (for example, in files such as `guardian/__init__.py` and `guardian/apps.py`), the patching is implemented as follows:
      ```python
      setattr(User, 'get_anonymous', staticmethod(lambda: get_anonymous_user()))
      setattr(User, 'add_obj_perm', lambda self, perm, obj: UserObjectPermission.objects.assign_perm(perm, self, obj))
      setattr(User, 'del_obj_perm', lambda self, perm, obj: UserObjectPermission.objects.remove_perm(perm, self, obj))
      ```
    - No later verification or integrity check is performed, meaning that if these attributes are altered after startup, the system will use the modified (and possibly insecure) implementations.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application in a controlled environment with monkey patching enabled.
    2. Verify that the User model contains the expected methods by calling, for example, `user.add_obj_perm` and confirming the normal behavior.
    3. Manually (or via a simulated attack) reassign one of the patched methods—for instance, override `User.add_obj_perm` with a function that always returns success without performing any permission checks.
    4. Attempt to use this altered method to assign a permission to a sensitive object.
    5. If the permission check is bypassed, this confirms that the lack of runtime integrity verification in the monkey patching mechanism exposes a critical vulnerability.
