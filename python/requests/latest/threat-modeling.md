|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 0001      | SSL/TLS Certificate Verification | An attacker could present an invalid SSL/TLS certificate to spoof a server and intercept sensitive data.    | Spoofing            | The library communicates over HTTPS and must verify server certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.                                     | By default, `requests` verifies SSL/TLS certificates when making HTTPS requests. Users can disable verification, which poses a security risk.      | Enforce certificate verification by default and discourage disabling it. Provide clear warnings or deprecate the ability to disable verification (`verify=False`). | Medium. Users may disable SSL verification due to misconfiguration or to bypass certificate errors, increasing the risk of MITM attacks.                             | High. Without proper certificate verification, attackers can perform MITM attacks, leading to data interception or modification, compromising sensitive information. | High          |
| 0002      | Logging Mechanism   | Sensitive information like credentials could be logged inadvertently, leading to information disclosure.    | Information Disclosure | The library may log request and response data for debugging purposes, which might include sensitive credentials or tokens.                                | `requests` avoids logging sensitive headers like `Authorization` by default. However, improper custom logging or debugging practices may expose such data.          | Ensure that sensitive information is masked or omitted in logs. Update documentation to warn users against logging sensitive data and provide best practices for secure logging. | Medium. Developers may introduce custom logging without properly handling sensitive data, especially during debugging sessions.                                    | Medium. Exposure of credentials in logs can lead to unauthorized access if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties or stored insecurely.                           | Medium        |
| 0003      | Dependency Management | An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in third-party modules used by the library to execute malicious code. | Tampering           | The library relies on third-party modules like `urllib3` and `chardet`, which may have vulnerabilities if not properly managed or updated.               | Dependencies are specified with version ranges in `setup.cfg`. However, if outdated or vulnerable versions are used, it may introduce risks.       | Implement strict dependency versioning with regular updates. Use tools like `pip freeze` to lock dependencies. Monitor and patch known vulnerabilities promptly.     | Low. The library maintainers regularly update dependencies, but users may not update to the latest versions promptly or may override dependency versions.            | High. Exploits in dependencies could lead to remote code execution or other severe security breaches impacting all users of the library.                             | Medium        |
| 0004      | HTTP Redirect Handling | An attacker could manipulate redirects to send requests to malicious servers or steal credentials via open redirects. | Redirect Tampering  | The library automatically handles HTTP redirects, which could be exploited if redirects are not properly validated or if headers like `Authorization` are improperly forwarded. | `requests` removes sensitive headers like `Authorization` when redirecting to a different host. Past vulnerabilities have addressed issues with credential leakage during redirects. | Continue to enforce strict handling of redirects, ensuring sensitive headers are not forwarded to untrusted domains. Educate users on the risks of open redirects and provide options to control redirect behavior. | Low. The library has mechanisms in place, but there is potential for misconfiguration or future vulnerabilities.                                                      | Medium. If credentials are exposed through redirects, it could lead to unauthorized access and compromise of user accounts.                                           | Low           |
| 0005      | Input Data Handling | Malicious input could lead to injection attacks if the library constructs requests without proper sanitization. | Injection           | Users may pass untrusted input to the library, which if not properly handled, could result in command injection, header injection, or other vulnerabilities. | The library constructs HTTP requests using provided parameters but does not execute them in a context where command injection is a risk. However, improper usage or extensions might introduce risks. | Validate and sanitize input parameters. Provide guidance to users on safe parameter handling. Review code to ensure that it is not susceptible to injection when constructing requests. | Low. The library itself is unlikely to be directly vulnerable, but improper extensions or misuse could introduce risks.                                              | High. Successful injection attacks could compromise systems, lead to data breaches, or enable further attacks.                                                      | Medium        |
| 0006      | Configuration Files Access | Unauthorized access to configuration files like `.netrc` can expose credentials stored on the system.          | Information Disclosure | The library reads configuration files for authentication, which may contain sensitive credentials. If access controls are inadequate, these files could be read by unauthorized users. | File access follows the permissions of the user running the application. The library does not change file permissions or enforce strict access controls. | Recommend users to set proper file permissions on configuration files. Update documentation with security best practices for storing credentials. Consider warnings when files have insecure permissions. | Medium. Users may neglect to secure configuration files, especially in shared or multi-user environments.                                                            | Medium. Exposure of credentials can lead to unauthorized access and compromise of services the credentials protect.                                                  | Medium        |
| 0007      | Test Code          | Malicious code injection in test scripts leading to code execution                                          | Tampering           | Test scripts are part of the codebase and could be modified to include malicious code that executes during testing.                                   | Test code is stored in the same repository with access controls and code reviews. However, tests may receive less scrutiny than production code.  | Enforce strict access controls and code reviews for test code changes. Implement automated code analysis and security scanning for test scripts.                     | Medium. While access controls exist, test code may be less rigorously reviewed, increasing the chance of malicious code being introduced.                            | High. Malicious test code could execute during testing, leading to unauthorized code execution, data leakage, or compromised build artifacts.                        | High          |

| 0001      | Package Repository  | An attacker could upload a malicious package with the same name to a repository, causing users to install it. | Public repositories may be susceptible to typosquatting or malicious uploads if proper controls are not in place.                    | PyPI enforces ownership and uses mechanisms like verified email addresses.                                                | Encourage users to verify package sources. Implement package signing and verification (e.g., PGP signatures). Monitor repositories for malicious packages. | Medium. While repositories have safeguards, attackers may still succeed in uploading malicious packages or exploiting typosquatting opportunities. | High. Installation of a malicious package can lead to code execution, data exfiltration, and widespread compromise of systems using the library. | High          |
| 0002      | Distribution Channel | Man-in-the-middle attack during package download could lead to installation of tampered packages.         | Users downloading packages over insecure channels (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS) may be vulnerable to interception and tampering.     | Official repositories like PyPI enforce HTTPS connections. However, some users may configure tools to use insecure protocols or repositories. | Enforce HTTPS connections for package downloads. Provide checksums or hashes for package verification. Educate users on configuring package managers securely. | Low. Most package managers default to secure protocols, but misconfigurations or use of alternative repositories increase risk.                   | High. Tampered packages can introduce malware, leading to severe security breaches in user environments.                                         | Medium        |
| 0003      | Versioning and Metadata | An attacker could trick users into installing an outdated or vulnerable version by manipulating metadata. | If versioning metadata is manipulated, users may inadvertently install versions with known vulnerabilities.                         | Package repositories manage metadata, but cache poisoning or metadata manipulation attacks could occur.                   | Implement package metadata validation. Encourage users to specify exact versions or use tools that verify package integrity. Provide release notes highlighting security fixes. | Low. Such attacks are complex and repositories have protections, but they are not impossible.                                                   | Medium. Using outdated versions leaves users vulnerable to known exploits, potentially leading to system compromise.                             | Low           |

| 0001      | Source Code Repository | An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the source code repository and inject malicious code.   | The repository may be targeted to insert backdoors or vulnerabilities directly into the codebase.                                  | Access controls, authentication mechanisms, and logging are in place for the repository. Pull requests and code reviews are required for changes. | Enforce strict access permissions. Require code reviews and approvals for all changes. Implement automated security scanning of code and dependencies. | Low. Compromising a well-secured repository requires significant effort, but insider threats or credential compromises pose risks.               | High. Malicious code in the source could be distributed to all users, leading to widespread security incidents.                                  | Medium        |
| 0002      | Build Environment   | Insecure build environment might allow an attacker to tamper with build artifacts or inject code.     | Build systems could be compromised if not properly secured, leading to the production of malicious packages.                      | Build processes are defined in configuration files and may use CI services with their own security measures.               | Secure build environments with limited access. Use isolated and reproducible builds. Regularly update and patch build tools. Monitor for suspicious activity during builds. | Medium. Build environments may be targeted, especially in open-source projects with multiple contributors and public CI systems.                | High. Compromised build artifacts can result in distributing malicious versions to all users, severely impacting security.                     | High          |
| 0003      | Dependency Management | Build process could include malicious dependencies compromising the build output.                      | Dependencies specified in configuration may be tampered with or include vulnerabilities if not properly controlled.                | Dependencies are managed via `setup.cfg` with specified versions. However, dependencies themselves may have vulnerabilities. | Use dependency locking and verification tools. Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities. Configure builds to use trusted sources for dependencies. | Medium. The risk depends on the practices for dependency management and the security of dependency sources.                                      | Medium. Vulnerable or malicious dependencies can compromise the library and its users, leading to code execution or data breaches.             | Medium        |
| 0004      | Build Environment   | Execution of malicious test code during the build process                                            | Test scripts are executed during the build; if compromised, they could execute malicious code affecting the build environment     | Build processes include running tests, but may not isolate test execution or verify test code integrity                     | Run tests in isolated environments (e.g., containers or virtual machines). Implement code signing or checksums for test code to detect tampering | Medium. The build environment relies on test code, which could be modified if not adequately protected                                          | High. Malicious test code execution during the build could lead to compromised build artifacts, unauthorized access, or supply chain attacks.  | High          |
