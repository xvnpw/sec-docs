# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Requests project aims to provide a simple, yet elegant HTTP library for Python, enabling developers to send HTTP/1.1 requests effortlessly. The primary goal is to simplify HTTP client operations, making it accessible and user-friendly for Python programmers.

Important business risks that need to be addressed include:

- Ensuring security and privacy in HTTP communications, as Requests may be used in applications that handle sensitive data.
- Maintaining compatibility with evolving web standards and Python versions.
- Preserving the trust and reliability of the library, given its widespread use in over 1,000,000 repositories.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: SSL/TLS certificate verification using `certifi` CA bundle.
- security control: Support for secure protocols and configurations (e.g., SSLContext).
- security control: Protection against insecure TLS versions and ciphers.
- security control: Deprecation of insecure HTTP methods and schemes.
- security control: Handling of sensitive data such as authentication credentials to prevent leakage (e.g., removal of Authorization headers on redirects).
- security control: Vulnerability disclosure process outlined in `SECURITY.md`.
- security control: Comprehensive test suite covering various security aspects.

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Dependency on external libraries (e.g., `urllib3`, `chardet`/`charset_normalizer`) which may introduce vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Potential misuse by developers leading to insecure configurations (e.g., setting `verify=False`).
- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party CA certificates which may be compromised.

Recommended high priority security controls:

- security control: Implement stricter default security configurations to minimize insecure usage.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches.
- security control: Enhance documentation to highlight best security practices.
- security control: Implement additional automated security checks in the build process.
- security control: Increase test coverage for edge cases and security vulnerabilities, including testing for improper handling of redirects, cookies, and authentication.

Security requirements:

**Authentication:**

- Should support secure authentication methods, including Basic, Digest, and OAuth.
- Should securely handle credentials and avoid exposing them in logs or error messages.

**Authorization:**

- Should ensure that HTTP methods and headers are correctly handled.
- Should not interfere with application-level authorization mechanisms.

**Input Validation:**

- Should validate and sanitize URLs and headers to prevent injection attacks.
- Should handle invalid inputs gracefully without crashing or exposing sensitive information.

**Cryptography:**

- Should use up-to-date cryptographic libraries and standards.
- Should ensure proper SSL/TLS configurations, supporting strong ciphers and protocols.
- Should validate certificates and provide warnings or errors for invalid certificates.

Implementation references:

- SSL/TLS verification is implemented in `requests.adapters` module (`cert_verify` method).
- Certificate bundle is provided via `requests.certs` module using `certifi`.
- Removal of Authorization headers on redirects is handled in `requests.sessions.SessionRedirectMixin.rebuild_auth`.
- Authentication methods are implemented in `requests.auth` module.
- Security tests are implemented in `tests/test_requests.py` and other test modules.
