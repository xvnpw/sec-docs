# Threat Modeling Analysis for the Project 'Requests' Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

**Requests** is a widely-used Python HTTP library designed to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. It abstracts the complexities of making HTTP requests behind a simple and intuitive API, allowing developers to interact with web services and consume data in their applications effortlessly.

### Key Components and Features

- **Session Handling**: Manages persistent sessions, maintaining cookies across requests to the same host.
- **HTTP Methods**: Supports all standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `PATCH`.
- **Authentication**: Provides built-in support for HTTP Basic and Digest Authentication, as well as integration with other authentication mechanisms.
- **Proxy Support**: Allows configuration of proxies for network requests, including support for proxy authentication.
- **SSL Verification**: Handles SSL certificate verification, supports custom SSL contexts, and allows disabling verification (not recommended).
- **File Uploads**: Simplifies multipart file uploads.
- **Custom Headers and Parameters**: Enables setting custom headers and query parameters for requests.
- **Response Handling**: Provides a rich `Response` object with content decoding, JSON parsing, status codes, and more.

### Dependencies

- **urllib3**: Utilized for advanced HTTP functionalities like connection pooling and thread safety.
- **Certifi**: Provides Mozilla's CA Bundle for secure SSL certificate verification.
- **Charset-Normalizer / Chardet**: Used for character encoding detection in responses.
- **idna**: Handles internationalized domain names as per RFC 5891.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective**:

- To **compromise systems using the 'Requests' library** by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the library itself, leading to unauthorized access, execution of malicious code, exfiltration of sensitive data, or compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the user's system or data.

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Inject Malicious Code into the 'Requests' Library**.
2. **Exploit Existing Vulnerabilities in the 'Requests' Library**.
3. **Compromise Distribution Channels (e.g., PyPI, GitHub Repository)**.
4. **Leverage Misconfigurations or Insecure Implementations by Users of the 'Requests' Library**.
5. **Exploit Insecure Recommendations in Documentation Leading to Vulnerable Implementations by Users**.

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

1. **Leverage Misconfigurations or Insecure Implementations by Users (Node 4)**

   - **Justification**: Users following insecure examples in documentation (Node 4.4) and disabling SSL verification (Node 4.1) create significant vulnerabilities. The likelihood is high due to user behavior influenced by documentation, and the impact is high as attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform MitM attacks or data exfiltration.

2. **Exploit Insecure Recommendations in Documentation (Node 5)**

   - **Justification**: Documentation that suggests insecure practices (Node 5.1.1) directly leads users to implement vulnerable code. Attackers can easily exploit these implementations (Node 5.2), leading to severe security breaches.

### Critical Nodes

- **Users Follow Insecure Examples in Documentation (Node 4.4)**

  - **Mitigation Impact**: Addressing this node by improving documentation can significantly reduce the risk of widespread insecure implementations.

- **User Disables SSL Verification (Node 4.1.1 and Node 5.1.1)**

  - **Mitigation Impact**: Preventing or discouraging disabling SSL verification can minimize the risk of MitM attacks.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

- **Improve Documentation Quality and Security**

  - **Implementation**: Review and update all documentation to ensure that examples follow best security practices. Remove insecure code snippets, such as those disabling SSL verification or using hardcoded credentials. Add warnings about the risks of certain configurations and emphasize secure defaults.

- **Enforce SSL Verification**

  - **Implementation**: Deprecate or remove the ability to disable SSL verification. If disabling is necessary for testing purposes, ensure that it is clearly marked as insecure, and discourage its use in production code.

- **User Education and Awareness**

  - **Implementation**: Provide guidance on secure implementation practices. Offer tutorials or resources on the importance of SSL verification, proper timeout settings, and secure proxy configuration.

- **Code Analysis and Warnings**

  - **Implementation**: Implement code analysis tools that can detect insecure configurations, such as 'verify=False', and warn developers during development or deployment.

- **Secure Proxy Configuration**

  - **Implementation**: Validate proxy configurations within the library to ensure they meet security standards. Warn users when configuring proxies that could expose data to potential interception.

- **Enhance Security in Examples and Tutorials**

  - **Implementation**: Ensure all examples in documentation and tutorials use secure coding practices, including proper error handling, secure authentication methods, and avoidance of hardcoded credentials.

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified

- **Users Implementing Insecure Code Based on Documentation**

  - High likelihood of users following insecure examples, leading to vulnerabilities such as MitM attacks due to disabled SSL verification.

- **Exploitation of Misconfigurations**

  - Attackers leveraging common misconfigurations like insecure proxy settings or improper session handling to compromise systems.

### Recommended Actions

- **Revise Documentation to Promote Security**

  - Update all documentation to eliminate insecure examples and emphasize secure coding practices.

- **Enhance Security Features**

  - Enforce SSL verification and provide clear warnings about the risks of disabling it.

- **Educate Users**

  - Provide resources and training on secure implementation of the library.

- **Implement Protective Measures**

  - Integrate code analysis tools to detect and warn against insecure configurations during development.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

### Questions

- **Are there plans to review and update the documentation to remove insecure examples?**

- **What measures are currently in place to prevent users from disabling critical security features like SSL verification?**

- **How frequently is the documentation audited for security compliance?**

### Assumptions

- **Assuming Users Rely Heavily on Official Documentation**

  - It is assumed that users frequently refer to official documentation and may copy code examples directly.

- **Assuming Current Documentation Contains Insecure Examples**

  - Based on the PROJECT FILES provided, it is assumed that some examples in the documentation suggest insecure practices.

- **Assuming No Existing Warnings on Insecure Configurations**

  - It is assumed that the library does not currently provide warnings or preventions against insecure configurations like disabling SSL verification.
