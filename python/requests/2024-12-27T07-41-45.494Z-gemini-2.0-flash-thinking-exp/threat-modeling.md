## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving the `requests` Library

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the use of the `requests` library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected `requests` Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) due to Disabled SSL/TLS Verification** | An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the remote server. If `verify=False` is used in `requests` calls, the application trusts any certificate presented, allowing the attacker to impersonate the server and eavesdrop or modify communication. | **Data Breach:** Sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or personal information can be stolen. **Data Tampering:**  The attacker can modify requests or responses, leading to incorrect application behavior or malicious actions. | `requests` functions using the `verify` parameter (e.g., `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`). Specifically, when `verify=False`. | **Critical** | **Always use `verify=True` in production.** Ensure the system has up-to-date CA certificates. If connecting to internal servers with self-signed certificates, use the `cert` parameter to specify the trusted certificate. |
| **Header Injection leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** | An attacker injects malicious data into HTTP headers (e.g., `Host`, `X-Forwarded-For`) if the application constructs headers based on user input without proper sanitization and then uses these headers in `requests` calls. This can force the application to make requests to internal or unintended external resources. | **Internal Network Access:** The attacker can access internal services or resources not exposed to the internet. **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can retrieve sensitive data from internal systems. **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can overload internal services. | `requests` functions where the `headers` argument is constructed using unsanitized user input. | **High** | **Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided data before including it in headers.** Avoid directly using user input to construct headers. Use parameterized requests or dedicated header construction methods. |
| **Data Injection via Unvalidated Input in Requests** | An attacker injects malicious data into request parameters (GET or POST) if the application doesn't validate and sanitize user-provided input before passing it to the `params` or `data` arguments in `requests` calls. | **Remote Code Execution (potentially):** Depending on the remote server's vulnerabilities, injected data could lead to code execution. **Data Corruption:** Injected data could corrupt data on the remote server. **Application Logic Bypass:** Attackers might manipulate data to bypass intended application logic. | `requests` functions where data is passed through the `params` or `data` arguments using unsanitized user input. | **High** | **Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before including it in requests.** Use parameterized requests where possible. Follow the principle of least privilege when interacting with external APIs. |
| **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Request Parameters or Headers** | Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (API keys, credentials, personal data) in request parameters (especially GET requests) or headers when making `requests` calls without proper protection. This data can be exposed in logs, browser history, or through network interception. | **Data Breach:** Sensitive credentials or personal information can be compromised. | `requests` functions where sensitive data is directly included in the `params` argument (for GET requests) or in the `headers` dictionary. | **High** | **Avoid including sensitive data in GET request parameters.** Use POST requests with encrypted connections (HTTPS) for sensitive data. Store sensitive credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables or secrets management). |
| **Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Requests** | If the application makes a large number of requests to an external service using `requests` without proper rate limiting or timeouts, it can overwhelm the external service or consume excessive resources on the application's side, leading to a denial of service. | **Denial of Service (DoS):** The application or the external service becomes unavailable. | `requests` functions used in loops or automated processes without proper controls. | **High** | **Implement appropriate timeouts for `requests` calls.** Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies when interacting with external services. Consider using asynchronous requests to avoid blocking. Monitor resource usage. |

**Important Considerations:**

* This list focuses on high and critical threats directly related to the `requests` library.
* Always prioritize addressing these high-severity threats.
* Ensure regular security reviews and updates to the `requests` library.
