## High and Critical Facenet Specific Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the `facenet` library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected Facenet Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Adversarial Example Attack Bypassing Recognition** | An attacker crafts subtle, often imperceptible, modifications to a facial image that cause the `facenet` model to misclassify it. This could be used to impersonate another user or gain unauthorized access if facial recognition is used for authentication. | Authentication bypass, unauthorized access to resources or data, impersonation. | `facenet.src.facenet.load_model()`, `facenet.src.facenet.get_embedding()`, the underlying TensorFlow graph and model weights. | High | - Implement liveness detection mechanisms to ensure the input is a live person and not a static image or video. - Consider using multiple biometric factors for authentication. - Research and potentially implement adversarial defense techniques (though these are still an active research area and may have limitations). - Regularly retrain or fine-tune the `facenet` model with diverse and potentially adversarial examples. |
| **Exploiting Model Bias for Targeted Attacks** | An attacker understands the biases present in the pre-trained `facenet` model (e.g., lower accuracy for certain demographics) and leverages this knowledge to craft attacks specifically targeting individuals from those groups. This could lead to denial of service (false negatives) or impersonation (false positives). | Denial of service for specific user groups, successful impersonation of individuals from vulnerable demographics. | The pre-trained `facenet` model weights and architecture. | High | - Evaluate the model's performance on diverse datasets relevant to your user base to identify potential biases. - Consider fine-tuning the model on your specific data to mitigate biases. - Be transparent about potential limitations and biases of the system. - Implement fallback mechanisms or alternative authentication methods for users who might be negatively affected by model bias. |
