# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
1. **API Keys**: Sensitive keys for OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic that are used to authenticate requests to LLM providers.
2. **User Input Data**: Data provided by users through GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments that may contain sensitive information.
3. **Fabric Patterns**: The patterns used by the Fabric Agent Action to process user requests and generate outputs.
4. **Output Files**: Files generated by the action that may contain processed data or results from LLM interactions.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **GitHub Repository**: The boundary between the trusted environment (repository) and untrusted external users who can create issues or pull requests.
2. **LLM Providers**: The boundary between the application and external LLM services (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic) that process user data.
3. **Local Environment**: The boundary between the application running in the GitHub Actions environment and the local development environment where patterns are updated.

## DATA FLOWS
1. **User Input to GitHub Action**: Data flows from user comments/issues to the GitHub Action.
2. **GitHub Action to LLM Providers**: Data flows from the GitHub Action to the LLM providers for processing.
3. **LLM Providers to GitHub Action**: Processed data flows back from LLM providers to the GitHub Action.
4. **GitHub Action to Output Files**: The final output is written to files in the repository.

## APPLICATION THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0001 | GitHub Action | Unauthorized access to API keys | Spoofing | If API keys are exposed, unauthorized users can access LLM services. | API keys are stored in GitHub secrets. | Use environment variables to store sensitive data securely. Regularly rotate keys. | Medium | Unauthorized access could lead to significant costs and data exposure. | High |
| 0002 | User Input | Sensitive data exposure | Information Disclosure | User input may contain sensitive information that could be exposed in output files. | Input is processed without modification, but output may still leak sensitive data. | Implement data sanitization and validation to filter out sensitive information. | Medium | Exposure of sensitive data could lead to privacy violations. | High |
| 0003 | Fabric Patterns | Manipulation of patterns | Tampering | An attacker could modify patterns to produce harmful outputs. | Patterns are fetched from a trusted repository. | Implement integrity checks (e.g., hash verification) on patterns. | Low | Tampering could lead to incorrect or harmful outputs. | Medium |
| 0004 | Output Files | Unauthorized access to output files | Spoofing | Output files may contain sensitive information that should not be publicly accessible. | Output files are generated in a controlled environment. | Set appropriate permissions on output files to restrict access. | Medium | Unauthorized access could lead to data leaks. | High |
| 0005 | LLM Providers | Data interception during transmission | Tampering | Data sent to and from LLM providers could be intercepted. | Use HTTPS for all communications with LLM providers. | Ensure all API calls are made over secure channels. | Medium | Interception could lead to data leaks or manipulation. | High |

# DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

## DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURES
1. **GitHub Actions**: The primary deployment architecture where the Fabric Agent Action runs.
2. **Docker Container**: The action is packaged as a Docker container, which may introduce additional risks.

## ASSETS
1. **Docker Image**: The Docker image that contains the Fabric Agent Action code and dependencies.
2. **GitHub Actions Workflows**: The YAML files that define the workflows for running the action.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **Docker Registry**: The boundary between the trusted environment (GitHub Actions) and the Docker registry where images are stored.
2. **GitHub Actions Environment**: The boundary between the GitHub Actions environment and external contributors who can trigger workflows.

## DEPLOYMENT THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0001 | Docker Image | Vulnerable dependencies | Vulnerabilities in dependencies could be exploited. | Regular updates and security checks on dependencies. | Use tools like Dependabot to automate dependency updates. | Medium | Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access or data leaks. | High |
| 0002 | GitHub Actions | Unauthorized workflow execution | Malicious users could trigger workflows to execute harmful actions. | Use access controls and conditions in workflows. | Implement strict permissions and validate inputs to workflows. | Medium | Unauthorized execution could lead to data loss or corruption. | High |
| 0003 | Docker Registry | Image tampering | An attacker could replace the Docker image with a malicious version. | Use signed images and verify signatures before deployment. | Implement image scanning and validation processes. | Low | Tampering could lead to the execution of malicious code. | Critical |

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
1. **Source Code**: The codebase that is built and published.
2. **Build Configuration**: Configuration files that define the build process (e.g., Dockerfile, CI/CD scripts).

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **Source Control**: The boundary between the trusted source control environment and external contributors.
2. **Build Environment**: The boundary between the build environment and external dependencies.

| 0001 | Source Code | Supply chain attack | An attacker could introduce malicious code into the repository. | Code reviews and automated testing. | Implement strict code review processes and use automated security scanning tools. | Medium | Malicious code could lead to data breaches or system compromise. | Critical |
| 0002 | Build Configuration | Misconfiguration | Incorrect configurations could lead to insecure builds. | Regular audits of build configurations. | Implement automated checks for configuration best practices. | Medium | Misconfiguration could lead to vulnerabilities in the deployed application. | High |
| 0003 | Build Environment | Dependency vulnerabilities | Vulnerabilities in build dependencies could be exploited. | Use tools to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies. | Regularly update dependencies and use tools like Snyk or Dependabot. | Medium | Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access or data leaks. | High |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
1. What are the specific security requirements for the API keys used in the application?
2. Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered?
3. What is the expected threat landscape for the application, and how often should the threat model be reviewed?
4. Assumption: The application will be deployed in a secure environment with controlled access to sensitive data.
5. Assumption: All external dependencies are regularly monitored for vulnerabilities.

This threat model provides a comprehensive overview of the potential risks associated with the Fabric Agent Action, focusing on application, deployment, and build processes. It highlights the importance of implementing security controls and best practices to mitigate identified threats.
