# Threat Modeling Analysis for Fabric Agent Action Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

**Fabric Agent Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automate complex workflows using an agent-based approach. It leverages Fabric Patterns and Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently select and execute patterns. The project is built with LangGraph and supports multiple LLM providers like OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic.

### Key Components and Features

- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates into existing workflows.
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Supports OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic.
- **Configurable Agents**: Offers different agent types (`router`, `react`, `react_issue`, `react_pr`) with customizable behavior.
- **Pattern Management**: Allows inclusion or exclusion of specific Fabric Patterns.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.11
- LangGraph and related libraries
- Docker for containerized execution

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree
