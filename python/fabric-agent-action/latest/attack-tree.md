# Threat Modeling Analysis for Fabric Agent Action Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

**Fabric Agent Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automate complex workflows using an agent-based approach. It leverages Fabric Patterns and Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently select and execute patterns. The project is built with LangGraph and supports multiple LLM providers like OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic.

### Key Components and Features

- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates into existing workflows.
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Supports OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic.
- **Configurable Agents**: Offers different agent types (`router`, `react`, `react_issue`, `react_pr`) with customizable behavior.
- **Pattern Management**: Allows inclusion or exclusion of specific Fabric Patterns.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.11
- LangGraph and related libraries
- Docker for containerized execution

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective**: Compromise systems using the Fabric Agent Action by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the project.

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Inject Malicious Code into the Project**
2. **Exploit Existing Vulnerabilities in the Project**

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

- **Phishing attack to steal credentials**: High likelihood and impact due to the commonality of phishing attacks and the potential access it provides.
- **Exploit weak passwords**: High likelihood and impact, especially if maintainers do not use strong passwords or MFA.
- **Inject malicious code through pull requests**: Medium likelihood but high impact, as it can introduce vulnerabilities directly into the codebase.

### Critical Nodes

- **Gain Access to Maintainer's Account**: Addressing this node can mitigate multiple attack paths related to repository compromise.
- **Exploit Misconfigured Secrets Management**: Securing secrets can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

- **Implement MFA for Maintainers**: Reduce the risk of account compromise through phishing or weak passwords.
- **Code Review and Approval Process**: Ensure all pull requests are reviewed and approved by multiple maintainers.
- **Secure Secrets Management**: Use encrypted secrets management solutions and avoid storing secrets in plaintext.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor and Alert**: Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities in the repository and CI/CD pipelines.

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified

- Phishing attacks and weak password exploitation pose significant risks to maintainer accounts.
- Malicious code injection through pull requests and dependencies can compromise the project.
- Misconfigured secrets management and insecure workflow configurations can lead to unauthorized access.

### Recommended Actions

- Enforce strong authentication measures for maintainers.
- Implement robust code review processes.
- Securely manage secrets and environment variables.
- Conduct regular security assessments and audits.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions

- **Questions**:
  - Are there any additional security measures in place for the GitHub repository?
  - How frequently are security audits conducted?
  - What is the current process for handling security vulnerabilities?

- **Assumptions**:
  - The project relies on GitHub for version control and CI/CD.
  - Maintainers have access to sensitive parts of the project.
  - The project uses third-party dependencies that could be compromised.
