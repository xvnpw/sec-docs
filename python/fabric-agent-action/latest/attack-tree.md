# Threat Modeling Analysis for the Fabric Agent Action Project Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

The **Fabric Agent Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automate complex workflows using an agent-based approach. It leverages Fabric Patterns and integrates with various Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently select and execute patterns based on user input. The project is built to enhance productivity in software development by automating tasks related to code reviews, documentation, and more.

### Key Components and Features

- **Agent Types**: Supports multiple agent types (`router`, `react`, `react_issue`, `react_pr`) for different use cases.
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Can utilize different LLM providers such as OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic.
- **Configuration Options**: Users can customize agent behavior, input/output files, and logging levels.
- **Security Controls**: Implements access control patterns to prevent unauthorized usage.

### Dependencies

- **Python Libraries**: Utilizes libraries such as `langchain`, `langgraph`, and `pydantic` for LLM interactions and configuration management.
- **Docker**: The project can be run in a Docker container, ensuring consistent environments across different setups.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

Attacker's Ultimate Objective:
- **Compromise systems using the Fabric Agent Action by exploiting weaknesses in its configuration, code, or deployment practices.**

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Inject Malicious Code**
   - Modify the action's code or configuration files to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors.

2. **Exploit Configuration Weaknesses**
   - Identify and exploit misconfigurations in GitHub Actions or environment variables.

3. **Compromise API Keys**
   - Gain access to sensitive API keys stored in GitHub secrets or environment variables.

4. **Manipulate Input Files**
   - Alter input files to execute unintended commands or extract sensitive information.

5. **Bypass Access Controls**
   - Circumvent security measures implemented in the action to execute unauthorized workflows.

## 4. Expand Each Attack Path with Detailed Steps

### 1. Inject Malicious Code
- **1.1 Modify Action Code**
  - Fork the repository and create a pull request with malicious changes.
  - Use social engineering to convince maintainers to merge the changes.

- **1.2 Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities**
  - Identify vulnerabilities in dependencies (e.g., `langchain`, `langgraph`) and exploit them to execute arbitrary code.

### 2. Exploit Configuration Weaknesses
- **2.1 Misconfigured GitHub Actions**
  - Analyze the workflow files for insecure configurations (e.g., allowing untrusted pull requests to run workflows).
  
- **2.2 Insecure Environment Variables**
  - Check for hardcoded secrets in the codebase or misconfigured environment variables.

### 3. Compromise API Keys
- **3.1 Access GitHub Secrets**
  - Use social engineering to gain access to the repository owner's account and extract secrets.
  
- **3.2 Phishing Attacks**
  - Create a phishing site to capture API keys from users interacting with the action.

### 4. Manipulate Input Files
- **4.1 Craft Malicious Input**
  - Create input files that exploit the action's processing logic to execute arbitrary commands.
  
- **4.2 Use GitHub Comments**
  - Leverage GitHub comments to inject malicious commands if the action processes comments.

### 5. Bypass Access Controls
- **5.1 Analyze Access Control Logic**
  - Review the access control patterns in the action and identify potential bypass methods.
  
- **5.2 Use Compromised Accounts**
  - Use stolen credentials to execute workflows as an authorized user.
