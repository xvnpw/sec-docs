# Threat Modeling Analysis for Fabric Agent Action Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

**Fabric Agent Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automate complex workflows using an agent-based approach. It leverages Fabric Patterns and Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently select and execute patterns. The project is built with LangGraph and supports multiple LLM providers like OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic.

### Key Components and Features

- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates into existing workflows.
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Supports OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic.
- **Configurable Agents**: Offers different agent types (`router`, `react`, `react_issue`, `react_pr`) with customizable behavior.
- **Pattern Management**: Allows inclusion or exclusion of specific Fabric Patterns.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.11
- LangGraph and related libraries
- Poetry for dependency management

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

- **Inject Malicious Code into the Project**: This path is significant due to the potential for widespread impact if malicious code is introduced into the project.
- **Exploit Existing Vulnerabilities**: Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access and control over systems using the project.

### Critical Nodes

- **Gain Access to the Repository**: Addressing this node can mitigate multiple attack paths related to code injection.
- **Exploit Misconfigured Secrets**: Securing secrets can prevent unauthorized access and misuse of API keys.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

- **Implement Strong Access Controls**: Use multi-factor authentication and strong password policies for repository access.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular code reviews and vulnerability assessments to identify and fix security flaws.
- **Secure Distribution Channels**: Use code signing and integrity checks for Docker images and GitHub Actions.
- **Protect Secrets**: Use secure storage solutions for API keys and other sensitive information.
- **Monitor and Alert**: Implement monitoring and alerting for unauthorized access and changes to the repository.

## 9. Summarize Findings
