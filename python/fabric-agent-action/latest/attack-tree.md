# Threat Modeling Analysis for the Fabric Agent Action Project Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview
The **Fabric Agent Action** is a GitHub Action designed to automate complex workflows using an agent-based approach. It leverages Fabric Patterns and integrates with various Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently select and execute patterns based on user input. The project is built to enhance productivity in software development and project management by automating tasks through AI.

### Key Components and Features
- **Agent Types**: Supports multiple agent types (`router`, `react`, `react_issue`, `react_pr`) for different use cases.
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Integrates with OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic for LLM capabilities.
- **Configuration Options**: Users can customize agent behavior, input/output files, and pattern management.
- **Security Controls**: Implements access control patterns to prevent unauthorized usage.

### Dependencies
- **LangChain**: For LLM interactions.
- **Poetry**: For dependency management.
- **Various Python libraries**: Including `pytest`, `ruff`, and `bandit` for testing and security checks.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

### Attacker's Ultimate Objective
**Compromise systems using the Fabric Agent Action by exploiting weaknesses in the project, leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or manipulation of workflows.**

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Inject Malicious Code into the Project**
   - Modify the action's code to include backdoors or malicious patterns.
   - Exploit vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline to introduce malicious changes.

2. **Exploit Existing Vulnerabilities**
   - Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the codebase or dependencies.
   - Target misconfigurations in the GitHub Action settings.

3. **Compromise Distribution Channels**
   - Manipulate the GitHub repository to distribute a compromised version of the action.
   - Use social engineering to gain access to maintainers' accounts.

4. **Leverage Insecure Implementations**
   - Exploit insecure API key management practices.
   - Target users who misconfigure the action in their workflows.
