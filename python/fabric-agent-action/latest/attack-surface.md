# Attack Surface Analysis for `Fabric Agent Action`

## Attack Surface Identification
The attack surface of the `Fabric Agent Action` includes various digital assets, components, and system entry points that could be targeted by an attacker. The following components have been identified:

- **APIs and External Integrations:**
  - **OpenAI API**: Utilized for executing fabric patterns. The API key is stored in GitHub secrets, which could be a target for attackers.
  - **OpenRouter API**: Another LLM provider that can be used, also requiring an API key.
  - **Anthropic API**: A third LLM provider that requires an API key.

- **Web Applications:**
  - **GitHub Actions**: The action is executed within GitHub workflows, which can be triggered by various events (e.g., pull requests, issue comments). This creates potential entry points for unauthorized execution.

- **Configuration Files:**
  - **action.yml**: Defines inputs and outputs for the GitHub Action, including sensitive parameters like API keys and agent types.
  - **Dockerfile**: Contains instructions for building the Docker image, which could be exploited if not properly secured.

- **Communication Protocols:**
  - **HTTP/HTTPS**: Used for API calls to external services. If not secured properly, these communications could be intercepted.

- **Authentication Mechanisms:**
  - **GitHub Secrets**: Used to store sensitive information like API keys. If an attacker gains access to the repository, they could potentially access these secrets.

- **Internet-facing Components:**
  - **GitHub Repository**: The repository itself is public, which means that the code and its configurations are visible to anyone. This could expose vulnerabilities.

- **Logging and Debugging:**
  - **Debugging Information**: The application can log detailed information, which could inadvertently expose sensitive data if logs are not managed properly.

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
- **API Key Exposure**: If API keys are not properly secured, they could be leaked, allowing unauthorized access to the LLM services.
- **Insecure GitHub Actions**: If workflows are not properly restricted, unauthorized users could trigger actions that incur costs or expose sensitive data.
- **Misconfigured Docker Images**: If the Docker image is not built securely, it could be exploited to run malicious code.
- **Inadequate Input Validation**: If user inputs are not properly validated, it could lead to injection attacks or other forms of exploitation.

### Reference Implementation Details:
- **action.yml**: Defines the action's inputs and outputs, including sensitive configurations.
- **Dockerfile**: Contains the build instructions for the action's Docker image.
- **/code/fabric_agent_action/app.py**: Main application logic that processes inputs and interacts with external APIs.

## Threat Enumeration
Using the STRIDE model, the following threats have been identified:

1. **Spoofing**:
   - **Threat**: An attacker could impersonate a legitimate user to trigger workflows.
   - **Attack Vector**: Exploiting weak access controls on GitHub Actions.
   - **Conditions**: If workflows are not restricted to specific users or contexts.

2. **Tampering**:
   - **Threat**: An attacker could modify the action's code or configuration files.
   - **Attack Vector**: Gaining write access to the repository.
   - **Conditions**: If repository permissions are not properly configured.

3. **Repudiation**:
   - **Threat**: Users could deny having triggered an action or made changes.
   - **Attack Vector**: Lack of proper logging and audit trails.
   - **Conditions**: If logging is not enabled or is insufficient.

4. **Information Disclosure**:
   - **Threat**: Sensitive information (e.g., API keys) could be exposed through logs or error messages.
   - **Attack Vector**: Inadequate logging practices.
   - **Conditions**: If debug logging is enabled in production.

5. **Denial of Service**:
   - **Threat**: An attacker could trigger excessive workflows, leading to service disruptions.
   - **Attack Vector**: Exploiting public access to workflows.
   - **Conditions**: If rate limiting is not implemented.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**:
   - **Threat**: An attacker could gain elevated access to perform unauthorized actions.
   - **Attack Vector**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the action's code.
   - **Conditions**: If code is not properly reviewed or tested.

## Impact Assessment
The potential impact of each identified threat is assessed as follows:

1. **Spoofing**:
   - **Impact**: High (unauthorized access to workflows).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on access controls).
   - **Mitigation**: Implement strict access controls and user verification.

2. **Tampering**:
   - **Impact**: Critical (could lead to malicious code execution).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on repository permissions).
   - **Mitigation**: Use branch protection rules and code reviews.

3. **Repudiation**:
   - **Impact**: Medium (could complicate accountability).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on logging practices).
   - **Mitigation**: Enable comprehensive logging and audit trails.

4. **Information Disclosure**:
   - **Impact**: High (exposure of sensitive data).
   - **Likelihood**: High (if logging is not managed).
   - **Mitigation**: Avoid logging sensitive information and review logs regularly.

5. **Denial of Service**:
   - **Impact**: High (service disruptions).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on public access).
   - **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting and monitoring.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**:
   - **Impact**: Critical (unauthorized actions).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on code security).
   - **Mitigation**: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews.

## Threat Ranking
Based on the assessed impact and likelihood, the threats are ranked as follows:

1. **Tampering** - Critical impact, medium likelihood.
2. **Elevation of Privilege** - Critical impact, medium likelihood.
3. **Information Disclosure** - High impact, high likelihood.
4. **Denial of Service** - High impact, medium likelihood.
5. **Spoofing** - High impact, medium likelihood.
6. **Repudiation** - Medium impact, medium likelihood.

## Mitigation Recommendations
To address the identified threats, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Implement Strict Access Controls**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Spoofing, Tampering.
   - **Best Practices**: Use GitHub's branch protection rules and limit workflow triggers to specific users.

2. **Conduct Regular Code Reviews**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Tampering, Elevation of Privilege.
   - **Best Practices**: Ensure all code changes are reviewed by multiple team members.

3. **Enable Comprehensive Logging**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Repudiation, Information Disclosure.
   - **Best Practices**: Log all actions and errors, but avoid logging sensitive information.

4. **Implement Rate Limiting**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Denial of Service.
   - **Best Practices**: Use GitHub's API rate limiting features to prevent abuse.

5. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Elevation of Privilege, Tampering.
   - **Best Practices**: Conduct periodic security assessments of the codebase and dependencies.
