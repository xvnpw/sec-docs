# Project Design Document for Fabric Agent Action

## BUSINESS POSTURE
The Fabric Agent Action project aims to automate complex workflows in GitHub using an agent-based approach that leverages Fabric Patterns and Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary business goals include:

- **Enhancing Workflow Efficiency**: Automating repetitive tasks in GitHub workflows to save time and reduce manual errors.
- **Improving Collaboration**: Providing tools that facilitate better communication and collaboration among team members through automated responses and insights.
- **Cost Management**: Implementing security controls to prevent unauthorized usage and manage API costs effectively.

### Business Risks
- **Unauthorized Access**: Risk of unauthorized users triggering workflows, leading to unexpected costs.
- **Operational Downtime**: Potential for system failures or bugs that could disrupt automated workflows.
- **Data Sensitivity**: Handling sensitive data in workflows without proper security measures could lead to data breaches.

## SECURITY POSTURE
### Existing Security Controls
- **Access Control Patterns**: Implemented conditions in workflows to restrict access based on user roles and repository ownership.
- **Environment Variables**: Use of secrets for API keys to prevent exposure in the codebase.

### Accepted Risks
- **Limited User Access**: While access is restricted, there is still a risk of misuse by authorized users.
- **Dependency on External APIs**: Reliance on third-party APIs for LLMs introduces risks related to availability and data handling.

### Recommended Security Controls
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on API calls to prevent abuse.
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain logs of all actions taken by the Fabric Agent Action for accountability and monitoring.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs to the action are validated to prevent injection attacks.

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: Use GitHub OAuth for user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control to restrict actions based on user roles.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Cryptography**: Use encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Critical Business Processes
- **Workflow Automation**: The primary process that needs protection is the automation of workflows in GitHub, which directly impacts productivity and collaboration.

### Data Sensitivity
- **API Keys**: The project handles sensitive API keys for OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic, which must be protected to prevent unauthorized access.
- **User Inputs**: Inputs processed by the action may contain sensitive information, requiring careful handling and validation.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
### Questions
1. What specific user roles will be allowed to trigger the action?
2. Are there any specific compliance requirements that need to be considered?
3. What is the expected volume of API calls, and how will rate limiting be managed?

### Assumptions
- The project will be deployed in a controlled environment with access restrictions.
- Users triggering the action will have appropriate permissions.
- The action will be regularly monitored for performance and security issues.
