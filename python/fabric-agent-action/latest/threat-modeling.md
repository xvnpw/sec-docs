# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
1. **API Keys**: Sensitive keys for OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic that are used to authenticate requests to LLM providers.
2. **User Input Data**: Data provided by users through GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments that may contain sensitive information.
3. **Fabric Patterns**: The collection of patterns that the application uses to generate responses and perform actions.
4. **Output Files**: Files generated by the application that may contain processed data or results from LLM interactions.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **GitHub Repository**: The boundary between the trusted environment (repository owner) and untrusted users (public contributors).
2. **External LLM Providers**: The boundary between the application and external services (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic) that process user data.
3. **Local Environment**: The boundary between the application running locally and the external environment (e.g., GitHub Actions runner).

## DATA FLOWS
1. **User Input to Application**: Data flows from GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments to the application for processing.
2. **Application to LLM Providers**: The application sends requests to external LLM providers with user input and API keys.
3. **LLM Providers to Application**: Responses from LLM providers are sent back to the application for further processing.
4. **Application to Output Files**: The application writes results to output files that may be posted back to GitHub.

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0001 | GitHub Actions Workflow | Unauthorized access to API keys | Spoofing | Unauthorized users could access sensitive API keys if not properly secured. | API keys are stored in GitHub secrets. | Implement additional access controls and audit logs for secret access. | Medium | Exposure of API keys could lead to unauthorized usage and costs. | High |
| 0002 | User Input | Sensitive data exposure | Information Disclosure | User input may contain sensitive information that could be exposed in output files. | Input is processed and sanitized before being sent to LLMs. | Implement data masking for sensitive information in outputs. | Medium | Exposure of sensitive data could lead to privacy violations. | High |
| 0003 | LLM Providers | Man-in-the-middle attack on API requests | Tampering | An attacker could intercept API requests to LLM providers. | HTTPS is used for all API requests. | Regularly update and audit SSL certificates. | Low | Successful interception could lead to data manipulation or exposure. | Critical |
| 0004 | Fabric Patterns | Malicious patterns execution | Tampering | Malicious patterns could be introduced that alter application behavior. | Patterns are sourced from a trusted repository. | Implement integrity checks for patterns before execution. | Low | Execution of malicious patterns could compromise application integrity. | High |
| 0005 | Output Files | Unauthorized access to output files | Spoofing | Unauthorized users could access output files containing sensitive information. | Output files are written to a secure location. | Implement strict access controls on output files. | Medium | Unauthorized access could lead to data leaks. | High |

1. **GitHub Actions**: The project is deployed using GitHub Actions workflows to automate tasks.
2. **Docker Container**: The application is packaged in a Docker container for deployment.

### Selected Deployment Architecture: GitHub Actions

## ASSETS
1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**: YAML files that define the CI/CD processes.
2. **Docker Images**: Images built and pushed to the GitHub Container Registry.
3. **Secrets**: API keys and other sensitive information stored in GitHub secrets.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **GitHub Actions Runner**: The boundary between the trusted environment (GitHub Actions) and untrusted external contributors.
2. **Docker Registry**: The boundary between the application and the external Docker registry.

|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0001 | GitHub Actions | Unauthorized access to workflows | Unauthorized users could modify workflows to execute malicious code. | Workflows are protected by branch protection rules. | Implement additional review processes for workflow changes. | Medium | Unauthorized changes could lead to execution of malicious code. | High |
| 0002 | Docker Container | Vulnerable dependencies in Docker image | Vulnerabilities in dependencies could be exploited. | Regularly update dependencies and use security scanning tools. | Implement automated dependency checks in CI/CD pipeline. | Medium | Exploitation of vulnerabilities could lead to system compromise. | High |
| 0003 | GitHub Secrets | Exposure of secrets in logs | Secrets could be accidentally logged during workflow execution. | Use GitHub Actions' built-in secret management. | Regularly audit logs for sensitive information exposure. | Medium | Exposure of secrets could lead to unauthorized access. | High |

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
1. **Source Code**: The codebase that is built and published.
2. **Build Scripts**: Scripts that automate the build process.
3. **CI/CD Configuration**: Configuration files for CI/CD tools.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **Build Environment**: The boundary between the trusted build environment and untrusted code contributions.
2. **External Dependencies**: The boundary between the application and external libraries or tools.

| 0002 | CI/CD Pipeline | Insecure build configurations | Misconfigurations could expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access. | Regularly review and audit CI/CD configurations. | Implement automated checks for security best practices. | Medium | Misconfigurations could lead to data leaks or unauthorized access. | High |
| 0003 | Build Environment | Compromised build environment | An attacker could gain access to the build environment and manipulate builds. | Use isolated environments for builds and limit access. | Implement strict access controls and monitoring. | Low | Compromise of the build environment could lead to malicious code being deployed. | Critical |

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
1. **Questions**:
   - What specific user data is being processed, and how is it being protected?
   - Are there any additional security measures in place for the LLM interactions?
   - How often are dependencies updated and audited for vulnerabilities?

2. **Assumptions**:
   - The application is deployed in a secure environment with proper access controls.
   - Users are aware of the potential risks associated with sharing sensitive information in GitHub issues and comments.
   - The development team follows best practices for security and regularly audits the codebase and dependencies.

This threat model highlights realistic threats and their potential impacts, providing a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with the application, deployment, and build processes.
