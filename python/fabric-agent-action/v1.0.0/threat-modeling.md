# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
1. **API Keys**: Sensitive keys for OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic that are used to authenticate requests to the respective APIs.
2. **User Input Data**: Data provided by users in GitHub issues or comments that may contain sensitive information.
3. **Fabric Patterns**: The patterns used by the Fabric Agent Action to process requests, which may contain proprietary logic or sensitive information.
4. **Output Files**: Generated output files that may contain results from processing user input, which could include sensitive or proprietary information.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **GitHub Repository**: The boundary between the trusted environment (repository) and untrusted external users who can create issues or comments.
2. **API Providers**: The boundary between the application and external API providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic) that process user data.
3. **Local Environment**: The boundary between the local execution environment (where the action runs) and the external environment (GitHub Actions runner).

## DATA FLOWS
1. **User Input to GitHub Action**: Data flows from user comments/issues to the GitHub Action.
2. **GitHub Action to API Providers**: Data flows from the GitHub Action to the respective API providers for processing.
3. **API Providers to GitHub Action**: Processed data flows back from the API providers to the GitHub Action.
4. **GitHub Action to Output Files**: The final output is written to output files in the repository.

## APPLICATION THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0001      | GitHub Action  | API Key Exposure through Environment Variables | Spoofing | If API keys are exposed, unauthorized users can access the APIs, leading to potential data breaches. | API keys are stored in GitHub secrets and not hardcoded. | Regularly rotate API keys and use least privilege access. | Medium - API keys are often targeted by attackers. | High - Compromised keys can lead to significant data loss or financial costs. | High |
| 0002      | GitHub Action  | Unauthorized Access to GitHub Actions | Tampering | Unauthorized users could trigger actions that lead to excessive API usage or data exposure. | Access control conditions are implemented in the workflow. | Implement stricter access controls and review permissions regularly. | Medium - Public repositories are more vulnerable. | Medium - Could lead to increased costs or data exposure. | Medium |
| 0003      | API Providers   | Data Leakage from API Responses | Information Disclosure | Sensitive user data could be leaked in API responses if not handled properly. | Responses are processed and filtered before being sent back to users. | Implement data sanitization and logging to monitor API responses. | Medium - API responses can be intercepted. | High - Sensitive data exposure can lead to reputational damage. | High |
| 0004      | Output Files    | Sensitive Data in Output Files | Information Disclosure | Generated output files may inadvertently contain sensitive information. | Output files are reviewed before being posted back to GitHub. | Implement checks to sanitize output data before writing to files. | Medium - Output files are accessible to users. | High - Sensitive data exposure can lead to reputational damage. | High |
| 0005      | User Input      | Injection Attacks via User Input | Tampering | Malicious input could be used to manipulate the action's behavior. | Input validation is performed before processing. | Implement strict input validation and sanitization. | Medium - User input is a common attack vector. | High - Successful injection could lead to unauthorized actions. | High |

# DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

## DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURES
1. **GitHub Actions**: The primary deployment architecture where the Fabric Agent Action is executed.
2. **Docker Container**: The action runs within a Docker container, which encapsulates the application and its dependencies.

## ASSETS
1. **Docker Image**: The Docker image that contains the application code and dependencies.
2. **GitHub Repository**: The repository that contains the action code and configuration.
3. **Secrets**: GitHub secrets used for storing sensitive information like API keys.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **GitHub Actions Runner**: The boundary between the GitHub Actions environment and the external internet.
2. **Docker Container**: The boundary between the containerized application and the host system.

## DEPLOYMENT THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0001      | Docker Image    | Vulnerabilities in Base Image | Vulnerabilities in the base image can be exploited by attackers. | Regular updates and security scans of the base image. | Use minimal base images and regularly scan for vulnerabilities. | Medium - Vulnerabilities are common in outdated images. | High - Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access. | High |
| 0002      | GitHub Actions  | Misconfiguration of Secrets | Misconfigured secrets can lead to exposure of sensitive information. | Secrets are managed through GitHub's secret management. | Regularly review and audit secrets configuration. | Medium - Misconfigurations are common in CI/CD environments. | High - Exposure of secrets can lead to significant data breaches. | High |
| 0003      | Docker Container | Container Escape | An attacker could escape the container and access the host system. | Containers are run with limited privileges. | Use security features like seccomp and AppArmor to restrict container capabilities. | Low - Container escape is less common but possible. | Critical - Successful escape could lead to full system compromise. | Critical |

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
1. **Source Code**: The codebase that is built and published.
2. **Build Configuration**: Configuration files that define the build process.
3. **Dependencies**: External libraries and packages used in the project.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **Build Environment**: The boundary between the build environment and the source code repository.
