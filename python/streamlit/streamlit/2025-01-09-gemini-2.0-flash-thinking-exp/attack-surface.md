# Attack Surface Analysis for streamlit/streamlit

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized User Input Leading to Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_user_input_leading_to_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability where user-provided input is directly used to construct and execute shell commands on the server.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** Streamlit allows developers to easily integrate user input from widgets directly into Python code, which might then be used to execute system commands (e.g., using `os.system`, `subprocess`).
    *   **Example:** A Streamlit app takes a file path as input from `st.text_input` and uses it in `os.system(f"cat {file_path}")`. A malicious user could input `"; rm -rf /"` to execute a destructive command.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data loss, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid executing shell commands directly based on user input.
        *   If shell commands are necessary, use parameterized commands or libraries that offer safe execution (e.g., `subprocess.run` with proper argument handling).
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize user input to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for the application's execution environment.

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized User Input Leading to Code Injection (Eval/Exec)](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_user_input_leading_to_code_injection__evalexec_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability where user-provided input is directly evaluated or executed as Python code.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** Streamlit's flexibility allows developers to potentially use functions like `eval()` or `exec()` with user input, although this is generally discouraged.
    *   **Example:** A Streamlit app takes Python code as input from `st.text_area` and uses `eval(user_code)` to execute it. A malicious user could input arbitrary harmful Python code.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never use `eval()` or `exec()` with untrusted user input.
        *   If dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, explore safer alternatives or sandboxing techniques.
        *   Implement rigorous input validation to ensure the input conforms to expected patterns and does not contain malicious code.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through User-Provided Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_user-provided_content.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability where malicious scripts are injected into content displayed to other users, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in their browsers.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** Streamlit renders content based on the application's logic, including potentially displaying user-provided text or HTML (e.g., through `st.write`, `st.markdown`). If this content isn't properly sanitized, it can be exploited for XSS.
    *   **Example:** A Streamlit app displays user comments entered via `st.text_input` using `st.write`. A malicious user enters `<script>alert("XSS");</script>` which gets executed in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the application, performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and escape user-provided content before displaying it. Streamlit might offer some automatic escaping, but developers should be aware of the context and ensure proper handling.
        *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
        *   Avoid directly rendering raw HTML from user input. If necessary, use a safe HTML rendering library with strict sanitization.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Controlled URLs](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_user-controlled_urls.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability where an attacker can induce the server to make requests to unintended locations, potentially internal services or external resources.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** If a Streamlit application uses user input to construct URLs for fetching data (e.g., using libraries like `requests` or `urllib`), it can be susceptible to SSRF.
    *   **Example:** A Streamlit app takes a URL as input from `st.text_input` and uses it to fetch an image using `requests.get(user_url)`. A malicious user could input a URL pointing to an internal service (`http://localhost:8080/admin`) to probe for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize user-provided URLs.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs for server-side requests.
        *   Consider using a proxy server or firewall to restrict outbound traffic from the application server.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (Malicious File Uploads)](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities__malicious_file_uploads_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability where users can upload malicious files that can be executed on the server or used to compromise other users.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** Streamlit provides the `st.file_uploader` widget, which allows users to upload files. If the application doesn't properly validate and handle these uploads, it can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A Streamlit app allows users to upload images. A malicious user uploads a PHP script disguised as an image, which, if placed in a publicly accessible directory and executed by the web server, could compromise the server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, remote code execution, defacement, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate file types and content based on expected formats (e.g., using magic numbers or content inspection).
        *   Avoid relying solely on file extensions for validation.
        *   Store uploaded files in a non-executable directory.
        *   Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable names and potential overwriting.
        *   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.
        *   Restrict file sizes.
