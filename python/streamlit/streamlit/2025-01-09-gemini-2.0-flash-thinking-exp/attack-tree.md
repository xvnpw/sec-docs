## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Streamlit Input Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_streamlit_input_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path is high-risk because user input is a primary interaction point in most Streamlit applications, making it a readily available attack surface. Lack of proper input handling is a common vulnerability.

    *   **Inject Malicious Code via User Input (CRITICAL NODE):** Successfully injecting malicious code directly leads to code execution on the server.
        *   **Command Injection (CRITICAL NODE):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit Streamlit input components (`st.text_input`, `st.selectbox`, etc.) to inject shell commands that are then executed by the server. This often occurs when user input is directly passed to functions like `subprocess.run` without proper sanitization.
            *   **Risk:** High likelihood due to common developer errors, high impact as it allows full server control.
        *   **Python Code Injection (CRITICAL NODE):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious Python code into input fields that are unwisely used with functions like `eval()` or `exec()`. This allows arbitrary Python code execution.
            *   **Risk:** Lower likelihood due to its obviously dangerous nature, but extremely high impact if successful.

    *   **Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Developers fail to properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing attackers to bypass intended restrictions and potentially trigger other vulnerabilities or logic flaws. This can lead to various exploits depending on the context.
        *   **Risk:** High likelihood due to common developer oversight, impact varies but can be high depending on the exploited vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Streamlit's File Handling Features (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_streamlit's_file_handling_features__high-risk_path_.md)

*   File upload functionality introduces significant risk if not handled securely. Malicious files can be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities during processing or can be used as a stepping stone for further attacks.

    *   **Upload Malicious Files (CRITICAL NODE):** The ability to upload files controlled by the attacker is a critical point of entry.
        *   **Execute Malicious Code During Upload/Processing (CRITICAL NODE):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload files that are specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the libraries or code used to process them (e.g., image processing libraries, document parsers). This can lead to arbitrary code execution during the upload or subsequent processing.
            *   **Risk:** Medium likelihood as it requires specific knowledge of processing vulnerabilities, but high impact if successful.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Streamlit's Configuration or Deployment (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_streamlit's_configuration_or_deployment__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Insecure configurations or vulnerabilities in the deployment environment can directly expose the application and the server to attacks.

    *   **Insecure Streamlit Configuration (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Misconfigurations in Streamlit's server settings (e.g., running in debug mode in production, exposing sensitive endpoints) can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute code.
        *   **Risk:** Low to Medium likelihood depending on the developer's security awareness, but high impact if exploited.

    *   **Vulnerabilities in Deployment Environment (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system, container runtime, or cloud platform where the Streamlit application is deployed. This is not a direct Streamlit vulnerability but is critical to the overall application security.
        *   **Risk:** Medium likelihood depending on the security posture of the deployment environment, high impact as it can lead to full server or environment compromise.
