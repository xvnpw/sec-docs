# Threat Model Analysis for streamlit/streamlit

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via `st.code` Injection](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via__st_code__injection.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker could inject malicious Python code into a text input or other user-controlled field that is subsequently rendered using `st.code` without proper sanitization. Streamlit will then execute this code on the server.
    *   **How:** By crafting specific input strings that contain harmful Python commands.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker could gain full control of the server running the Streamlit application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   **Description:** The `streamlit.code` function and any surrounding code that handles user input destined for this function.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly embedding unsanitized user input into `st.code`.
    *   If displaying user-provided code is necessary, use syntax highlighting libraries outside of `st.code` that do not execute the code.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the server-side before rendering any code.

## Threat: [Client-Side Code Injection via `st.markdown` with `unsafe_allow_html=True`](./threats/client-side_code_injection_via__st_markdown__with__unsafe_allow_html=true_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** If `unsafe_allow_html=True` is used in `st.markdown` and user-provided input is included without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that will be executed in the user's browser.
    *   **How:** By crafting malicious HTML or JavaScript within user input fields.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Description:** This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where the attacker can steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   **Description:** The `streamlit.markdown` function when used with `unsafe_allow_html=True`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using `unsafe_allow_html=True` unless absolutely necessary.
    *   If `unsafe_allow_html=True` is required, rigorously sanitize all user-provided input before rendering it using a trusted HTML sanitization library.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Streamlit Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_streamlit_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** Streamlit relies on various Python packages. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them through the Streamlit application.
    *   **How:** By crafting specific inputs or interactions that trigger the vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Description:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from information disclosure and denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   **Description:** Any of Streamlit's dependencies that have known vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Streamlit and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow security best practices for managing dependencies.
