## Streamlit Application Threat Model - High-Risk & Critical Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise the Streamlit application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Streamlit itself, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or disruption of service.

**Root Goal:** Compromise Streamlit Application

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors (High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes):**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** This represents a category of attacks where the attacker's goal is to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Streamlit application. Success in this area grants the attacker the highest level of control, allowing them to steal data, modify the application, or completely take over the server.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Full server compromise, data breach, complete application control, service disruption.

* **Exploit Dependencies with Known Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    * **Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries and packages that Streamlit relies on. If a dependency has a publicly known RCE vulnerability, an attacker can leverage this to execute code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Full server compromise, potentially easier to execute if exploits are readily available.

* **Gain Access to the Underlying Server:**
    * **Description:** This attack targets the infrastructure on which the Streamlit application is deployed. By exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the hosting platform, the attacker can gain access to the operating system of the server.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Access to all applications and data on the server, potential for lateral movement to other systems.

* **Escape the Container Environment:**
    * **Description:** If the Streamlit application is running within a container (e.g., Docker), this attack aims to break out of the container and gain access to the host operating system. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the container runtime or kernel.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Access to the host system, potentially affecting other containers and the underlying infrastructure.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Inject Malicious Python Code via Input -> Leverage Unsanitized User Input in `st.write`, `st.markdown`, etc.:**
    * **Description:** Streamlit applications often use user input to dynamically generate content. If this input is not properly sanitized before being rendered using functions like `st.write` or `st.markdown`, an attacker can inject malicious Python code. Because Streamlit executes Python code on the server, this injected code will be executed with the server's privileges.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - This is a common vulnerability, especially if developers are not security-aware.
    * **Impact:** High - Can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to perform any action the server user can.
    * **Example:** A user provides input like `"<script>import os; os.system('cat /etc/passwd')</script>"` in a text field. If `st.markdown` renders this without sanitization, the Python code to read the password file will be executed on the server.

* **Leverage Streamlit's File Upload Functionality for Malicious Purposes -> Upload and Execute Malicious Scripts:**
    * **Description:** If the Streamlit application allows users to upload files, an attacker can upload a malicious script (e.g., a Python script) and then find a way to execute it on the server. This could be through a vulnerability in how the application processes uploaded files or by placing the file in a location where it can be executed by the web server.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - File upload functionalities are common targets, and misconfigurations can lead to execution vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:** High - Successful execution of a malicious script can lead to full server compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
    * **Example:** An attacker uploads a Python script named `backdoor.py` containing code to establish a reverse shell. If the application doesn't prevent execution of files in the upload directory, the attacker could potentially trigger its execution.

**Prioritization for Mitigation:**

This focused sub-tree clearly highlights the areas that require immediate and stringent security measures:

1. **Prevent Code Injection:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all user inputs. Use parameterized queries for database interactions and avoid directly rendering unsanitized user input.
2. **Secure Dependency Management:** Maintain an up-to-date list of dependencies and regularly scan for known vulnerabilities. Implement a process for promptly patching or replacing vulnerable dependencies.
3. **Secure File Uploads:** Implement strict file type validation, store uploaded files outside the web server's document root, and ensure that uploaded files cannot be directly executed by the web server. Consider using antivirus scanning on uploaded files.
4. **Harden Deployment Environment:** Follow security best practices for the chosen hosting platform, including proper access controls, regular security audits, and timely patching of the underlying operating system and related services. For containerized deployments, adhere to container security best practices to prevent container escape.

By concentrating efforts on mitigating these high-risk paths and securing critical nodes, the development team can significantly improve the security posture of the Streamlit application and protect it from the most severe threats.
