Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing on elements directly involving Streamlit and with high or critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Direct Code Execution
    *   **Description:** Streamlit applications execute arbitrary Python code defined by the developer. This means any vulnerabilities in the developer's code can be directly exploited on the server.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** Streamlit's core functionality is to run the provided Python script. It doesn't inherently sandbox or restrict the code's capabilities.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses `os.system(user_provided_string)` to execute a system command based on user input without proper sanitization. An attacker could input `"; rm -rf /"` to potentially delete critical server files.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the server hosting the Streamlit application, data loss, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid running the Streamlit application with overly permissive user accounts.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Regularly review the application code for potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:** Minimize the use of functions like `eval()` or `exec()` with user-provided input.

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Output
    *   **Description:** If user-provided text or data is directly rendered in the Streamlit application's UI without proper encoding or sanitization, malicious JavaScript code can be injected and executed in the user's browser.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** Streamlit automatically renders various data types. If developers directly display user input without escaping, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** A Streamlit application displays a user's comment using `st.write(user_comment)`. If `user_comment` contains `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`, this script will execute in the browser of anyone viewing the page.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Streamlit's Built-in Sanitization (where applicable):** Be aware of how Streamlit handles different data types and ensure it's not rendering raw HTML from user input unintentionally.
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Encode user-provided data appropriately based on the context where it's being displayed (e.g., HTML escaping for web pages).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

*   **Attack Surface:** File Upload Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Streamlit's `st.file_uploader` allows users to upload files. Improper handling of these uploaded files can lead to various security risks.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** Streamlit provides the mechanism for file uploads, making the application a target for such attacks if not handled securely.
    *   **Example:** A Streamlit application allows users to upload images. Without proper validation, an attacker could upload a malicious PHP script disguised as an image, which could then be executed if the server is misconfigured.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Potential for remote code execution, denial of service (through large file uploads), or access to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate file types, sizes, and content before processing.
        *   **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root and with restricted permissions.
        *   **Content Security Scanning:** Scan uploaded files for malware or malicious content.
        *   **Rename Uploaded Files:**  Rename uploaded files to prevent path traversal or execution vulnerabilities.
