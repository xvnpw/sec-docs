## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Streamlit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_streamlit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Streamlit processes user input from widgets.
*   **Attack Vector:** If user input is not properly sanitized and validated, attackers can inject malicious code that the Python backend will execute. This is particularly dangerous because Streamlit's core functionality involves executing Python code based on user interactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Input to Widgets [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__malicious_input_to_widgets__critical_node_.md)

*   This is a specific instance within input handling vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vector:** Imagine a Streamlit app that takes user input to generate a report. An attacker could input shell commands instead of expected data, and if the application directly executes this input without sanitization (e.g., using `os.system()` or `subprocess`), it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Streamlit Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_streamlit_server_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path targets vulnerabilities within the Streamlit server itself, which is based on the Tornado web server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploiting Known Tornado Vulnerabilities (Underlying Server) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploiting_known_tornado_vulnerabilities__underlying_server___critical_node_.md)

*   This focuses on leveraging known security flaws in the Tornado web server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Like any software, Tornado might have known vulnerabilities. If the Streamlit application uses an outdated version of Tornado, attackers can exploit these known weaknesses to gain control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Streamlit Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_streamlit_component_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path targets vulnerabilities introduced by the use of custom or third-party components within the Streamlit application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Custom Components [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_custom_components__critical_node_.md)

*   This focuses on XSS vulnerabilities arising from poorly implemented custom components.
*   **Attack Vector:** If a developer creates a custom Streamlit component that doesn't properly sanitize user input before rendering it in the browser, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript. This script can then steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions in the context of the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Components [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__vulnerabilities_in_third-party_components__critical_node_.md)

*   This focuses on vulnerabilities present in external libraries used by the Streamlit application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Streamlit applications often use other Python libraries. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, they can be exploited to compromise the Streamlit application.
