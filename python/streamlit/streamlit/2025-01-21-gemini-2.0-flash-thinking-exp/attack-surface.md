# Attack Surface Analysis for streamlit/streamlit

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized User Input leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_user_input_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected through user-provided input and executed in the browsers of other users viewing the application.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** Streamlit's ease of displaying user input directly using functions like `st.write` or `st.markdown` without explicit sanitization makes it easy to introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A user enters `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` in a text input field, and the application displays it directly using `st.write(user_input)`. When another user views this, the alert box pops up.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided input before displaying it. Use libraries like `html` or `bleach` in Python to escape or remove potentially harmful HTML tags and scripts.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP header to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Injection](./attack_surfaces/markdown_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Users inject malicious Markdown code that, when rendered by Streamlit, can lead to unexpected behavior or information disclosure.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** Streamlit's `st.markdown` function renders Markdown, and if user input is directly passed to it without proper escaping, malicious Markdown can be executed.
    *   **Example:** A user enters `[Click Me](javascript:alert('Markdown XSS'))` in a text area. When rendered with `st.markdown`, clicking the link executes JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to XSS, including potential for arbitrary JavaScript execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Escape User-Provided Markdown:** If displaying user-provided Markdown, escape potentially dangerous characters or use a Markdown rendering library that offers sanitization options.
        *   **Avoid Direct Rendering of Untrusted Markdown:** If possible, avoid directly rendering Markdown provided by users. Consider alternative ways to display user-generated content.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Users upload malicious files that can be executed on the server or used for other malicious purposes.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** The `st.file_uploader` component allows users to upload files, making the application a potential target for malicious uploads.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the server is not configured correctly, this script could be executed, potentially granting the attacker control.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate file types and sizes on the client-side and server-side.
        *   **Content Analysis:** Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus or sandboxing techniques.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store uploaded files in a secure location, separate from the web server's document root, with restricted execution permissions.
        *   **Rename Files:** Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable filenames and potential path traversal attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via File Uploads or User Input](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_file_uploads_or_user_input.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate file paths provided by users to access or modify files outside the intended directories.
    *   **How Streamlit Contributes:** If user-provided filenames or paths from `st.file_uploader` or other input components are used directly in file system operations without proper validation, path traversal vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a file with the name `../../../../etc/passwd`. If the application directly uses this name to save the file, it could overwrite system files.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, modification of critical system files, potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user-provided file paths and names.
        *   **Use Absolute Paths:** When working with files, use absolute paths or canonicalize paths to prevent traversal.
        *   **Chroot Jails or Sandboxing:** Isolate file operations within a restricted environment.
