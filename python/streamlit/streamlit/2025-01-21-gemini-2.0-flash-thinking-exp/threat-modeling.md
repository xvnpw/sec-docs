# Threat Model Analysis for streamlit/streamlit

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Unsafe Code Practices](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_unsafe_code_practices.md)

**Description:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Streamlit application because Streamlit directly executes the Python code provided by the developer. If this code includes unsafe practices like using `eval()` or `exec()` on unsanitized user input, or directly executing shell commands based on user input, Streamlit will facilitate the execution of malicious code.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server hosting the application, including access to sensitive data, modification of files, and potential for further attacks on other systems.

**Affected Component:** Streamlit's core execution environment, specifically the mechanism by which Streamlit runs the developer's Python script.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using `eval()` or `exec()` on user-provided input within the Streamlit application.
*   Sanitize and validate all user input rigorously before using it in any potentially dangerous operations.
*   Follow secure coding practices and principles when developing Streamlit applications.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_output.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the Streamlit application if Streamlit renders user-provided data in the application's UI without proper sanitization. This can occur if developers use Streamlit components in a way that bypasses default sanitization or if vulnerabilities exist within Streamlit's rendering logic itself. The attacker could then steal user credentials, session tokens, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Impact:** Compromise of user accounts interacting with the application, data theft, and potential for further attacks targeting users.

**Affected Component:** Streamlit's rendering engine and potentially specific UI components that handle user input display.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure all user-provided data displayed through Streamlit components is properly sanitized and escaped by Streamlit.
*   Be cautious when using custom components or directly manipulating the DOM, ensuring that these actions do not introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Report any instances where Streamlit components fail to properly sanitize output to the Streamlit development team.

## Threat: [Command Injection via User Input](./threats/command_injection_via_user_input.md)

**Description:** If a Streamlit application uses user input to construct and execute shell commands (e.g., using the `subprocess` module) without proper sanitization, Streamlit will execute these commands. An attacker could inject malicious commands that will be executed on the server by manipulating the user input.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server hosting the application, similar to arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** The parts of the Streamlit application where developer code interacts with the operating system through shell commands, facilitated by Streamlit's execution environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid executing shell commands based on user input within the Streamlit application whenever possible.
*   If necessary, use parameterized commands and carefully sanitize user input to prevent malicious commands from being executed.

## Threat: [Security Risks in Custom Components](./threats/security_risks_in_custom_components.md)

**Description:** Streamlit allows the integration of custom frontend components. If these components, which are executed within the user's browser, contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS), attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the user's session or gain access to sensitive information within the browser context. Streamlit's mechanism for integrating these components introduces this risk.

**Impact:** Compromise of user accounts interacting with the application, data theft within the browser context, and potential for further client-side attacks.

**Affected Component:** Streamlit's custom component API and the mechanism by which Streamlit integrates and renders these components in the user's browser.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review the code of custom components for security vulnerabilities before integrating them into a Streamlit application.
*   Use well-vetted and trusted custom component libraries.
*   Implement secure coding practices when developing custom components.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Streamlit's Core Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_streamlit's_core_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Streamlit relies on various Python packages. If vulnerabilities exist in the core dependencies that Streamlit directly utilizes for its functionality, these vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise the Streamlit application itself. This is a direct risk introduced by Streamlit's choice of and reliance on these dependencies.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from information disclosure to remote code execution on the server running the Streamlit application.

**Affected Component:** Streamlit's core dependencies (Python packages that are essential for Streamlit's operation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   The Streamlit development team should regularly update Streamlit's core dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   The Streamlit development team should monitor security advisories for its dependencies and address any identified vulnerabilities promptly.
*   Developers using Streamlit should ensure they are using the latest stable version of Streamlit, which includes the most recent dependency updates.
