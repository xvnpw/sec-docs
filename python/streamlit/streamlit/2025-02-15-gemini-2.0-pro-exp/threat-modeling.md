# Threat Model Analysis for streamlit/streamlit

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Component Injection](./threats/malicious_custom_component_injection.md)

*   **Threat:**  Malicious Custom Component Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript or Python package disguised as a legitimate Streamlit custom component.  They distribute it through public repositories or social engineering, tricking a developer into installing and using it within their Streamlit application. The malicious component could then steal data, manipulate the UI, or execute arbitrary code on the server or client, leveraging Streamlit's component model.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breach, application compromise, execution of arbitrary code on the server or client, reputational damage.
    *   **Streamlit Component Affected:**  `streamlit.components.v1` (the module for creating and using custom components). Specifically, any function that loads or executes external code, like `html()`, `iframe()`, or when using third-party component libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly vet third-party components:**  Examine the source code, author reputation, and community feedback before using any custom component.
        *   **Use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts, styles, and other resources can be loaded. This limits the damage a malicious component can do.
        *   **Implement sandboxing (if possible):**  Explore techniques to isolate custom components, limiting their access to the main application context.
        *   **Regularly update components:**  Keep all custom components up-to-date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Avoid using components from untrusted sources.**

## Threat: [Session State Manipulation via Network Interception](./threats/session_state_manipulation_via_network_interception.md)

*   **Threat:**  Session State Manipulation via Network Interception

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the WebSocket communication between the Streamlit client (browser) and server.  They modify the data being sent, altering the application's session state.  This could change displayed data, bypass input validation, or influence application logic, directly exploiting Streamlit's state management.
    *   **Impact:**  Data corruption, unauthorized access to features, incorrect application behavior, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Streamlit Component Affected:**  Streamlit's internal session state management mechanism, which relies on WebSocket communication.  This affects all interactive widgets (`st.button`, `st.text_input`, `st.selectbox`, etc.) as their state is managed through this mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use HTTPS (TLS encryption):**  This is mandatory to protect the WebSocket communication from interception and modification.
        *   **Implement server-side validation:**  Never trust data received from the client.  Validate all data *before* it's used to update the session state or perform any actions.
        *   **Consider using cryptographic signatures:**  For highly sensitive data, use HMAC or other cryptographic techniques to verify the integrity of session data.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via `st.write` or `st.dataframe`](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via__st_write__or__st_dataframe_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Sensitive Data Exposure via `st.write` or `st.dataframe`

    *   **Description:** A developer inadvertently uses `st.write` or `st.dataframe` to display raw data structures (e.g., Python dictionaries, Pandas DataFrames) that contain sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII).  This information is then directly visible to anyone accessing the Streamlit application.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breach, privacy violation, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Streamlit Component Affected:**  `st.write`, `st.dataframe`, `st.table`, and any other function that displays data directly to the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Carefully review and sanitize output:**  Before displaying data, explicitly select and format only the information that is intended for the user.
        *   **Use data masking or redaction:**  Implement techniques to mask or redact sensitive parts of data before displaying it.
        *   **Avoid displaying raw data structures:**  Instead, create custom views or formatted output that only shows the necessary information.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via File Upload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_file_upload.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service via File Upload

    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a very large file or a large number of files using Streamlit's `st.file_uploader`, overwhelming the server's resources (disk space, memory, CPU). This makes the application unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users, directly targeting a Streamlit component.
    *   **Impact:**  Application downtime, service disruption, potential for data loss (if disk space is exhausted).
    *   **Streamlit Component Affected:**  `st.file_uploader`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit file size:**  Set a maximum allowed file size in `st.file_uploader` using the `max_upload_size` parameter.
        *   **Limit the number of files:** Restrict the number of files a user can upload at once.
        *   **Implement rate limiting:**  Limit the frequency of file upload requests from a single user or IP address.
        *   **Use a separate file storage service:**  Offload file storage to a dedicated service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) to avoid overwhelming the Streamlit server.
        *   **Validate file type:** Check the file type and content to prevent uploading of malicious files.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Debugging Mode](./threats/information_disclosure_via_debugging_mode.md)

*   **Threat:**  Information Disclosure via Debugging Mode

    *   **Description:**  The Streamlit application is deployed with debugging mode enabled (`--global.developmentMode true` or similar).  This exposes detailed error messages, stack traces, and potentially sensitive configuration information to anyone accessing the application, a direct consequence of Streamlit's configuration.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, potential for further attacks (attackers can use the exposed information to identify vulnerabilities).
    *   **Streamlit Component Affected:**  The entire Streamlit application; this is a global configuration setting.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable debugging mode in production:**  Ensure that debugging mode is *never* enabled in a production environment.  Use environment variables or configuration files to control this setting.

## Threat: [Secrets Leakage via Environment Variables or Logging (with `st.write` misuse)](./threats/secrets_leakage_via_environment_variables_or_logging__with__st_write__misuse_.md)

* **Threat:** Secrets Leakage via Environment Variables or Logging (with `st.write` misuse)

    * **Description:** Streamlit application uses environment variables to store secrets. These secrets are accidentally exposed through error messages, logging statements, or *specifically* by misusing `st.write` for debugging purposes to output environment variable values.
    * **Impact:**  Compromise of connected services, data breach, unauthorized access.
    * **Streamlit Component Affected:**  Any component that accesses environment variables. Critically, *misuse of `st.write` for debugging* is the direct Streamlit involvement.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use a secrets manager:**  Store secrets in a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) instead of directly in environment variables.
        *   **Implement secure logging:**  Configure logging to filter out sensitive information.  Avoid logging raw data structures or environment variables.
        *   **Regularly review logs:**  Monitor logs for any accidental exposure of secrets.
        *   **Never use `st.write` to output raw environment variables or secrets.** This is the crucial Streamlit-specific mitigation.
