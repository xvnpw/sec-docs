# Attack Surface Analysis for streamlit/streamlit

## Attack Surface: [1. Custom Component XSS](./attack_surfaces/1__custom_component_xss.md)

*   *Description:* Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within custom Streamlit components.
    *   *How Streamlit Contributes:* Streamlit's custom component feature allows developers to embed arbitrary JavaScript/React code. Streamlit's architecture *facilitates* the creation of these components but doesn't inherently prevent XSS *within* the component's own code. The responsibility for security lies entirely with the component developer.
    *   *Example:* A custom component that takes user input and displays it without proper sanitization. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript that steals cookies.
    *   *Impact:*  Compromise of user accounts, data theft, execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.
    *   *Risk Severity:* High to Critical (depending on data handled).
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Strict Component-Level Input Validation:** Validate *all* input within the component's JavaScript.
        *   **Strict Component-Level Output Encoding:** Encode *all* output within the component's JavaScript before displaying it. Use context-appropriate encoding (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
        *   **CSP (Component Level):** If possible, implement a strict Content Security Policy specifically for the component.
        *   **Vet Third-Party Components:** Thoroughly review the source code of any third-party components. Prefer reputable, security-audited components.
        *   **Regular Component Updates:** Keep custom components (and their dependencies) updated.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unrestricted File Uploads (st.file_uploader)](./attack_surfaces/2__unrestricted_file_uploads__st_file_uploader_.md)

*   *Description:*  Exploitation of the `st.file_uploader` component to upload malicious files.
    *   *How Streamlit Contributes:* Streamlit provides the `st.file_uploader` component *as a core feature*. While Streamlit *provides* the component, it's the developer's responsibility to implement security controls. Streamlit does *not* automatically prevent malicious uploads.
    *   *Example:* An attacker uploads a PHP shell disguised as a JPG, gaining server control.
    *   *Impact:*  Remote code execution, data breaches, complete system compromise.
    *   *Risk Severity:* Critical
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Strict File Extension Whitelisting:** Enforce a whitelist of *only* allowed extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`). Do *not* rely on user input.
        *   **File Type Verification (Magic Numbers):** Use a library to verify file type based on content (magic numbers), *not* just the extension.
        *   **File Size Limits:** Enforce a maximum file size.
        *   **Secure Storage (Outside Web Root):** Store uploads outside the web root, with restricted permissions. Block direct URL access.
        *   **Filename Sanitization/Regeneration:** Sanitize filenames or generate new, unique filenames. Prevent path traversal.
        *   **Antivirus Scanning:** Integrate an antivirus scanner.
        *   **Never Execute Uploaded Files:** Do not execute or include uploaded files directly.

## Attack Surface: [3. WebSocket Hijacking/CSWSH](./attack_surfaces/3__websocket_hijackingcswsh.md)

*   *Description:*  Interception/manipulation of WebSocket communication.
    *   *How Streamlit Contributes:* Streamlit *fundamentally relies* on WebSockets for its core interactive functionality. This inherent reliance makes WebSocket security paramount. Misconfiguration directly impacts the application.
    *   *Example:* An attacker intercepts a WebSocket connection, modifying data and altering application behavior. Or, an attacker uses CSWSH to force malicious WebSocket requests.
    *   *Impact:*  Data breaches, manipulation of application state, denial of service.
    *   *Risk Severity:* High
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Mandatory WSS (Secure WebSockets):** *Always* use WSS with valid TLS certificates. Never use unencrypted WS.
        *   **Strict Origin Validation:** Validate the `Origin` header of *all* incoming WebSocket connections. Prevent Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). Only allow trusted origins.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization (WebSocket Level):** Implement authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections.
        *   **Rate Limiting (WebSocket Connections):** Implement rate limiting and connection limits to prevent DoS.
        *   **Input Validation (WebSocket Messages):** Validate *all* data received over WebSockets.

## Attack Surface: [4. Session State Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/4__session_state_manipulation.md)

* Description:* Attackers manipulating or hijacking Streamlit's session state.
    * How Streamlit Contributes:* Streamlit *provides* the session state feature as a core part of its framework. While convenient, this built-in feature becomes a direct attack vector if not secured properly.
    * Example:* An attacker guesses or sets a session ID (session fixation) to impersonate another user.
    * Impact:* Unauthorized access to user data, privilege escalation, session hijacking.
    * Risk Severity:* High
    * Mitigation Strategies:*
        * **Strong, Random Session IDs:** Ensure Streamlit uses strong, random, and unpredictable session IDs (this is usually handled by the underlying web framework, but verify the configuration).
        * **Secure and HttpOnly Cookies:** Use secure and HttpOnly cookies for session management.
        * **Session Timeout:** Implement appropriate session timeouts.
        * **Encrypt Session Data:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in the session state.
        * **Minimize Sensitive Data in Session:** Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in the session state.
