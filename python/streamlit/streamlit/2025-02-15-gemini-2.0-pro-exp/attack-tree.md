## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Streamlit Component Vulnerabilities -> 1.1 Custom Component Vulnerability -> [***1.1.1 RCE via Comp***]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_streamlit_component_vulnerabilities_-_1_1_custom_component_vulnerability_-__1_1_1_rce_via_co_5d9d67c5.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a custom Streamlit component to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application.  This is a critical vulnerability because it grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends heavily on the quality of the custom component's code and security practices followed during development.)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full server compromise, data breaches, potential for lateral movement within the network.)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires identifying a vulnerability in the custom component and crafting an exploit.  The effort can range from low if a simple vulnerability exists to high if the vulnerability is complex.)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced (Requires a good understanding of web application security, common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, command injection, and potentially knowledge of the specific technologies used in the custom component.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Intrusion detection systems (IDS) might detect suspicious activity, and code analysis tools could potentially identify the vulnerability during development.  However, a skilled attacker might be able to evade detection.)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines for the language and framework used to develop the custom component.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Rigorously validate *all* input received by the component, using a whitelist approach whenever possible.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode all output from the component to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which could be a stepping stone to RCE.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure the component runs with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on security-sensitive areas.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to automatically scan the component's code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use dynamic analysis (fuzzing) to test the component with a wide range of inputs to identify potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Streamlit Session State -> 2.2 Hijack Existing Session ID -> [2.2.2 Lack of Session Timeout]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_streamlit_session_state_-_2_2_hijack_existing_session_id_-__2_2_2_lack_of_session_timeout_f2af38a4.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a valid user's session by exploiting the absence of, or excessively long, session timeouts.  If a user leaves their session active without logging out, and there's no timeout mechanism, the attacker can potentially reuse the session ID to impersonate the user.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the application's configuration and user behavior.  If timeouts are not configured or are set to very long durations, the likelihood increases.)
*   **Impact:** High (The attacker gains full access to the user's account and data within the Streamlit application.  This could lead to data theft, unauthorized actions, and potential privilege escalation.)
*   **Effort:** Low (The attacker simply needs to obtain a valid session ID that hasn't expired.  This could be done through various means, such as sniffing network traffic if HTTPS is not used, or finding an unattended computer with an active session.)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice (The attack itself is simple, although obtaining the session ID might require some technical knowledge depending on the method used.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Monitoring session activity and looking for unusual patterns might help detect session hijacking.  However, if the attacker is careful, it can be difficult to distinguish their activity from legitimate user activity.)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Session Timeouts:**  Configure Streamlit to automatically invalidate sessions after a period of inactivity.  Choose a reasonable timeout duration based on the application's security requirements.
    *   **Use HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server, protecting session cookies from interception.
    *   **Logout Functionality:**  Provide a clear and easily accessible logout button for users.
    *   **Session Regeneration:** Regenerate the session ID after a successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Streamlit's Server-Side Execution Model -> [***3.1 Execute Arbitrary Code on Server***]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_streamlit's_server-side_execution_model_-__3_1_execute_arbitrary_code_on_server_.md)

*   This is a critical node representing the ultimate goal of many attacks. It has two high-risk paths leading to it:

    *   **3.1 -> [***3.1.1 Unsafe Deserialization***]**

        *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability where the Streamlit application (or a component it uses) deserializes untrusted data using an unsafe method (e.g., `pickle.loads` in Python without proper precautions).  This allows the attacker to inject malicious objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (If developers are aware of the risks and avoid unsafe deserialization practices.  However, it can be a high-risk vulnerability if developers are not careful.)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Full server compromise.)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding a vulnerable deserialization point and crafting a malicious payload.)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced (Requires a deep understanding of serialization and deserialization mechanisms, and the ability to craft exploit payloads.)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Static analysis tools might be able to detect the use of unsafe deserialization functions.  Runtime detection is more difficult, but intrusion detection systems might detect unusual activity.)
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Avoid Unsafe Deserialization:**  Do *not* use unsafe deserialization functions with untrusted data.
            *   **Use Safe Alternatives:**  If deserialization is necessary, use a safe alternative like `json.loads` for JSON data, or a secure deserialization library that provides protection against malicious payloads.
            *   **Input Validation:**  If you *must* use a potentially unsafe deserialization method, rigorously validate the input *before* deserialization to ensure it conforms to the expected format and does not contain any malicious code.

    *   **3.1 -> [***3.1.2 Lack of Input Sanitization***]**

        *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input to the Streamlit application that is not properly sanitized before being used in server-side code.  This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including command injection, SQL injection, and path traversal, ultimately allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If input sanitization is weak or absent.  This is a common vulnerability in web applications.)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Full server compromise.)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires identifying a vulnerable input field and crafting an exploit payload.)
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced (Requires a good understanding of web application security and various injection techniques.)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Web application firewalls (WAFs) and intrusion detection systems might detect common injection patterns.  Code analysis tools can also help identify potential vulnerabilities.)
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize *all* user input before using it in server-side code.  This includes removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters, and validating the input against a whitelist of allowed values or patterns.
            *   **Parameterized Queries:**  When interacting with databases, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.
            *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the Streamlit application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.
            *   **Output Encoding:** Encode data before displaying it to the user to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
            * **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions to validate the format and content of user input.
