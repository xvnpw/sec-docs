# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for streamlit/streamlit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Streamlit Input Components](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_streamlit_input_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all Streamlit input components (`st.text_input`, `st.number_input`, `st.selectbox`, `st.file_uploader`, etc.) in your application.
    2.  For each input component, define the expected data type, format, and constraints. Consider using Streamlit's built-in input type hints and validation features where available.
    3.  Implement validation logic *immediately* after receiving user input from Streamlit components, before using the input in any further processing or display within the Streamlit application.
    4.  Sanitize user input, especially text-based inputs from `st.text_input` or descriptions from `st.file_uploader`, to prevent HTML injection or other display-related vulnerabilities when rendered by Streamlit's output functions (`st.markdown`, `st.write`, `st.code`, etc.). Use appropriate escaping or sanitization functions relevant to the output context.
    5.  If validation fails within Streamlit, use Streamlit's error and warning display functions (`st.error`, `st.warning`) to provide immediate feedback to the user and prevent further processing with invalid input within the Streamlit application flow.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Streamlit output rendering - Severity: High
        *   Code Injection through manipulated Streamlit input (if improperly handled in backend logic) - Severity: High
        *   Data Integrity Issues within the Streamlit application logic - Severity: Medium

    *   **Impact:**
        *   XSS: High reduction - Prevents injection of malicious scripts that could be rendered by Streamlit's output functions, potentially compromising user sessions or application behavior within the Streamlit context.
        *   Code Injection: High reduction - Reduces the risk of user input, passed through Streamlit components, being used to inject malicious code into backend processes triggered by the Streamlit application.
        *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium reduction - Ensures data processed and displayed within the Streamlit application is in the expected format, reducing errors and unexpected behavior in the user interface and data visualizations.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented in the user login form (`app/auth.py`) which uses `st.text_input` and performs basic length checks, but sanitization for display is not explicitly implemented within Streamlit output.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Sanitization of user inputs for display within Streamlit components (`st.markdown`, `st.write`, `st.code`) is not consistently implemented across the application, particularly in data display sections (`app/data_analysis.py`) and file upload descriptions (`app/file_upload.py`).
        *   More robust validation beyond basic checks is needed for various Streamlit input components throughout the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Streamlit File Uploader Type and Size Restrictions](./mitigation_strategies/streamlit_file_uploader_type_and_size_restrictions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  For every `st.file_uploader` component used in your Streamlit application, explicitly define the `type` parameter to restrict allowed file extensions to only those strictly necessary for the application's intended functionality within Streamlit.
    2.  Implement size limits for files uploaded via `st.file_uploader`. Check the size of the uploaded file using `uploaded_file.size` (available directly from Streamlit's file uploader output) and reject files exceeding a defined reasonable limit. Use Streamlit's error display (`st.error`) to inform the user about file size restrictions.
    3.  Consider using Streamlit's progress bar (`st.progress`) in conjunction with file uploads to provide feedback to users during potentially lengthy upload processes, mitigating perceived DoS attempts.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via large file uploads through Streamlit - Severity: Medium
        *   Malware Upload and Potential Processing within Streamlit application - Severity: Medium (limited by Streamlit's execution environment, but still a risk if files are processed further)
        *   Streamlit Application Resource Exhaustion due to large file handling - Severity: Medium

    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS via large file uploads: Medium reduction - Limits the impact of users attempting to overload the Streamlit application by uploading excessively large files through the `st.file_uploader` component.
        *   Malware Upload and Potential Processing: Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of users uploading malicious files that could be processed by the Streamlit application, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in file processing libraries or backend systems if files are passed beyond Streamlit.
        *   Streamlit Application Resource Exhaustion: Medium reduction - Prevents excessive memory consumption and processing time within the Streamlit application itself due to handling very large files uploaded via `st.file_uploader`.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   File type restriction is implemented in the data upload section (`app/file_upload.py`) using `st.file_uploader`'s `type` parameter, allowing only CSV and TXT files within the Streamlit application.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   File size limits are not implemented for `st.file_uploader` in `app/file_upload.py`, leaving the Streamlit application vulnerable to resource exhaustion from large uploads.
        *   Progress bar feedback during file uploads using `st.progress` is not implemented, which could improve user experience and provide visual cues during uploads, especially for larger files handled by Streamlit.
