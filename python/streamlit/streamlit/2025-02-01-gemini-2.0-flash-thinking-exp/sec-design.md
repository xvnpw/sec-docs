# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Democratize machine learning and data science by making it easier to build and share interactive web applications.
  - Empower data scientists and machine learning engineers to quickly prototype and deploy their models and analyses as web apps without extensive web development expertise.
  - Foster a community around Streamlit, encouraging contributions and growth of the ecosystem.
  - Provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for data exploration, visualization, and presentation.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Streamlit could lead to data breaches or unauthorized access to applications built with Streamlit.
  - Lack of trust in the platform due to security concerns could hinder adoption, especially in enterprise environments.
  - Open-source nature means reliance on community contributions for security updates and vulnerability patching, which might have delays.
  - Potential misuse of Streamlit for malicious purposes if security is not adequately addressed.
  - Dependency on underlying Python ecosystem and its security posture.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities in Python packages. (Implemented in: Project's development practices and dependency management.)
  - security control: Code reviews for contributions to the open-source project. (Implemented in: GitHub pull request review process.)
  - security control: Input sanitization and output encoding to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS. (Implemented in: Streamlit framework codebase.)
  - security control: HTTPS enabled for Streamlit Cloud deployments. (Implemented in: Streamlit Cloud infrastructure.)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on user-provided Python code, which could introduce vulnerabilities if not written securely.
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature implies public disclosure of vulnerabilities, potentially increasing exploitation window.
  - accepted risk: Security of applications built with Streamlit is ultimately the responsibility of the application developer.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for Streamlit framework development.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits of the Streamlit framework and Streamlit Cloud.
  - security control: Provide security best practices and guidelines for developers building Streamlit applications.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms in Streamlit Cloud to protect against denial-of-service attacks.
  - security control: Enhance input validation and sanitization within the Streamlit framework to further mitigate injection vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: For Streamlit Cloud, implement robust authentication mechanisms to control access to deployed applications and user accounts.
    - Requirement: For self-hosted Streamlit applications, provide guidance and mechanisms for developers to integrate their own authentication solutions.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement authorization controls within Streamlit Cloud to manage user permissions and access to applications and resources.
    - Requirement: For self-hosted applications, provide guidance on implementing authorization logic within Streamlit applications based on user roles or permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Streamlit framework must enforce input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS) in user-provided code and Streamlit framework itself.
    - Requirement: Provide clear documentation and examples for developers on how to properly validate user inputs within their Streamlit applications.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use cryptography appropriately to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest within Streamlit Cloud infrastructure.
    - Requirement: Provide guidance to developers on how to use cryptography securely within their Streamlit applications when handling sensitive data.
    - Requirement: Ensure secure storage of secrets and API keys used by Streamlit Cloud and Streamlit applications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and distribution of the Streamlit library.
  - Operation of Streamlit Cloud service (if applicable).
  - Maintaining community trust and adoption of Streamlit.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Streamlit Framework Source Code: High sensitivity, compromise could lead to widespread vulnerabilities.
  - Streamlit Cloud User Data (if applicable): Medium to High sensitivity, depending on data stored (user accounts, application configurations).
  - Application Data processed by Streamlit applications: Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the application, could be highly sensitive (e.g., financial data, personal information). Streamlit itself does not directly handle this data, but applications built with it do.
  - Build and Release Pipeline Secrets: High sensitivity, compromise could lead to malicious code injection.
