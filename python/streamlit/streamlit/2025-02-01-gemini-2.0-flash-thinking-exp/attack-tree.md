## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Code via User Input [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to inject malicious code (e.g., Python code, shell commands) through user input fields within the Streamlit application. If the application does not properly sanitize and validate this input, the injected code can be executed by the server.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Significant to Critical (Server compromise, data breach, data manipulation)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult

*   **Attack Vector: Trigger Server-Side Code Execution [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** This is the successful outcome of the "Inject Malicious Code via User Input" attack. The attacker's malicious payload is executed on the server, potentially gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (dependent on successful injection)
    *   **Impact:** Significant to Critical (Server compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service)
    *   **Effort:** N/A (Outcome of previous step)
    *   **Skill Level:** N/A (Outcome of previous step)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult

*   **Attack Vector: Trigger Deserialization of Malicious Objects [CRITICAL NODE] (Potentially High Impact)**
    *   **Description:** If the Streamlit application uses `st.session_state` to store complex Python objects, and if custom serialization/deserialization is implemented insecurely or vulnerabilities exist in the serialization process, attackers might attempt to inject malicious serialized objects. Upon deserialization by the server, this could lead to code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (requires specific conditions and vulnerabilities)
    *   **Impact:** Critical (Remote Code Execution)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Medium Risk Path: Exploit Information Disclosure via Streamlit Features](./attack_tree_paths/medium_risk_path_exploit_information_disclosure_via_streamlit_features.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Extract Sensitive Information from Debug Output or Logs [CRITICAL NODE] (Information Disclosure)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations or poor practices that lead to sensitive information being exposed in debug output, server logs, or error messages. This information could include file paths, database credentials, internal application logic, or other confidential data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if verbose logging or poor error handling is present)
    *   **Impact:** Minor to Moderate (Information Disclosure, potentially leading to further attacks)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if logs are accessible or errors are displayed)

*   **Attack Vector: Exploit Error Handling to Reveal Information [CRITICAL NODE] (Information Disclosure)**
    *   **Description:** Similar to the above, attackers trigger application errors by providing unexpected input or actions. If error handling is not properly implemented, error messages displayed to users or logged on the server might reveal sensitive information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if error handling is not robust)
    *   **Impact:** Minor to Moderate (Information Disclosure, potentially leading to further attacks)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if errors are displayed to users)

## Attack Tree Path: [Medium Risk Path: Exploit Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/medium_risk_path_exploit_denial_of_service__dos__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Resource Exhaustion via Input Flooding [CRITICAL NODE] (DoS)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers flood the Streamlit application with a large volume of requests, specifically crafted to trigger resource-intensive operations within the application. This can overwhelm server resources (CPU, memory, network) and lead to a denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (easy to automate)
    *   **Impact:** Significant (Denial of Service, application unavailability)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

*   **Attack Vector: Exploit WebSocket Connection Limits [CRITICAL NODE] (DoS)**
    *   **Description:** Streamlit relies heavily on WebSocket connections for real-time updates. Attackers attempt to exhaust server resources by establishing a massive number of WebSocket connections to the Streamlit server. If the server is not properly configured to handle connection limits, this can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if server is not configured for WebSocket limits)
    *   **Impact:** Significant (Denial of Service, application unavailability)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

## Attack Tree Path: [Medium Risk Path: Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/medium_risk_path_exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Exploit Vulnerable Dependency [CRITICAL NODE] (Potentially High Impact)**
    *   **Description:** Streamlit applications depend on various Python packages. If any of these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application. The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability and the affected dependency.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if vulnerable dependencies are present and exploitable)
    *   **Impact:** Moderate to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and exploited component, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (if exploits are available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult
