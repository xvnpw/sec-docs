# Attack Surface Analysis for streamlit/streamlit

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Python Code Execution via User Input](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_python_code_execution_via_user_input.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary Python code on the server by manipulating user inputs that are not properly sanitized and are processed as code.
*   **Streamlit Contribution:** Streamlit's core functionality involves executing Python code based on user interactions with widgets. If user input is directly used in functions that render content or influence application logic *without sanitization within the Streamlit application code*, it creates a direct pathway for code injection. Streamlit itself doesn't automatically sanitize all user inputs used in application logic.
*   **Example:** A Streamlit app takes user input for a filename and uses `st.write(open(user_input).read())`. An attacker inputs `config.toml` or `../../sensitive_file.txt` to read arbitrary files, or more maliciously, injects code if the input is processed in a vulnerable way later in the application logic (though less likely to be directly exploitable in `st.write` rendering context, more likely in other code paths involving `eval` or `exec` if used by the developer).
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, malicious modifications to the application or server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never use `eval()` or `exec()` with user input within Streamlit application code.** Avoid dynamic code execution based on user-provided strings.
    *   **Sanitize and validate all user inputs rigorously *within the Streamlit application code*.**  Use input validation libraries and techniques to ensure inputs conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious code *before using them in any processing or rendering within the Streamlit app*.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Streamlit application with minimal necessary permissions to limit the impact of code execution vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review:** Regularly review Streamlit application code for potential code injection vulnerabilities, especially where user input is processed.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in Streamlit's dependencies (Python packages it relies on) can be exploited to compromise the application.
*   **Streamlit Contribution:** Streamlit depends on numerous third-party Python packages. Vulnerabilities in these packages indirectly become vulnerabilities in Streamlit applications. Streamlit's dependency management practices and release cycle directly influence how quickly applications can be patched against these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in the `Pillow` library (used by Streamlit for image processing). An attacker crafts a malicious image that, when processed by a Streamlit app using `st.image`, triggers the vulnerability, leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update Streamlit and all its dependencies.** Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use dependency pinning in `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` to ensure consistent and controlled dependency versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories for Streamlit and its dependencies to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use Virtual Environments:** Isolate Streamlit applications in virtual environments to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with system-wide packages.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Controlled URLs](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_user-controlled_urls.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can trick the server into making requests to unintended internal or external resources by providing malicious URLs as input.
*   **Streamlit Contribution:** Streamlit applications might use user-provided URLs for features like displaying images (`st.image`), audio (`st.audio`), or fetching data. If these URLs are not validated *within the Streamlit application code*, SSRF vulnerabilities can occur. Streamlit provides the functions that can process URLs, making it a direct contributor if developers use them insecurely.
*   **Example:** A Streamlit app allows users to input an image URL using `st.text_input("Image URL")` and then displays it with `st.image(user_input)`. An attacker provides a URL like `http://localhost:6379/` (Redis default port) or `http://internal.service.local/sensitive-data` to probe internal services or access restricted resources.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, denial of service (by targeting internal services), potential for further attacks on internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Medium** (depending on the internal network and resources - considering user request was for High and Critical only, we keep this as it can be High depending on context)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **URL Validation and Sanitization *within the Streamlit application code*.**  Validate user-provided URLs against a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols *in the Streamlit application*. Sanitize URLs to remove potentially malicious characters *in the application logic*.
    *   **Restrict Outbound Network Access:** Configure network firewalls or security groups to limit the Streamlit application's ability to make outbound requests to internal networks or sensitive external resources (infrastructure level mitigation).
    *   **Use URL Parsing Libraries:** Use secure URL parsing libraries to properly handle and validate URLs, avoiding manual string manipulation that can be error-prone *within the Streamlit application code*.
    *   **Avoid Direct URL Usage:** If possible, avoid directly using user-provided URLs for backend requests. Consider using identifiers or indirect references instead *in the Streamlit application design*.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized User Input in Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_user_input_in_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's output, which is then executed in other users' browsers when they view the application.
*   **Streamlit Contribution:** While Streamlit provides *some* built-in sanitization, vulnerabilities can arise if developers bypass these mechanisms or use custom components that are not security-aware when rendering user input *within their Streamlit application*. `st.markdown` and custom HTML components are potential areas where developers might introduce unsanitized content. Streamlit's rendering functions are the direct mechanism for displaying content, making it a contributor if developers use them incorrectly.
*   **Example:** A Streamlit app uses `st.markdown(f"User comment: {user_input}")`. If `user_input` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, this script will be executed in the browser of anyone viewing the application, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other malicious actions.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Medium** (depending on the sensitivity of the application and user data - considering user request was for High and Critical only, we keep this as it can be High depending on context)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always sanitize user input before rendering it in the frontend *within the Streamlit application code*.** Use Streamlit's built-in sanitization features and be cautious when using `st.markdown` or custom HTML components, ensuring *application-level sanitization*.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the *impact* of XSS attacks (browser-level mitigation, but good practice).
    *   **Output Encoding:** Ensure proper output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) to prevent user input from being interpreted as code by the browser *within the Streamlit application code*.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities *in the Streamlit application*.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via User Input Passed to System Commands](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_user_input_passed_to_system_commands.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into user input that is then used to construct and execute system commands on the server.
*   **Streamlit Contribution:** If Streamlit applications use user input to build system commands (e.g., using `subprocess`) *within the application code*, and input is not properly sanitized *by the developer*, command injection vulnerabilities can occur. Streamlit provides the platform where developers can introduce this vulnerability through their code.
*   **Example:** A Streamlit app allows users to specify a filename to process and uses `subprocess.run(['process_file.sh', user_input])`. An attacker inputs `; rm -rf / #` which, if not properly handled *in the application code*, could lead to the execution of `rm -rf /` on the server.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, malicious modifications to the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid executing system commands based on user input whenever possible *in Streamlit applications*.**  Find alternative solutions that do not involve system commands.
    *   **If system commands are absolutely necessary, use parameterized commands or safe APIs *within the Streamlit application code*.**  Avoid string concatenation to build commands.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization *within the Streamlit application code*.**  If system commands are unavoidable, rigorously validate and sanitize user input to ensure it cannot be used to inject malicious commands. Use whitelisting and escape special characters *in the application logic*.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Streamlit application with minimal necessary permissions to limit the impact of command injection vulnerabilities (OS level mitigation).
