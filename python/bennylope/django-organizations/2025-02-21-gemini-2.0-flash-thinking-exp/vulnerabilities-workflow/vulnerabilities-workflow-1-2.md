- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Django Settings – Hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG Enabled
  **Description:**
  Multiple configuration files in the project insecurely configure Django for development rather than production. In particular:
  - In `/code/manage.py` and `/code/conftest.py`, Django is configured with `DEBUG=True` and a hardcoded secret key (`"ThisIsHorriblyInsecure"`).
  - In `/code/example/conf/settings.py`, the production settings file also explicitly sets `DEBUG=True` and uses a hardcoded secret key (`"7@m$nx@q%-$la^fy_(-rhxtvoxk118hrprg=q86f"`).
  An attacker can trigger an error (for example, by accessing a URL that causes an exception) and cause Django to serve its detailed debug traceback page. This page exposes sensitive information (such as configuration details, internal paths, environment details, and secret key information), which an attacker can use to forge session cookies, CSRF tokens, or otherwise compromise the application’s authentication and data integrity.

  **Impact:**
  - **Confidentiality:** Detailed debug pages divulge internal configurations and sensitive cryptographic details.
  - **Integrity:** Knowledge of the hardcoded secret keys allows an attacker to forge or tamper with signed data (e.g., session cookies) and impersonate legitimate users.
  - **Availability:** Exposed configuration details can aid attackers in planning further attacks against the infrastructure.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None. The project directly hardcodes insecure default values in configuration files (such as in `/code/manage.py`, `/code/conftest.py`, and `/code/example/conf/settings.py`), without any dynamic or environment-dependent configuration.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system to inject a strong, random SECRET_KEY for production deployments.
  - Set `DEBUG=False` for production environments.
  - Ensure that production-oriented settings (such as a properly restricted `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list) are enforced.

  **Preconditions:**
  - The application is deployed to a publicly accessible environment using these default configuration files without overriding the insecure settings.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `/code/manage.py` and `/code/conftest.py`, Django is configured as follows:
    ```python
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        ...,
        SECRET_KEY="ThisIsHorriblyInsecure",
        ...
    )
    ```
    This forces the use of an insecure secret key and enables debug mode.
  - In `/code/example/conf/settings.py`, the following insecure assignments are made:
    ```python
    DEBUG = True
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG
    ...
    SECRET_KEY = "7@m$nx@q%-$la^fy_(-rhxtvoxk118hrprg=q86f"
    ```
    As these settings are loaded in production (unless specifically overridden), any error triggered in the application will render a detailed debug page exposing these values.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Deployment Setup:**
     - Deploy the Django application using the provided configuration files (ensuring that the hardcoded SECRET_KEY and `DEBUG=True` remain unchanged).
  2. **Trigger an Application Error:**
     - As an external attacker (without any authentication), request a URL that is known to either not exist or craft parameters that trigger an exception in one of the views.
  3. **Observe Debug Output:**
     - Verify that Django’s debug page is rendered, displaying the full traceback and configuration details, including the insecure SECRET_KEY.
  4. **Session Tampering Attempt:**
     - Using the known SECRET_KEY, attempt to forge a signed cookie or CSRF token to impersonate a user.
  5. **Document Findings:**
     - Record that the application divulges sensitive configuration data and that the use of predictable, hardcoded secret keys poses a total compromise risk if exploited.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Missing Clickjacking Protection – X-Frame-Options Header Not Set
  **Description:**
  The project’s settings file (`/code/example/conf/settings.py`) does not enable clickjacking protection because the middleware responsible for setting the `X-Frame-Options` header is commented out. Specifically, in the `MIDDLEWARE` list the line:
  ```python
  # 'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
  ```
  remains disabled. As a result, an attacker can load the application in an iframe on a malicious website and employ clickjacking techniques to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions, such as clicking on concealed buttons or links.

  **Impact:**
  - **User Security:** Authenticated users may be tricked into performing actions without their consent (e.g., transferring funds, changing settings, or divulging sensitive data).
  - **Reputation and Data Integrity:** Repeated clickjacking attacks could lead to loss of user trust and compromise sensitive transactions or administrative actions.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The code contains a commented suggestion to enable the clickjacking middleware but does not actively include it in the middleware stack. There are no other custom protections configured for clickjacking.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Enable the `django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware` in the `MIDDLEWARE` list for all deployment environments (or at minimum for production).
  - Alternatively, configure the web server (e.g., via HTTP headers) to enforce an appropriate `X-Frame-Options` policy (such as `SAMEORIGIN`).

  **Preconditions:**
  - The application is deployed in an environment where the middleware is not overridden and is accessible to external attackers.
  - Users engage with the site through a browser that honors the `X-Frame-Options` header (or its absence can be exploited).

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `/code/example/conf/settings.py`, observe the middleware configuration:
    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware",
        # Uncomment the next line for simple clickjacking protection:
        # 'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
    ]
    ```
    The absence of `XFrameOptionsMiddleware` means that the response headers do not automatically include `X-Frame-Options`, leaving pages vulnerable to being embedded in iframes on malicious sites.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Deployment Setup:**
     - Deploy the Django application using the provided settings (which do not include the clickjacking protection middleware).
  2. **Construct a Malicious Page:**
     - Create an external HTML page on a domain controlled by the attacker that contains an iframe embedding the deployed application’s URL.
  3. **User Interaction Simulation:**
     - Simulate user interaction by accessing the malicious page with a browser.
  4. **Header Inspection:**
     - Using browser developer tools, inspect the HTTP response headers of the embedded application pages to verify that the `X-Frame-Options` header is missing.
  5. **Demonstrate Exploit Potential:**
     - (Optionally) Design a simple clickjacking demo where a button on the embedded site is overlaid with deceptive UI elements, showcasing how a user could be tricked into clicking an action they did not intend.
  6. **Document Findings:**
     - Record that the application does not provide the necessary clickjacking protection and that enabling the middleware (or an equivalent server configuration) is required to mitigate this vulnerability.
