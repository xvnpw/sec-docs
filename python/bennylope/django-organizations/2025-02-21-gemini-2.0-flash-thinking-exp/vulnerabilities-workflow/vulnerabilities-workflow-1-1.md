### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Email Header Injection in Organization Invitations

* Description:
    1. An attacker initiates the organization invitation process by attempting to add a new user to an organization.
    2. In the "email address" field for the new user (which corresponds to the `invitee_identifier` field in the `OrganizationInvitationBase` model), the attacker enters a specially crafted email address. This crafted email address includes additional email headers, such as `attacker@example.com%0ABcc:attacker2@example.com`. The `%0A` represents a newline character, which is used to inject new headers.
    3. The application's invitation system processes this input and uses the `invitee_identifier` to send an invitation email.
    4. Due to insufficient sanitization of the `invitee_identifier`, the injected headers are included in the email being sent.
    5. The email is sent, and the injected `Bcc:attacker2@example.com` header causes a blind carbon copy of the invitation email to be sent to `attacker2@example.com`, without the knowledge of the intended recipient or the organization.

* Impact:
    * **Information Disclosure**: Attackers can potentially BCC themselves to invitation emails, gaining unauthorized access to invitation details and potentially sensitive organization information being sent in the email body.
    * **Phishing and Spam**: By injecting headers, attackers could manipulate email headers to bypass spam filters or conduct more sophisticated phishing attacks.
    * **Email Spoofing**: In more advanced scenarios, header injection vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for email spoofing.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * No specific mitigations are implemented in the provided code to prevent email header injection for the `invitee_identifier` field. The code uses `EmailMultiAlternatives` in `src/organizations/backends/defaults.py` (and `EmailMessage` in `src/organizations/backends/modeled.py`), which can mitigate some basic header injection if used correctly, but it does not automatically sanitize user inputs embedded within template contexts that are then used to construct email headers. The sanitization of the subject line `subject = " ".join(subject.split())` is present in `src/organizations/backends/defaults.py` and `src/organizations/backends/modeled.py`, but this is not relevant to header injection via `invitee_identifier`.

* Missing mitigations:
    * **Input Sanitization**: The `invitee_identifier` field should be rigorously sanitized before being used in any email sending process, especially if it's incorporated into email headers (To:, Cc:, Bcc:, Subject:, From:, etc.).  Specifically, newline characters and other header-injection-related characters should be encoded or stripped to prevent interpretation as email headers. This sanitization should be implemented before the `invitee_identifier` is used to construct the email in functions like `email_message` in `src/organizations/backends/defaults.py` and `src/organizations/backends/modeled.py`.
    * **Secure Email API Usage**: Ensure that the email sending API is used in a way that prevents header injection. For instance, using parameters of the email API to set recipients and other headers rather than embedding user-controlled data directly into header strings. Review and refactor email sending functions in `src/organizations/backends/defaults.py` and `src/organizations/backends/modeled.py` to ensure secure API usage.
    * **Security Audit of Email Handling**: A thorough security review of all email sending functionalities is needed to identify all potential injection points and apply appropriate sanitization or secure coding practices, especially focusing on how user inputs are handled within email templates used in `src/organizations/backends/defaults.py` and `src/organizations/backends/modeled.py`.

* Preconditions:
    * The application must have a publicly accessible organization invitation feature that utilizes the `invitee_identifier` in a way that can influence email headers.
    * The email sending mechanism must not automatically sanitize or encode header-injection characters in the `invitee_identifier`.

* Source code analysis:
    * **File: src/organizations/backends/defaults.py**
        ```python
        from django.core.mail import EmailMessage

        class BaseBackend:
            # ...
            def email_message(
                self,
                user,
                subject_template,
                body_template,
                sender=None,
                message_class=EmailMessage, # or EmailMultiAlternatives
                **kwargs,
            ):
                # ...
                subject_template = loader.get_template(subject_template)
                body_template = loader.get_template(body_template)
                subject = subject_template.render(
                    kwargs
                ).strip()  # Remove stray newline characters
                body = body_template.render(kwargs)
                return message_class(subject, body, from_email, [user.email], headers=headers)
        ```
        This code snippet from `BaseBackend` in `src/organizations/backends/defaults.py` (and similar `email_message` in `ModelInvitation` in `src/organizations/backends/modeled.py`) shows that email subjects and bodies are rendered from templates. If the `invitee_identifier` is used in these templates without sanitization, it can lead to header injection. The `subject = " ".join(subject.split())` is present, but it only removes extra spaces and newlines within the subject line, not preventing header injection via `invitee_identifier` if it's used in the subject or body templates.

    * **File: src/organizations/base.py**
        ```python
        class AbstractBaseInvitation(models.Model):
            # ...
            invitee_identifier = models.CharField(
                max_length=1000,
                help_text=_(
                    "The contact identifier for the invitee, email, phone number,"
                    " social media handle, etc."
                ),
            )
            # ...
        ```
        The `invitee_identifier` field, defined in `AbstractBaseInvitation` in `src/organizations/base.py`, is a `CharField` and can accept arbitrary strings without sanitization. This field is intended to store the invitee's email or other identifier, and if used directly in email construction, it's a potential injection point.

    * **File: src/organizations/forms.py**
        ```python
        class OrganizationUserAddForm(forms.ModelForm):
            email = forms.EmailField(max_length=75)
            # ...
            def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
                # ...
                user = invitation_backend().invite_by_email(
                    self.cleaned_data["email"],
                    **{
                        "domain": get_current_site(self.request),
                        "organization": self.organization,
                        "sender": self.request.user,
                    },
                )
                # ...
        ```
        The `OrganizationUserAddForm` in `src/organizations/forms.py` takes user-provided email and passes it to `invitation_backend().invite_by_email`. This email is then used as `invitee_identifier` when creating an invitation in `ModelInvitation.invite_by_email` in `src/organizations/backends/modeled.py`, highlighting the path of unsanitized user input to email sending functions.

* Security test case:
    1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have an account capable of inviting users to an organization in a deployed instance of the application.
    2. **Login**: Log in to the application with an administrative user who has permissions to invite new users to an organization.
    3. **Navigate to Invite User**: Go to the organization's user management page and find the "Invite User" or "Add User" functionality.
    4. **Craft Malicious Email**: In the email address field, enter the following crafted email address: `testuser@example.com%0ABcc:attacker_email_address@malicious.com`. Replace `attacker_email_address@malicious.com` with an email address you control to verify the BCC injection.
    5. **Send Invitation**: Submit the invitation form.
    6. **Check Email Headers**:
        * **For Attacker Email Address**: Check the inbox of `attacker_email_address@malicious.com`. If you receive a copy of the invitation email, this indicates successful BCC header injection.
        * **Alternatively (if direct inbox access is not possible)**: Inspect the email headers of the invitation email received by `testuser@example.com` (if possible, depending on the application's setup and your access). Look for injected headers like `Bcc: attacker_email_address@malicious.com`. This step might be more challenging as direct access to sent email headers might not be readily available in all testing environments.
    7. **Verify Vulnerability**: If the attacker email address receives a BCC of the invitation email, or if injected headers are found in the email headers, the Email Header Injection vulnerability is confirmed.
