- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via Environment Variable File Inclusion in FileAwareMapping
  - **Description:**  
    The class that wraps over the process environment variables—especially its “\_FILE” feature in the `FileAwareMapping` class—directly uses the value of an environment variable (with a “_FILE” suffix) as the path to read a file. In other words, if an environment variable such as “SECRET_KEY_FILE” is set, a call later to retrieve “SECRET_KEY” does not return the literal environment value but instead opens and reads the file indicated. An attacker who can influence environment configuration (for example, via misconfigured container deployments, compromised CI/CD pipelines, or configuration injection in some hosts) could set such a variable to reference any file on disk (e.g. “/etc/passwd” or other sensitive files). When the application resolves that key through its lookup mechanism, the file’s contents will be read and (if later exposed by the application, for example in error reports or debug output) may lead to disclosure of system data.
    
  - **Impact:**  
    Exploitation allows an attacker to force the application to read arbitrary files that its process account can access. This may lead to sensitive data disclosure (such as system password files, cryptographic keys, or configuration files), which in turn can facilitate further compromise of the system.
    
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**  
    **High**
    
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The current implementation in the project simply checks for the existence of a “_FILE”–suffixed key in the environment and uses its value directly as the file path (via a plain call to Python’s built‑in `open()`). There is no input or path validation before reading the file.
    
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • No validation or sanitization is performed on the file path passed via the environment variable.  
    • There is no whitelist or restriction enforcing that only files from an allowed directory (for example, a dedicated configuration directory) be read.  
    • Additional logging and monitoring of suspicious file references is absent.
    
  - **Preconditions:**  
    • The attacker must be able to influence or control the environment variables for the running application (for instance, via misconfigurations in container orchestration, injection through non‑secured deployment pipelines, or by other means in multi-tenant environments).  
    • The application must use the “\_FILE” lookup feature (for example, by calling `env("SECRET_KEY")` while “SECRET_KEY_FILE” is set) so that the file path provided by the environment is read at runtime.
    
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    1. In the file **environ/fileaware_mapping.py**, the `__getitem__` method is defined as follows:  
       ```python
       def __getitem__(self, key):
           if self.cache and key in self.files_cache:
               return self.files_cache[key]
           key_file = self.env.get(key + "_FILE")
           if key_file:
               with open(key_file, encoding='utf-8') as f:
                   value = f.read()
               if self.cache:
                   self.files_cache[key] = value
               return value
           return self.env[key]
       ```  
    2. Notice that if an environment variable with the suffix “_FILE” is present (for example, “SECRET_KEY_FILE”), its value is used directly as the file path in the `open()` call.  
    3. There is no check to verify that the file path (e.g. `/etc/passwd` or another sensitive file) is inside an allowed or expected directory.  
    4. Thus, if an attacker can set such an environment variable, any readable file can be loaded by the application when it performs a lookup using the primary key name.
    
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Test Setup:**  
       - In a controlled test or staging environment, create a temporary file (e.g. `/tmp/test_secret.txt`) with known sensitive content (for example, "sensitive-data").  
       - Override the process environment (or use a fake mapping) so that the key `MY_SECRET_FILE` is set to the full path of the temporary file.  
    2. **Execution:**  
       - Using the `FileAwareMapping` class (or the higher‑level `Env` class that relies on it), attempt to retrieve the value by calling, for example, `env("MY_SECRET")`.  
       - In this configuration the absence of a normal “MY_SECRET” variable should force the lookup to check for “MY_SECRET_FILE” and then read its content.
    3. **Verification:**  
       - Verify that the returned value from the lookup exactly equals the contents of the temporary file.  
       - Next, modify the test by setting `MY_SECRET_FILE` to a known sensitive file path (for instance, “/etc/passwd” on a system where it is safe to do so in a test environment) and confirm that the lookup returns the content of that file.  
       - Confirm that no path restrictions or sanitization is applied (for example, by testing with both absolute and relative paths).
    4. **Conclusion:**  
       - If the application returns the file contents as provided by the environment variable bypassing any validation, the test successfully demonstrates the arbitrary file read vulnerability.
       
By addressing this vulnerability—by validating or restricting the allowed file paths when using the “_FILE” suffix feature—the risk of arbitrary file reads and confidential data disclosure can be significantly mitigated.
