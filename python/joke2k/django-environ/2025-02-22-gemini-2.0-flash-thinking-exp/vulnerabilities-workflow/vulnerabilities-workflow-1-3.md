### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in FileAwareMapping leading to arbitrary file read
- Description:
    1. An attacker can control environment variables of an application that uses `django-environ`'s `FileAwareMapping`.
    2. The attacker sets an environment variable with a `_FILE` suffix (e.g., `CONFIG_FILE`).
    3. The value of this environment variable is set to an absolute path pointing to a sensitive file on the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/app/sensitive_config.ini`).
    4. When the application uses `environ('CONFIG')` to access the environment variable, `FileAwareMapping.__getitem__` is triggered.
    5. `FileAwareMapping` checks for the existence of `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.
    6. It finds `CONFIG_FILE` and opens the file at the path specified by the attacker-controlled environment variable *without any path validation*.
    7. The content of the attacker-specified file is read and returned as the value of `environ('CONFIG')`.
    8. If the application then exposes this value (e.g., logs it, displays it, uses it in an error message), the attacker can read the content of arbitrary files on the server.
- Impact:
    - High - Information Disclosure. An external attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, application code, or system files, depending on the application's environment and file permissions. This can lead to further attacks, such as privilege escalation or data breaches.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code in `FileAwareMapping.__getitem__` directly opens and reads the file path provided in the environment variable without any validation or sanitization.
    - There are no checks to ensure the file path is within an expected directory or to prevent traversal outside of allowed paths.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement path sanitization and validation in `FileAwareMapping.__getitem__`.
    - Ensure that the file path provided in the `*_FILE` environment variable is within an expected base directory.
    - Use `os.path.abspath` to resolve the path and then check if it starts with a safe, predefined base path.
    - Consider using more restrictive file access permissions for the application to limit the impact of potential path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must be using `django-environ` and specifically utilize `FileAwareMapping` (or `FileAwareEnv`).
    - An attacker must be able to control or influence environment variables that are used by the application and processed by `FileAwareMapping`. This could happen if the application reads environment variables from external sources that are attacker-influenced (e.g., through a web interface, API, or shared configuration).
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    File: /code/environ/fileaware_mapping.py

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if self.cache and key in self.files_cache:
            return self.files_cache[key]
        key_file = self.env.get(key + "_FILE") # [POINT-OF-INTEREST 1] - Retrieving file path from environment variable
        if key_file:
            with open(key_file, encoding='utf-8') as f: # [POINT-OF-INTEREST 2] - Directly opening file from attacker-controlled path
                value = f.read()
            if self.cache:
                self.files_cache[key] = value
            return value
        return self.env[key]
    ```
    - **[POINT-OF-INTEREST 1]**: The code retrieves the file path directly from the environment variable `key + "_FILE"` without any validation. This means the attacker has direct control over the `key_file` path.
    - **[POINT-OF-INTEREST 2]**: The `open(key_file, ...)` function is called directly with the attacker-controlled `key_file` path. There is no check to ensure that `key_file` is safe or within expected boundaries. This allows path traversal if the attacker provides a path like `/../../../../etc/passwd`.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a test Django project that uses `django-environ`.
    2. Modify the Django settings to use `environ.FileAwareEnv` instead of `environ.Env`:
        ```python
        # settings.py
        import environ

        env = environ.FileAwareEnv()
        READ_FROM_FILE_CONFIG = env('READ_FROM_FILE_CONFIG')
        ```
    3. Create a simple Django view that displays the value of `READ_FROM_FILE_CONFIG`:
        ```python
        # views.py
        from django.shortcuts import render
        from django.conf import settings

        def test_view(request):
            config_value = settings.READ_FROM_FILE_CONFIG
            return render(request, 'test_template.html', {'config_value': config_value})
        ```
    4. Create a template `test_template.html` to display the `config_value`.
    5. Run the Django development server.
    6. **Attacker Action:** Before accessing the view, set the environment variable `READ_FROM_FILE_CONFIG_FILE` to point to a sensitive file, for example:
       ```bash
       export READ_FROM_FILE_CONFIG_FILE="/etc/passwd"
       ```
    7. **Attacker Action:** Access the Django view in a browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/test_view/`).
    8. **Verification:** Observe that the content of `/etc/passwd` (or the file specified in step 6) is displayed in the web page, demonstrating successful arbitrary file read due to path traversal.
