### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Inadequate validation of sparse fieldset parameters leading to potential information disclosure

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a request to a JSON:API endpoint that supports sparse fieldsets.
    2. The attacker includes the `fields[resource_name]` query parameter with a value that contains special characters or unexpected field names, potentially not corresponding to actual serializer fields.
    3. The `JSONRenderer._filter_sparse_fields` method in `rest_framework_json_api/renderers.py` retrieves this value from `request.query_params` and splits it by commas without proper validation or sanitization of individual field names.
    4. While the current code iterates through serializer fields and checks for inclusion based on the split `sparse_fields`, inadequate validation of `sparse_fields` values could lead to unexpected behavior if a crafted value bypasses intended filtering, potentially exposing more data than intended or causing backend errors.
    5. Although direct injection into field names seems limited by the serializer's field definitions, the lack of validation on the input `sparse_fieldset_value` itself is a potential vulnerability. It could be exploited if future code changes or specific serializer configurations introduce weaknesses when handling these unfiltered field names.

- Impact:
    - High: Potential information disclosure. While the immediate risk might be low due to the current field filtering logic, inadequate validation opens the door for future vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior that could lead to exposing sensitive data if field filtering is bypassed or if backend errors expose information.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code retrieves and processes the `fields[resource_name]` query parameter without any explicit validation of the field names provided.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Implement robust validation for the `fields[resource_name]` query parameter to ensure that only valid field names for the given resource are accepted. This validation should occur in `JSONRenderer._filter_sparse_fields` before splitting and using the field names.
    - Sanitization: Sanitize the input field names to remove any potentially malicious characters or unexpected input.

- Preconditions:
    - The API endpoint must be using `rest_framework_json_api.renderers.JSONRenderer`.
    - The API endpoint must support sparse fieldsets, which is the default behavior when using `rest_framework_json_api.serializers.ModelSerializer` and `rest_framework_json_api.views.ModelViewSet`.
    - The application must be deployed publicly and accessible to external attackers.

- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    File: /code/rest_framework_json_api/renderers.py
    ```
    ```python
    @classmethod
    def _filter_sparse_fields(cls, serializer, fields, resource_name):
        request = serializer.context.get("request")
        if request:
            sparse_fieldset_query_param = f"fields[{resource_name}]"
            sparse_fieldset_value = request.query_params.get(
                sparse_fieldset_query_param
            )
            if sparse_fieldset_value is not None: # <-- Input from query parameter is used without validation
                sparse_fields = sparse_fieldset_value.split(",") # <-- Input is split by comma without validation
                return {
                    field_name: field
                    for field_name, field, in fields.items()
                    if field.field_name in sparse_fields # <-- Filtering logic based on unvalidated input
                    # URL field is not considered a field in JSON:API spec
                    # but a link so need to keep it
                    or (
                        field.field_name == api_settings.URL_FIELD_NAME
                        and isinstance(field, relations.HyperlinkedIdentityField)
                    )
                }

        return fields
    ```
    - The `_filter_sparse_fields` method retrieves the `fields[resource_name]` query parameter value directly from `request.query_params` without validation.
    - It then splits this value by commas to create a list of `sparse_fields`.
    - The code iterates through the serializer's `fields` and includes a field in the output only if its `field.field_name` is present in the `sparse_fields` list or if it's the URL field.
    - The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of `sparse_fieldset_value`. An attacker could potentially inject crafted values here. While the current filtering logic might limit immediate exploitation, it's a risky pattern.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Send a GET request to a JSON:API endpoint that supports sparse fieldsets (e.g., `/blogs/`).
    2. Include the `fields[Blog]` query parameter with an invalid or unexpected value, for example: `fields[Blog]=name,invalid-field,name`.
    3. Observe the response. While in the current implementation it might not directly expose extra data due to the field check against serializer fields, a lack of validation is present.
    4. To enhance the test case for future potential vulnerabilities, try injecting special characters or very long strings in `fields[Blog]` to observe if it causes any backend errors or unexpected behavior that might indicate a deeper issue related to how unvalidated input is handled. For example: `fields[Blog]=name,very-long-field-name-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`.
    5. Examine the server-side logs for any errors or warnings related to processing the crafted `fields[Blog]` parameter. While a successful exploit might not be immediately apparent due to current filtering, the lack of validation is a vulnerability that should be addressed to prevent future exploits or unexpected behavior arising from input injection.
