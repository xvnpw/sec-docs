Here is the updated list of vulnerabilities, filtered and formatted as requested:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Misconfigured ReadOnlyModelViewSet Allows Write Operations
  - **Description:**
    The custom “read‑only” viewset class is derived from DRF’s ReadOnlyModelViewSet but overrides its default allowed HTTP methods to include POST, PATCH, and DELETE. An attacker may send write‑oriented requests (such as POST, PATCH, or DELETE) to an endpoint implemented using this class when the developer intended it to be read‑only.
    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**
    1. An attacker identifies an endpoint built with ReadOnlyModelViewSet.
    2. The attacker sends HTTP POST, PATCH, or DELETE requests containing valid JSON:API payloads.
    3. Due to the permissive method list and lack of strict permission checks, the endpoint processes the request and modifies or deletes data.
  - **Impact:**
    Unauthorized modifications or deletions occur on data that should be immutable, compromising data integrity and violating the principle of least privilege.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The base class currently lists “get”, “post”, “patch”, “delete”, “head”, and “options” as allowed HTTP methods.
    - Custom actions using the @action decorator may override behavior, but endpoints built with this base class remain at risk if they assume read‑only behavior.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Use a stricter default that limits http_method_names to only “get”, “head”, and “options” for read‑only endpoints.
    - Apply additional default permission enforcement on endpoints intended to be read‑only.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An API endpoint is implemented using the provided ReadOnlyModelViewSet without any additional restrictions on HTTP methods or permissions.
    - The endpoint is publicly accessible.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/rest_framework_json_api/views.py` (and corroborated by tests in `/code/tests/views.py`), the custom ReadOnlyModelViewSet shows that non‑safe methods are allowed by default.
    - The design allows developer‑override through custom actions; however, the default behavior is too permissive for endpoints intended only for data retrieval.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy an endpoint using ReadOnlyModelViewSet without additional method or permission restrictions.
    2. Send an HTTP DELETE request (e.g. `DELETE /some_resource/1/`) with a valid JSON:API payload.
    3. Confirm that the resource is removed.
    4. Repeat with POST and PATCH requests to verify that write operations are accepted without explicit permission checks.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unrestricted CRUD Operations due to Lack of Access Controls
  - **Description:**
    Multiple endpoints—including those for blogs, entries, comments, companies, and projects—inherit directly from ModelViewSet without specifying any permission classes or access control measures.
    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**
    1. An attacker sends a POST request (for example, to `/blogs/`) with a well‑formed JSON:API payload to create a new resource.
    2. Similarly, the attacker sends PATCH or DELETE requests to endpoints such as `/comments/1/` or `/companies/1/` to update or remove records.
    3. With no authentication or authorization checks in place, the operations succeed, allowing unauthorized modifications.
  - **Impact:**
    Any unauthorized user can create, modify, or delete resources, leading to potential data integrity, confidentiality, and availability issues.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project relies on DRF’s default permission model (“AllowAny”) when no explicit permission classes are set on endpoints.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust permission classes (e.g. `IsAuthenticated` or custom logic) on all endpoints that allow data modification.
    - Enforce strict authentication and authorization checks on all modifying endpoints.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application’s endpoints built on ModelViewSet (or JsonApiViewSet without overrides) are deployed publicly without any access control layers.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/example/views.py` (and the corresponding URL registrations in `/code/example/urls.py`), viewsets such as BlogViewSet, EntryViewSet, CommentViewSet, and CompanyViewSet expose full CRUD operations without additional restrictions.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. On a publicly deployed instance, identify an endpoint (e.g. `/blogs/`).
    2. Send a POST request with a valid JSON:API payload to create a new blog resource.
    3. Verify that the resource is created successfully without requiring authentication.
    4. Similarly, send PATCH and DELETE requests to other endpoints and confirm that write operations are accepted.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Object Selection in Featured Entry Endpoints
  - **Description:**
    The “featured” entry endpoints in EntryViewSet and DRFEntryViewSet override the standard `get_object()` method incorrectly. Instead of fetching the record matching the provided primary key, the method uses the URL parameter (named “entry_pk”) to exclude that record and returns the first entry that does not match the given ID.
    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**
    1. An API client sends a GET request to an endpoint such as `/entries/{entry_pk}/` expecting the entry with that specific ID.
    2. The overridden `get_object()` method executes code that excludes the provided `entry_pk` and returns the first available entry with a different ID.
    3. The client receives a resource that does not correspond to the requested identifier.
  - **Impact:**
    This mis‑selection can lead to unintended data exposure and confusion in API response behavior. If business logic relies on a reliable primary key–based lookup, unauthorized data may be disclosed or object‑specific restrictions bypassed.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - A comment in the code (“# Handle featured”) suggests that the override was intended for a “featured” use case but is applied unconditionally whenever the “entry_pk” URL parameter is supplied.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Correct the object retrieval logic so that when a primary key is specified, the endpoint returns the matching resource.
    - If “featured” entries are needed, serve them via a dedicated endpoint with clear and unambiguous logic.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The endpoint is implemented using EntryViewSet or DRFEntryViewSet and the URL includes an “entry_pk” parameter.
    - The endpoint is publicly accessible and no custom logic exists to enforce correct object lookup.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/example/views.py`, the `get_object()` method checks for “entry_pk” in `self.kwargs` and, if present, calls:
      ```python
      entry_pk = self.kwargs.get("entry_pk", None)
      if entry_pk is not None:
          return Entry.objects.exclude(pk=entry_pk).first()
      ```
      This deviates from the standard lookup using `Entry.objects.get(pk=entry_pk)`, inadvertently returning an unrelated resource.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy an endpoint using EntryViewSet (or DRFEntryViewSet) with a URL pattern that includes an “entry_pk” parameter.
    2. Choose a valid primary key (for example, “5”) and send a GET request to `/entries/5/`.
    3. Observe that the returned entry does not have ID 5 but is instead the first entry with a different ID.
    4. This confirms the retrieval logic is flawed and does not adhere to the expected RESTful behavior.

- **Vulnerability Name:** DEBUG Mode Enabled in Production Exposes Sensitive Debug Information
  - **Description:**
    The application’s configuration (in `/code/example/settings/dev.py`) sets `DEBUG = True` and is imported by default via `/code/example/settings/__init__.py`. In production, causing an exception (for example, by requesting an undefined URL) will trigger a detailed Django debug page that displays stack traces, environment variables, and configuration settings—including sensitive information.
    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**
    1. An attacker accesses a non‑existent endpoint or deliberately triggers an application error.
    2. The application, running with `DEBUG = True`, returns a detailed error page with stack trace and configuration details.
    3. The attacker examines the response and extracts sensitive internal information.
  - **Impact:**
    Exposure of internal state, file paths, configuration details, and potentially sensitive data (such as the SECRET_KEY) may help an attacker map the internal structure of the application and plan further attacks.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No mitigation is in place—the settings file explicitly sets `DEBUG = True`.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Disable debug mode in production by setting `DEBUG = False`.
    - Configure a custom exception handler that does not expose detailed debug information.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The publicly accessible instance is deployed using the development configuration of settings (i.e. using `/code/example/settings/dev.py`).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/example/settings/dev.py`, the line `DEBUG = True` is explicitly set.
    - Since `/code/example/settings/__init__.py` imports the development settings, no production‑specific override exists, leaving the application in debug mode even if deployed publicly.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application using the provided settings.
    2. Access a non‑existent or error‑producing endpoint (for example, `/nonexistent`).
    3. Confirm that the response contains a Django debug page with a full stack trace and internal configuration details such as file paths and environment variables.
    4. Verify that sensitive data (e.g. SECRET_KEY and database configuration) are exposed on the error page.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Hardcoded SECRET_KEY in Configuration Allows Forged Signatures
  - **Description:**
    The application’s configuration file (`/code/example/settings/dev.py`) contains a hardcoded secret key value (`"abc123"`). If an attacker gains knowledge of this secret key—either through accidental code disclosure or via debug error pages—they may use it to forge session cookies or other signed data.
    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**
    1. An attacker discovers the hardcoded SECRET_KEY by viewing publicly accessible source code or via a debug page triggered by an error.
    2. Using the known SECRET_KEY, the attacker crafts forged session cookies or tampered signed data (such as JSON Web Tokens).
    3. The server, relying on the compromised key for cryptographic signing, accepts the forged data and may allow the attacker to impersonate users or escalate privileges.
  - **Impact:**
    The integrity and authenticity of signed data is compromised, which could lead to session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, and bypass of security controls.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No mitigations are implemented—the SECRET_KEY is statically defined in the development settings.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Remove hardcoded secret values from the source code and instead load the SECRET_KEY securely from environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The development settings—which include a hardcoded SECRET_KEY—are deployed in the production environment, and the source configuration is either directly accessible or inadvertently exposed (for example, via debug error pages).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/example/settings/dev.py`, the line `SECRET_KEY = "abc123"` is hardcoded.
    - Since `/code/example/settings/__init__.py` imports `dev.py` by default, this insecure secret key is used in the deployed application.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Examine the deployed application (or trigger an error page via the DEBUG mode vulnerability) to retrieve the SECRET_KEY value.
    2. Using the known key `"abc123"`, craft a signed session cookie or token that mimics a valid user session.
    3. Send the forged token to any endpoint that requires authenticated access.
    4. Verify that the server accepts the forged token, thereby confirming that the signature can be recreated due to the hardcoded secret.
