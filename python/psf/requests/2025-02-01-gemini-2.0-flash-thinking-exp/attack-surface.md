# Attack Surface Analysis for psf/requests

## Attack Surface: [URL Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/url_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate URLs used in `requests` calls by controlling parts of the URL string, leading to requests being sent to unintended destinations.
    *   **How `requests` contributes:** `requests` directly uses URLs provided to its functions. Unsanitized URL inputs passed to `requests` create this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Application uses `requests.get(user_provided_base_url + "/api/data")`. Attacker provides `user_provided_base_url` as `https://malicious.example.com`, causing `requests` to target a malicious server.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration to malicious servers, execution of malicious code from attacker-controlled resources, unintended actions against malicious targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict URL Validation:** Validate and sanitize all URL components before using them in `requests`.
        *   **URL Parsing & Construction:** Use URL parsing libraries to build URLs programmatically, avoiding string concatenation of untrusted input.
        *   **Allowlisting Domains:**  Restrict `requests` to only target URLs within a predefined allowlist of trusted domains.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Disabling SSL/TLS verification in `requests` (`verify=False`) exposes the application to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, compromising communication security.
    *   **How `requests` contributes:** `requests`' `verify` parameter directly controls SSL/TLS verification. Setting it to `False` disables essential security checks.
    *   **Example:** Application uses `requests.get(url, verify=False)` in production. An attacker intercepts communication, potentially reading or modifying data in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Data interception, data manipulation, credential theft, complete loss of confidentiality and integrity of communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always Enable SSL Verification:** **Ensure `verify=True` is set for all `requests` calls in production.**
        *   **Proper Certificate Handling:** If using custom certificates, configure `verify` with the correct certificate path (`verify='/path/to/cert.pem'`).
        *   **Maintain Up-to-date Certificates:** Keep the system's certificate store (used by `requests`) updated.
        *   **Avoid `verify=False` in Production:**  Reserve `verify=False` only for testing against trusted local development servers, understanding the inherent risks.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `requests`' dependencies (like `urllib3`) can be exploited through the application's use of `requests`.
    *   **How `requests` contributes:** `requests` relies on these libraries. Vulnerabilities in dependencies become attack vectors for applications using `requests`.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is found in `urllib3`. An application using an outdated `requests` version that includes the vulnerable `urllib3` becomes susceptible to exploitation.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific dependency vulnerability; can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High to Critical depending on the dependency vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly Update `requests`:** Keep `requests` and its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in `requests`' dependencies.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories for `requests` and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Credential Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_credential_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling or storage of authentication credentials used with `requests` can lead to credential compromise.
    *   **How `requests` contributes:** `requests` provides authentication mechanisms. Insecure handling of credentials used with these mechanisms creates a vulnerability when using `requests` for authentication.
    *   **Example:** API keys are hardcoded in the application code and used in `requests` calls for authentication. Code exposure leads to API key compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, account takeover, abuse of API quotas.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the credentials and protected resources)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Hardcode Credentials:** Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application.
        *   **Use Secure Storage:** Utilize environment variables, secure configuration files, or dedicated secrets management systems for storing credentials.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to credentials.
        *   **Credential Rotation:** Implement credential rotation policies.
