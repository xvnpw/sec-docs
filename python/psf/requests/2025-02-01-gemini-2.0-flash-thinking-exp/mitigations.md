## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update `requests` and its Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update__requests__and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update `requests` and its Dependencies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dependencies:** Use dependency management tools (like `pipenv`, `poetry`, or `pip freeze`) to list project dependencies, including `requests`.
    2.  **Check for Updates:** Regularly check for new versions of `requests` using tools like `pip list --outdated` or vulnerability scanners.
    3.  **Review Release Notes:** Before updating, review release notes for security patches and bug fixes in `requests`.
    4.  **Update Dependencies:** Use dependency management tools to update to the latest stable `requests` version (e.g., `pip install --upgrade requests`).
    5.  **Test Thoroughly:** After updating, run tests to ensure no regressions are introduced.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated `requests` versions may contain known security flaws.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces risk by patching known vulnerabilities in `requests`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, using `requirements.txt` and manual `pip install --upgrade` during development and deployment.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automation of `requests` updates in CI/CD pipeline is missing.
