# Threat Model Analysis for psf/requests

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities present in the `requests` library itself or in its dependencies (like `urllib3`, `certifi`, etc.). This could be achieved by sending crafted requests to the application or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the library processes data. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `requests` library and its dependencies (modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `requests` and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning tools in the development and deployment pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `requests` and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure SSL Certificate Verification](./threats/insecure_ssl_certificate_verification.md)

*   **Threat:** Disabled SSL Certificate Verification
*   **Description:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by intercepting network traffic when the application disables SSL certificate verification (using `verify=False` in `requests`). This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on communication, modify data in transit, or impersonate the legitimate server without the application detecting the deception.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, credential theft, injection of malicious content, loss of data integrity.
*   **Affected Component:** `requests.request` function and related functions (parameter `verify`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always enable SSL certificate verification in production environments. Avoid setting `verify=False`.
    *   For connections to servers with self-signed or internal certificates, use the `verify` parameter to specify a path to a valid certificate authority bundle or the specific certificate.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability where user-controlled input is used to construct or influence the URL used in `requests` calls. This allows the attacker to force the application to send requests to unintended destinations, such as internal resources within the organization's network, other servers, or even the application's own server. This can bypass firewalls, access sensitive internal data, or perform actions on behalf of the application.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, denial of service, port scanning of internal networks, potential remote code execution in vulnerable internal services.
*   **Affected Component:** `requests.request` function and related functions (URL parameter).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the sensitivity of accessible internal resources).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input that is used to construct URLs for `requests` calls.
    *   Implement strict allowlists for allowed destination domains or URLs. Only permit requests to known and trusted external services.
    *   Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs. Use indirect methods to determine the target URL based on user input, rather than directly embedding user input into the URL string.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate the application server from sensitive internal resources, limiting the potential impact of SSRF.
