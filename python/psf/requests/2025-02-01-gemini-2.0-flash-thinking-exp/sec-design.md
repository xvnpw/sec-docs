# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Provide a user-friendly and reliable Python library for making HTTP requests.
 - Enable Python developers to easily integrate with web services and APIs.
 - Maintain a widely adopted and trusted open-source project within the Python ecosystem.
 - Ensure the library is performant and efficient for various use cases.
 - Foster a community of contributors and users around the project.

- Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the library could impact a vast number of downstream applications, leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
 - Reputational damage to the project and the Python Software Foundation if the library is perceived as unreliable or insecure.
 - Supply chain attacks targeting the library's dependencies or distribution channels could compromise users.
 - Lack of timely security updates and patches could leave users vulnerable to known exploits.
 - Compatibility issues with different Python versions or platforms could hinder adoption and create maintenance overhead.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Version control using Git and GitHub. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Public issue tracking on GitHub. Implemented in: GitHub repository issue tracker.
 - security control: Pull requests and code review process for contributions. Implemented in: GitHub contribution guidelines and GitHub workflow.
 - security control: Distribution via PyPI (Python Package Index). Implemented in: PyPI infrastructure.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly vetted.
 - accepted risk: Limited resources for dedicated security testing and audits due to open-source nature.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not immediately addressed.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
 - security control: Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
 - security control: Establish a clear security policy and vulnerability disclosure process to handle security issues effectively.
 - security control: Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses.
 - security control: Implement code signing for releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of distributed packages.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: The library should securely handle authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) provided by users, avoiding storage in logs or insecure locations.
  - Requirement: Support various authentication methods including but not limited to Basic Auth, Digest Auth, OAuth, and API Key authentication.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: While the library itself does not enforce authorization, it should provide mechanisms for applications to implement authorization checks based on server responses (e.g., checking HTTP status codes like 401, 403).
  - Requirement: The library should not automatically follow redirects to different domains without user awareness, to prevent potential authorization bypass issues.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: The library must validate all user-provided inputs, such as URLs, headers, parameters, and data, to prevent injection attacks (e.g., URL injection, header injection).
  - Requirement: Sanitize or encode user inputs when constructing HTTP requests to mitigate injection risks.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Enforce HTTPS by default for all requests to protect data in transit.
  - Requirement: Properly handle TLS/SSL certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - Requirement: Support secure renegotiation and other TLS best practices.
  - Requirement: Avoid implementing custom cryptography; rely on well-vetted and established cryptographic libraries provided by Python and the operating system.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Enabling reliable and secure HTTP communication for Python applications across various domains.
 - Facilitating integration of Python applications with web services and APIs.
 - Maintaining the trust and reputation of the Requests library as a fundamental component of the Python ecosystem.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - The Requests library itself does not store or process sensitive data directly. However, it is used by applications that may handle highly sensitive data.
 - Data sensitivity depends entirely on the applications using the Requests library. This could include:
  - Authentication credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens) used in requests. Sensitivity: High.
  - User data transmitted in requests and responses (personal information, financial data, etc.). Sensitivity: Varies, potentially High.
  - Application logic and configuration that could be exposed through vulnerabilities in the library. Sensitivity: Medium to High.
 - The integrity and availability of the Requests library itself are also critical, as its compromise could impact a vast number of applications. Sensitivity: High (for integrity and availability of the library).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the formal security policy for the Requests project? Is there a public security policy document?
 - Is there a dedicated security team or point of contact for security vulnerabilities?
 - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities? Is there a vulnerability disclosure policy?
 - Are there regular security audits or penetration testing performed on the Requests library?
 - Are automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST, dependency scanning) integrated into the CI/CD pipeline? If so, which tools are used?
 - Is code signing used for releases to ensure package integrity and authenticity?
 - What is the process for managing and updating dependencies, especially in response to security vulnerabilities?

- Assumptions:
 - The Requests project follows standard open-source development practices, including code review and public issue tracking.
 - The project relies on the security of the GitHub and PyPI platforms for version control and distribution.
 - Security testing is primarily performed through community contributions and may not be as comprehensive as in commercial software projects.
 - The project aims to address security vulnerabilities reported by the community in a timely manner, but resources may be limited.
 - HTTPS is the default and recommended protocol for making requests using the library.
