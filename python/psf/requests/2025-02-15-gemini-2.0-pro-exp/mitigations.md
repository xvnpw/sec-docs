# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for psf/requests

## Mitigation Strategy: [Always Verify SSL Certificates](./mitigation_strategies/always_verify_ssl_certificates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Always Verify SSL Certificates (using `requests`' `verify` parameter)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Ensure the `verify` parameter in `requests` calls is either omitted (defaulting to `True`) or explicitly set to `True`: `requests.get(url, verify=True)`.
        2.  For custom Certificate Authorities (CAs), provide the CA bundle path to `verify`: `requests.get(url, verify='/path/to/ca_bundle.pem')`.
        3.  *Never* set `verify=False` in production. If temporarily disabling during development (strongly discouraged), use environment variables to control this, ensuring it's *never* off in deployment.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** (Severity: Critical) - Attacker intercepts connection, presents fake certificate, decrypts/modifies traffic.
        *   **Data Breaches:** (Severity: Critical) - Sensitive data transmitted can be stolen.
        *   **Data Tampering:** (Severity: High) - Attacker can modify data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible (with proper CA management).
        *   **Data Breaches:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible (if MitM prevented).
        *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible (if MitM prevented).

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, in `api_client.py` (default `verify=True`).  `data_fetcher.py` uses a custom CA bundle.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in `test_utils.py` (some tests disable verification). Refactor to use a mock CA or alternative testing approach.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/use_timeouts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use Timeouts (using `requests`' `timeout` parameter)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Always set the `timeout` parameter in `requests` calls: `requests.get(url, timeout=5)`.
        2.  Use a tuple for finer control: `requests.get(url, timeout=(connect_timeout, read_timeout))`.
        3.  Handle `requests.exceptions.Timeout` exceptions gracefully. Implement retry logic (with limits) if appropriate.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Slow servers can cause hangs.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Hanging requests consume resources.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with appropriate timeouts/handling).
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** `api_client.py` (10-second timeout). `data_fetcher.py` (separate connect/read timeouts).

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in `report_generator.py`. Add timeouts to external service calls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Redirects](./mitigation_strategies/control_redirects.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Redirects (using `requests`' `allow_redirects` and `max_redirects` parameters)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  If redirects are *not* expected, set `allow_redirects=False`: `requests.get(url, allow_redirects=False)`.
        2.  If redirects *are* expected, limit them with `max_redirects`: `requests.get(url, max_redirects=5)`.
        3.  Inspect `response.history` (list of redirect `Response` objects) and validate the final URL (`response.url`).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Open Redirects:** (Severity: Medium) - Malicious redirects to phishing/attack sites.
        *   **SSRF (via redirects):** (Severity: High) - Redirects bypass URL validation, access internal resources.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Open Redirects:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with limits and final URL validation).
        *   **SSRF (via redirects):** Risk reduced from High to Low (combined with URL validation).

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `max_redirects` set in `api_client.py`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing final URL validation after redirects. Update `data_fetcher.py` and `report_generator.py` to inspect `response.history` and validate.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Manage HTTP Headers](./mitigation_strategies/manage_http_headers.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Manage HTTP Headers (using `requests`' `headers` parameter)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  Review all uses of the `headers` parameter: `requests.get(url, headers=headers)`.
        2.  Explicitly set `User-Agent` to a custom value (avoid revealing `requests` version).
        3.  Avoid unnecessary headers (e.g., `Referer`), unless required.
        4.  Remove sensitive headers (e.g., `Authorization`) *before* logging request details.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: Low) - Default headers reveal application/library details.
        *   **Data Leakage (through logs):** (Severity: Medium) - Sensitive headers logged without redaction.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
        *   **Data Leakage (through logs):** Risk reduced from Medium to Negligible (with redaction).

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `User-Agent` set in `api_client.py`. Sensitive headers removed before logging in `error_handler.py`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Inconsistent approach. Review and update `data_fetcher.py` and `report_generator.py`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Streaming for Large Responses](./mitigation_strategies/use_streaming_for_large_responses.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Use Streaming for Large Responses (using requests' stream parameter)
    *   **Description:**
        1. When expecting large responses, use the stream=True parameter in your requests call: response = requests.get(url, stream=True).
        2.  Iterate over the response content using response.iter_content(chunk_size=...) or response.iter_lines().
        3.  Process the data in chunks, avoiding loading the entire response into memory at once.
        4. Ensure that you properly close the connection after processing the streamed response, either by exiting a with statement or by explicitly calling response.close().

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Large responses can consume excessive memory, leading to application crashes or slowdowns.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Similar to DoS, but specifically focuses on memory exhaustion.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (by preventing memory overload).
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in download_large_file function in utils.py.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Not implemented in process_data function in data_fetcher.py, which potentially receives large JSON responses. This should be updated to use streaming.
