# Project Design Document: Requests Library

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Priorities and Goals:

The primary goal of the Requests library is to provide a simple, intuitive, and reliable way for Python developers to interact with HTTP services. It aims to abstract away the complexities of making HTTP requests, handling sessions, authentication, and response parsing, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their applications. The library prioritizes ease of use, correctness, and broad compatibility across different Python versions and platforms.

Business Risks:

*   Data Breaches: As a library handling HTTP requests, incorrect or insecure usage could expose sensitive data transmitted over the network, leading to data breaches.
*   Service Disruptions: Vulnerabilities in the library or its dependencies could be exploited to cause denial-of-service attacks, disrupting applications that rely on Requests.
*   Reputation Damage: Security vulnerabilities or reliability issues in a widely used library like Requests could significantly damage the reputation of the project and its maintainers.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of the development or distribution infrastructure could lead to malicious code being injected into the library, affecting a large number of users.
*   Compliance Violations: Improper handling of sensitive data, such as cookies or authentication tokens, could lead to violations of privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Secure Development Practices: The project follows secure coding practices, including input validation, output encoding, and regular security reviews. (Described in contribution guidelines and project documentation).
*   security control: Dependency Management: The project carefully manages its dependencies to minimize the risk of supply chain attacks. (Described in `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`).
*   security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: The project has a clear vulnerability disclosure policy, encouraging responsible reporting of security issues. (Described in `SECURITY.md`).
*   security control: Testing: The project has an extensive test suite, including unit and integration tests, to ensure the correctness and security of the code. (Located in the `tests/` directory).
*   security control: HTTPS by Default: Requests encourages the use of HTTPS by providing convenient ways to verify SSL certificates. (Described in the documentation).
*   security control: Session Management: Requests provides a `Session` object for managing cookies, authentication, and other persistent settings across multiple requests. (Described in the documentation).
*   security control: Authentication Helpers: Requests includes built-in support for common authentication schemes like Basic, Digest, and OAuth. (Described in the documentation).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies: While the project carefully manages its dependencies, it still relies on external libraries, which could introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: User Misconfiguration: The library provides secure defaults, but users can override these settings, potentially introducing security risks.
*   accepted risk: Platform-Specific Issues: The library's behavior may vary slightly across different operating systems and Python versions, potentially leading to unexpected security issues.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) Support: Consider adding support for CSP headers to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   security control: Subresource Integrity (SRI) Support: If loading external resources, consider adding support for SRI to ensure their integrity.
*   security control: Enhanced Fuzzing: Implement more comprehensive fuzzing to identify potential vulnerabilities in parsing and handling HTTP requests and responses.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for various authentication mechanisms (Basic, Digest, OAuth 1.0a, OAuth 2.0, custom authentication).
    *   Secure storage and handling of credentials.
    *   Protection against credential stuffing and brute-force attacks.
*   Authorization:
    *   No specific authorization requirements at the library level, as authorization is typically handled by the server.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user-provided input, including URLs, headers, and request bodies.
    *   Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Handle different character encodings correctly.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use secure TLS/SSL protocols for HTTPS connections.
    *   Verify server certificates by default.
    *   Provide options for customizing certificate verification.
    *   Use strong cryptographic algorithms and key lengths.

    *   Local testing (unit and integration) helps identify vulnerabilities early.
*   GitHub Repository:
    *   Access control and authentication protect the codebase.
    *   Branch protection rules enforce code review and prevent direct pushes to the main branch.
*   Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions):
    *   Automated testing (unit, integration, linting) ensures code quality and security.
    *   SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools scan the code for potential vulnerabilities. Examples include:
        *   Bandit: A security linter for Python.
        *   CodeQL: A semantic code analysis engine.
*   Release Pipeline (GitHub Actions):
    *   Automated build process creates consistent and reproducible builds.
    *   Build artifacts (wheels and source distributions) are signed to ensure integrity.
    *   Automated upload to PyPI with secure credentials.
*   Supply Chain Security:
    *   Dependencies are carefully managed and pinned to specific versions.
    *   Tools like `pip-audit` can be used to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Regular updates to dependencies address security issues.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Making HTTP requests reliably and securely.
*   Handling sensitive data (e.g., authentication tokens, API keys) securely.
*   Maintaining the integrity and availability of applications that rely on the Requests library.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Data transmitted using the Requests library can range from non-sensitive public data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. The sensitivity depends entirely on the application using the library.
*   Authentication tokens, API keys, and cookies handled by the Requests library are highly sensitive and must be protected.
*   Request and response headers may contain sensitive information, such as user-agent strings, IP addresses, and session identifiers.
