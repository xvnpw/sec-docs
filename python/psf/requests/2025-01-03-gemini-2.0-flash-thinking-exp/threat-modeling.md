# Threat Model Analysis for psf/requests

## Threat: [Insufficient TLS/SSL Certificate Verification](./threats/insufficient_tlsssl_certificate_verification.md)

**Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack due to Lack of Certificate Verification

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the server. By spoofing the server's identity (presenting a fraudulent certificate), the attacker can decrypt, read, and potentially modify the data exchanged without the application or user being aware. This is directly enabled by the application's configuration of the `requests` library.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality (sensitive data is exposed), loss of integrity (data can be altered), potential for unauthorized actions if the intercepted communication includes authentication credentials or commands.
*   **Affected Component:** The TLS/SSL verification mechanisms within the `requests` library, particularly the `verify` parameter in functions like `get()` and `post()`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always enable and enforce TLS/SSL certificate verification by ensuring the `verify` parameter is set to `True` (or a path to a valid CA bundle).
    *   Regularly update the `certifi` package (or the system's CA store) to include the latest trusted certificates.
    *   Avoid setting `verify=False` in production environments. If necessary for testing, ensure it's not deployed to production.

## Threat: [URL Injection](./threats/url_injection.md)

**Threat:** Redirecting Requests to Malicious Servers

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-controlled input that is directly used to construct the target URL for a `requests` call. The `requests` library then makes a request to this attacker-controlled URL, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, potential compromise of other systems if the application interacts with the malicious server, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Functions like `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`, etc., where the `url` parameter is constructed using untrusted input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into URLs used with `requests`.
    *   Use URL parsing libraries to construct URLs safely instead of string concatenation.
    *   Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns if possible.

## Threat: [Credential Leakage in Requests](./threats/credential_leakage_in_requests.md)

**Threat:** Exposing Sensitive Credentials in Transit or Logs

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens) directly in the URL or headers of `requests` calls. The `requests` library then transmits these credentials, potentially exposing them in logs, network traffic, or browser history.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources protected by the leaked credentials, potential for data breaches or account compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The `auth` parameter, URL construction, and `headers` parameter in `requests` functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid including credentials directly in URLs. Use secure methods like HTTP Basic Authentication (via the `auth` parameter) or bearer tokens in headers.
    *   Store and manage credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure configuration files.
    *   Implement proper logging practices that avoid logging sensitive information passed through `requests`.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Security Flaws in the `requests` Library or its Dependencies

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist in the `requests` library itself or in its dependencies (like `urllib3`). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of the library.
*   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire `requests` library and its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical to High)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the `requests` library and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for `requests` and its dependencies.
