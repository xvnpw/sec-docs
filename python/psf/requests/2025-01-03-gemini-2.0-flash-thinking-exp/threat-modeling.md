# Threat Model Analysis for psf/requests

## Threat: [URL Injection](./threats/url_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the URL passed to a `requests` function (e.g., `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`) by injecting malicious characters or a completely different URL. This can happen if the URL is built using unsanitized user input or data from an untrusted source. The attacker might aim to redirect the application's requests to a malicious server they control.

**Impact:**  The application sends requests to an unintended destination, potentially leaking sensitive data to the attacker's server, executing unintended actions on the attacker's server (if it mimics an API), or being used as a proxy to attack other internal systems (SSRF).

**Affected `requests` Component:**  Functions that accept a URL as an argument, such as `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`, `requests.put()`, `requests.delete()`, etc.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./threats/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** The application uses default or insecure TLS/SSL settings when making requests, such as allowing weak ciphers or outdated protocols. An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack could exploit these weaknesses to eavesdrop on or manipulate the communication.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, such as authentication credentials or personal information. Potential for the attacker to modify data in transit.

**Affected `requests` Component:**  The underlying `urllib3` library that `requests` uses for handling HTTPS connections, specifically the SSLContext configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Server Certificate Verification Bypass](./threats/server_certificate_verification_bypass.md)

**Description:** The application disables server certificate verification in `requests` (e.g., by setting `verify=False`). This makes the application vulnerable to MitM attacks, as it will trust any server, even those with self-signed or invalid certificates.

**Impact:**  An attacker can intercept communication between the application and the intended server, potentially stealing sensitive information or injecting malicious data.

**Affected `requests` Component:** The `verify` parameter in `requests` functions and `Session` objects.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within the `requests` library itself or its dependencies (like `urllib3`). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application is using an outdated version of `requests` or its dependencies.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other security breaches depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Affected `requests` Component:** The entire `requests` library and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Injection](./threats/server-side_request_forgery_(ssrf)_via_url_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a URL injection vulnerability to make the application send requests to internal resources or other services that are not publicly accessible. This can be used to bypass firewalls, access sensitive data, or perform actions on internal systems.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to internal resources, data exfiltration, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure.

**Affected `requests` Component:** Functions that accept a URL as an argument (e.g., `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical
