## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery_(ssrf).md)

**Description:** An attacker can control the destination URL in a `requests` call, causing the application server to make requests to unintended locations.

**How `requests` is involved:** The application uses user-supplied data (directly or indirectly) to construct the URL passed to `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`, etc.

**Impact:** Accessing internal resources, manipulating internal services, bypassing firewalls, accessing cloud metadata services to steal credentials.

**Mitigation:**
- Sanitize and validate user-provided URLs. Use allow-lists instead of block-lists.
- Limit the application server's outbound network access.
- Consider using a more restrictive HTTP client for internal requests.
- Utilize libraries specifically designed to prevent SSRF.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Cloud Metadata Services](./attack_tree_paths/access_cloud_metadata_services.md)

**Description:** Exploiting SSRF to access cloud provider metadata endpoints (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`) to retrieve sensitive information like API keys and instance credentials.

**How `requests` is involved:**  An attacker-controlled URL pointing to the metadata service is used in a `requests` call.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the cloud instance and potentially the entire cloud environment.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement strong SSRF prevention measures.
- Restrict access to the metadata service using firewall rules or network policies.
- Rotate credentials frequently.
- Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly on instances.

## Attack Tree Path: [Capture Sensitive Tokens/Cookies](./attack_tree_paths/capture_sensitive_tokenscookies.md)

**Description:** Attackers aim to steal authentication tokens or session cookies used by the application. This can be achieved through various means, including insecure authentication handling within the application's `requests` usage.

**How `requests` is involved:** The application might be transmitting or storing authentication credentials insecurely when making requests, making them vulnerable to interception or leakage.

**Impact:** Full account takeover, allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate users.

**Mitigation:**
- Store and transmit credentials securely (e.g., using HTTPS, secure storage mechanisms).
- Utilize `requests`' built-in authentication features securely.
- Implement proper session management with secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure flags).

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal or Manipulate Cookies](./attack_tree_paths/steal_or_manipulate_cookies.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to gain access to or modify session cookies to hijack user sessions or alter the application's state.

**How `requests` is involved:** The application might not be setting secure cookie attributes or might be vulnerable to attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) that could lead to cookie theft. While `requests` handles cookie sending and receiving, the application's configuration and handling of these cookies are the key vulnerability.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, manipulation of application data.

**Mitigation:**
- Set secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
- Implement robust protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Regularly rotate session keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker takes over a valid user session by obtaining the user's session ID, typically through cookie theft or session fixation.

**How `requests` is involved:** While `requests` itself doesn't directly cause session hijacking, vulnerabilities in how the application uses `requests` (e.g., allowing header injection for session fixation or not protecting cookies) can enable this attack.

**Impact:** Full control over the compromised user's account and its associated data and privileges.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement secure cookie handling.
- Protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Use strong session ID generation and management.
- Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent session hijacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization.md)

**Description:** If the application deserializes data received in responses from `requests` without proper sanitization, an attacker can craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server.

**How `requests` is involved:** The application uses `requests` to fetch data, and then uses libraries like `pickle` or vulnerable JSON deserializers on the response content.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server.

**Mitigation:**
- Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
- Use safe serialization formats like JSON with secure deserialization practices.
- Implement security measures specific to the deserialization library being used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code.md)

**Description:** The attacker successfully runs their own code on the application server. This is often the ultimate goal of many attacks.

**How `requests` is involved:**  While `requests` itself doesn't directly execute code, vulnerabilities related to its use (like SSRF leading to internal service exploitation or insecure deserialization) can be the pathway to achieving code execution.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal data, install malware, or disrupt operations.

**Mitigation:**  Focus on preventing the vulnerabilities that lead to code execution (SSRF, insecure deserialization, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [Disabled SSL/TLS Verification](./attack_tree_paths/disabled_ssltls_verification.md)

**Description:** The application disables SSL/TLS certificate verification in `requests` (e.g., by setting `verify=False`).

**How `requests` is involved:** The `verify=False` parameter is used in `requests` function calls.

**Impact:** Makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and the remote server.

**Mitigation:**  Always enable SSL/TLS verification by setting `verify=True` (or relying on the default). Ensure the application uses a trusted CA bundle.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and a remote server, potentially eavesdropping on or manipulating the data being exchanged.

**How `requests` is involved:** Disabling SSL/TLS verification in `requests` makes the application susceptible to MITM attacks.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, modification of requests and responses, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Mitigation:**  Always enable SSL/TLS verification. Ensure secure network configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Decrypt Communication](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_decrypt_communication.md)

**Description:** The attacker successfully intercepts and decrypts the communication between the application and a remote server due to the lack of proper encryption (e.g., disabled SSL/TLS verification).

**How `requests` is involved:**  The application's insecure configuration of `requests` (disabling verification) allows the attacker to perform this interception and decryption.

**Impact:** Exposure of all data transmitted, including sensitive credentials, API keys, and user data.

**Mitigation:**  Enforce SSL/TLS verification. Use HTTPS for all communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries used by `requests` (e.g., `urllib3`).

**How `requests` is involved:** `requests` relies on these libraries, and vulnerabilities in them can be exploited through `requests`.

**Impact:**  Can range from denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
- Regularly update `requests` and its dependencies to the latest versions.
- Use dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities.
- Implement mitigations recommended for specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Publicly Disclosed Exploits](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_publicly_disclosed_exploits.md)

**Description:** Attackers utilize readily available exploit code or techniques for known vulnerabilities in `requests`' dependencies.

**How `requests` is involved:** The application is vulnerable due to its use of a vulnerable version of a dependency.

**Impact:**  Can lead to rapid and widespread compromise if an easily exploitable vulnerability exists.

**Mitigation:**  Proactive patching and dependency management are crucial to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
