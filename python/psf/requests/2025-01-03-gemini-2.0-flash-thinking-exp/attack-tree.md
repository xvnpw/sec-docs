## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via requests (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_requests_(critical_node).md)

* **Compromise Application via requests (Critical Node):**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of the `requests` library to harm the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Sending Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_sending_vulnerabilities_(critical_node).md)

* **Exploit Request Sending Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    * This category encompasses various methods of manipulating outgoing requests to achieve malicious goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Target URL (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_target_url_(critical_node).md)

* **Manipulate Target URL (Critical Node):**
    * Attackers aim to control or influence the destination URL of requests made by the application.
        * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application uses user-controlled data to construct the target URL in a `requests` call.
            * Impact: Allows attackers to make requests on behalf of the server, potentially accessing internal resources, interacting with internal services, or even executing arbitrary code on internal systems.
            * Mitigation: Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs used in URL construction. Use allow-lists of allowed hosts instead of block-lists.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery_(ssrf)_(high-risk_path).md)

* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application uses user-controlled data to construct the target URL in a `requests` call.
            * Impact: Allows attackers to make requests on behalf of the server, potentially accessing internal resources, interacting with internal services, or even executing arbitrary code on internal systems.
            * Mitigation: Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs used in URL construction. Use allow-lists of allowed hosts instead of block-lists.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Request Body (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_request_body_(critical_node).md)

* **Inject Malicious Request Body (Critical Node):**
    * Attackers attempt to inject malicious data into the body of HTTP requests sent by the application.
        * **Insecure Deserialization via Request Body (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application sends serialized data in the request body (e.g., using Pickle) without proper validation, and the receiving end is vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
            * Impact: Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the receiving server if it deserializes the malicious payload.
            * Mitigation: Avoid sending serialized data if possible. If necessary, use secure serialization formats and implement strict input validation on the receiving end.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization via Request Body (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization_via_request_body_(high-risk_path).md)

* **Insecure Deserialization via Request Body (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application sends serialized data in the request body (e.g., using Pickle) without proper validation, and the receiving end is vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
            * Impact: Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the receiving server if it deserializes the malicious payload.
            * Mitigation: Avoid sending serialized data if possible. If necessary, use secure serialization formats and implement strict input validation on the receiving end.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Authentication Handling (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_authentication_handling_(critical_node).md)

* **Exploit Insecure Authentication Handling (Critical Node):**
    * Attackers target weaknesses in how the application handles authentication when making requests.
        * **Leaking Credentials in Requests (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application inadvertently includes sensitive information like API keys or passwords directly in request URLs, headers, or bodies.
            * Impact: Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data breaches.
            * Mitigation: Avoid hardcoding credentials. Use secure credential management practices and avoid logging sensitive request details.
        * **Weak or Missing TLS/SSL Verification (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application disables TLS/SSL verification in `requests` (e.g., `verify=False`) or relies on a potentially compromised system trust store.
            * Impact: Makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and modify communication.
            * Mitigation: Always enable TLS/SSL verification and use the `cert` parameter to specify trusted certificates if needed for internal or self-signed certificates. Regularly update the system trust store or use a specific certificate bundle.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaking Credentials in Requests (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/leaking_credentials_in_requests_(high-risk_path).md)

* **Leaking Credentials in Requests (High-Risk Path):**

            * Impact: Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data breaches.
            * Mitigation: Avoid hardcoding credentials. Use secure credential management practices and avoid logging sensitive request details.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak or Missing TLS/SSL Verification (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_or_missing_tlsssl_verification_(high-risk_path).md)

* **Weak or Missing TLS/SSL Verification (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application disables TLS/SSL verification in `requests` (e.g., `verify=False`) or relies on a potentially compromised system trust store.
            * Impact: Makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and modify communication.
            * Mitigation: Always enable TLS/SSL verification and use the `cert` parameter to specify trusted certificates if needed for internal or self-signed certificates. Regularly update the system trust store or use a specific certificate bundle.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_response_handling_vulnerabilities_(critical_node).md)

* **Exploit Response Handling Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    * Attackers focus on manipulating or exploiting the way the application processes responses received via `requests`.
        * **Insecure Deserialization of Response (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application deserializes response data (e.g., JSON, Pickle) without proper input validation.
            * Impact: If the response contains a malicious serialized payload, it can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server.
            * Mitigation: Validate response data thoroughly before deserialization. Avoid using insecure deserialization libraries like `pickle` on untrusted data. Prefer safer alternatives like `json`.

    * Attackers target misconfigurations or insecure usage patterns of the `requests` library itself.
        * **Insecure Proxy Configuration (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application uses a proxy configured with weak or no authentication.
            * Impact: Allows attackers to act as a Man-in-the-Middle, intercepting, modifying, or eavesdropping on requests made through the proxy.
            * Mitigation: Securely configure proxies with strong authentication. Avoid using public or untrusted proxies.
        * **Session Hijacking or Fixation (High-Risk Path):**
            * Attack Vector: The application uses `requests.Session` in a way that allows attackers to steal existing session cookies or force a user to use a specific session ID.
            * Impact: Can lead to account takeover, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
            * Mitigation: Implement secure session management practices, such as using secure, HTTPOnly cookies and regenerating session IDs after login. Avoid exposing session identifiers in URLs.
