# Threat Model Analysis for psf/requests

## Threat: [URL Injection](./threats/url_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the URL used in a `requests` call by injecting malicious characters or URLs through user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized. This causes the `requests` library to make requests to unintended destinations.

**Impact:**
*   The application might make requests to internal resources, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized actions (Server-Side Request Forgery - SSRF).
*   The application might make requests to external malicious sites, potentially leaking data or being used in further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into URLs used with `requests`.
*   Use URL parsing libraries to construct URLs safely, ensuring proper encoding of special characters.
*   Implement allow-lists for acceptable URL schemes and domains if possible.
*   Avoid directly embedding user input into URLs; use parameters or request bodies instead where appropriate.

## Threat: [Header Injection](./threats/header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTTP headers by manipulating user-controlled input that is used to construct request headers passed to `requests`. This can lead to various attacks by controlling the behavior of the server or the client.

**Impact:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting `Set-Cookie` headers to set malicious cookies in the user's browser.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting headers to manipulate caching mechanisms, potentially serving malicious content to other users.
*   **Session Fixation:** Injecting headers to fix a user's session ID.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Injecting headers to circumvent authentication or authorization checks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly using user input to construct HTTP headers passed to `requests`.
*   Use a safe list of allowed header names and values.
*   Sanitize user input rigorously if it must be used in headers, encoding special characters appropriately.
*   Prefer using dedicated `requests` parameters for specific header functionalities (e.g., authentication).

## Threat: [Disabled SSL Certificate Verification](./threats/disabled_ssl_certificate_verification.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit applications that disable SSL certificate verification in `requests` (e.g., by setting `verify=False`). This allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, where the attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between the application and the server initiated by `requests`.

**Impact:**
*   Confidential data transmitted over HTTPS can be intercepted and read by the attacker.
*   The attacker can modify requests and responses, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.
*   Credentials and session tokens can be stolen.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never** disable SSL certificate verification in production environments when using `requests`. Always set `verify=True`.
*   If connecting to internal servers with self-signed certificates, use the `cert` parameter to specify the CA bundle or the specific certificate path.
*   Ensure the system's CA certificates are up-to-date.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirects](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_redirects.md)

**Description:** If an application automatically follows HTTP redirects using `requests` and the initial request's URL is influenced by user input, an attacker can manipulate the redirect chain to force `requests` to make requests to internal resources or arbitrary external sites.

**Impact:**
*   The application can be used to scan internal networks or access internal services that are not publicly accessible.
*   The application can be used as a proxy to attack other systems.
*   Sensitive information from internal services can be exposed.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully validate and sanitize URLs used for requests made with `requests`, especially if they are based on user input.
*   Consider disabling automatic redirects (`allow_redirects=False`) in `requests` and handling redirects manually with appropriate security checks.
*   Implement allow-lists for acceptable redirect destinations.

## Threat: [Insecure Credential Handling in Authentication](./threats/insecure_credential_handling_in_authentication.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `requests'` authentication features (e.g., Basic Auth, Digest Auth) but stores or transmits credentials insecurely, attackers can potentially intercept or retrieve these credentials being used by `requests`.

**Impact:**
*   Compromised credentials can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users and access protected resources through requests made by the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the code when using `requests` authentication.
*   Use secure methods for storing and managing credentials (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems).
*   Ensure that connections are made over HTTPS to protect credentials in transit when using `requests`.
*   Consider using more secure authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 where appropriate.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle via Malicious Proxy](./threats/man-in-the-middle_via_malicious_proxy.md)

**Description:** If the application uses a proxy configured by user input or an untrusted source with `requests`, an attacker can set up a malicious proxy server to intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and the target server initiated by `requests`.

**Impact:**
*   Confidential data can be intercepted and read.
*   Requests and responses can be modified, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.
*   Credentials and session tokens can be stolen.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid relying on user-provided proxy configurations when using `requests`.
*   If proxies are necessary, ensure they are from trusted sources and configured securely.
*   Implement strict validation and sanitization if proxy configurations are based on user input.
