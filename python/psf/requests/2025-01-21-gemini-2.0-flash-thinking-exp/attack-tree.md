## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using 'requests'](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_'requests'.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Manipulation **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

This path encompasses techniques where an attacker manipulates the requests made by the application using the `requests` library. This is a high-risk area because it directly interacts with external systems and can bypass intended security boundaries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/perform_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf___critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents the ability of an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to unintended locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate URL Parameter **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_url_parameter__critical_node_.md)

This is a key step in SSRF where the attacker controls or influences the URL parameter used in a `requests` call.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Internal/Restricted URL **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_internalrestricted_url__high-risk_path_.md)

By manipulating the URL, the attacker can force the application to make requests to internal network resources, cloud metadata services, or other restricted endpoints, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data in Requests **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_in_requests__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves injecting malicious content into the request body or headers sent by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads in Request Body **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads_in_request_body__critical_node_.md)

This critical node focuses on injecting malicious code or data into the request body.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Target Application's Data Processing **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_target_application's_data_processing__high-risk_path_.md)

By injecting malicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection, command injection), the attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in how the receiving application processes the data, potentially leading to data breaches, remote code execution, or other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Response Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_response_handling.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deserialization of Response Data **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deserialization_of_response_data__critical_node_.md)

This critical node highlights the danger of deserializing data received from `requests` without proper validation. If the application deserializes untrusted data, an attacker can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit `requests` Library Internals **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit__requests__library_internals__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the `requests` library itself or its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in `requests` **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in__requests___critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents the risk of using a version of `requests` with known security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify CVEs in Used `requests` Version](./attack_tree_paths/identify_cves_in_used__requests__version.md)

Attackers can identify the specific version of `requests` being used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Public Exploits **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_public_exploits__high-risk_path_.md)

If known vulnerabilities exist for that version, attackers can leverage publicly available exploits to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This critical node highlights the risk of vulnerabilities in libraries that `requests` depends on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerable Dependencies of `requests`](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerable_dependencies_of__requests_.md)

Attackers can identify vulnerable dependencies like `urllib3`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Vulnerabilities in Libraries like `urllib3` **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_like__urllib3___high-risk_path_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in these dependencies can have the same impact as exploiting vulnerabilities in `requests` itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse `requests` Features for Malicious Purposes **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/abuse__requests__features_for_malicious_purposes__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves misusing legitimate features of the `requests` library to achieve malicious goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leak Sensitive Information **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/leak_sensitive_information__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on scenarios where sensitive information is unintentionally exposed through the use of `requests`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Handling of Authentication Credentials **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/improper_handling_of_authentication_credentials__critical_node_.md)

This critical node highlights the risk of insecurely managing authentication credentials used with `requests`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose API Keys or Tokens in Requests **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/expose_api_keys_or_tokens_in_requests__high-risk_path_.md)

If API keys, tokens, or other sensitive credentials are included directly in the request (e.g., in the URL or headers) and not handled securely, they can be intercepted or logged, leading to unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Disable Certificate Verification **(Critical Node)**](./attack_tree_paths/disable_certificate_verification__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents a severe misconfiguration where the application disables SSL certificate verification.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack **(High-Risk Path)**](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack__high-risk_path_.md)

Disabling certificate verification makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, where attackers can intercept and manipulate communication between the application and the server.
