# Attack Surface Analysis for psf/requests

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the application to make HTTP requests to arbitrary destinations, potentially internal resources or external systems.
    *   **How `requests` Contributes:** The `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`, and similar functions are used to make outbound HTTP requests. If the target URL is derived from unsanitized user input, `requests` directly facilitates the malicious request.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a URL as input to fetch content. An attacker provides `http://internal-server/admin` as the URL, and the application using `requests.get(user_provided_url)` inadvertently makes a request to the internal admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration, denial of service against internal systems, potential for further exploitation of internal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided URLs:** Use allow-lists of permitted domains or protocols.
        *   **Avoid directly using user input in URL construction.**
        *   **Implement network segmentation and firewall rules** to restrict outbound traffic from the application server.
        *   **Consider using a dedicated service or library for URL validation.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious HTTP headers into requests made by the application.
    *   **How `requests` Contributes:** The `headers` parameter in `requests` functions allows setting custom headers. If header values are constructed using unsanitized user input, attackers can inject arbitrary headers.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom `User-Agent`. An attacker provides a value like `evil\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\nGET /sensitive-data HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: vulnerable-app.com`. This could lead to HTTP Response Splitting or other header-based attacks on the server or intermediaries.
    *   **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting/Smuggling, cache poisoning, session hijacking, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly validate and sanitize user input used for header values.**
        *   **Avoid directly using user input to construct header values.**
        *   **Use libraries or functions that automatically handle header encoding and prevent injection.**
        *   **Ensure the underlying HTTP library and server are configured to mitigate header injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Disabled SSL/TLS Verification](./attack_surfaces/disabled_ssltls_verification.md)

*   **Description:** The application disables SSL/TLS certificate verification, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **How `requests` Contributes:** The `verify=False` parameter in `requests` functions disables certificate verification.
    *   **Example:** A developer sets `requests.get('https://api.example.com', verify=False)` to bypass certificate issues. An attacker on the network can intercept the communication and potentially steal sensitive data or inject malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, potential for data manipulation, impersonation of the legitimate server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never disable SSL/TLS certificate verification in production environments.**
        *   **Ensure the system has up-to-date CA certificates.**
        *   **Properly handle certificate errors and investigate the root cause instead of disabling verification.**
        *   **Consider using certificate pinning for critical connections.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization of Response Content](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization_of_response_content.md)

*   **Description:** The application automatically deserializes response content (e.g., JSON, pickle) without verifying the source and integrity, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **How `requests` Contributes:** The `response.json()` and `response.content` methods can be used to access and potentially deserialize response data. If the application blindly trusts the content and deserializes it without validation, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application fetches data from an external API and uses `response.json()` without verifying the API's authenticity. A compromised API could send malicious JSON that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the application server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid automatically deserializing data from untrusted sources.**
        *   **Verify the source and integrity of the data before deserialization.**
        *   **Use secure deserialization methods and libraries that prevent code execution vulnerabilities.**
        *   **Implement input validation on the deserialized data.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Authentication Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_authentication_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Authentication credentials used with `requests` are stored insecurely or exposed in logs or error messages.
    *   **How `requests` Contributes:** The `auth` parameter in `requests` functions is used to provide authentication credentials. If these credentials are hardcoded, stored in easily accessible configuration files, or logged without proper redaction, they can be compromised.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes an API key directly in the code when making a request: `requests.get('https://api.example.com', auth=('user', 'hardcoded_password'))`. This password can be easily found in the source code.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, potential for further attacks using the compromised credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never hardcode credentials in the code.**
        *   **Store credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure configuration files.**
        *   **Avoid logging sensitive credentials.**
        *   **Use secure authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 where possible.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities via `requests`](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities_via__requests_.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses `requests` to upload files, and vulnerabilities exist in how filenames or file content are handled.
    *   **How `requests` Contributes:** The `files` parameter in `requests.post()` allows uploading files. If the filename is directly taken from user input without sanitization, or if the server-side doesn't properly handle the uploaded file, vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to upload files, and the original filename is used to store the file on the server without sanitization. An attacker uploads a file named `../../../../evil.php`, potentially overwriting critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, arbitrary file upload, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize and validate filenames before using them on the server-side.**
        *   **Store uploaded files in a dedicated, non-executable directory.**
        *   **Implement proper access controls on uploaded files.**
        *   **Scan uploaded files for malware.
