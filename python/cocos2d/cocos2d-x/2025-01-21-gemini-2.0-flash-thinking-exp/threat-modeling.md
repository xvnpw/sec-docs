# Threat Model Analysis for cocos2d/cocos2d-x

## Threat: [Path Traversal in Resource Loading](./threats/path_traversal_in_resource_loading.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided input or configuration files used by Cocos2d-x to load resources (images, audio, scripts). By inserting "../" sequences or absolute paths, they could access files outside the intended application directory. This could allow them to read sensitive configuration files, game data, or even executable code if the application attempts to load it.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive data, source code), potential for arbitrary code execution if executable files are accessed.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cocos2d-x FileUtils module, specifically functions like `FileUtils::getInstance()->getStringFromFile`, `Director::getInstance()->getTextureCache()->addImage`, and related resource loading mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly in file paths.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-controlled data used in resource paths.
        *   Use relative paths for resource loading and ensure the application's working directory is properly set.
        *   Consider using a resource management system that restricts access to specific directories.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Scripting Engine](./threats/code_injection_via_scripting_engine.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Cocos2d-x's Lua or JavaScript bindings and dynamically evaluates user-provided input or data from untrusted sources as script code, an attacker could inject malicious code. This code would be executed within the scripting engine's context, potentially allowing them to manipulate game logic, access sensitive data, or even interact with the underlying operating system if sandbox escapes are possible.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the game's context, potential for data breaches or further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cocos2d-x LuaEngine or JavaScript (SpiderMonkey/V8) bindings, specifically functions like `LuaEngine::executeString` or equivalent JavaScript evaluation methods.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly evaluate user-provided input as script code.
        *   If dynamic scripting is necessary, carefully sanitize and validate all input.
        *   Implement a robust sandbox for the scripting engine to limit its access to system resources.
        *   Consider using pre-compiled scripts instead of dynamically evaluating them.

## Threat: [Sandbox Escape in Scripting Engine](./threats/sandbox_escape_in_scripting_engine.md)

*   **Description:** Even with sandboxing in place, vulnerabilities in the Cocos2d-x scripting engine bindings or the underlying scripting engine itself could allow an attacker to escape the sandbox. This would grant them broader access to the device's operating system and its resources, potentially leading to more severe consequences.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution outside the game's context, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cocos2d-x LuaEngine or JavaScript bindings, the underlying Lua VM or JavaScript engine (SpiderMonkey/V8).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Cocos2d-x engine and scripting engine libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Carefully review and audit custom scripting bindings for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement additional security layers outside the scripting engine's sandbox.
        *   Minimize the privileges granted to the scripting engine.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Bugs in Native Code](./threats/memory_corruption_bugs_in_native_code.md)

*   **Description:** Cocos2d-x is written in C++, making it susceptible to memory management errors like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and dangling pointers within the engine's code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing crafted input or triggering specific game states that lead to memory corruption within Cocos2d-x components. Successful exploitation can result in crashes, arbitrary code execution, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, arbitrary code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core Cocos2d-x engine code (CCNode, CCSprite, etc.), and potentially vulnerable third-party libraries directly integrated and exposed through Cocos2d-x APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Cocos2d-x engine updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   When extending or modifying the engine, use memory-safe coding practices (e.g., smart pointers, bounds checking).
        *   Perform thorough code reviews and static analysis on any custom native code interacting with Cocos2d-x.
        *   Utilize memory debugging tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during development and testing of native code extensions.

## Threat: [Insecure Network Communication](./threats/insecure_network_communication.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Cocos2d-x's built-in networking capabilities to communicate with servers over unencrypted channels (HTTP instead of HTTPS), an attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could intercept and eavesdrop on the communication facilitated by Cocos2d-x's networking classes. This could expose sensitive data like user credentials, game progress, or in-app purchase information.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for account compromise or manipulation of game data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cocos2d-x networking classes (e.g., `HttpRequest`, `WebSocket`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use HTTPS for all network communication involving sensitive data initiated through Cocos2d-x's networking APIs.
        *   Implement certificate pinning when using Cocos2d-x's networking to prevent MITM attacks even with compromised CAs.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data before transmitting it over the network, even with HTTPS, when using Cocos2d-x's networking.

## Threat: [Hardcoded Secrets](./threats/hardcoded_secrets.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally hardcode sensitive information like API keys or encryption keys directly into the application's source code or configuration files that are part of the Cocos2d-x project. This information can be easily extracted by reverse-engineering the application.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to services, compromise of encryption.
    *   **Affected Component:** All parts of the codebase and configuration files within the Cocos2d-x project where secrets might be present.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode sensitive information in the application code or configuration files within the Cocos2d-x project.
        *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems to store secrets.
        *   Obfuscate code to make reverse engineering more difficult, but don't rely on it as the primary security measure.
        *   Regularly scan the codebase for potential hardcoded secrets.
