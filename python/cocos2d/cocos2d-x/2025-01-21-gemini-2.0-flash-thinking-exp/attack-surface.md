# Attack Surface Analysis for cocos2d/cocos2d-x

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description**: The application loads external resources like images, audio, and scripts. If these are sourced from untrusted locations or not validated, they can be malicious.
*   **How cocos2d-x contributes**: Cocos2d-x provides mechanisms for loading various asset types (e.g., `Sprite::create()`, `AudioEngine::play2d()`, `ScriptingCore::runScript()`). It relies on the developer to ensure the integrity and source of these assets.
*   **Example**: An attacker replaces a legitimate game image on a compromised download server with a specially crafted image that exploits a vulnerability in the image decoding library used by cocos2d-x.
*   **Impact**: Code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity**: High
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Load assets from trusted and verified sources only.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums) for downloaded assets.
    *   Avoid dynamically loading executable scripts (Lua, JavaScript) from untrusted sources.
    *   Keep cocos2d-x and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities in asset processing libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Requests](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_requests.md)

*   **Description**: The application communicates with external servers using network requests. If these requests are not secured, they are vulnerable to interception and manipulation.
*   **How cocos2d-x contributes**: Cocos2d-x provides the `network::HttpRequest` class for making HTTP requests. The developer is responsible for configuring secure connections (HTTPS) and validating server certificates.
*   **Example**: An application uses `network::HttpRequest` with an HTTP URL instead of HTTPS to send user credentials to a server. An attacker on the same network intercepts the traffic and steals the credentials.
*   **Impact**: Information disclosure, account compromise, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity**: Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Always use HTTPS for network communication with external servers.
    *   Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate validation to prevent connecting to malicious servers.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in network requests; use secure protocols and encryption.
    *   Be cautious about trusting server responses without validation.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities (Lua/JavaScript)](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_vulnerabilities__luajavascript_.md)

*   **Description**: Cocos2d-x supports scripting languages like Lua and JavaScript. Vulnerabilities in the scripting engine or insecure scripting practices can lead to code execution.
*   **How cocos2d-x contributes**: Cocos2d-x integrates scripting engines (e.g., SpiderMonkey for JavaScript, LuaJIT for Lua) through its `ScriptingCore`. The framework allows executing scripts from files or strings.
*   **Example**: An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the LuaJIT engine used by cocos2d-x by providing a specially crafted Lua script that allows arbitrary code execution on the device.
*   **Impact**: Code execution, privilege escalation, complete compromise of the application and potentially the device.
*   **Risk Severity**: Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Keep the scripting engine (and cocos2d-x) updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Avoid executing scripts from untrusted sources or user-provided input.
    *   If dynamic script loading is necessary, implement strict sandboxing and validation of the scripts.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when writing Lua or JavaScript code within the application.

## Attack Surface: [Platform API Misuse](./attack_surfaces/platform_api_misuse.md)

*   **Description**: Cocos2d-x provides abstractions over platform-specific APIs. Misusing these APIs or failing to handle platform-specific security considerations can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **How cocos2d-x contributes**: Cocos2d-x exposes platform-specific functionalities through its API (e.g., accessing device sensors, file system operations). Incorrect usage can lead to security issues.
*   **Example (Android)**: An application uses cocos2d-x's file system access to write sensitive data to external storage without proper permissions or encryption, making it accessible to other applications.
*   **Impact**: Information disclosure, privilege escalation, unauthorized access to device resources.
*   **Risk Severity**: High
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Thoroughly understand the security implications of using platform-specific APIs.
    *   Follow platform-specific security best practices (e.g., requesting necessary permissions on Android, using the Keychain on iOS).
    *   Avoid storing sensitive data insecurely on the device's file system.
