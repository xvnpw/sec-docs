## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Input Processing [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_input_processing__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends an input string that is longer than the buffer allocated to store it. This overwrites adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting data, crashing the application, or even allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
**Focus Areas:** Text input fields, event handlers processing string data, any function handling string input without proper bounds checking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization of Input Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization_of_input_data__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application receives serialized data (e.g., in JSON, XML, or binary format) and deserializes it into objects without proper validation. An attacker can craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, creates harmful objects or triggers code execution.
**Focus Areas:** Network communication receiving serialized data, loading game state from files, any function deserializing external data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject modified or malicious script files (if using scripting languages like Lua or JavaScript) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_modified_or_malicious_script_files__if_using_scripting_languages_like_lua_or_javascript___cri_83e6b1ec.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application loads script files from external or user-controlled sources without proper verification, an attacker can replace legitimate script files with malicious ones. This allows them to manipulate game logic, access sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code within the scripting environment.
**Focus Areas:** Loading scripts from local storage, downloading scripts from a server, any mechanism that allows external scripts to be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Insecure APIs or Protocols [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_apis_or_protocols__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The game uses custom-built network APIs or protocols that contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication, access unauthorized data, manipulate game state, or potentially execute code on the server or client.
**Focus Areas:** Custom network communication logic, poorly designed APIs, lack of proper input validation and authorization checks in network communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of Network Responses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_network_responses__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The game receives data from a network server and processes it without proper validation. An attacker can manipulate the server's responses to inject malicious data that, when processed by the game, leads to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, code injection, or application crashes.
**Focus Areas:** Parsing and processing data received from game servers, handling error conditions in network responses, any logic that relies on the integrity of server-provided data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection in Scripting Language [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_in_scripting_language__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application allows user-provided input to be directly incorporated into scripts that are then executed, an attacker can inject malicious code into the script. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands within the scripting environment, potentially gaining control over game logic or accessing sensitive data.
**Focus Areas:** Processing user input within script execution, dynamically generating scripts based on user input, any mechanism that allows external code to be executed within the scripting environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_third-party_library_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Cocos2d-x applications often rely on external libraries for various functionalities (e.g., networking, image processing, audio handling). If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them through the application. This can lead to code execution, data breaches, or application crashes.
**Focus Areas:** Identifying the third-party libraries used by the application, checking for known vulnerabilities in those libraries, ensuring libraries are updated to the latest secure versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tampering with Application Packages [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/tampering_with_application_packages__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker modifies the application package (APK for Android, IPA for iOS) after it has been built but before or after distribution. This can involve injecting malicious code, replacing legitimate assets with malicious ones, or altering the application's functionality. Users who install the tampered package will then be running the compromised version.
**Focus Areas:** Securing the build process, implementing code signing, verifying the integrity of application packages before installation.
