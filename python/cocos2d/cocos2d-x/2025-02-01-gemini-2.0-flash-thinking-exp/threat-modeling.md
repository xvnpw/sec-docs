# Threat Model Analysis for cocos2d/cocos2d-x

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Image Loading](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_image_loading.md)

- **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPG) that, when processed by Cocos2d-x's image loading functions, causes a buffer overflow. This can overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, application crash.
- **Cocos2d-x Component Affected:** `Image` class, `Texture2D` class, Rendering module, image loading functions.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use the latest version of Cocos2d-x engine with patched vulnerabilities.
    - Validate image file headers and data before loading.
    - Consider using secure image loading libraries or sandboxing image processing.

## Threat: [Script Injection via Dynamic Script Loading](./threats/script_injection_via_dynamic_script_loading.md)

- **Description:** If the application loads Lua or JavaScript scripts dynamically from an untrusted source, an attacker can inject malicious scripts. These scripts execute within the game's scripting environment, allowing manipulation of game logic, data access, or potentially system command execution.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within scripting, game logic manipulation, data theft, account compromise.
- **Cocos2d-x Component Affected:** Scripting engine integration (Lua/JavaScript), `ScriptingCore` module, script loading and execution functions.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid dynamic script loading from untrusted sources.
    - If necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization of script sources.
    - Use HTTPS for downloading scripts.
    - Implement code signing and integrity checks for downloaded scripts.
    - Sandbox the scripting environment.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerability in Scripting (Lua `loadstring`)](./threats/deserialization_vulnerability_in_scripting__lua__loadstring__.md)

- **Description:** Using insecure deserialization functions like Lua's `loadstring` on untrusted data allows attackers to craft malicious serialized data. When deserialized, this data executes arbitrary Lua code.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within Lua scripting, game logic manipulation, data theft.
- **Cocos2d-x Component Affected:** Lua scripting integration, `ScriptingCore` module, Lua `loadstring` function usage.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid using `loadstring` or similar insecure deserialization on untrusted data.
    - Use safer data serialization methods like JSON or Protocol Buffers with secure parsing.
    - Implement input validation and sanitization for deserialized data.

## Threat: [Insecure Network Communication (HTTP)](./threats/insecure_network_communication__http_.md)

- **Description:** Using unencrypted HTTP for sensitive network communication exposes data to interception. Attackers can eavesdrop, steal credentials, game state, or modify data in transit (man-in-the-middle attacks).
- **Impact:** Data theft, account compromise, game manipulation, man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Cocos2d-x Component Affected:** Networking module (if directly used), game code handling network communication.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Always use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for all network communication, especially for sensitive data.
    - Implement proper certificate validation.
    - Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text in network requests.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Critical Third-Party Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_critical_third-party_libraries.md)

- **Description:** Cocos2d-x relies on third-party libraries. Critical vulnerabilities in these libraries (e.g., in animation or physics libraries) can be exploited by attackers, for example, by providing malicious animation files or triggering specific physics interactions.
- **Impact:** Can range from denial of service and application crashes to arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability.
- **Cocos2d-x Component Affected:** Integration of third-party libraries, modules using these libraries (e.g., `Spine` module, `Physics` module).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly update third-party libraries to the latest versions.
    - Monitor security advisories for used third-party libraries.
    - Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
