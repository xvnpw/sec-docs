# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals
  - Provide a robust, cross-platform game engine for developers to create 2D and 3D games.
  - Foster a large and active community of developers around the engine.
  - Enable developers to easily deploy games to multiple platforms, reducing development time and cost.
  - Maintain the engine as open-source and freely available to developers.

- Business Risks
  - Security vulnerabilities in the engine could be exploited in games built with cocos2d-x, leading to potential game exploits, cheating, or denial of service.
  - Lack of timely security updates and patches could erode developer trust and community confidence.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting the engine's dependencies or build process could compromise the engine itself and games built with it.
  - Reputational damage if the engine is perceived as insecure or unreliable.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls
  - security control: Code reviews are likely conducted by maintainers and community contributors as part of the pull request process. (Location: GitHub Pull Request process)
  - security control: Issue tracking system is used to report and manage bugs, including potential security vulnerabilities. (Location: GitHub Issues)
  - security control: Open-source nature allows for community scrutiny and contribution to identify and fix security issues. (Location: Open Source Community)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching may lead to delays in addressing critical issues.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be introduced by community contributors who may not have sufficient security expertise.

- Recommended Security Controls
  - recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Integrate Dependency Scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the engine.
  - recommended security control: Establish a clear and public vulnerability disclosure policy and process to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
  - recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the engine by security experts.
  - recommended security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using cocos2d-x to build games securely.

- Security Requirements
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the game engine itself. Authentication is typically implemented within games built using cocos2d-x, and the engine should provide functionalities to support secure authentication mechanisms if needed by game developers.
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is primarily a concern for games built with cocos2d-x. The engine should offer features that allow developers to implement robust authorization logic within their games.
  - Input Validation: The engine must handle various types of input (user input, network data, file data) securely. Input validation should be implemented at multiple levels within the engine to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, injection attacks, and cross-site scripting (if applicable to web-based games).
  - Cryptography: The engine should provide well-vetted and easy-to-use cryptographic libraries and functions for game developers to implement secure features such as data encryption, secure communication, and integrity checks. This includes support for common cryptographic algorithms and protocols.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes
  - Providing a secure and reliable game engine to developers.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trust of the cocos2d-x project within the game development community.
  - Ensuring the continued adoption and use of cocos2d-x for game development.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity
  - Source code of the cocos2d-x engine: High sensitivity (Intellectual Property, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Compromise could lead to unauthorized modifications, theft of IP, and introduction of vulnerabilities.
  - Build artifacts (compiled engine libraries): Medium sensitivity (Integrity, Availability). Compromise could lead to distribution of malicious or vulnerable engine versions.
  - Project infrastructure (GitHub repository, build systems): Medium sensitivity (Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality). Compromise could disrupt development, introduce malicious code, or expose project information.
  - Community and developer data (GitHub accounts, forum data): Low to Medium sensitivity (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Depending on the data collected and stored by the project's online presence.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports for cocos2d-x? Is there a dedicated security team or point of contact?
  - Are there any existing security testing practices in place, such as penetration testing or security audits?
  - What is the expected level of security expertise among developers using cocos2d-x? Should security documentation and tools be geared towards beginners or experienced developers?
  - Are there specific types of games or industries that cocos2d-x is primarily targeting? This could influence the threat model (e.g., games handling sensitive user data).

- Assumptions
  - The primary security concern is vulnerabilities within the cocos2d-x engine code that could be exploited in games built with it.
  - The cocos2d-x project operates with limited resources for dedicated security efforts, relying heavily on community contributions and open-source security best practices.
  - Games built with cocos2d-x are diverse in genre and complexity, and security requirements will vary depending on the specific game.
  - The target audience for this design document includes security-conscious developers, project maintainers, and potentially security researchers interested in contributing to the project's security.
