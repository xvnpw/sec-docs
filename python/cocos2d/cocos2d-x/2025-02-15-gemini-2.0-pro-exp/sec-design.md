# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a free, open-source, cross-platform game development framework.
*   Maintain a large and active community of developers.
*   Ensure ease of use and rapid development capabilities.
*   Support a wide range of platforms and devices.
*   Enable developers to create high-performance 2D games.
*   Facilitate the creation of games that can be easily monetized.

Business Risks:

*   Malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities in the framework to compromise games built with it, potentially impacting a large number of users.
*   The open-source nature of the project makes it susceptible to malicious contributions or forks that could harm the reputation and trustworthiness of the framework.
*   Lack of robust security practices could lead to intellectual property theft or unauthorized modification of the framework.
*   Failure to address security concerns could lead to decreased adoption by developers and damage the project's reputation.
*   Inability to secure the build and distribution process could lead to compromised releases.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews are performed, although the consistency and depth may vary (mentioned throughout the repository's contribution guidelines).
*   security control: Community involvement in identifying and reporting issues (implicit in the open-source nature).
*   security control: Use of CMake for build configuration, which can help manage dependencies (described in build documentation).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security improvements and vulnerability identification.
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities due to the complexity of the codebase and the wide range of supported platforms.
*   accepted risk: Limited formal security testing and auditing.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement static application security testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) for runtime vulnerability analysis.
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   Establish a formal vulnerability disclosure program.
*   Provide security training for core contributors.
*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   Use code signing for releases.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the framework itself, but guidance should be provided to developers on implementing secure authentication mechanisms in their games.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to the framework itself, but guidance should be provided to developers on implementing secure authorization mechanisms in their games.
*   Input Validation: The framework should provide robust input validation mechanisms to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and injection attacks.  This is crucial for handling user input, file loading, and network communication.
*   Cryptography: The framework should provide secure cryptographic primitives for common tasks like data encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.  Guidance should be provided on using these primitives securely.

    Build_Script -- Performs --> SCA["SCA Tools"]
    Build_Script -- Generates --> Build_Artifacts["Build Artifacts\n(APK, IPA, Executable)"]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Code Commit:** The developer commits code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  **CI Trigger:** The commit triggers a build process on a CI server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
3.  **Build Script Execution:** The CI server executes a build script (e.g., CMake).
4.  **Compilation:** The build script uses a compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) to compile the source code.
5.  **Dependency Management:** The build script manages and links third-party libraries.
6.  **Security Analysis:**
    *   **SAST:** Static Application Security Testing tools are run to analyze the source code for vulnerabilities.
    *   **SCA:** Software Composition Analysis tools are run to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
7.  **Artifact Generation:** The build script generates the final build artifacts (e.g., APK for Android, IPA for iOS, executable for desktop platforms).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   **Version Control (Git):** Tracks code changes and allows for auditing.
*   **CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins):** Automates the build process and ensures consistency.
*   **SAST Tools:** Identify vulnerabilities in the source code.
*   **SCA Tools:** Identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   **Code Signing (Recommended):** Ensures the integrity and authenticity of the build artifacts.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Game development and distribution.
*   Community engagement and support.
*   Maintenance and updates of the framework.

Data to Protect:

*   **Source Code (Sensitivity: Medium):**  The framework's source code is publicly available, but unauthorized modifications or malicious forks could harm the project's reputation.
*   **Third-Party Library Dependencies (Sensitivity: Medium to High):** Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited in games built with Cocos2d-x.
*   **User Data (Sensitivity: Varies):**  This depends on the specific games built with Cocos2d-x.  The framework itself doesn't directly handle user data, but games built with it might. Developers are responsible for securing user data within their games.
*   **Build Artifacts (Sensitivity: High):**  Compromised build artifacts could lead to widespread distribution of malicious code.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What is the current level of security awareness among the core contributors and the wider community?
*   Are there any existing security audits or penetration tests that have been performed on Cocos2d-x?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community?
*   Are there any specific platform security requirements that need to be considered (e.g., iOS App Store Review Guidelines)?
*   What is the budget and resource allocation for security improvements?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The project prioritizes being open-source and community-driven.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: There is a basic level of security awareness, but formal security practices are limited.
*   DESIGN: The framework relies heavily on C++ and third-party libraries. The build process is automated to some extent, but security checks may not be comprehensive.
