# Attack Surface Analysis for cocos2d/cocos2d-x

## Attack Surface: [Resource Loading and Path Traversal (Cocos2d-x File Utilities)](./attack_surfaces/resource_loading_and_path_traversal__cocos2d-x_file_utilities_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from how Cocos2d-x's resource loading mechanisms handle file paths, potentially allowing attackers to access or manipulate files outside the intended application sandbox.  This focuses specifically on the `FileUtils` class and related functions within Cocos2d-x.
*   **Cocos2d-x Contribution:** Cocos2d-x's `FileUtils` class provides the core functions for loading resources (images, audio, scripts, etc.).  Insecure use of these functions (e.g., constructing file paths from user-supplied data without proper sanitization) directly introduces the vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker provides a crafted configuration file that includes a resource path like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` to a function like `Sprite::create()`. If `FileUtils::fullPathForFilename` (or a related function) doesn't properly sanitize this, the application might attempt to load the system's password file.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure (reading sensitive files).
    *   Potential code execution (if a malicious script is loaded).
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Path Validation:** *Never* construct file paths directly from user input within Cocos2d-x functions. Use a whitelist of allowed directories and filenames. Sanitize all paths to remove potentially dangerous characters (e.g., "..", "/", "\\").  Rely on `FileUtils::fullPathForFilename` and related functions *correctly*, ensuring they are used as intended to resolve paths within the application's resource directory.
    *   **Resource Integrity Checks:** Verify the integrity of downloaded resources (if applicable) using checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures before passing them to Cocos2d-x loading functions.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Ensure the application, and therefore Cocos2d-x's file access, operates within a restricted environment (sandbox) that limits its access to the filesystem.
    *   **Resource Loading Limits:** Implement limits on the size and number of resources that Cocos2d-x can load to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Exploitation (Cocos2d-x Bindings)](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_exploitation__cocos2d-x_bindings_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Cocos2d-x integrates with and exposes its API to scripting engines (Lua or JavaScript), allowing attackers to inject and execute malicious code through the engine's bindings.
*   **Cocos2d-x Contribution:** Cocos2d-x provides the bindings that allow Lua and JavaScript scripts to interact with the engine's C++ code.  The security of these bindings is paramount.  If the bindings allow unsafe access to native functions or don't properly validate input from scripts, this creates a direct attack vector.
*   **Example:**
    *   A game uses Cocos2d-x's Lua bindings.  A vulnerability in the binding for a function that modifies game state allows an attacker to inject Lua code that calls this function with arbitrary parameters, leading to unintended game behavior or even a crash.  Or, a binding might expose a function that *should* be internal, allowing a script to bypass security checks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete application compromise (arbitrary code execution through the scripting engine).
    *   Data theft.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Modification of game state.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization (at the Binding Level):**  *Crucially*, sanitize *all* input passed from scripts to Cocos2d-x's C++ functions through the bindings.  Treat all script input as untrusted.  This is often *more* important than sanitizing user input *within* the script itself, as the bindings are the gatekeeper.
    *   **Secure Bindings:** Use a secure, up-to-date version of Cocos2d-x.  The Cocos2d-x developers are responsible for the security of the bindings, so staying updated is essential.
    *   **Minimal API Exposure:**  Expose only the *absolutely necessary* Cocos2d-x functions to the scripting engine.  Avoid exposing internal or sensitive functions.  Carefully review the API exposed to scripts.
    *   **Code Review (of Bindings):** If you are modifying or extending Cocos2d-x's bindings, perform a thorough security code review of the binding code itself.
    *   **Sandboxing (of the Scripting Engine):** Even with secure bindings, consider running the scripting engine in a separate, isolated process with limited privileges, if possible. This limits the damage if the scripting engine itself is compromised.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data (Cocos2d-x Data Structures)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data__cocos2d-x_data_structures_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from Cocos2d-x deserializing data from untrusted sources (network, files) into its own data structures without proper validation. This is specifically about Cocos2d-x's *own* serialization/deserialization mechanisms, if any are used.
*   **Cocos2d-x Contribution:** If Cocos2d-x provides built-in mechanisms for serializing and deserializing its own objects (e.g., `Node` hierarchies, custom data structures), and these mechanisms are used to process untrusted data, this creates a direct vulnerability. *Note:* Cocos2d-x primarily relies on external formats like JSON or platform-specific serialization, but if custom serialization is used, this becomes relevant.
*   **Example:**
    *   If Cocos2d-x had a built-in function to deserialize a `Node` tree from a custom binary format, and this function was used to load data from a downloaded file, an attacker could craft a malicious file that, when deserialized, triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability within Cocos2d-x's internal code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution (within the context of Cocos2d-x).
    *   Data corruption.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Deserialization (with Cocos2d-x's mechanisms):** If Cocos2d-x provides custom serialization, avoid using it to deserialize data from untrusted sources. Prefer standard, well-vetted formats like JSON (with appropriate security precautions).
    *   **Whitelist-Based Deserialization (if unavoidable):** If you *must* use Cocos2d-x's custom deserialization with untrusted data, implement strict whitelisting of allowed classes/types. Reject any data that attempts to deserialize an unapproved object. This requires deep understanding of Cocos2d-x's internals.
    *   **Input Validation (before Cocos2d-x deserialization):** Before passing data to Cocos2d-x's deserialization functions, perform rigorous validation of the data's structure and content.
    *   **Secure Parsers (if applicable):** If Cocos2d-x's deserialization uses a custom parser, ensure that parser is secure and resistant to common parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Limited Privileges:** Run the code that uses Cocos2d-x's deserialization functions in a context with limited privileges.
