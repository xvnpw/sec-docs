## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Cocos2d-x and its Integrated Libraries](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_cocos2d-x_and_its_integrated_libraries.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Cocos2d-x and its Integrated Libraries

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Cocos2d-x Version:** Determine the exact version of Cocos2d-x being used (check `cocos2d.h`, project files, etc.).
    2.  **Check Official Repository:** Regularly (e.g., monthly) check the official Cocos2d-x GitHub repository for new releases, security patches, and changelogs.
    3.  **Review Changelogs:** Carefully examine changelogs for security-related fixes.  Look for keywords like "security," "vulnerability," "CVE," "fix," "patch."
    4.  **Update Process:** Follow the official Cocos2d-x upgrade instructions. This typically involves:
        *   Downloading the new version.
        *   Replacing the existing Cocos2d-x files in your project.
        *   Updating project settings (CMakeLists.txt, Xcode/Android Studio project files) to reflect the new version.
        *   Addressing any API changes or deprecations (as indicated in the changelog).
    5.  **Integrated Library Updates:** Cocos2d-x often bundles or relies on specific versions of libraries like:
        *   **Box2D/Chipmunk (Physics):** Check for updates within the Cocos2d-x release notes or the physics engine's own repository.
        *   **OpenAL/FMOD (Audio):**  Similarly, check for updates.
        *   **libcurl (Networking):** If Cocos2d-x's built-in networking uses libcurl, ensure it's updated along with Cocos2d-x.
    6.  **Test Extensively:** After updating, thoroughly test *all* game features, paying particular attention to areas that use the updated components (physics, audio, networking).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Cocos2d-x Core (Severity: High to Critical):** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the engine's core components (rendering, scene management, input handling) can lead to crashes, arbitrary code execution, or denial of service.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Integrated Libraries (Severity: High to Critical):**  Vulnerabilities in bundled libraries (physics, audio, networking) can be exploited through Cocos2d-x's API.  For example, a vulnerability in the physics engine could be triggered by specially crafted game levels.
    *   **Outdated API Usage (Severity: Moderate):**  Using deprecated Cocos2d-x APIs that have known security weaknesses (even if not formally CVEs) can increase risk.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cocos2d-x Core Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: High.  Updating directly addresses known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Integrated Library Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: High.  Updating bundled libraries eliminates known issues.
    *   **Outdated API Usage:** Risk reduction: Moderate.  Migrating to newer, more secure APIs improves the overall security posture.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example:* Cocos2d-x updates are performed when major new features are needed, but not on a regular schedule.  Integrated library updates are not explicitly tracked or managed.

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example:*  A formal, documented process for regular Cocos2d-x and integrated library updates.  Automated checks for new releases.  A dedicated testing phase specifically for post-update verification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Use of Cocos2d-x `UserDefault` and File I/O](./mitigation_strategies/secure_use_of_cocos2d-x__userdefault__and_file_io.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Use of Cocos2d-x `UserDefault` and File I/O

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`UserDefault` (Simple Data):**
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Do *not* store highly sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personally identifiable information) in `UserDefault`. It's generally stored in plain text or with weak platform-default protection.
        *   **Data Type Awareness:** Be mindful of the data types you store in `UserDefault` (strings, integers, booleans, floats).  Ensure you're retrieving the data using the correct `getXXX()` method (e.g., `getString()`, `getInteger()`).  Incorrect type handling can lead to unexpected behavior.
        *   **Input Validation (Indirect):** While `UserDefault` itself doesn't have direct input validation, ensure that the data *you write* to `UserDefault` is properly validated *before* storing it. This prevents indirect injection vulnerabilities.
    2.  **File I/O (Complex Data):**
        *   **Encryption:** If you need to store more complex or sensitive data (e.g., game save files, custom data structures), use Cocos2d-x's file I/O functions (e.g., `FileUtils::getInstance()->getDataFromFile()`, `FileUtils::getInstance()->writeToFile()`) in conjunction with *strong encryption*.
        *   **Key Management:**  *Never* hardcode encryption keys. Derive keys securely (e.g., using PBKDF2 from a user password, or using platform-specific secure storage like Keychain/Keystore).
        *   **File Path Validation:**  When reading or writing files, *always* validate the file paths.  Use Cocos2d-x's `FileUtils::getInstance()->getWritablePath()` to get the appropriate directory for storing data.  *Never* construct file paths directly from user input or untrusted sources.  This prevents path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   **Data Integrity:**  When loading data from files, calculate a checksum (e.g., SHA-256) or use an HMAC to verify the data's integrity.  Store the checksum/HMAC separately (or securely alongside the encrypted data).
        * **Atomic Operations:** If possible, use atomic file operations or a transactional approach to ensure that file writes are either fully completed or not at all, preventing data corruption in case of crashes or interruptions. Cocos2d-x doesn't provide built-in atomic file operations, so you might need platform-specific code for this.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage from `UserDefault` (Severity: Moderate):**  Exposure of less-sensitive data stored in `UserDefault`.
    *   **Data Tampering (File I/O) (Severity: High):**  Modification of game save files or other data stored on disk.
    *   **Data Corruption (File I/O) (Severity: Moderate):**  Incomplete file writes leading to unusable data.
    *   **Path Traversal (File I/O) (Severity: Critical):**  Attackers could read or write arbitrary files on the device by manipulating file paths.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **`UserDefault` Leakage:** Risk reduction: Moderate.  Avoiding sensitive data in `UserDefault` minimizes the impact of potential exposure.
    *   **File I/O Tampering:** Risk reduction: High.  Encryption and integrity checks prevent unauthorized modification.
    *   **File I/O Corruption:** Risk reduction: Moderate. Atomic operations (if implemented) prevent data corruption.
    *   **Path Traversal:** Risk reduction: High.  Strict file path validation eliminates this vulnerability.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example:* `UserDefault` is used for storing basic game settings. File I/O is used for saving game progress, but without encryption or integrity checks. File paths are constructed using `getWritablePath()`, but without additional validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example:*  Encryption of sensitive data stored using File I/O.  Secure key management for file encryption.  Integrity checks (checksums/HMACs) for loaded files.  Thorough file path validation to prevent path traversal.  Consideration of atomic file operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Handling of External Data in Cocos2d-x Callbacks and Event Listeners](./mitigation_strategies/safe_handling_of_external_data_in_cocos2d-x_callbacks_and_event_listeners.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Safe Handling of External Data in Cocos2d-x Callbacks and Event Listeners

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Callbacks/Listeners:** Identify all Cocos2d-x callbacks and event listeners in your code.  This includes:
        *   **Touch Events:** `EventListenerTouchOneByOne`, `EventListenerTouchAllAtOnce`.
        *   **Keyboard Events:** `EventListenerKeyboard`.
        *   **Accelerometer Events:** `EventListenerAcceleration`.
        *   **Custom Events:** `EventListenerCustom`.
        *   **Network Callbacks:** Callbacks associated with network requests (if using Cocos2d-x's networking features).
        *   **Scheduler Callbacks:** `scheduleUpdate()`, `schedule()`.
    2.  **Data Validation:** Within each callback/listener, *validate all data* received from the event.  This is crucial because these events are often triggered by external input (user interaction, network data, sensor data).
        *   **Touch Events:** Check the validity of touch coordinates.  Ensure they are within the expected bounds of the screen or UI elements.
        *   **Keyboard Events:** Sanitize keyboard input.  Be particularly careful if you're using keyboard input to construct strings or commands.
        *   **Accelerometer Events:** Validate accelerometer data.  Ensure the values are within the expected range.
        *   **Network Callbacks:**  Thoroughly validate *all* data received from the network.  Do not trust data implicitly.  Check for data type, length, range, and expected format.
        *   **Scheduler Callbacks:** Be mindful of any data passed to scheduled callbacks.  Ensure that this data is validated and sanitized, especially if it originates from external sources.
    3.  **Avoid Direct Use of Untrusted Data:** Do not directly use untrusted data from callbacks/listeners to:
        *   Construct file paths.
        *   Execute Lua/JavaScript code (e.g., using `eval`).
        *   Modify game state without proper validation.
        *   Display text without proper escaping (to prevent XSS if using a web view).
    4. **Thread Safety:** If callbacks are executed on different threads (which can happen with Cocos2d-x's scheduler or networking), ensure that data shared between threads is accessed and modified in a thread-safe manner (using mutexes, atomic operations, or other synchronization mechanisms).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (Severity: High):**  Attackers could inject malicious data through touch events, keyboard input, or network data to manipulate game logic or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Logic Errors (Severity: Variable):**  Invalid or unexpected data from callbacks/listeners can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or data corruption.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (in Web Views) (Severity: High):**  If a web view is used and data from callbacks is displayed without escaping, attackers could inject malicious scripts.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Moderate):** Malformed input could cause crashes or hangs within callback functions.
    * **Race Conditions (Severity: Moderate):** If multiple threads access shared data without proper synchronization, it can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduction: High.  Thorough data validation and sanitization prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduction: Moderate.  Data validation helps prevent unexpected behavior caused by invalid input.
    *   **XSS (in Web Views):** Risk reduction: High.  Proper escaping of data displayed in web views prevents XSS.
    * **DoS:** Risk reduction: Moderate. Input validation can prevent crashes caused by malformed data.
    * **Race Conditions:** Risk reduction: High. Thread-safe data access prevents race conditions.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Example:* Basic validation of touch coordinates is performed.  Keyboard input is used for simple text entry, but without extensive sanitization. Network data is parsed, but with limited validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:** *Example:*  Comprehensive data validation for all callbacks/listeners, including network callbacks.  Strict sanitization of keyboard input.  Careful handling of data shared between threads.  Consideration of potential XSS vulnerabilities if web views are used.
