# Threat Model Analysis for cocos2d/cocos2d-x

## Threat: [Lua Script Injection/Modification (if Lua is used)](./threats/lua_script_injectionmodification__if_lua_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If the game utilizes Lua scripting (a common practice in Cocos2d-x development), an attacker modifies existing Lua scripts bundled with the application or injects new malicious scripts.  This allows them to alter game logic, gain unauthorized access to data exposed to the Lua environment, or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the Lua scripting engine. Attackers can achieve this by modifying the application package (APK, IPA) or, in some cases, by exploiting vulnerabilities that allow for runtime script modification.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete control over the game's behavior and logic.
        *   Access to sensitive data that is accessible within the Lua scripting environment.
        *   Ability to implement cheats and gain unfair advantages.
        *   Potential for more severe system compromise if the Lua environment interacts with native code in an insecure manner (e.g., through poorly designed bindings).
    *   **Cocos2d-x Component Affected:**
        *   `LuaEngine`: This is the core component responsible for executing Lua scripts within Cocos2d-x.
        *   Any Cocos2d-x classes or functions that expose functionality or data to the Lua environment through bindings (e.g., custom C++ classes registered with Lua).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Lua Bytecode Compilation:** Compile all Lua scripts into bytecode before deploying the application. This makes the scripts more difficult to read and modify, although it's not a complete solution as bytecode can still be decompiled.
        *   **Script Integrity Checks:** Calculate cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) of the Lua scripts (either source or bytecode) during development.  At runtime, before executing any script, verify its hash against the stored value. If the hash doesn't match, prevent the script from running.
        *   **Secure Bindings:**  Extremely carefully review and secure all bindings between Lua and native (C++) code. Minimize the functionality exposed to the Lua environment.  Avoid exposing any sensitive operations or data directly.  Use strong input validation on any data passed from Lua to native code.
        *   **Sandboxing (Difficult but Ideal):**  Ideally, run Lua scripts in a sandboxed environment with strictly limited access to system resources and sensitive data.  This is often very challenging to implement effectively and may have performance implications, but it provides the strongest protection.

## Threat: [Memory Manipulation (Targeting Cocos2d-x Game State)](./threats/memory_manipulation__targeting_cocos2d-x_game_state_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses debugging tools, memory editors (such as GameGuardian on Android), or custom-built tools to directly modify the game's memory while it's running.  This allows them to alter game variables, manipulate object states, or even call functions directly.  The attacker targets data structures and logic managed by Cocos2d-x, such as node positions, sprite properties, game scores, and resource counts.  This is a common technique for cheating in games.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unfair advantages in the game (e.g., infinite health, unlimited resources, bypassing level restrictions).
        *   Bypassing of in-app purchase mechanisms.
        *   Potential for triggering crashes or undefined behavior by corrupting memory.
        *   In some cases, if combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., a buffer overflow), memory manipulation could lead to arbitrary code execution, although this is less common than simple cheating.
    *   **Cocos2d-x Component Affected:**
        *   This is a broad threat that affects virtually all Cocos2d-x components that manage game state and data in memory.  This includes:
            *   `Node` and its subclasses (e.g., `Sprite`, `Label`, `Layer`):  Attackers can modify properties like position, scale, rotation, visibility, and custom data.
            *   `ActionManager`:  Attackers might try to manipulate or bypass running actions.
            *   `Scheduler`:  Attackers could interfere with scheduled tasks.
            *   Any custom C++ classes that store game state data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Anti-Debugging Techniques:** Implement checks to detect if a debugger is attached to the game process. If a debugger is detected, the game should terminate, obfuscate its behavior, or take other defensive actions.  This makes it more difficult for attackers to use common debugging tools.
        *   **Obfuscation:** Obfuscate the names and structures of critical game variables and data structures in memory.  This makes it harder for attackers to locate and identify the values they want to modify.  Tools like code obfuscators can help with this.
        *   **Data Encryption (in Memory):**  Encrypt sensitive game data *in memory* when it's not actively being used.  Decrypt it only when needed and re-encrypt it immediately afterward.  This adds computational overhead but significantly increases the difficulty of direct memory modification.
        *   **Consistency Checks and Redundancy:**  Regularly check the integrity and consistency of important game state data.  For example, you might store redundant copies of critical values or calculate checksums.  If inconsistencies are detected, assume tampering and take appropriate action (e.g., reset the game state, terminate the session, report the event to a server).
        *   **Server-Side Validation (Crucial):**  For critical game events, actions, and data, perform validation on a trusted server.  Do *not* rely solely on client-side checks, as these can be bypassed by memory manipulation.

## Threat: [Outdated Cocos2d-x Version with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/outdated_cocos2d-x_version_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application is built using an older version of the Cocos2d-x framework that contains known and publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities. Attackers can research these vulnerabilities and develop exploits specifically targeting the outdated version.
    *   **Impact:** The impact varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability. It could range from:
        *   Minor information disclosure (e.g., leaking internal file paths).
        *   Denial of service (crashing the game).
        *   Arbitrary code execution (allowing the attacker to run their own code within the game's process). This is the most severe impact.
    *   **Cocos2d-x Component Affected:** Potentially *any* component of Cocos2d-x could be affected, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. This could include:
        *   `FileUtils`
        *   `network::HttpClient`
        *   `LuaEngine`
        *   Rendering components
        *   Audio engine
        *   Input handling
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates (Essential):**  Keep the Cocos2d-x framework updated to the *latest stable version*.  This is the most important mitigation.  Newer versions include security patches that address known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Actively monitor the official Cocos2d-x website, forums, and security mailing lists for announcements of new vulnerabilities and available patches.
        *   **Patching:** If a critical vulnerability is discovered and a patch is available (but a full version update is not immediately feasible), apply the patch as soon as possible.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Proactive):** Use vulnerability scanning tools that can identify known vulnerabilities in specific versions of Cocos2d-x and other libraries.
