# Attack Surface Analysis for cocos2d/cocos2d-x

## Attack Surface: [Resource Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/resource_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths used to load resources (images, audio, scripts) to access files outside the intended application directory.
    *   **How Cocos2d-x Contributes:** Cocos2d-x uses file paths to load resources. If these paths are constructed dynamically based on user input or external data without proper sanitization, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Providing a resource path like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` to attempt to read sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application data or even system files, potential for application compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid constructing resource paths directly from user input. Use predefined resource identifiers or sanitize input thoroughly. Implement strict file access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Resource File Parsing](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_resource_file_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted resource files (images, audio, etc.) can exploit vulnerabilities in the libraries used by Cocos2d-x to parse these formats.
    *   **How Cocos2d-x Contributes:** Cocos2d-x relies on external libraries (e.g., libpng, libjpeg, audio decoders) to handle various file formats. Vulnerabilities in these libraries directly impact applications using Cocos2d-x.
    *   **Example:** Loading a PNG image with a crafted header that triggers a buffer overflow in the image decoding library.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, memory corruption, potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep Cocos2d-x and its dependencies updated to the latest versions, as these often include security patches for underlying libraries. Validate resource files before loading if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Script Injection (Lua/JavaScript)](./attack_surfaces/script_injection__luajavascript_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts (Lua or JavaScript, depending on the scripting backend used) if the application allows loading or executing external code insecurely.
    *   **How Cocos2d-x Contributes:** Cocos2d-x supports scripting languages for game logic. If the application loads scripts from untrusted sources or constructs script code based on user input without proper sanitization, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Injecting a Lua script that uses Cocos2d-x's API to access sensitive data or modify game state in an unauthorized way.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the application's logic, potential for data manipulation, exfiltration, or even remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid loading scripts from untrusted sources. If necessary, implement strict sandboxing and input validation for any data used to construct script code. Use secure coding practices when interacting with the scripting engine.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_communication.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive data transmitted over the network can be intercepted or manipulated if insecure protocols (like HTTP) are used or server certificates are not validated.
    *   **How Cocos2d-x Contributes:** Cocos2d-x provides networking capabilities (e.g., `network::HttpClient`). If developers don't use these features securely, the application is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Transmitting user credentials or in-app purchase details over an unencrypted HTTP connection using `network::HttpClient` without certificate validation.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, man-in-the-middle attacks, potential for account compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always use HTTPS for transmitting sensitive data when using Cocos2d-x's networking features. Implement proper server certificate validation. Avoid storing sensitive data directly in the application if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Game State](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_game_state.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted game save files can exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process, potentially leading to code execution or data manipulation.
    *   **How Cocos2d-x Contributes:** If the application uses Cocos2d-x's built-in mechanisms or external libraries for saving and loading game state without proper security measures, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Modifying a saved game file that is loaded using Cocos2d-x's file handling to inject code that will be executed when the game is loaded.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, manipulation of game state, potential for cheating or other unintended behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid using default serialization mechanisms without security considerations when saving and loading game state within a Cocos2d-x application. Implement data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) for saved game data. Consider using more secure serialization formats.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Cocos2d-x relies on various third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be inherited by applications using Cocos2d-x.
    *   **How Cocos2d-x Contributes:** Cocos2d-x integrates with and depends on external libraries for various functionalities.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of a library bundled with or used by Cocos2d-x, such as an image decoding library or a networking library.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from application crashes to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update Cocos2d-x and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories for used libraries.
