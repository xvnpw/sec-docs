| Threat | Description (Attacker Actions & How) | Impact | Affected Haystack Component(s) | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Model Spoofing/Poisoning** | An attacker replaces the legitimate NLP model used by Haystack with a malicious one. This could happen if the application fetches models from untrusted sources or doesn't verify model integrity, leading Haystack's Reader or Generator to use the compromised model. |  The application produces incorrect, biased, or even harmful outputs based on the malicious model. This could lead to misinformation, security vulnerabilities if the model is designed to exploit the application, or reputational damage. | Reader module, Generator module, Model Hub integrations | **High** | - Use trusted and verified model sources (e.g., Hugging Face Hub with verified models). <br> - Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of downloaded models (e.g., checksums, signatures). <br> - Consider hosting models internally if feasible. <br> - Regularly update models from trusted sources. |
| **Document Store Spoofing** | An attacker manipulates the DocumentStore connection details or redirects Haystack to a fake data source. This could be achieved by compromising configuration files or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Haystack establishes the connection to the DocumentStore (e.g., insecurely stored credentials). | The application might operate on incorrect or malicious data, leading to flawed search results, biased answers, or even denial of service if the fake source is unavailable. It could also lead to data breaches if the fake source is a honeypot designed to capture sensitive information. | DocumentStore initialization, `elasticsearch` or other DocumentStore client libraries within Haystack | **High** | - Securely store and manage DocumentStore credentials (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management). <br> - Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the underlying data source. <br> - Regularly audit DocumentStore configurations and connection parameters within the Haystack setup. <br> - Use network segmentation to restrict access to the DocumentStore from the Haystack instance. |
| **Data Poisoning during Ingestion** | An attacker injects malicious or misleading data into the documents being indexed by Haystack. This could happen if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate data before passing it to Haystack's DocumentIngester or `write_documents` function. |  Search results become unreliable and potentially harmful. Biased or incorrect information can be presented to users through Haystack's retrieval mechanisms. In extreme cases, injected malicious content could lead to XSS vulnerabilities if search results are displayed without proper sanitization by the application. | DocumentIngester, PreProcessors within Haystack, DocumentStore's `write_documents` function | **High** | - Implement robust input validation and sanitization before indexing any data using Haystack's ingestion methods. <br> - Utilize Haystack's PreProcessors for data cleaning and transformation before indexing. <br> - Implement access controls on data sources to prevent unauthorized modifications before they reach Haystack. <br> - Regularly review and audit the indexed data within the Haystack DocumentStore for anomalies. |
| **Pipeline Tampering** | An attacker modifies the definition or configuration of Haystack pipelines. This could be achieved by compromising configuration files that define Haystack pipelines or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application loads and executes Haystack pipelines. |  The application's behavior becomes unpredictable. Attackers could inject malicious components into the pipeline, alter the flow of data processing within Haystack, or cause denial of service by introducing resource-intensive components into the Haystack pipeline. | Pipeline definition (YAML files, Python code used with Haystack's `Pipeline` class), `Pipeline.add_node` function | **High** | - Store pipeline definitions securely and restrict modification access. <br> - Avoid dynamic pipeline creation based on untrusted user input that directly manipulates Haystack pipeline definitions. <br> - Implement version control for Haystack pipeline definitions. <br> - Thoroughly review and test any changes to Haystack pipeline configurations. |
| **Code Injection through Custom Components** | If the application uses custom Haystack components (e.g., custom Retrievers, Readers, or Nodes in a pipeline), vulnerabilities in these components could allow for code execution within the Haystack environment. This could happen if input validation is missing or if insecure libraries are used within the custom Haystack component. |  Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Haystack instance, potentially leading to full system compromise and data breaches. | Custom Haystack components (e.g., custom Nodes, Retrievers, Readers extending Haystack's base classes) | **Critical** | - Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Haystack components. <br> - Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within custom Haystack components. <br> - Regularly review and audit custom Haystack component code. <br> - Use well-vetted and secure libraries within custom Haystack components. |
| **Insecure Configuration of Integrations** | Misconfigured integrations within Haystack with external services (e.g., databases, vector stores, model providers) expose vulnerabilities. This could involve storing credentials insecurely within Haystack's integration configurations or having overly permissive access controls configured within Haystack's integration setup. |  Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the integrated services through the Haystack integration, potentially leading to data breaches or the ability to manipulate external systems. | Integration modules within Haystack (e.g., `ElasticsearchDocumentStore`, `FAISSDocumentStore` configuration), API client libraries used by Haystack integrations | **High** | - Securely store and manage credentials for external integrations used by Haystack (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management, not hardcoding credentials). <br> - Implement the principle of least privilege for integration access configured within Haystack. <br> - Regularly review and audit integration configurations and permissions within the Haystack setup. <br> - Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for external integrations configured within Haystack. |
