- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Default Django Settings in Example Project

- **Description:**  
  The example project’s Django settings (located in `/code/example/project/settings.py`) are configured with insecure defaults that are acceptable only during local development. An external threat actor who manages to deploy or access a publicly available instance using these settings can trigger the vulnerability in the following way:
  1. The settings have `DEBUG` set to `True`, which means that when an error occurs the full debug traceback (including sensitive configuration details) is rendered in the HTTP response.
  2. `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is set to `["*"]`, which does not restrict which hosts can access the application.
  3. A hard-coded and weak `SECRET_KEY` is used.  
  An attacker can intentionally cause an error (for example, by requesting a non-existent route or triggering an exception in a view) and receive detailed error pages that reveal internal file paths, environment details, and other sensitive information, thereby facilitating further attacks.

- **Impact:**  
  - **Information Disclosure:** Detailed error pages may reveal sensitive data (e.g., secret keys, environment variables, configuration paths).  
  - **Facilitated Exploitation:** Knowledge gained from debug information can help an attacker craft further targeted attacks against the system.  
  - **Misuse of Insecure Defaults:** With `ALLOWED_HOSTS` left open, the application may be accessible from any network location, compounding the risk.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The project documentation and production build commands (e.g., `python manage.py tailwind build`) imply that there is an intended production configuration process.  
  - The insecure settings appear only in the example project provided for local development.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No explicit safeguards are provided to prevent deployment with `DEBUG = True` in a production environment.  
  - There is no mechanism to enforce a secure, randomly generated `SECRET_KEY` outside of development.
  - The example settings do not restrict `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, leaving the application open to access from any host.

- **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker’s target is a publicly accessible deployment running the example project settings (i.e. using `/code/example/project/settings.py` with `DEBUG=True`, an open `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and a weak, hard-coded `SECRET_KEY`).
  - The deployment is not reconfigured for production (for example, by setting `DEBUG=False`, a proper `SECRET_KEY`, and a restricted `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list).

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  1. In `/code/example/project/settings.py` the following lines highlight the insecure configuration:
     - `SECRET_KEY = "7c@h1io9=5@8m%fqlyvnx&!x0zm556-g@+dpvu4ab+tsjkm@vm"`  
       → A hard-coded key that is publicly visible.
     - `DEBUG = True`  
       → Enables Django’s debug mode, which provides detailed error reports.
     - `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]`  
       → Allows HTTP requests from any host, meaning there is no host header or origin validation.
  2. These settings are intended for local or development use. However, if an attacker deploys the example project “as is” or if a developer fails to change these values before deploying to production, the insecure defaults directly expose sensitive debug information to the public.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Deployment Setup:**  
     - Deploy the application using the example project configuration (ensure that `/code/example/project/settings.py` is in use without changes).
     - Confirm that the instance is accessible from an external network.
  2. **Triggering an Error:**  
     - Access a non-existent URL or perform an action designed to trigger a server error (for example, by visiting a URL that does not match any valid path).
  3. **Verifying Detailed Debug Information:**  
     - Observe the error page returned by Django. If `DEBUG` is `True`, the page will include a full traceback with internal file paths, settings values (including the `SECRET_KEY`), and other sensitive data.
  4. **Host Verification:**  
     - Use network tools (or review HTTP response headers) to confirm that the application is serving requests from all hosts (due to `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]`).
  5. **Conclusion:**  
     - If detailed debug information is visible and the settings remain unconfined, the vulnerability is confirmed.
