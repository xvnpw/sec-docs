### Vulnerability List:

* **Vulnerability Name:** Unvalidated data creation in `Select2ListView` and `Select2ProvidedValueListView`

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker can send a POST request to the `Select2ListViewAutocomplete` or `Select2ProvidedValueListViewAutocomplete` views with a `text` parameter.
    2. These views, designed for handling list-based autocompletes, implement a `create` method that directly returns the provided `text` without any validation or sanitization.
    3. If the autocomplete widget using these views is configured with `create_field`, it enables the "Create 'text'" option in the dropdown.
    4. When a user (potentially an admin or other authorized user in certain admin configurations) selects this "Create" option and submits the form, the `create` method in the view is called via a POST request, adding the unvalidated `text` directly into the choices.
    5. In the provided `Select2ListViewAutocomplete` and `Select2ProvidedValueListViewAutocomplete` views, the `create` method returns the unsanitized user input directly. This input is then displayed as a selectable option in the autocomplete widget for subsequent requests.
    6. If an attacker provides malicious JavaScript code as the `text` parameter, this code will be rendered in the HTML when the autocomplete suggestions are displayed, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

* **Impact:**
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    - An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
    - When an authorized user views the page containing the vulnerable autocomplete widget, the injected script will execute in their browser.
    - This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim user's session.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The `create` methods in `Select2ListView` and `Select2ProvidedValueListView` in `dal/autocomplete.py` and `dal_select2/views.py`, and the example views in `/code/test_project/select2_list/views.py` do not perform any validation or sanitization of the input text.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization in the `create` methods of `Select2ListView` and `Select2ProvidedValueListView` in both `dal/autocomplete.py` and `dal_select2/views.py`.
    - HTML escaping of the text rendered in the autocomplete suggestions, especially when displaying the "Create 'text'" option and the created options themselves.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The `Select2ListViewAutocomplete` or `Select2ProvidedValueListViewAutocomplete` views (or similar subclasses using `Select2ListView` or `Select2ProvidedValueListView` from either `dal/autocomplete.py` or `dal_select2/views.py`) are used with `ListSelect2` widget.
    - The `ListSelect2` widget is configured with `create_field` option enabled (implicitly or explicitly by setting `data-tags="1"` or similar).
    - An attacker can send POST requests to the autocomplete view URL.
    - An authorized user (e.g., admin) views a page containing the vulnerable autocomplete widget and triggers the autocomplete functionality by typing in the field and potentially selecting the "Create" option after an attacker has injected malicious code.

* **Source Code Analysis:**

    1. **`dal/autocomplete.py` and `dal_select2/views.py` - `Select2ListView.create` and `Select2ProvidedValueListView.create`:**
    ```python
    # dal/autocomplete.py
    class Select2ListView(ViewMixin, View):
        # ...
        def post(self, request):
            # ...
            if self.create_field and 'text' in request.POST:
                text = request.POST['text']
                if self.has_create_permission(request):
                    new_item = self.create(text) # Vulnerable line
                    if new_item is None:
                        return HttpResponseBadRequest('Create not allowed')
                    # ...
                    return HttpResponse(json.dumps({
                        'id': self.get_created_item_value(new_item),
                        'text': self.get_created_item_text(new_item),
                    }), content_type='application/json')
            return HttpResponseBadRequest('Create not allowed')

        def create(self, text):
            """Create and return new item from text, or None."""
            raise ImproperlyConfigured(
                "'create' method must be implemented to use create_field"
            )

    class Select2ProvidedValueListView(Select2ListView):
        # ...
        def create(self, text):
            """Create and return new item from text, or None."""
            raise ImproperlyConfigured(
                "'create' method must be implemented to use create_field"
            )

    # dal_select2/views.py
    class Select2ListView(ViewMixin, View):
        # ...
        def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            """Add an option to the autocomplete list.

            ...
            """
            if not hasattr(self, 'create'):
                raise ImproperlyConfigured('Missing "create()"')

            text = request.POST.get('text', None)

            if text is None:
                return http.HttpResponseBadRequest()

            text = self.create(text) # Vulnerable line

            if text is None:
                return http.HttpResponseBadRequest()

            return http.JsonResponse({
                'id': text,
                'text': text,
            })

        def create(self, text):
            """Create and return new item from text, or None."""
            raise ImproperlyConfigured(
                "'create' method must be implemented to use create_field"
            )
    ```
    - The base classes `Select2ListView` and `Select2ProvidedValueListView` in `dal/autocomplete.py` and `dal_select2/views.py` expect the `create` method to be overridden in subclasses to provide actual creation logic.
    - If subclasses (like example views or user-defined views) implement `create` like this (example from previous analysis, but applicable to both locations):
    ```python
    class CustomSelect2ListViewAutocomplete(Select2ListView): # or Select2ListView from dal_select2/views.py
        def create(self, text):
            return text # Unsafe: Returns unsanitized input directly
        # ...
    ```
    - They directly return the user-provided `text` without any sanitization. This is the root cause of the XSS vulnerability in both locations.

    2. **`dal_select2/widgets.py` - `ListSelect2` rendering:**
    - The `ListSelect2` widget, used in conjunction with these views, renders the options received from the view. If the `text` attribute in the JSON response from the `create` method contains malicious JavaScript, it will be inserted into the HTML without proper escaping, leading to XSS when the browser renders the suggestions.

        Application->Backend: Call Select2ListView.create("<script>alert('XSS')</script>")
        Backend->Backend: Select2ListView.create returns "<script>alert('XSS')</script>" (unsanitized)
        Backend->Application: Response 200 OK with JSON: {'id': '<script>alert("XSS")</script>', 'text': '<script>alert("XSS")</script>'}
        Application->Browser: Response with HTML containing ListSelect2 widget
        Browser->Browser: User interacts with the ListSelect2 widget, triggering autocomplete
        Browser->Application: GET /test-autocomplete/?q=...
        Application->Backend: Select2ListView.get_list() returns list including "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
        Backend->Application: Response 200 OK with JSON including {'id': '<script>alert("XSS")</script>', 'text': '<script>alert("XSS")</script>'}
        Application->Browser: Response with HTML for autocomplete suggestions, including unsanitized text
        Browser->Browser: Browser renders HTML, executes injected JavaScript alert('XSS')
    ```


* **Security Test Case:**

    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Ensure the test project is set up and running.
        - Access the URL for the `select2_list` test app, for example, `/dal_single/` or `/admin/select2_list/tmodel/add/` if the widget is used in admin.
        - Identify the URL used for the `ListSelect2` widget, which is likely `/select2_list/test-autocomplete/` based on `/code/test_project/select2_list/urls.py` and `/code/test_project/select2_list/forms.py`.

    2. **Steps:**
        - Open a browser and navigate to the page containing the `ListSelect2` widget (e.g., `/dal_single/`).
        - Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12).
        - In the developer tools, go to the "Network" tab to monitor network requests.
        - In the `ListSelect2` input field, type some text to trigger the autocomplete suggestions.
        - Observe the network requests; you should see a GET request to `/select2_list/test-autocomplete/?q=...`.
        - Now, in the `ListSelect2` input field, type the following payload: `<script>alert("XSS-ListSelect2")</script>`.
        - Look for the "Create '...' " option in the dropdown list. It should display "Create '<script>alert("XSS-ListSelect2")</script>'".
        - Select this "Create" option. This will send a POST request in the background.
        - Type some other characters in the input field again to trigger the autocomplete suggestions again.
        - **Expected Outcome:** An alert box with "XSS-ListSelect2" should pop up in the browser, demonstrating successful XSS. If the alert doesn't appear immediately, inspect the HTML source of the autocomplete suggestions in the developer tools (Elements tab) to confirm that the `<script>` tag is injected into the HTML.

This test case confirms that the `create` functionality in `Select2ListView` and `Select2ProvidedValueListView` (in both `dal/autocomplete.py` and `dal_select2/views.py`) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of input validation and sanitization.
