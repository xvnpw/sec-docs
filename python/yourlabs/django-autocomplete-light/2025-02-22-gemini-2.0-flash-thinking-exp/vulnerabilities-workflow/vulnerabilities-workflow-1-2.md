- **Vulnerability Name:** Hardcoded SECRET_KEY in Settings  
  - **Description:**  
    The project’s settings file hardcodes the Django secret key (e.g.,  
    `SECRET_KEY = '58$1jvc332=lyfk_m^jl6ody$7pbk18nm95==!r$7m5!2dp%l@'`) within the source code. An attacker who obtains the source code (for example, by browsing a public repository) can extract this key and use it to:
    1. Forge session cookies and CSRF tokens.
    2. Impersonate users by creating or modifying signed data.
    3. Possibly escalate privileges by tampering with cryptographically protected values.
  - **Impact:**  
    Critical compromise of application security. With the secret key known, an attacker may hijack sessions, forge authentication tokens, and bypass security measures based on token signing.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    There is no mitigation in place—the key is stored as a literal in the settings module.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • Pull the secret key out of source code and load it from a secure environment variable or secrets manager.  
    • Enforce secret rotation and avoid committing production secrets to version control.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The source code is visible (e.g. via a public repository) or accessible through code leaks.  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    In `/code/test_project/settings/base.py`, the file plainly defines:
    ```python
    SECRET_KEY = '58$1jvc332=lyfk_m^jl6ody$7pbk18nm95==!r$7m5!2dp%l@'
    ```  
    No fallback or secure import is performed.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Access the public repository and locate the settings file (e.g. `settings/base.py`).  
    2. Extract the hardcoded secret key from the file.  
    3. Using a tool (or custom script), craft session cookies or tamper with CSRF tokens by signing them with the extracted key.  
    4. Attempt to use the forged cookies/tokens to authenticate or perform sensitive actions on the deployed application.  
    5. Verify that the attacker can bypass standard protections.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration  
  - **Description:**  
    The settings specify `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']`, which tells Django to accept requests from any host header. An attacker can exploit this by sending requests with a forged Host header to:
    1. Abuse URL generation (e.g. in password reset emails) by injecting attacker-controlled hostnames.
    2. Facilitate host header poisoning or DNS rebinding attacks.
  - **Impact:**  
    High risk of host header injection that can lead to phishing, cache poisoning, and redirect attacks—potentially tricking users or other systems into interacting with a malicious endpoint.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    No mitigation is present; the project simply allows any host.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • Restrict ALLOWED_HOSTS to a whitelist of known, legitimate domain names (e.g. `['yourdomain.com']`).  
    • Validate the Host header against an approved list before proceeding with request processing.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The deployed application is accessible over the Internet, and ALLOWED_HOSTS is not overridden by an environment–specific configuration.  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    In `/code/test_project/settings/base.py` the configuration is directly set as:
    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
    ```  
    This setting leaves the application vulnerable to any Host header manipulation.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Use a tool such as curl, Postman, or Burp Suite to send an HTTP request to the application endpoint with a custom Host header (for example, `Host: evil.com`).  
    2. Confirm that the server processes the request normally despite the non–approved header.  
    3. Create a scenario where the application generates absolute URLs (such as in email templates) and verify that the forged Host header appears.  
    4. Document that unrestricted host names allow manipulation.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential DEBUG Mode Misconfiguration in Production  
  - **Description:**  
    The DEBUG setting is derived from an environment variable with a fallback that inspects command–line arguments. In environments where the `DEBUG` environment variable is not set explicitly, the fallback logic may enable DEBUG mode (especially when commands like “runserver” or “pytest” are detected). An external attacker could force errors that trigger detailed debug pages containing sensitive stack traces, configuration data, and other internal details.  
  - **Impact:**  
    High risk of information disclosure. Verbose error output may leak sensitive details like file paths, database settings, and even parts of the source code, aiding an attacker in further exploits.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The code attempts to set DEBUG using:  
    ```python
    DEBUG = os.environ.get('DEBUG', False)
    if 'DEBUG' not in os.environ:
        for cmd in ('runserver', 'pytest', 'py.test'):
            if cmd in sys.argv[0] or len(sys.argv) > 1 and cmd in sys.argv[1]:
                DEBUG = True
                continue
    ```  
    However, this fallback can inadvertently enable DEBUG mode outside of testing.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • Remove fallback logic that enables DEBUG mode based on command–line inspection.  
    • Require an explicit setting (or a default safe value) for DEBUG in production environments.  
    • Consider adding a safeguard that prevents running with DEBUG=True in production deployments.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The production environment is deployed without an explicit `DEBUG` environment variable setting, causing the fallback to enable debug mode.  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    In `/code/test_project/settings/base.py`, the fallback logic may set DEBUG to True if environment variables are missing and certain commands are detected. This logic is risky because it does not distinguish between a development command and a production deployment.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application in an environment where the `DEBUG` variable is not defined.  
    2. Trigger an error by accessing a non–existent page or causing an exception (e.g., sending an invalid parameter).  
    3. Observe that a detailed debug page is rendered, showing the full traceback and sensitive information.  
    4. Verify that this page is accessible to unauthenticated external users.  
    5. Document the exposure of internal details.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Data Access via Unvalidated Forwarded Parameters  
  - **Description:**  
    Some autocomplete endpoints (for example, the one in the `linked_data` app) use a “forward” mechanism to filter querysets based on JSON–encoded GET parameters. In the `LinkedDataView`, the code retrieves a forwarded parameter (e.g. `"owner"`) and applies it directly to the queryset:
    ```python
    owner = self.forwarded.get('owner', None)
    if owner:
        qs = qs.filter(owner_id=owner)
    ```
    Because the value for `owner` is taken directly from the request without verification, an attacker can supply an arbitrary owner identifier—accessing data that belongs to users they should not see.
  - **Impact:**  
    High risk of unauthorized data disclosure (an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability). Attackers can manipulate forwarded parameters to retrieve data associated with other users, breaching data confidentiality and privacy.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    Some parts of the project (for instance, the `secure_data` endpoint) correctly tie data to the authenticated `request.user`, but endpoints like the one in `linked_data` (and similar patterns in `rename_forward`) lack such checks.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • Validate that any forwarded parameter (such as owner ID) matches the identity or permissions of the authenticated user.  
    • Enforce proper authentication for these endpoints and deny filtering based solely on client–provided forwarded values.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The endpoint (e.g. `/linked_data/`) is accessible without sufficient access control, and the forwarded parameters are taken directly from the client request (via JSON–encoded GET parameters).  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    In `/code/test_project/linked_data/urls.py`, the view’s `get_queryset()` method processes the forwarded “owner” parameter without verifying that it belongs to `request.user`:
    ```python
    class LinkedDataView(autocomplete.Select2QuerySetView):
        def get_queryset(self):
            qs = super(LinkedDataView, self).get_queryset()
            owner = self.forwarded.get('owner', None)
            if owner:
                qs = qs.filter(owner_id=owner)
            return qs
    ```  
    This design assumes that the forwarded data is “trusted”—which is not the case in a public instance.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. As an external attacker (or using an unauthorized account), send a GET request to the `/linked_data/` endpoint with a manipulated forwarding parameter in the query string. For example:  
       ```
       GET /linked_data/?forward={"owner": "1"}
       ```  
    2. Observe that the response includes autocomplete suggestions filtered by `owner_id = 1` regardless of the attacker’s own user ID.  
    3. Try altering the forwarded “owner” value to different numbers and verify that data belonging to other users is returned.  
    4. Document that the endpoint returns data not limited to the authenticated user, confirming an insecure data–filtering flaw.
