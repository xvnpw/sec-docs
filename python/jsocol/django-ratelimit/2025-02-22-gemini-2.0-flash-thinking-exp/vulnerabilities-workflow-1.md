## Combined Vulnerability List

### Inadequate Rate Limiting in Multi-Process Environments with LocMemCache

- **Vulnerability Name:** Inadequate Rate Limiting in Multi-Process Environments with LocMemCache
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker targets a Django application that uses `django-ratelimit` for rate limiting.
    2. The application is configured to use `django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache` as the cache backend.
    3. The Django application is deployed in a multi-process environment, such as using WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI with multiple worker processes, or ASGI servers with multiple processes.
    4. The attacker sends requests to a rate-limited endpoint.
    5. Because `LocMemCache` is not shared between processes, each process maintains its own independent rate limit counters.
    6. If the attacker's requests are distributed across multiple processes (which can happen due to load balancing or request distribution in multi-process environments), the rate limit is applied per process, not globally.
    7. As a result, the attacker can send more requests in total than the intended global rate limit by effectively resetting the rate limit counter in each process.
- **Impact:** Rate limits can be circumvented, allowing attackers to bypass intended restrictions. This can lead to abuse of application resources, such as excessive API calls, brute-force attacks, or other actions that rate limiting is meant to prevent. This undermines the security functionality of the rate limiter.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project includes a system check (`django_ratelimit.E003`) that flags `django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache` as a broken backend because it is not a shared cache.
    - This system check generates an error during Django's `check` command, warning developers about the unsuitable cache backend.
    - However, this is only a warning and does not prevent the use of `LocMemCache`. Developers can silence this check, as demonstrated in the provided `test_settings.py` file.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Prevent or strongly discourage the use of `LocMemCache` or other non-shared cache backends in production environments. This could involve:
        - Enhancing the system check to be a critical error that cannot be easily silenced, especially in production settings.
        - Adding runtime warnings or exceptions when `LocMemCache` is detected in a multi-process environment.
    - Improve documentation to clearly highlight the limitations of `LocMemCache` in multi-process environments and strongly recommend shared cache backends like Memcached or Redis for production deployments.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Django application is deployed in a multi-process environment.
    - `django-ratelimit` is configured to use `django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache`.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. `/code/django_ratelimit/checks.py`: The `check_caches` function explicitly identifies `django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache` in `KNOWN_BROKEN_CACHE_BACKENDS` with the reason `CACHE_NOT_SHARED`. This results in a `checks.Error` with `id='django_ratelimit.E003'`.
    2. `/code/test_settings.py`: The `SILENCED_SYSTEM_CHECKS = ['django_ratelimit.E003', 'django_ratelimit.W001']` setting in the test configuration silences this error, indicating awareness of the issue but no active prevention in the library itself beyond the system check.
    3. `/code/django_ratelimit/core.py`: The `is_ratelimited` and `get_usage` functions rely on Django's cache framework to store and retrieve rate limit counters. When `LocMemCache` is configured, each process operates on its own isolated in-memory cache.
    4. In multi-process environments, requests can be routed to different processes. Each process will independently manage rate limits based on its local `LocMemCache`. This process-local rate limiting fails to provide a global rate limit across the entire application instance.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Setup:
        - Deploy a Django application using `django-ratelimit`.
        - Configure `settings.py` to use `LocMemCache`:
          ```python
          RATELIMIT_USE_CACHE = 'default'
          CACHES = {
              'default': {
                  'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
                  'LOCATION': 'ratelimit-tests',
              }
          }
          ```
        - Configure a view to be rate-limited, for example:
          ```python
          from django_ratelimit.decorators import ratelimit
          from django.http import HttpResponse

          @ratelimit(key='ip', rate='2/m')
          def my_view(request):
              return HttpResponse("View Accessed")
          ```
        - Deploy the Django application with a multi-process server like Gunicorn (e.g., `gunicorn -w 2 your_project.wsgi`).
    2. Attack Simulation:
        - From an attacker's machine, use a tool like `curl` or a script to send HTTP requests to the rate-limited view.
        - Send 3 or more requests within a minute from the same IP address. Try to distribute requests in time to potentially hit different processes if possible but even rapid requests can be distributed by OS scheduler.
        - Observe the HTTP responses.
    3. Expected Result (Vulnerable Case - LocMemCache):
        - All requests (including the 3rd and subsequent requests within the minute) will likely return a successful "View Accessed" response (HTTP 200). This indicates that the rate limit of 2 requests per minute is not being enforced globally across processes and is being bypassed.
    4. Mitigation Test:
        - Modify `settings.py` to use a shared cache backend like Redis:
          ```python
          RATELIMIT_USE_CACHE = 'default'
          CACHES = {
              'default': {
                  'BACKEND': 'django_redis.cache.RedisCache',
                  'LOCATION': 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1', # Replace with your Redis connection details
                  'OPTIONS': {
                      'CLIENT_CLASS': 'django_redis.client.DefaultClient',
                  }
              }
          }
          ```
          (Ensure `django-redis` is installed and Redis server is running).
        - Redeploy the Django application.
        - Repeat step 2 (send 3 or more requests within a minute).
    5. Expected Result (Mitigated Case - Redis):
        - The first two requests will return a successful "View Accessed" response (HTTP 200).
        - The third and subsequent requests within the minute should be blocked by the rate limiter, and will likely return a `Ratelimited` exception (e.g., HTTP 403 if default exception handling is in place, or a custom response if middleware is configured). This confirms that the rate limit is now being enforced globally.

### Rate Limit Bypass via Cache Failure (Fail Open Behavior)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Rate Limit Bypass via Cache Failure (Fail Open Behavior)
- **Description:**
    1. An external attacker targets an endpoint that is protected with rate-limiting logic (e.g., a login or password-reset endpoint decorated with `@ratelimit`).
    2. The attacker induces cache backend unreachability or unresponsiveness (e.g., network issues, flooding, misconfigurations).
    3. When a request is processed, `get_usage` attempts to use the cache (via `cache.add` or `cache.incr`). Cache call fails or returns "no value".
    4. The code catches the error and, if `RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN=True`, returns `None`.
    5. `is_ratelimited` interprets `None` usage as "not ratelimited", permitting the request.
    6. The attacker sends many requests, bypassing rate limits, enabling brute-force or abuse.
- **Impact:** Bypassing rate limiting allows brute-force attacks, resource exhaustion, and abuse of protected functionality. Severe security and operational consequences in scenarios requiring strict rate limits.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - `get_usage` catches cache connection errors (e.g., `socket.gaierror`) and respects `RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN` setting.
    - "Fail open" approach prevents blocking legitimate traffic during cache issues.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No built-in "fail closed" alternative for enforcing rate limiting during cache unreachability.
    - No fallback mechanisms (local counters, alerting) for cache connectivity issues.
    - Lack of enhanced monitoring and automatic stricter rate limiting during cache failures.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Application deployed with network-reachable caching backend susceptible to disruption.
    - `RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN=True` is configured (or default "fail open" behavior).
    - Attacker can induce cache connectivity failures or influence cache behavior.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `django_ratelimit/core.py`, `get_usage` function:
      ```python
      try:
          added = cache.add(cache_key, initial_value, period + EXPIRATION_FUDGE)
      except socket.gaierror:  # for redis
          added = False
      ```
      ```python
      try:
          count = cache.incr(cache_key)
      except ValueError:
          pass
      ```
      ```python
      if count is None or count is False:
          if getattr(settings, 'RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN', False):
              return None
          return { 'count': 0, ... 'should_limit': True, ... }
      ```
    - Returning `None` from `get_usage` bypasses rate limit in `is_ratelimited`.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
       - Deploy application with `django-ratelimit`, rate-limited login view (`@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='1/m')`).
       - Configure caching backend (Redis/memcached), set `RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN=True`.
    2. **Simulate Cache Failure:**
       - Make cache backend unreachable:
         - (a) Point `RATELIMIT_USE_CACHE` to non-existent server.
         - (b) Network partition/firewall blocking cache access.
    3. **Execution:**
       - Send excessive HTTP requests from external client to protected endpoint.
    4. **Verification:**
       - Observe endpoint does not throttle requests after exceeding rate limit.
       - Confirm cache operations fail and `get_usage` returns `None`, bypassing rate limiting.
    5. **Conclusion:**
       - Attacker-induced cache failures bypass rate-limiting protections, verifying vulnerability.
