## Vulnerability List

- **No High-Rank Vulnerabilities Found**
    - **Description:** After a thorough review of the `django-ratelimit` project, considering the perspective of an external attacker targeting a publicly available instance, and applying the exclusion and inclusion criteria specified, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were identified that are inherent to the library itself and exploitable in its intended usage. Potential misconfigurations or misuse of the library in specific application contexts might lead to ineffective rate limiting, but these are not considered vulnerabilities within the scope of this analysis of the `django-ratelimit` project's code and design.
    - **Impact:** N/A (No vulnerability identified)
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** N/A
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** The project incorporates several security best practices as mitigations against potential issues:
        - CodeQL static analysis is used to proactively identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
        - A comprehensive test suite ensures the rate limiting functionality works as expected across various scenarios.
        - Configurable cache backend allows users to choose secure caching mechanisms and includes checks for known problematic backends.
        - Default use of SHA256 for cache key hashing enhances security by preventing simple key prediction.
    - **Missing Mitigations:** N/A (No vulnerability identified in the library itself. Proper configuration and usage by the integrating application are crucial for effective rate limiting.)
    - **Preconditions:** N/A
    - **Source Code Analysis:** N/A (No vulnerability identified in the library's source code that meets the criteria.)
    - **Security Test Case:** N/A (No vulnerability identified to test based on the given criteria.)
