- **Vulnerability Name:** Rate Limit Bypass via Cache Failure (Fail Open Behavior)

  - **Description:**  
    The library’s rate‐limiting logic depends on a caching backend to store and retrieve the count of requests. In the function `get_usage` (located in `django_ratelimit/core.py`), the code tries to add a new cache key or update the counter using the cache’s atomic operations. If the cache backend is unreachable or experiences connection errors (for example, when a network disruption or misconfiguration prevents proper connectivity), the code catches specific errors (e.g. a `socket.gaierror`) and—if the counter remains unavailable—returns a “no rate limit” result when the setting `RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN` is enabled.  
    **Step by step how an attacker could trigger this:**  
    1. An external attacker targets an endpoint that is protected with this rate-limiting logic (for example, a login or password-reset endpoint that is decorated with `@ratelimit`).  
    2. The attacker uses techniques (such as inducing network-level issues, flooding the cache backend, or exploiting misconfigurations) to cause the caching backend (e.g. an external memcached or Redis server) to become unreachable or unresponsive.  
    3. When a request is processed, the `get_usage` function attempts to use the cache (via `cache.add` or `cache.incr`). Because the cache call fails or returns an unexpected “no value” response, the code catches the error and, if `RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN` is set to True (which is common to avoid false positives), returns `None`.
    4. The helper function `is_ratelimited` interprets a `None` usage value as “not ratelimited” and thus permits the request to proceed.
    5. With the rate limit effectively bypassed, the attacker can send many requests in rapid succession, potentially enabling brute-force login attempts or broadly abusive behavior.

  - **Impact:**  
    Bypassing rate limiting may allow attackers to perform brute-force attacks against sensitive endpoints, overwhelm resources by sending many requests, or otherwise abuse the protected functionality. In scenarios where endpoints require strict rate limits to prevent abuse, this vulnerability could have severe security and operational consequences.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The code in `get_usage` catches certain cache connection errors (for example, `socket.gaierror`) and respects the administrator’s choice via the setting `RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN`.  
    - This “fail open” approach is intentionally provided so that in the event of cache issues, the application does not inadvertently block legitimate traffic.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - There is no built-in “fail closed” alternative that would enforce rate limiting even if the caching backend is unreachable. In critical security scenarios, this may allow an attacker to intentionally force a cache outage and bypass rate limits.  
    - The library does not include additional fallback mechanisms (such as local in‑process counters or alerting) to detect and mitigate cache connectivity issues.
    - Enhanced monitoring and automatic switching to a stricter rate limiting mode during cache failures are missing.

  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The application is deployed in an environment where the caching backend (used for rate tracking) is reachable over the network and can be disrupted by an attacker.
    - The application is configured with `RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN=True` (or the default behavior leads to “fail open”), so that when the cache fails, rate limiting is not enforced.
    - The attacker has the ability to either induce cache connectivity failures (via network attacks or by triggering misconfigurations) or otherwise influence the cache’s behavior.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `django_ratelimit/core.py`, the function `get_usage` computes a cache key using `_make_cache_key` and then tries to add or increment the counter using:
      - ```python
        try:
            added = cache.add(cache_key, initial_value, period + EXPIRATION_FUDGE)
        except socket.gaierror:  # for redis
            added = False
        ```
      - If the key already exists (or in the event of a connection failure) and the `increment` flag is set, it further attempts:
        ```python
        try:
            count = cache.incr(cache_key)
        except ValueError:
            pass
        ```
    - If these operations fail to yield a valid count (i.e. if `count` ends up as `None` or `False`), the code checks:
      ```python
      if count is None or count is False:
          if getattr(settings, 'RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN', False):
              return None
          return { 'count': 0, ... 'should_limit': True, ... }
      ```
    - Returning `None` results in the helper function `is_ratelimited` interpreting the request as not rate limited. This “fail open” behavior was intentionally provided as a fail-safe for cache failures but creates a loophole for attackers.
  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Setup:**  
       - Deploy the application using `django-ratelimit` on a publicly accessible endpoint (e.g. a login view decorated with `@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='1/m')`).
       - Configure the application with a caching backend (such as Redis or memcached) and set `RATELIMIT_FAIL_OPEN=True`.
    2. **Simulate Cache Failure:**  
       - Temporarily make the caching backend unreachable. This can be done by (a) configuring the cache settings (`RATELIMIT_USE_CACHE`) to point to a non-existent server or (b) simulating a network partition/firewall rule that blocks access to the cache.
    3. **Execution:**  
       - Send a series of HTTP requests (more than what the configured rate would normally allow) from an external client to the protected endpoint.
    4. **Verification:**  
       - Observe that even after exceeding the defined rate (e.g. more than 1 request per minute), the endpoint does not reject or throttle the requests.
       - Confirm via application logging or direct testing that the cache operations are failing and that `get_usage` is returning `None`, resulting in bypassed rate limiting.
    5. **Conclusion:**  
       - This test demonstrates that an attacker capable of inducing cache connectivity failures can effectively bypass rate-limiting protections, verifying the vulnerability.
