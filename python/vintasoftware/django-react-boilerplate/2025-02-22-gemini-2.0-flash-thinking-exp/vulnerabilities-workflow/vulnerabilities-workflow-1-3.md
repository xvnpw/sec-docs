### Vulnerability 1: Insecure default ALLOWED_HOSTS setting

- Vulnerability name: Insecure default ALLOWED_HOSTS setting
- Description: The default `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in the `render.yaml` configuration file is set to `'*'`, which signifies that the Django application will accept requests from any host. This permissive configuration bypasses Django's built-in protection against host header attacks. An attacker could exploit this by sending requests with a forged `Host` header.
- Impact: By manipulating the `Host` header, an attacker can potentially carry out various attacks, including:
    - Password reset poisoning: An attacker can initiate a password reset request and, by controlling the `Host` header, ensure the password reset link points to a malicious domain under their control.
    - Cache poisoning: If the application uses caching based on the host, an attacker can poison the cache with content from a malicious host, affecting subsequent users.
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS): In certain scenarios, if the application reflects the hostname in responses without proper sanitization, a forged `Host` header could be used to inject and execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None by default in the initial project setup. The `README.md` file contains instructions to modify the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting after the initial deployment, but the default configuration is insecure.
- Missing mitigations:
    - The default `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in `render.yaml` should be more secure. Ideally, it should be an empty list `[]` or contain a placeholder hostname like `'your-app-name.onrender.com'` to encourage users to change it.
    - The project bootstrap section in `README.md` should strongly emphasize the importance of changing the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting to the actual domain(s) of the deployed application before going to production.
    - The `render_build.sh` script could include a check to ensure that `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is not set to `'*'` and warn the user or fail the build if it is.
- Preconditions:
    - The project is deployed to Render.com using the default `render.yaml` configuration file.
    - The `ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment variable in Render.com is not manually changed from its default value of `'*'`.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/render.yaml`
    ```yaml
    envVarGroups:
      - name: python-services
        envVars:
          - key: PYTHON_VERSION
            value: 3.12.0
          - key: POETRY_VERSION
            value: 2.0.1
          - key: SECRET_KEY
            generateValue: true
          - key: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
            value: {{project_name}}.settings.production
          - key: ALLOWED_HOSTS
            value: '*'
    ```
    - The `render.yaml` file defines an environment variable group `python-services` which includes `ALLOWED_HOSTS` set to `'*'`.
    - When deploying to Render.com using this `render.yaml`, this default value is applied unless explicitly overridden.
    - Django's `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting, when set to `'*'`, disables host header validation, making the application vulnerable to host header attacks.

- Security test case:
    1. Deploy the Django application to Render.com using the provided `render.yaml` file without modifying the default `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting.
    2. Once the application is deployed and accessible via a Render.com URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`), use a tool like `curl` or a web browser's developer tools to send a request to the application with a manipulated `Host` header. For example:
        ```bash
        curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com -H "Host: malicious.example.com"
        ```
    3. Observe the application's response. If the application is vulnerable, it will respond normally to the request despite the `Host` header being set to `malicious.example.com`, a domain different from the expected Render.com domain.
    4. To further demonstrate the impact, attempt a password reset poisoning attack. Initiate a password reset request for a user on the application. Intercept the password reset email and examine the reset link. If the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` vulnerability is present, the password reset link will likely be generated using the malicious hostname from the `Host` header (i.e., `malicious.example.com`) instead of the legitimate application domain (`your-app-name.onrender.com`). This confirms that an attacker can control the hostname used in password reset emails, potentially redirecting users to a phishing site.
