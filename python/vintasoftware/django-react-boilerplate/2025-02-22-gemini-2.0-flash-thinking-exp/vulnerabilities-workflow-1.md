#### 1. Unprotected User Registration Endpoint

This vulnerability exposes an unprotected user registration endpoint, allowing unauthorized users to create accounts.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unprotected User Registration Endpoint
- **Description:**
    - The `UserViewSet` in `backend/users/views.py` is configured as a `ModelViewSet` and exposed via an API endpoint. `ModelViewSet` automatically includes a `create` action, which, if not explicitly restricted, can allow unauthenticated user registration, even when default permissions are set to `IsAuthenticated`. An external attacker can send a POST request to the `/api/users/` endpoint with user registration data. If public user registration is not intended, this endpoint allows anyone to create new user accounts without authentication.
- **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized user account creation allows malicious actors to create numerous accounts, potentially leading to resource exhaustion on the server, spam or abuse of application functionalities, and potential for further attacks using created accounts.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - Default `REST_FRAMEWORK` permissions are set to `IsAuthenticated` in `backend/project_name/settings/base.py`.
    - Django Defender is included for brute-force login protection, but it does not protect the registration endpoint.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Explicitly control permissions for the `create` action in `UserViewSet` to prevent unauthorized user registration. This can be achieved by setting permissions to explicitly deny unauthenticated access to the `create` action or by removing the `create` action if public user registration is not intended.
- **Preconditions:**
    - A publicly accessible instance of the Django React Boilerplate application is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - `backend/users/views.py`:
        ```python
        from rest_framework import viewsets
        from .models import User
        from .serializers import UserSerializer

        class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
            queryset = User.objects.all()
            serializer_class = UserSerializer
        ```
        - `UserViewSet` inherits from `ModelViewSet`, which includes default CRUD actions, including `create`.
    - `backend/users/routes.py`:
        ```python
        from .views import UserViewSet

        routes = [
            {"regex": r"users", "viewset": UserViewSet, "basename": "user"},
        ]
        ```
        - Registers `UserViewSet` to be accessible under `/api/users/` endpoint.
    - `backend/project_name/urls.py`:
        ```python
        from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
        # ...
        router = DefaultRouter()
        routes = common_routes + users_routes # users_routes includes users endpoint
        for route in routes:
            router.register(route["regex"], route["viewset"], basename=route["basename"])
        urlpatterns = [
            path("api/", include(router.urls), name="api"), # API endpoints are under /api/
            # ...
        ]
        ```
        - Registers API routes using `DefaultRouter`, making `UserViewSet` accessible via the API.
    - `backend/project_name/settings/base.py`:
        ```python
        REST_FRAMEWORK = {
            # ...
            "DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES": [
                "rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated",
            ],
            # ...
        }
        ```
        - Sets default permission `IsAuthenticated` for all REST API endpoints, but this default may not prevent unauthenticated access to the `create` action in `ModelViewSet` if not explicitly overridden.
    - **Vulnerability Flow:**
        1. An external attacker sends a POST request to `/api/users/`.
        2. Django REST Framework routes the request to `UserViewSet.create` action.
        3. The `create` action, lacking explicit permission configuration, bypasses the default `IsAuthenticated` permission and allows unauthenticated user creation.
        4. A new user is created in the database without authentication.

- **Security test case:**
    1. Deploy the Django React Boilerplate application to a publicly accessible environment.
    2. Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send a POST request to `/api/users/`.
    3. Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
    4. Include the following JSON payload in the request body:
        ```json
        {
          "email": "testuser123@example.com",
          "password": "P@$$wOrd123"
        }
        ```
    5. Send the request without any authentication credentials.
    6. Check the HTTP response status code. A `201 Created` status code indicates a successful, and thus vulnerable, user registration. A `403 Forbidden` or `401 Unauthorized` response indicates that the vulnerability is mitigated.
    7. If the response status code is `201 Created`, verify in the Django admin panel or directly in the database if a new user with the email "testuser123@example.com" has been created.
    8. Successful user creation without authentication confirms the vulnerability.

#### 2. Mass Assignment / Privilege Escalation in User API

This vulnerability allows authenticated non-admin users to escalate their privileges by modifying sensitive fields in their user profile via the User API.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Mass Assignment / Privilege Escalation in User API
- **Description:**
    - The User API, implemented using a default DRF `ModelViewSet` for users, utilizes a serializer that exposes sensitive fields such as `is_staff` and `is_superuser` without marking them as read-only. An authenticated attacker (even a normal user) can send a crafted PUT or PATCH request to the user endpoint (e.g., `/api/users/<user_id>/`) to modify these fields and escalate their privileges to administrative levels.
- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to grant themselves or other accounts administrative privileges, leading to full system compromise, including unauthorized data access, modification, and control over backend functions.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The project uses DRF’s default `IsAuthenticated` permission on all API endpoints, requiring users to be signed in to access the API. However, there are no object-level access restrictions or field-level protections applied in the User serializer to prevent mass assignment.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Mark sensitive fields (e.g., `is_staff`, `is_superuser`, `is_active`) as read-only in the `UserSerializer` or use a dedicated "update" serializer that excludes these fields.
    - Implement additional object-level permission checks in the `UserViewSet` to restrict updates to only the user's own account or require admin rights for modifications to other users' accounts.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be authenticated as a regular (non-admin) user.
    - The attacker needs to know or be able to enumerate user IDs or be able to target their own user ID.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - `backend/users/serializers.py`:
        ```python
        class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                model = User
                fields = [
                    "id",
                    "email",
                    "is_active",
                    "is_staff",
                    "is_superuser",
                    "created",
                    "modified",
                    "last_login",
                ]
        ```
        - The `UserSerializer` includes sensitive fields without explicitly marking them as read-only, allowing update operations to modify `is_staff` and `is_superuser`.
    - `backend/users/views.py`:
        ```python
        class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
            queryset = User.objects.all()
            serializer_class = UserSerializer
        ```
        - The `UserViewSet` does not override the update logic or queryset to restrict modifications to a user’s own record or implement permission checks to prevent privilege escalation.
- **Security test case:**
    1. Log in to the application with a normal (non-admin) user account and obtain a valid session or authentication token.
    2. Identify the current user's ID (or a target user's ID) using a GET request to `/api/users/`.
    3. Send a PATCH request to `/api/users/<user_id>/` with the following JSON payload:
        ```json
        {
          "is_superuser": true,
          "is_staff": true
        }
        ```
    4. Verify that the response is `200 OK`.
    5. Perform a subsequent GET request to `/api/users/<user_id>/` or attempt to access admin-only functionalities to confirm that the user’s account now has elevated privileges.
    6. If the user record is updated with admin-level privileges without proper authorization, the vulnerability is confirmed.

#### 3. Insecure ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration

This vulnerability arises from an overly permissive `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting, making the application susceptible to host header attacks.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration
- **Description:**
    - The default `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in the `render.yaml` configuration file is set to `'*'`, which signifies that the Django application will accept requests from any host. In production settings, the value for `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is sourced from an environment variable, and the default value is set to `"*"`. This permissive configuration bypasses Django's built-in protection against host header attacks. An attacker can exploit this by sending requests with a forged `Host` header to manipulate absolute URLs (e.g., in password reset links, error emails) or facilitate host header poisoning and cache poisoning attacks.
- **Impact:**
    - An insecure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` configuration can lead to various attacks:
        - **Password reset poisoning:** Attackers can initiate password reset requests and manipulate the `Host` header to ensure password reset links point to malicious domains.
        - **Cache poisoning:** If the application uses host-based caching, attackers can poison the cache with content from a malicious host.
        - **Host header injection:** Attackers may be able to inject malicious content by controlling the hostname used in the application's responses.
        - **Redirection to malicious sites:** Users can be redirected to attacker-controlled sites.
        - **Session security compromise:** Host header manipulation can sometimes interfere with session security.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - Production settings use environment variables for `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (via `config("ALLOWED_HOSTS", cast=Csv())`).
    - The `README.md` file contains instructions to modify the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting after the initial deployment, but the default configuration is insecure.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - The default `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in `render.yaml` should be changed from `'*'` to a more secure configuration, ideally an empty list `[]` or a placeholder hostname like `'your-app-name.onrender.com'` to encourage users to update it.
    - The environment configuration should restrict `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to a whitelist of known and trusted domain(s) (e.g., `["{{project_name}}-a1b2.onrender.com", "example.org"]`).
    - The project bootstrap section in `README.md` should strongly emphasize the importance of changing the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting to the actual domain(s) of the deployed application before going to production.
    - The `render_build.sh` script could include a check to ensure that `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is not set to `'*'` and warn the user or fail the build if it is.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed in a publicly accessible production environment using the default `render.yaml` configuration.
    - The environment variable for `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is not properly overridden with a secure, domain-specific list.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - `backend/project_name/settings/production.py`:
        ```python
        ALLOWED_HOSTS = config("ALLOWED_HOSTS", cast=Csv())
        ```
        - `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is configured to be read from the environment variable `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
    - `/code/render.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        envVarGroups:
          - name: python-services
            envVars:
              - key: PYTHON_VERSION
                value: 3.12.0
              - key: POETRY_VERSION
                value: 2.0.1
              - key: SECRET_KEY
                generateValue: true
              - key: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
                value: {{project_name}}.settings.production
              - key: ALLOWED_HOSTS
                value: '*'
        ```
        - The `render.yaml` file sets the default value of the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment variable to `'*'`. This default value is used when deploying to Render.com unless overridden.
    - When `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is set to `'*'`, Django disables host header validation, making the application vulnerable to host header attacks.

- **Security test case:**
    1. Deploy the Django application to Render.com using the provided `render.yaml` file without modifying the default `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting.
    2. Once deployed and accessible, use `curl` or browser developer tools to send a request to the application with a manipulated `Host` header. For example:
        ```bash
        curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com -H "Host: malicious.example.com"
        ```
    3. Observe the application's response. If vulnerable, the application will respond normally despite the `Host` header being set to `malicious.example.com`.
    4. To demonstrate password reset poisoning: Initiate a password reset request for a user. Intercept the password reset email and examine the reset link. If vulnerable, the reset link will use `malicious.example.com` instead of the legitimate application domain, confirming the attacker's ability to control hostnames in password reset emails.
