- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deserialization via PickleSerializer  
  **Description:**  
  An attacker who gains access to the Redis cache (for example by exploiting network misconfiguration or weak authentication) can inject a malicious pickle payload into the cache. When the application later reads this key using the default PickleSerializer, the untrusted data is deserialized with Python’s pickle.loads() without any integrity or type checks. Since pickle may execute arbitrary code during deserialization, this process can cause arbitrary code execution on the server.  
  **Impact:**  
  Arbitrary code execution on the host running the Django application. This can lead to a full compromise of the server, data theft, or further lateral movement within the network.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The project provides alternative serializer classes (e.g., JSONSerializer, MSGPackSerializer, YAMLSerializer) that do not allow arbitrary code execution by design.  
  - However, by default the settings rely on the PickleSerializer when no override is provided.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No built‑in safeguard is implemented around pickle deserialization to verify the integrity or authenticity of cached data.  
  - There is no strict enforcement (within the library) to prefer a safe serializer in public deployments.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The Redis instance must be accessible to external attackers (for example, because of misconfiguration or weak network access controls).  
  - The cache configuration is set to use the default PickleSerializer (or a configuration that enables it).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/redis_cache/serializers.py`, the `PickleSerializer` defines:
    - `serialize(self, value)` → uses `pickle.dumps(value, self.pickle_version)`.
    - `deserialize(self, value)` → directly calls `pickle.loads(force_bytes(value))`.  
  - In `/code/redis_cache/backends/base.py`, when a cache lookup is performed (for example, via the `get()` or `get_or_set()` methods), the retrieved raw value is processed by `get_value()`, which internally calls `self.deserialize(value)`.  
  - There is no additional validation or integrity check over the serialized data, so if an attacker injects a crafted pickle payload into Redis, it will be deserialized without any protection.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Deploy the application in a test environment using the default settings (which use PickleSerializer).  
  2. Reconfigure the Redis instance temporarily so that it is accessible on an external interface (or simulate attacker access via an open network channel) and note that its weak password is in use.  
  3. Using a Redis client (for example, via `redis-cli`), connect to the Redis server at the configured location (e.g. 127.0.0.1:6381) with the password “yadayada”.  
  4. Prepare and set a key with a malicious pickle payload. (For testing purposes, use a payload that triggers a benign action such as writing a marker file or toggling a debug flag.)  
     – For example, set the key `malicious_key` to a pickle‑serialized payload that, when deserialized, executes a controlled script.  
  5. In the application, trigger code that issues a cache lookup on the key (e.g. via a view that calls `cache.get('malicious_key')`).  
  6. Observe that the malicious payload is executed (for instance, the marker file is created), confirming arbitrary code execution via deserialization.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Weak Default Redis Authentication  
  **Description:**  
  The project’s configuration (especially in test settings such as in `/code/tests/settings.py`) hardcodes a weak Redis password (“yadayada”). If the same configuration is deployed (or if production settings are mis‐configured using these defaults) and the Redis instance is exposed to external networks, an attacker can connect to Redis using this password. Once connected, the attacker may read or write data to the cache, alter cached application data, or inject malicious payloads (which, when combined with the insecure deserialization issue, can lead to further compromise).  
  **Impact:**  
  Unauthorized access to the caching backend can result in cache poisoning, leakage of sensitive application data, and may even pave the way toward arbitrary code execution.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - A password is specified in the cache configuration; however, the chosen password (“yadayada”) is weak and predictable.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no mechanism enforcing the use of strong, randomly generated passwords.  
  - No network-level access controls (such as firewall restrictions) are integrated into the project’s configuration to protect the Redis instance from exposure to untrusted networks.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The Redis instance is deployed using the provided configuration with the weak password.  
  - The Redis server is accessible from external networks (e.g. due to misconfiguration or overly permissive firewall settings).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/tests/settings.py` (as well as in other test case configuration files), the cache configuration under `OPTIONS` includes:
    - `"PASSWORD": "yadayada"`.  
  - In `/code/redis_cache/connection.py`, when establishing connections to Redis, this password is passed directly (via the keyword arguments to the connection pool) without any additional strengthening or verification.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Deploy the application (or a test instance of the application) using the provided configuration.  
  2. From an external network (or simulate external access), use a Redis client tool (for instance, `redis-cli`) to connect to the Redis instance at the configured address (e.g. 127.0.0.1:6381).  
  3. Authenticate using the password “yadayada” and verify that the authentication succeeds.  
  4. Issue basic Redis commands (such as GET, SET, and KEYS) to demonstrate that the attacker can view and modify cache data.  
  5. Document the successful unauthorized access as confirmation of the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Hardcoded Weak Django SECRET_KEY  
  **Description:**  
  In `/code/tests/settings.py` the Django setting `SECRET_KEY` is hardcoded as “shh...it's a seakret”. If this test configuration (or a similarly weak key) is inadvertently deployed in production, the predictable and publicly known secret key will compromise Django’s cryptographic signing. An attacker can use the known secret to forge session cookies, CSRF tokens, or other signed data, which may lead to session hijacking or other types of attacks against the web application.  
  **Impact:**  
  The compromise of the Django secret key can result in session hijacking, authentication bypass, and CSRF attacks—all of which can lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation in the application.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The hardcoded key appears only in the test settings. It is assumed that production deployments will override this value.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no built‑in measure to enforce the use of a strong, unpredictable secret key.  
  - No warning or check exists within the library code to prevent accidental deployment of a weak key.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The application uses the test configuration (or any configuration with a similarly weak, hardcoded key) in production.  
  - An attacker is able to craft or modify signed cookies or tokens using the known secret key.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/tests/settings.py`, the setting:
    - `SECRET_KEY = "shh...it's a seakret"`
    is defined without any randomness or obfuscation.  
  - As Django relies on this key for signing session cookies, CSRF tokens, and other security‑critical data, any disclosure or use of this key in production inherently undermines the application’s security.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Deploy the Django application using the test settings containing the hardcoded secret key.  
  2. Using the known secret, an attacker can forge a session cookie (or CSRF token) that appears valid to the application.  
  3. Submit requests with the forged cookie to access authenticated endpoints or perform state‑changing operations.  
  4. Verify that the application accepts the forged tokens and grants access or performs unintended actions, confirming that the hardcoded key leads to exploitable weakness.
