# Attack Surface Analysis for davidsandberg/facenet

## Attack Surface: [Adversarial Example Attacks (Evasion)](./attack_surfaces/adversarial_example_attacks__evasion_.md)

*Description:* Crafted input images designed to fool the `facenet` model into misclassifying or misidentifying a face, even if the changes are imperceptible to humans.
*How Facenet Contributes:* `facenet`'s core functionality is a deep learning model, which is inherently vulnerable to adversarial examples. The library provides the model and embedding generation, making this attack directly targetable.
*Example:* An attacker slightly modifies a photo of their face, causing `facenet` to identify them as a specific authorized user, granting them access to a restricted system.
*Impact:*
    *   Unauthorized access (false acceptance).
    *   Denial of service (false rejection).
    *   Impersonation of specific individuals.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (if used for authentication/authorization) or **High** (if used for other purposes like identification).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Adversarial Training:** Train the `facenet` model (or a fine-tuned version) with adversarial examples to increase its robustness. This is the most effective, but computationally expensive, approach.  Developers should prioritize this.
    *   **Ensemble Methods:** Use multiple face recognition models (potentially including non-`facenet` models) and compare their outputs.  If the models disagree, it could indicate an adversarial attack. Developers should consider this if high security is required.
    *   **Gradient Masking/Obfuscation:** Techniques to make it harder for attackers to calculate the gradients needed to craft adversarial examples.  This is often a temporary measure.

## Attack Surface: [Model Inversion Attacks](./attack_surfaces/model_inversion_attacks.md)

*Description:*  Attempts to reconstruct the original training images (faces) from the `facenet` model itself or its generated embeddings.
*How Facenet Contributes:* `facenet` provides the model and the embedding generation process. The model's weights and the embeddings contain information about the training data.
*Example:* An attacker gains access to the `facenet` model file and uses model inversion techniques to partially reconstruct faces from the original training dataset, revealing sensitive personal information.
*Impact:*
    *   Leakage of sensitive facial data used to train the model (privacy violation).
    *   Potential for re-identification of individuals if the training data is not anonymized.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (especially if the training data contains PII or is not publicly available).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Differential Privacy:** Train the `facenet` model with differential privacy techniques. This adds noise during training to make it significantly harder to reconstruct individual data points. Developers should strongly consider this if using private training data.
    *   **Limit Model Access:** Treat the `facenet` model file (e.g., `.pb` file) as a highly sensitive asset.  Restrict access to it using file system permissions, encryption, and secure storage.  Developers and system administrators must enforce this.
    *   **Minimize Embedding Size:** Use the smallest embedding size that still provides acceptable accuracy for the application. Smaller embeddings leak less information. Developers should carefully evaluate the trade-off.
    * **Federated Learning:** If possible, use federated learning to train model without sharing training data.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the libraries that `facenet` depends on (TensorFlow, NumPy, SciPy, etc.).
*How Facenet Contributes:* `facenet` *directly* relies on these external libraries. A vulnerability in a dependency becomes a vulnerability in the `facenet` deployment.
*Example:* A known vulnerability in an older version of TensorFlow allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running `facenet`.
*Impact:*
    *   Remote code execution.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Data exfiltration (including facial data and embeddings).
    *   System compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (potential for complete system takeover).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Use a package manager (like `pip`) to keep all dependencies up-to-date. Regularly check for and apply security updates. Developers are responsible for this.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Employ SCA tools to automatically identify and track dependencies and their associated vulnerabilities.
    *   **Pin Dependency Versions (with Caution):** Specify exact versions or secure version ranges. Balance this with the need to apply security patches.
    *   **Virtual Environments:** Use Python virtual environments to isolate dependencies.
