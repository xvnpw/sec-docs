# Threat Model Analysis for davidsandberg/facenet

## Threat: [Presentation Attack (Photo/Video)](./threats/presentation_attack__photovideo_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker presents a photograph, video recording, or replay attack (using a screen displaying a video) of a legitimate user's face to the camera. The attacker aims to impersonate the legitimate user.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application and its resources, impersonation of the legitimate user, potential data breach or manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire facenet pipeline is affected, as it processes the input image and generates embeddings. Specifically, the lack of liveness detection in the core `facenet` library is the primary vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Liveness Detection:** Integrate a separate, robust liveness detection library or service. This is the *most crucial* mitigation. Examples include:
            *   **Challenge-Response:** Require the user to perform a specific action (blink, smile, turn head).
            *   **Depth Analysis:** Use a depth-sensing camera (e.g., structured light, time-of-flight) to distinguish between a 2D image and a 3D face.
            *   **Texture Analysis:** Analyze the texture of the skin to detect subtle differences between real skin and a mask or photograph.
            *   **Micro-Movement Analysis:** Detect subtle, involuntary movements of the face.

## Threat: [Presentation Attack (3D Mask)](./threats/presentation_attack__3d_mask_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses a realistic 3D mask of a legitimate user's face to bypass the facial recognition system. This is a more sophisticated presentation attack than a simple photo.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to photo/video presentation attacks: unauthorized access, impersonation, data breach/manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Same as photo/video attacks: the entire facenet pipeline, particularly its lack of inherent liveness detection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Advanced Liveness Detection:** Use liveness detection techniques specifically designed to detect 3D masks. This often involves depth analysis and texture analysis, potentially combined with other methods.

## Threat: [Adversarial Perturbation (Targeted Misclassification)](./threats/adversarial_perturbation__targeted_misclassification_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a slightly modified image of their own face.  The modifications are imperceptible to humans but cause `facenet` to misclassify the attacker's face as that of a specific target user. This leverages vulnerabilities in the underlying machine learning model.
    *   **Impact:** Targeted impersonation of a specific user, bypassing authentication and gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `facenet` model itself (the pre-trained or fine-tuned neural network) is the primary target. The embedding generation process (`facenet.prewhiten`, `facenet.load_model`, and the inference process) is exploited.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Adversarial Training:** Train the facenet model (or a downstream classifier) with adversarial examples to make it more robust to these perturbations. This is a complex but effective mitigation.
        *   **Ensemble Methods:** Use multiple models (potentially with different architectures or training data) and combine their predictions.

## Threat: [Model Poisoning (Backdoor)](./threats/model_poisoning__backdoor_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the training data used to train or fine-tune the `facenet` model. They introduce "poisoned" samples (images with subtle modifications or mislabeled data) that create a backdoor. This backdoor allows the attacker to be recognized as a specific user, or to cause misclassifications under specific conditions.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the facial recognition system. The attacker can reliably bypass authentication or cause targeted misclassifications.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `facenet` model itself (the trained neural network) is compromised. The training process and data are the attack vectors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Training Data Control:** Implement rigorous access control and auditing for the training data.
        *   **Data Provenance:** Track the origin and integrity of all training data.
        *   **Data Sanitization and Validation:** Carefully inspect and validate all training data for anomalies or malicious modifications.
        *   **Anomaly Detection During Training:** Monitor the training process for unusual behavior that might indicate poisoning.
        *   **Use Pre-trained Models from Trusted Sources:** If possible, use pre-trained models from reputable sources and avoid retraining unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        * **Differential Privacy during training:** Use differential privacy techniques to limit the influence of single training sample.

## Threat: [Model Inversion Attack](./threats/model_inversion_attack.md)

*   **Description:** Given access to the embeddings generated by facenet, an attacker attempts to reconstruct a recognizable image of the original face.
    *   **Impact:** Privacy violation; the attacker can potentially obtain images of enrolled users, which could then be used for presentation attacks or other malicious purposes.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `facenet` model and the embedding generation process. The attacker exploits the information contained within the embeddings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Treat Embeddings as Highly Sensitive Data:** Implement strict access control, encryption at rest and in transit, and auditing.
        *   **Differential Privacy:** Add noise to the embeddings during generation to make reconstruction more difficult. This trades off some accuracy for increased privacy.
        *   **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) or Homomorphic Encryption:** If embeddings need to be shared or processed by multiple parties, consider using SMPC or homomorphic encryption to protect them.
