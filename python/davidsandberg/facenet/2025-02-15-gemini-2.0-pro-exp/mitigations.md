## Mitigation Strategy: [Adversarial Training](./mitigation_strategies/adversarial_training.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Adversarial Training

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Adversarial Examples:** Use libraries like Foolbox, CleverHans, or ART (Adversarial Robustness Toolbox) to generate adversarial examples *specifically targeting the facenet model*.  Experiment with different attack methods (FGSM, PGD, C&W, etc.) and perturbation levels.
    2.  **Create Augmented Dataset:** Combine the original training dataset used for facenet (or your fine-tuning dataset) with the generated adversarial examples. Maintain a reasonable balance (e.g., 1:1 or 1:2 ratio of original to adversarial).  Ensure the adversarial examples are labeled with the *correct* ground truth labels.
    3.  **Retrain/Fine-tune Facenet:** Retrain the entire facenet model, or fine-tune a pre-trained facenet model, using this augmented dataset.  Adjust training parameters (learning rate, epochs, etc.) as needed.  This is a direct modification of the facenet model.
    4.  **Iterative Process:**  After retraining, generate *new* adversarial examples against the *newly retrained* facenet model.  Repeat the training process. This iterative approach builds robustness against increasingly sophisticated attacks.
    5.  **Performance Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor the facenet model's performance on *both* clean and adversarial examples during training and validation.  Ensure that accuracy on clean images doesn't degrade unacceptably.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Adversarial Examples (High Severity):** Directly reduces the facenet model's vulnerability to crafted input perturbations.
    *   **Data Poisoning (Medium Severity):** Offers some limited, indirect protection against subtle data poisoning by increasing the model's overall robustness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Adversarial Examples:** Significantly reduces the success rate of adversarial attacks against the facenet model. The degree of reduction depends on the attack strength and training thoroughness.
    *   **Data Poisoning:** Provides a moderate reduction in the impact of subtle data poisoning. It's a secondary defense.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical - Needs to be filled in based on the actual project)
    *   Example: "Partially implemented. Adversarial training with FGSM is used during fine-tuning in `training/facenet_finetune.py`."

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical - Needs to be filled in based on the actual project)
    *   Example: "Missing iterative adversarial training and support for stronger attacks (PGD, C&W).  Needs expansion in `training/facenet_finetune.py` and a new script `training/generate_facenet_adversarial.py`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Preprocessing (Facenet-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/input_preprocessing__facenet-specific_aspects_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Input Preprocessing (Facenet-Specific)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Normalization:** Ensure the input image pixel values are normalized *exactly* as expected by the specific facenet model being used. Different pre-trained models may have different normalization requirements (e.g., 0-1, -1 to 1, or specific mean/std subtraction). This is *critical* for correct facenet operation.
    2.  **Resizing:** Resize the input image to the precise dimensions expected by the facenet model.  This is usually a fixed size (e.g., 160x160 pixels).  Use a high-quality resizing algorithm (e.g., Lanczos resampling) to minimize artifacts.
    3.  **Noise Reduction (Carefully Tuned):** *If* applying noise reduction (e.g., Gaussian blur, median filtering), do so *before* the facenet embedding calculation.  The parameters (e.g., kernel size) must be *carefully tuned* to avoid degrading the facenet model's accuracy on clean images.  Extensive testing is required.
    4.  **Random Transformations (Carefully Tuned):** *If* applying random transformations (rotations, scaling, cropping), do so *before* the facenet embedding calculation.  The transformations must be *subtle* and *carefully tuned* to avoid significantly altering the facial features and degrading facenet's performance. Extensive testing is required.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Adversarial Examples (Medium Severity):** Can mitigate some simple adversarial attacks that rely on small, high-frequency perturbations. The effectiveness is highly dependent on the tuning.
    *   **Invalid Input (Low Severity):** Ensures the input conforms to the facenet model's expected format.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Adversarial Examples:** Provides a moderate reduction in the success rate of *basic* adversarial attacks, *if* noise reduction or random transformations are carefully implemented and tuned.
    *   **Invalid Input:** Ensures correct input format for the facenet model.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Example: "Normalization and resizing are handled by the `facenet` library's built-in preprocessing functions, called in `preprocessing/facenet_input.py`."

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Example: "Noise reduction and random transformations are not currently implemented.  If added, they need to be placed in `preprocessing/facenet_input.py` and *extensively tested* for their impact on facenet's accuracy."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Feature Squeezing (Post-Facenet Embedding)](./mitigation_strategies/feature_squeezing__post-facenet_embedding_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Feature Squeezing (Post-Facenet)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain Facenet Embedding:**  First, obtain the embedding vector from the facenet model as usual.
    2.  **Apply Squeezing:**  Apply a feature squeezing technique to the embedding vector *after* it's been generated by facenet.  This could involve:
        *   **Bit Depth Reduction:** Reduce the precision of the embedding vector's elements (e.g., from float32 to float16).
        *   **Spatial Smoothing:** Apply a smoothing filter to the embedding vector (though this is less common for embeddings than for images).
    3. **Use Modified Embedding:** Use this modified, "squeezed" embedding vector for subsequent tasks (e.g., similarity comparisons, classification).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Adversarial Examples (Medium Severity):** Can reduce the sensitivity of the system to small perturbations in the embedding space, making some adversarial attacks less effective.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Adversarial Examples:** Offers a moderate reduction in the effectiveness of some adversarial attacks, particularly those that result in small changes to the embedding.  The impact depends on the squeezing method and its parameters.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Example: "Not implemented."

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Example: "Feature squeezing is not implemented.  If added, it would need to be implemented in a new module, `postprocessing/facenet_embedding_squeeze.py`, and its impact on accuracy thoroughly evaluated."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ensemble Methods (Multiple Facenet Models)](./mitigation_strategies/ensemble_methods__multiple_facenet_models_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Ensemble Methods (Multiple Facenet Models)

* **Description:**
    1. **Train Multiple Models:** Train or fine-tune *multiple* independent facenet models. These models could:
        *   Use different pre-trained weights.
        *   Be trained on slightly different subsets of the data.
        *   Have slightly different architectures (if you're modifying the facenet architecture).
        *   Be trained with different hyperparameters.
    2. **Obtain Embeddings:** For a given input image, obtain embeddings from *each* of the trained facenet models.
    3. **Combine Predictions:** Combine the predictions (e.g., similarity scores or classification results) from the multiple models. Common combination methods include:
        *   **Averaging:** Average the embedding vectors or similarity scores.
        *   **Voting:** If using facenet for classification, use a majority vote among the models.
        *   **Stacking:** Train a separate "meta-learner" model to combine the outputs of the individual facenet models.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Adversarial Examples (Medium to High Severity):** An adversarial example crafted for one model is less likely to be effective against all models in the ensemble.
    * **Model-Specific Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Reduces reliance on any single model's specific weaknesses.

* **Impact:**
    * **Adversarial Examples:** Significantly increases robustness against adversarial attacks. The degree of improvement depends on the diversity of the models in the ensemble.
    * **Model-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Reduces the impact of any single model's vulnerabilities.

* **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    * Example: "Not implemented."

* **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    * Example: "Ensemble methods are not implemented. This would require significant changes to the training and inference pipelines. New scripts for training multiple models (`training/facenet_ensemble_train.py`) and combining their predictions (`inference/facenet_ensemble_predict.py`) would be needed."
