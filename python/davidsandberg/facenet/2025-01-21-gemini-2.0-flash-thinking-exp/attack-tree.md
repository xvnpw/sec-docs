## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Resource Consumption](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_resource_consumption.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Cause a denial of service by exhausting the application's resources through Facenet.
*   Critical Node: Flood Facenet with Complex or Numerous Images
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Medium (Service disruption)
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Attack Description: An attacker sends a large number of image processing requests to the application, or sends requests containing very large or complex images. This overwhelms the server's CPU, memory, or other resources used by Facenet, making the application unresponsive to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Vulnerabilities in TensorFlow (or other dependencies)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_tensorflow__or_other_dependencies_.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access or control by exploiting vulnerabilities in Facenet's dependencies.
*   Critical Node: Trigger Vulnerability through Facenet's Usage
    *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
    *   Impact: High (RCE potential, system compromise)
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to High
    *   Attack Description: An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in a dependency like TensorFlow. They then craft specific input or trigger a sequence of actions within the application's use of Facenet that causes the vulnerable code in the dependency to be executed, potentially leading to remote code execution or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Bypass Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_bypass_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access to the application by circumventing the facial recognition authentication.
*   Critical Node: Exploit Loose Thresholds in Embedding Comparison
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High
    *   Impact: High (Unauthorized access)
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
    *   Attack Description: The application uses a facial recognition system where the threshold for determining if two facial embeddings match is set too low. An attacker can exploit this by presenting an image of themselves or another unauthorized person, and the system incorrectly identifies them as an authorized user due to the overly permissive threshold.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Denial of Service via Facenet Integration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_denial_of_service_via_facenet_integration.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Cause a denial of service by overwhelming the application with requests that utilize Facenet.
*   Critical Node: Send Large Number of Requests Utilizing Facenet
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High
    *   Impact: Medium (Service disruption)
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Attack Description: An attacker sends a large volume of legitimate-looking requests to the application that trigger Facenet processing. Even if the individual requests are not malicious, the sheer number of requests overwhelms the application's resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This differs from the resource consumption attack within Facenet itself, as this focuses on overloading the application's integration points with Facenet.
