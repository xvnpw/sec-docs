# Threat Model Analysis for davidsandberg/facenet

## Threat: [Adversarial Attack on Face Recognition](./threats/adversarial_attack_on_face_recognition.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts subtle, often imperceptible, modifications to a facial image. The goal is to create an image that is visually similar to a legitimate user but causes Facenet to generate an embedding that matches a different identity or fails to match the correct identity.
    *   **How:** The attacker might directly manipulate an image file before it's processed by Facenet.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Bypassing Authentication:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access by presenting an adversarial image that is incorrectly recognized as a legitimate user by Facenet.
    *   **Impersonation:** The system might incorrectly identify one individual as another based on Facenet's output, leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Flooding the system with adversarial examples could degrade the performance of Facenet's face recognition process or lead to incorrect classifications, disrupting the application's functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Adversarial Training:** Retrain the specific Facenet model being used with adversarial examples to make it more robust against such attacks.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** While challenging for image data, implement checks for unusual pixel patterns or statistical anomalies in the input images before feeding them to Facenet.
    *   **Ensemble Methods:** Use multiple face recognition models or algorithms in conjunction with Facenet, as adversarial examples crafted for Facenet might not fool other models.

## Threat: [Extraction of Face Embeddings](./threats/extraction_of_face_embeddings.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains access to the face embeddings generated by Facenet.
    *   **How:** This could occur by intercepting the embeddings as they are generated by Facenet or accessed from memory after generation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Stolen embeddings generated by Facenet could be used to bypass authentication systems that rely solely on comparing these stored embeddings with newly generated ones.
    *   **Privacy Violation:** Embeddings generated by Facenet represent facial features and can potentially be used to identify individuals if linked to other identifying information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Memory Handling:** Ensure that the memory where Facenet stores and processes embeddings is protected from unauthorized access.
    *   **Secure Transmission:** If embeddings generated by Facenet are transmitted, encrypt them in transit using HTTPS or other secure protocols.
    *   **One-way Hashing (with caution):** Consider using one-way hashing or other irreversible transformations on embeddings generated by Facenet before storage, if the application's use case allows for it (note: this might impact the ability to compare embeddings directly).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Facenet Library or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_facenet_library_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in the Facenet library itself or its underlying dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow).
    *   **How:** This could involve sending specially crafted input that is processed by Facenet or its dependencies, triggering a vulnerability, leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers could gain complete control over the server running the application by exploiting a vulnerability within Facenet or its dependencies.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The application could crash or become unavailable due to a vulnerability in Facenet or its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Facenet library and all its dependencies (especially TensorFlow) updated to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in the specific versions of Facenet and its dependencies being used.
    *   **Virtual Environments:** Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies and prevent conflicts, making it easier to manage and update specific library versions.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Facenet Library](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_facenet_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises the Facenet library or its dependencies at the source (e.g., through a compromised repository), injecting malicious code that will be executed when the library is used.
    *   **How:** Developers unknowingly download and use the compromised Facenet library in their application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   This could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or other security compromises, as the malicious code within the Facenet library would have the same privileges as the application using it.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Trusted Sources:** Download the Facenet library and its dependencies from official and trusted sources (e.g., the official GitHub repository, PyPI).
    *   **Verify Checksums/Signatures:** Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or digital signatures provided by the Facenet developers.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin specific versions of Facenet and its dependencies in your project's requirements file to ensure consistent builds and reduce the risk of automatically pulling in compromised versions.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to analyze your project's dependencies, including Facenet, and identify potential security risks or known malicious components.
