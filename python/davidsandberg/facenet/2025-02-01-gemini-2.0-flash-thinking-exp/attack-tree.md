## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Facenet Library Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_facenet_library_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Known Facenet Code Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs, security advisories) in the `davidsandberg/facenet` codebase itself. This is less likely as the project is not actively maintained with security patches, but vulnerabilities could still exist or be discovered.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the libraries that Facenet depends on, primarily TensorFlow, but also NumPy, SciPy, and others. These dependencies are complex and frequently targeted, making this a significant risk.

**Potential Impact:**
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server running the application.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or exhausting resources.
*   Data breaches by gaining unauthorized access to application data or the underlying system.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan Facenet and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools (Software Composition Analysis - SCA).
*   **Patching and Updates:**  Keep Facenet dependencies (especially TensorFlow) updated to the latest patched versions.  While `davidsandberg/facenet` itself might not receive patches, updating dependencies is crucial.
*   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor security feeds and advisories related to TensorFlow and other dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE - within Library Vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path__critical_node_-_within_library_vulnerabilities_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   This is a sub-category of "Exploit Facenet Library Vulnerabilities" but is highlighted due to the high prevalence of dependency vulnerabilities in modern software. Attackers often target known vulnerabilities in popular libraries like TensorFlow.

**Potential Impact:** (Same as "Exploit Facenet Library Vulnerabilities")
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
*   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   Data breaches

**Mitigation:** (Same as "Exploit Facenet Library Vulnerabilities")
*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
*   Dependency Updates
*   Security Monitoring

## Attack Tree Path: [Face Spoofing Attacks (Presentation Attacks) (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/face_spoofing_attacks__presentation_attacks___high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Printed Photos or Videos:** Using a printed photograph or a video recording of an authorized person's face to bypass face recognition authentication.
*   **Masks or Realistic Face Replicas:** Employing sophisticated masks or 3D-printed face replicas to impersonate authorized individuals.
*   **Replay Attacks using Recorded Video Feeds:** Capturing and replaying live video feeds of authorized users to gain unauthorized access.

**Potential Impact:**
*   Bypassing authentication mechanisms that rely solely on Facenet.
*   Unauthorized access to application features and data intended for authorized users.
*   Account takeover and impersonation.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Liveness Detection:** Implement liveness detection techniques (e.g., blink detection, motion analysis, depth sensing) to distinguish between live faces and spoofs. Note that Facenet itself does not provide liveness detection, requiring integration of additional libraries or hardware.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Combine face recognition with other authentication factors (e.g., passwords, OTP, security keys) to reduce reliance on face recognition alone and increase security.
*   **Challenge-Response Mechanisms:** Implement challenge-response protocols during authentication to ensure liveness and prevent replay attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Storage or Handling of Face Embeddings (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_storage_or_handling_of_face_embeddings__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Access and Steal Stored Face Embeddings:** Gaining unauthorized access to the database or storage system where face embeddings are stored and exfiltrating these embeddings. This could be through SQL injection, file system vulnerabilities, or compromised credentials.
*   **Manipulate Stored Embeddings:**  Modifying or replacing stored face embeddings in the database to grant unauthorized access to attacker-controlled faces or deny access to legitimate users.
*   **Use Stolen Embeddings for Impersonation:** If face embeddings are reusable across different systems or applications, attackers could use stolen embeddings to impersonate users in other contexts.

**Potential Impact:**
*   Privacy breach and exposure of sensitive biometric data (face embeddings).
*   Unauthorized access to the application by using stolen or manipulated embeddings.
*   Potential impersonation of users in other systems if embeddings are reused.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Encrypt face embeddings when stored in the database and during transmission.
*   **Strong Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls to the database or storage system containing embeddings, limiting access to only authorized application components.
*   **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic signatures) to detect tampering with stored embeddings.
*   **Scoped Embedding Usage:**  Avoid reusing face embeddings across different applications or systems without careful security considerations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Attacks Targeting Facenet Usage (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_attacks_targeting_facenet_usage__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Phishing:** Deceiving users into providing their images or videos through fake websites, emails, or messages that mimic legitimate application interfaces.
*   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating users into willingly providing their images or videos under false pretenses, often by impersonating support staff or authority figures.

**Potential Impact:**
*   Obtaining images or videos of authorized users that can be used for face spoofing attacks.
*   Compromising user accounts and gaining unauthorized access.

**Mitigation:**
*   **User Education and Awareness Training:** Educate users about phishing and social engineering tactics, emphasizing the importance of protecting their images and videos.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA to reduce reliance on single-factor face recognition and mitigate the impact of compromised images/videos.
*   **Secure Communication Channels:** Use secure and verified communication channels for user interactions and avoid requesting sensitive information through unverified channels.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Images into Training Data (HIGH RISK PATH - if application allows retraining/fine-tuning)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_images_into_training_data__high_risk_path_-_if_application_allows_retrainingfine-tu_26c495e1.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Compromise Data Sources:** Gaining unauthorized access to the data sources used for training the Facenet model and injecting malicious images into these sources.
*   **Directly Inject Malicious Images:** If the application has a training pipeline, directly injecting malicious images into this pipeline, bypassing input validation or access controls.
*   **Manipulate Training Data Labels:** Altering the labels associated with training images to cause the model to learn incorrect associations, leading to model poisoning.

**Potential Impact:**
*   **Model Poisoning:** Corrupting the trained Facenet model, causing it to misclassify faces, become biased, or even be backdoored to recognize specific attacker faces.
*   Long-term degradation of face recognition accuracy and reliability.
*   Potential security breaches if the poisoned model is used for authentication or access control.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Secure Training Data Sources:** Implement strong access controls and security measures to protect training data sources from unauthorized access and modification.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization for Training Data:**  Apply strict input validation and sanitization to all training data to prevent injection of malicious images or data.
*   **Data Integrity Checks:** Implement data integrity checks and validation for training data and labels to detect tampering or corruption.
*   **Model Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of the Facenet model after retraining for anomalies or unexpected behavior that could indicate model poisoning.
*   **Training Data Auditing:** Regularly audit training data sources and pipelines to identify and remove any potentially malicious or corrupted data.
