# Attack Surface Analysis for davidsandberg/facenet

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Images](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_images.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in image processing libraries when handling specially crafted image files processed by Facenet.
    *   **How Facenet Contributes:** `facenet` utilizes image processing libraries (like Pillow or OpenCV) to load and preprocess images before feeding them into its model. These libraries' vulnerabilities can be triggered by malformed images processed by Facenet.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PNG image with a crafted header that exploits a buffer overflow in Pillow, leading to remote code execution when Facenet attempts to process the image.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep image processing libraries updated.
        *   Implement robust image validation and sanitization before processing with `facenet`.
        *   Run image processing and `facenet` in isolated environments.

## Attack Surface: [Model File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/model_file_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Compromising the integrity of the trained `facenet` model files.
    *   **How Facenet Contributes:** `facenet` loads pre-trained model files to perform facial recognition. If these files are modified, the model's behavior is directly affected.
    *   **Example:** An attacker replaces the legitimate `facenet` model with a malicious one trained to always recognize the attacker's face, bypassing authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Manipulation, Backdoor Insertion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store model files with restricted access.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums) for model files.
        *   Fetch model files from trusted sources over secure channels.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (TensorFlow/Keras)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries__tensorflowkeras_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the TensorFlow or Keras libraries that `facenet` depends on.
    *   **How Facenet Contributes:** `facenet` is built upon TensorFlow and Keras. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be indirectly exploited when `facenet` uses their functionalities.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in TensorFlow allows crafted inputs to cause arbitrary code execution during model inference performed by `facenet`.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update TensorFlow and Keras to the latest stable versions.
        *   Monitor security advisories for TensorFlow and Keras.
        *   Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.
