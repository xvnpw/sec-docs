# Threat Model Analysis for davidsandberg/facenet

## Threat: [Adversarial Attack on Face Embedding Generation](./threats/adversarial_attack_on_face_embedding_generation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft subtly modified input images (adversarial examples) that are visually almost identical to legitimate images but cause `facenet` to generate incorrect or manipulated face embeddings. This could allow an attacker to impersonate another user or evade detection.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, identity theft, system compromise.

**Affected Component:** `facenet`'s face embedding generation module.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement input sanitization and validation to detect and reject potentially adversarial images.
*   Explore techniques for adversarial defense, such as adversarial training or input transformation.
*   Monitor the distribution of generated embeddings for anomalies that might indicate an attack.
*   Consider using ensemble methods with multiple face recognition models to increase robustness.

## Threat: [Data Poisoning during Fine-tuning (if applicable)](./threats/data_poisoning_during_fine-tuning__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows for fine-tuning the `facenet` model with new data, an attacker could inject malicious or manipulated data into the training set. This could cause the model to learn incorrect associations, recognize specific attackers, or fail to recognize legitimate users.

**Impact:** Backdoors in the face recognition system, reduced accuracy, potential for targeted attacks.

**Affected Component:** The model fine-tuning process and the data used for fine-tuning (directly impacting `facenet`'s learned parameters).

**Risk Severity:** High (if fine-tuning is allowed with untrusted data).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet and sanitize all data used for fine-tuning.
*   Implement robust access controls to restrict who can contribute to the training dataset.
*   Monitor the model's performance after fine-tuning for any unexpected changes or degradation.
*   Use techniques like anomaly detection to identify potentially poisoned data points.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries.md)

**Description:** `facenet` relies on libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries used by `facenet`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the severity of the underlying vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep TensorFlow and PyTorch (and all other dependencies) updated to the latest stable versions with security patches.
*   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security auditing tools.
*   Isolate the environment where `facenet` is running to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Threat: [Replay Attacks using Stored Embeddings](./threats/replay_attacks_using_stored_embeddings.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to stored face embeddings could attempt to use these embeddings to authenticate as the legitimate user, bypassing the need for a live face scan.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, identity theft.

**Affected Component:** The authentication mechanism that relies on comparing stored embeddings generated by `facenet`.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement liveness detection mechanisms to ensure the face being presented is from a live person.
*   Use time-based one-time codes or other multi-factor authentication methods in conjunction with face recognition.
*   Regularly re-enroll users' facial data to mitigate the risk of stolen embeddings being valid for extended periods.
