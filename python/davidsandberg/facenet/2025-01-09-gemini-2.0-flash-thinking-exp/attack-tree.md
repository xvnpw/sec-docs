## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Facenet Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_facenet_application.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete breach of the application's security. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective, potentially gaining unauthorized access, manipulating data, or disrupting services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node represents weaknesses in how the application handles input data, specifically image data for Facenet. Successfully exploiting vulnerabilities here allows attackers to bypass initial security checks and potentially impersonate users or inject malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Spoofed Identity](./attack_tree_paths/provide_spoofed_identity.md)

This node is critical because it represents a direct attempt to bypass identity verification. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user, gaining unauthorized access to resources and functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node focuses on weaknesses within the Facenet model itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences, including triggering backdoors, extracting sensitive information, or manipulating the model's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node highlights the risks associated with using external libraries. Successfully exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies like TensorFlow or image processing libraries can grant attackers significant control over the system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node represents weaknesses in how Facenet is integrated into the larger application. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can expose Facenet's functionalities in unintended ways, bypassing security controls and allowing unauthorized access or actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Spoofed Identity -> Submit photo/video of a different person](./attack_tree_paths/provide_spoofed_identity_-_submit_photovideo_of_a_different_person.md)

This path is high-risk because it's a simple attack with a high likelihood of success if basic liveness detection isn't implemented or is weak. The impact is medium, potentially allowing unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Spoofed Identity -> Use deepfake technology to create realistic spoof](./attack_tree_paths/provide_spoofed_identity_-_use_deepfake_technology_to_create_realistic_spoof.md)

This path is high-risk due to the increasing sophistication and accessibility of deepfake technology. While requiring more effort than a simple photo, it can bypass basic liveness detection and has a high potential impact, leading to unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Target TensorFlow Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_target_tensorflow_vulnerabilities.md)

This path is high-risk because TensorFlow is a core dependency, and known vulnerabilities can be readily exploited using publicly available tools. The impact is high, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Target Image Processing Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_target_image_processing_library_vulnerabilities.md)

Similar to TensorFlow, vulnerabilities in image processing libraries are common and can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution, making this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities -> Bypass Liveness Detection (if implemented)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities_-_bypass_liveness_detection__if_implemented_.md)

This path is high-risk because it directly targets a security control designed to prevent spoofing. Successfully bypassing liveness detection allows attackers to impersonate users, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities -> Exploit API Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_api_misconfigurations.md)

This path is high-risk due to the prevalence of API misconfigurations in web applications. If Facenet's API endpoints are not properly secured, attackers can easily exploit them to gain unauthorized access or manipulate Facenet's functionality.
