**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Author:** AI Architecture Expert

**1. Introduction**

This document provides an enhanced design overview of a system built upon the FaceNet model, as exemplified by the implementation found in the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)). This detailed design serves as a crucial artifact for subsequent threat modeling exercises, enabling a thorough understanding of the system's architecture, individual components, and the flow of data.

**1.1. Project Overview**

The core objective of the FaceNet project is to achieve robust face recognition by learning a transformation that maps face images into a compact Euclidean space. In this space, the distance between two face embeddings directly reflects the similarity between the corresponding faces. This capability facilitates tasks such as verifying if two face images belong to the same individual and identifying an unknown face from a database of known faces. The linked repository offers code for both training new FaceNet models and utilizing pre-trained models for practical face recognition applications.

        *   The repository uses TensorFlow or Keras to load and execute the pre-trained FaceNet model.
        *   The model takes the preprocessed face image as input and outputs a high-dimensional vector (the face embedding).
        *   The dimensionality of the embedding is a key parameter (e.g., 128-dimensional embedding).
