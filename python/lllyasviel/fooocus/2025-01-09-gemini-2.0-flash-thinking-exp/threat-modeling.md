# Threat Model Analysis for lllyasviel/fooocus

## Threat: [Malicious Prompt Injection](./threats/malicious_prompt_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a user prompt containing malicious commands or instructions that are interpreted and executed by Fooocus or its underlying libraries. This could involve injecting code, manipulating file paths, or triggering unintended system commands *within the context of Fooocus's execution*.
*   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion (causing denial of service due to Fooocus overloading the system), generation of harmful or illegal content by manipulating Fooocus's behavior, potential for remote code execution on the server *if vulnerabilities exist within Fooocus's prompt processing logic itself*.
*   **Affected Fooocus Component:** Prompt processing logic, potentially the interface with underlying diffusion models or system calls made by Fooocus.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency (library or model) that Fooocus relies on. This could involve injecting malicious code into a library used by Fooocus or distributing a backdoored model that Fooocus loads and uses during image generation.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution *within the Fooocus process*, data exfiltration *through compromised dependencies used by Fooocus*, installation of backdoors that could be exploited when Fooocus is running.
*   **Affected Fooocus Component:** Dependency management within Fooocus, the model loading mechanism used by Fooocus.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Fooocus or its Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_fooocus_or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Fooocus library itself or its direct dependencies to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service by crashing Fooocus, or gain unauthorized access to resources *accessible by the Fooocus process*.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution *within the Fooocus process*, denial of service by crashing Fooocus, information disclosure by exploiting vulnerabilities in Fooocus's data handling.
*   **Affected Fooocus Component:** Any part of the Fooocus codebase or its direct dependencies containing a vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Local File System Access Exploitation via Fooocus](./threats/local_file_system_access_exploitation_via_fooocus.md)

*   **Description:** If Fooocus has unintended or excessive access to the local file system, an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in Fooocus to read sensitive files, write malicious files, or execute commands by manipulating file paths within prompts or parameters *that Fooocus processes*.
*   **Impact:** Data breach by reading files accessible to Fooocus, server compromise by writing malicious files to locations Fooocus can access, potential for command execution if Fooocus interacts with the system in a vulnerable way based on file paths.
*   **Affected Fooocus Component:** File system access mechanisms within Fooocus, potentially prompt or parameter handling that involves file paths.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
