# Attack Surface Analysis for lllyasviel/fooocus

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Model Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_model_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Loading untrusted or compromised Stable Diffusion models can introduce malicious code or vulnerabilities into the Fooocus environment.
    *   **How Fooocus Contributes:** Fooocus allows users to load custom models, which can be sourced from anywhere. This trust-on-first-use approach without verification poses a risk.
    *   **Example:** A user downloads a seemingly legitimate model from an untrusted source. This model contains code that executes when loaded by Fooocus, potentially giving the attacker control over the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of models (e.g., using checksums, digital signatures). Provide clear warnings to users about the risks of loading untrusted models. Consider sandboxing model loading processes.
        *   **Users:** Only load models from trusted and reputable sources. Verify the integrity of downloaded models if possible. Be extremely cautious about models from unknown origins.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Fooocus relies on various third-party libraries (e.g., PyTorch, Transformers, Diffusers). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited if not properly managed.
    *   **How Fooocus Contributes:**  Fooocus's functionality is directly tied to the security of its dependencies. Outdated or vulnerable dependencies create an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in a specific version of the `diffusers` library that Fooocus uses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if Fooocus is running that vulnerable version.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Implement a robust dependency management strategy. Pin specific versions of dependencies to ensure consistency and avoid unexpected breaking changes. Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit` or `safety`. Keep dependencies updated with security patches.
        *   **Users:** Ensure the Fooocus installation is kept up-to-date. This often includes updates to its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [File System Access Issues](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper handling of file paths and access permissions can allow attackers to read or write arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **How Fooocus Contributes:** Fooocus interacts with the file system for loading models, saving generated images, and potentially accessing other resources based on user configuration.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in how Fooocus handles user-provided file paths could allow an attacker to specify a path like `/etc/shadow` for reading or a system directory for writing malicious files.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, modification of critical system files, remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths. Use absolute paths instead of relative paths where possible. Enforce the principle of least privilege for file system access. Avoid directly using user input to construct file paths.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about providing file paths to Fooocus, especially from untrusted sources. Understand the permissions required by Fooocus and ensure they are appropriate.
