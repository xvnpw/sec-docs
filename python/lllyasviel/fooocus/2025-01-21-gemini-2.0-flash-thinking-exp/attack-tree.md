## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Fooocus [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_fooocus__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fooocus Input Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fooocus_input_handling__critical_.md)

This category of attacks focuses on manipulating the input provided to Fooocus.

* **Malicious Prompt Injection [CRITICAL]:**
    * Attackers craft prompts designed to exploit vulnerabilities or unintended behaviors within Fooocus.
    * **Trigger Unintended Actions in Fooocus:**
        * **Cause Resource Exhaustion (DoS) [CRITICAL]:**
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: High
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Medium
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium
            * Crafting prompts that require excessive computational resources can lead to denial of service by overloading the server.
* **Inject Malicious Code via Parameters (if unsanitized) [CRITICAL]:**
    * Likelihood: Low
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: High
    * Skill Level: High
    * Detection Difficulty: Hard
    * If the application doesn't properly sanitize parameters before passing them to Fooocus, attackers could inject malicious code if Fooocus has vulnerabilities allowing code execution through specific parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fooocus Resource Consumption [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fooocus_resource_consumption__critical_.md)

This category of attacks aims to overwhelm the resources used by Fooocus.

* **Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Requests [CRITICAL]:**
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy
    * Attackers send a large number of image generation requests to overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, GPU), leading to a denial of service.
* **Model Manipulation/Poisoning (Less Likely, but Possible) [CRITICAL]:**
    * Likelihood: Low
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: High
    * Skill Level: High
    * Detection Difficulty: Hard
    * If the application allows users to upload or select custom models for Fooocus, an attacker could upload a malicious model designed to cause harm when used. This could involve triggering vulnerabilities in Fooocus or generating harmful outputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fooocus Dependencies/Underlying Libraries [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fooocus_dependenciesunderlying_libraries__critical_.md)

This category focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the software that Fooocus relies on.

* **Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Stable Diffusion or other libraries:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]:**
        * Likelihood: Low (depends on patch status)
        * Impact: Critical
        * Effort: Medium (if exploit exists) to High (if 0-day)
        * Skill Level: Medium to High
        * Detection Difficulty: Hard
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in underlying libraries could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Input Validation Before Passing to Fooocus [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_input_validation_before_passing_to_fooocus__critical_.md)

* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Depends on the exploited vulnerability
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Low to Medium
* Detection Difficulty: Medium
* If the application doesn't properly validate user input before passing it to Fooocus, it can allow malicious input to reach Fooocus, potentially triggering vulnerabilities. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability that is triggered by the unsanitized input.
