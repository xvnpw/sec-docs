# Threat Model Analysis for lllyasviel/fooocus

## Threat: [Prompt Injection](./threats/prompt_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Prompt Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious prompt to manipulate Fooocus's behavior beyond intended image generation. This could involve injecting commands or exploiting parsing vulnerabilities in prompt processing to cause unintended actions or resource exhaustion. For example, a crafted prompt could be designed to consume excessive GPU memory, leading to denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (e.g., GPU or CPU overload).
    *   Generation of unintended or harmful content, potentially causing reputational damage or legal issues.
*   **Fooocus Component Affected:** Prompt Processing Module, Stable Diffusion model interaction.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization and validation for user prompts, focusing on filtering out potentially malicious patterns and commands.
    *   Utilize prompt content filtering to detect and block prompts likely to generate harmful or inappropriate content.
    *   Enforce strict resource limits on Fooocus processes, especially GPU and CPU usage, to prevent DoS attacks.
    *   Regularly audit and update prompt processing logic and underlying libraries for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** Fooocus relies on numerous third-party libraries (e.g., PyTorch, Diffusers, Transformers). Attackers could exploit known, high-severity vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application. Exploitation could involve leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of these libraries that Fooocus depends on.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE), potentially allowing attackers to gain full control of the server running Fooocus.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) through exploiting vulnerabilities that cause crashes, instability, or performance degradation.
    *   Data breaches if vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.
*   **Fooocus Component Affected:** Core Fooocus application and all its dependencies listed in requirements files (e.g., `requirements.txt`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain a rigorously updated environment by promptly updating Fooocus and all its dependencies to the latest stable and patched versions.
    *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools to continuously monitor Fooocus dependencies for known vulnerabilities and receive alerts for critical issues.
    *   Employ dependency pinning to ensure consistent and controlled dependency versions across deployments, facilitating vulnerability tracking and patching.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases relevant to Fooocus and its dependencies to proactively identify and address emerging threats.

## Threat: [Malicious Model Loading](./threats/malicious_model_loading.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Model Loading
*   **Description:** If Fooocus is configured to load models from untrusted or insufficiently vetted sources, an attacker could potentially trick the application into loading a malicious AI model. This model could be specifically crafted to contain embedded exploits or backdoors that activate when loaded and used by Fooocus, leading to severe compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE), granting attackers control over the server infrastructure.
    *   Data exfiltration, where the malicious model is designed to steal sensitive data during model loading or inference processes.
    *   System compromise and instability, potentially leading to complete system failure or persistent backdoors.
    *   Generation of intentionally harmful, misleading, or illegal images as part of a targeted attack.
*   **Fooocus Component Affected:** Model Loading Module, potentially impacting the entire inference pipeline and system security.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly restrict model loading to only trusted and highly reputable sources. Ideally, pre-package models within the application or use a curated, internal model repository.
    *   Implement robust model validation mechanisms, including cryptographic checksum verification and digital signatures, to ensure model integrity and authenticity before loading.
    *   Store models in secure, isolated locations with highly restricted access to prevent unauthorized modification or substitution.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for Fooocus processes, minimizing the permissions granted to limit the potential damage from a compromised model.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion](./threats/resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (DoS)
*   **Description:** Attackers can intentionally overload the Fooocus application by sending a high volume of resource-intensive image generation requests. This can exhaust critical server resources, particularly GPU and CPU, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Attackers might automate this process using botnets to amplify the impact.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS), rendering the application unavailable to legitimate users and disrupting operations.
    *   Severe performance degradation, leading to slow response times and a poor user experience for all users.
    *   Significant increase in infrastructure costs due to spikes in resource consumption, especially in cloud environments.
*   **Fooocus Component Affected:** Image Generation Pipeline, Resource Management within Fooocus.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement aggressive rate limiting to strictly control the number of image generation requests from individual users or IP addresses within defined timeframes.
    *   Set and enforce resource quotas for image generation requests, limiting parameters like maximum image resolution, generation steps, and processing time.
    *   Utilize a robust queueing system to manage and prioritize image generation requests, preventing overload and ensuring fair resource allocation.
    *   Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for resource usage (CPU, GPU, memory) to proactively detect and respond to potential resource exhaustion attacks in real-time.
