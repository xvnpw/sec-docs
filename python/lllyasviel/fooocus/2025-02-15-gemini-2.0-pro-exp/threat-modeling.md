# Threat Model Analysis for lllyasviel/fooocus

## Threat: [Malicious Model Substitution (via File System)](./threats/malicious_model_substitution__via_file_system_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with local file system access (or through a separate vulnerability allowing file uploads) replaces a legitimate model checkpoint file (e.g., `.safetensors`, `.ckpt`) loaded by *Fooocus* with a tampered or malicious version. The attacker could craft the malicious model to generate harmful content, exfiltrate data, or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in model parsing libraries used *within Fooocus*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Generation of inappropriate, illegal, or harmful content.
        *   Potential for data exfiltration (steganography within generated images).
        *   Possible remote code execution (RCE) if vulnerabilities in model parsing libraries *within Fooocus or its direct dependencies* are exploited.
        *   Reputational damage to the application and its operators.
    *   **Fooocus Component Affected:**
        *   `model_manager.py` (specifically, functions related to loading models from disk, like `load_model_from_file`).
        *   The overall model loading pipeline *within Fooocus*, including any functions that handle file paths and model selection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Permissions:** Ensure that the directory containing model files has the most restrictive permissions possible. Only the *Fooocus* process should have read access, and no users should have write access.
        *   **Model Checksum Verification:** Before loading any model, *Fooocus* should calculate its cryptographic hash (SHA-256) and compare it to a known-good value stored securely (e.g., in a separate, read-only configuration file or database).  *Fooocus* should reject the model if the hashes don't match.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Implement a system for digitally signing models from trusted sources.  *Fooocus* should verify the signature before loading.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Load and process models *within Fooocus* in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container with limited privileges and resource access) to contain any potential exploits. This sandboxing should be part of the *Fooocus* execution environment.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit the model files on disk to ensure their integrity.

## Threat: [Malicious Model Substitution (via URL)](./threats/malicious_model_substitution__via_url_.md)

*   **Description:** If *Fooocus* is configured to download models from URLs, an attacker could manipulate a *Fooocus* configuration file or intercept network traffic (e.g., through a Man-in-the-Middle attack) to redirect *Fooocus* to a malicious model URL.
    *   **Impact:** Same as above (Malicious Model Substitution via File System).
    *   **Fooocus Component Affected:**
        *   `model_manager.py` (functions related to downloading models, like those using `requests` or similar libraries *within Fooocus*).
        *   Configuration parsing logic *within Fooocus* (e.g., functions that read model URLs from `config.txt` or similar).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:**  *Fooocus* must *always* use HTTPS for downloading models.  Do not allow HTTP connections.
        *   **Certificate Pinning:**  Implement certificate pinning *within Fooocus* to ensure that it only connects to servers with specific, trusted certificates, preventing MITM attacks.
        *   **URL Whitelist:** *Fooocus* should maintain a whitelist of trusted model download URLs.  Reject any requests to URLs not on the whitelist.
        *   **Checksum Verification (Post-Download):** After *Fooocus* downloads a model, it should immediately calculate its checksum and verify it against a known-good value.
        *   **Sandboxing:** As above (sandboxing *within the Fooocus execution context*).

## Threat: [Input Parameter Manipulation (Prompt Injection) - *Focusing on Fooocus-Specific Aspects*](./threats/input_parameter_manipulation__prompt_injection__-_focusing_on_fooocus-specific_aspects.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input prompts specifically designed to trigger unexpected behavior *within Fooocus's prompt parsing and processing logic*, or to exploit vulnerabilities in how *Fooocus* interacts with its core image generation libraries (e.g., `diffusers`). This goes beyond general input validation and targets *Fooocus's specific implementation*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption *triggered by Fooocus's handling of the prompt*.
        *   Information disclosure (e.g., revealing details about *Fooocus's internal model configuration*).
        *   Generation of unexpected or undesirable content *due to flaws in Fooocus's prompt handling*.
        *   Potential for triggering vulnerabilities in underlying libraries *through Fooocus's specific API calls*.
    *   **Fooocus Component Affected:**
        *   `process_images.py` (functions that handle user input, parse prompts, and apply styles *within Fooocus*).
        *   Any functions *within Fooocus* that interact with the `diffusers` library based on user input.
        *   Potentially, style-related modules *within Fooocus* if custom styles are supported and not properly sanitized *by Fooocus*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fooocus-Specific Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation *within Fooocus* for all parameters, including prompts, styles, seeds, and other settings.  Define allowed character sets, lengths, and formats *based on Fooocus's expected input*.
        *   **Fooocus-Specific Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user input *within Fooocus* to remove or escape any potentially harmful characters or sequences *that could exploit Fooocus's parsing logic*.
        *   **Rate Limiting (within Fooocus):** If *Fooocus* handles requests directly, limit the rate at which it processes requests.
        *   **Resource Quotas (within Fooocus):** If *Fooocus* manages resources, set limits on resource consumption (CPU, GPU, memory) per request.
        *   **Regular Expression Filtering (Fooocus-Specific):** Use carefully crafted regular expressions *within Fooocus* to filter out known malicious prompt patterns *that target Fooocus's implementation*.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering](./threats/configuration_file_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to *Fooocus's* configuration files (e.g., `config.txt`, or custom configuration files used *by Fooocus*) and modifies them to alter *Fooocus's* behavior.  This could include changing model paths, enabling debug modes, or modifying security settings *within Fooocus*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Loading of malicious models *by Fooocus*.
        *   Exposure of sensitive information (if debug mode is enabled *in Fooocus*).
        *   Disabling of security features *within Fooocus*.
        *   Alteration of *Fooocus's* behavior in unpredictable ways.
    *   **Fooocus Component Affected:**
        *   Any code *within Fooocus* that reads and parses configuration files.  This is likely spread across multiple modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure File Permissions:**  Restrict access to configuration files used *by Fooocus* using appropriate file system permissions.
        *   **Integrity Checks:**  *Fooocus* should calculate checksums of its configuration files and verify them on startup.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use a configuration management system (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to enforce desired configurations and detect unauthorized changes *to files used by Fooocus*.
        *   **Read-Only Configuration:**  If possible, make the configuration files read-only for the *Fooocus* process after initial setup.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Supply Chain Attack) - *Direct Fooocus Dependencies*](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__supply_chain_attack__-_direct_fooocus_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered in one of *Fooocus's direct dependencies* (e.g., a specific version of `diffusers`, `transformers`, or other Python packages listed in *Fooocus's* `requirements.txt`). An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise *Fooocus*.  This focuses on vulnerabilities in packages *directly* used by Fooocus, not general system libraries.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) *within the Fooocus process*.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) *of Fooocus*.
        *   Information Disclosure *from Fooocus*.
        *   Data Corruption *within Fooocus*.
    *   **Fooocus Component Affected:**
        *   Potentially any part of *Fooocus* that uses the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a `requirements.txt` file *for Fooocus* and pin dependencies to specific, known-good versions.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan *Fooocus's* dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit`, `safety`, or dedicated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   **Virtual Environments:** Use virtual environments to isolate *Fooocus's* dependencies and prevent conflicts.
        *   **Prompt Updates:**  Update *Fooocus's* dependencies promptly when security patches are released.
        *   **Dependency Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor for new vulnerability disclosures related to *Fooocus's direct dependencies*.
