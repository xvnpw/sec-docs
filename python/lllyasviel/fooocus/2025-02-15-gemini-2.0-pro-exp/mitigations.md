## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Model Whitelisting (Modified for Fooocus)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_model_whitelisting__modified_for_fooocus_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Identify Trusted Models:** Determine a list of reputable sources and specific, trusted models.
    2.  **Download and Verify:** Download models and obtain/calculate their SHA-256 checksums.
    3.  **Modify `config.txt` (and related files):**  Instead of *just* specifying model paths, extend the configuration to include checksums.  This might require modifying the parsing logic in Fooocus to handle a new format, for example:
        ```
        # Original (Hypothetical)
        model_path = "models/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors"

        # Modified (Hypothetical - Requires Code Changes)
        model_path = "models/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors"
        model_checksum = "sha256:e14a996815d7999f..."  # The actual checksum
        ```
    4.  **Implement Checksum Verification in Fooocus Code:** Modify the Python code in Fooocus that loads models (likely in files related to model initialization or loading).  Add logic to:
        *   Read the `model_path` *and* `model_checksum` from the configuration.
        *   Calculate the SHA-256 checksum of the file at `model_path`.
        *   Compare the calculated checksum with the `model_checksum` from the configuration.
        *   *Only* load the model if the checksums match.  If they don't, raise a `ValueError` or a custom exception, and log the error *securely* (avoiding logging sensitive information).
    5.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for cases where:
        *   The checksum is missing from the configuration.
        *   The checksum doesn't match.
        *   The model file is not found.
    6. **Secure Configuration Loading:** Ensure the configuration file itself is loaded securely, preventing injection of malicious paths or checksums.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Models:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Prevents loading of models not explicitly whitelisted.
    *   **Model Tampering:** (Severity: **High**) - Detects modifications to model files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Models:** Risk reduced to near zero, *if the whitelist is maintained*.
    *   **Model Tampering:** High risk reduction; detects unauthorized changes.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Fooocus allows specifying model paths, but *not* checksums.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Checksum verification logic within the Fooocus Python code.
    *   Modification of the configuration file format and parsing to include checksums.
    *   Robust error handling for failed checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation (Within Fooocus)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation__within_fooocus_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Identify Prompt Entry Point:** Locate the exact point in the Fooocus code (Python files) where user-provided prompts are received and processed *before* being passed to the underlying model.
    2.  **Implement Denylist:** Create a denylist of words, phrases, and regular expressions (as described previously) within a Python module or a dedicated configuration file loaded by Fooocus.
    3.  **Add Filtering Logic:**  Insert code at the prompt entry point to:
        *   Lowercase the prompt.
        *   Iterate through the denylist.
        *   Use string matching or regular expressions to check for matches.
        *   If a match is found:
            *   Option A:  Raise an exception and prevent image generation.  Log the event securely.
            *   Option B:  Replace the matched term with a safe alternative (e.g., replace a sensitive word with "[REDACTED]").  Log the modification.
    4.  **Length Limits:**  Enforce a maximum prompt length *within the Fooocus code*.  If the prompt exceeds the limit, raise an exception or truncate the prompt (logging the truncation).
    5.  **Character Restrictions:**  Implement checks to ensure the prompt only contains allowed characters.  Reject or sanitize prompts containing disallowed characters.
    6. **Log Sanitization:** Log all sanitization actions, including the original prompt, the detected issue, and the action taken (rejection, replacement, truncation).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Indirect Prompt Injection:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Reduces the risk of prompts designed to elicit harmful outputs.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Partial):** (Severity: **Medium**) - Length limits help.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Indirect Prompt Injection:** Moderate risk reduction.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Some protection against overly long prompts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All sanitization and validation logic needs to be added to the Fooocus code at the prompt processing stage.
    *   The denylist needs to be created and integrated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Configuration (Within Fooocus)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_configuration__within_fooocus_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Locate Inference Code:** Identify the specific Python functions within Fooocus that perform the actual image generation (inference) using the loaded model.
    2.  **Add Timeout Parameters:**  Modify these functions to accept a `timeout` parameter (in seconds or milliseconds).
    3.  **Implement Timeout Logic:**  Within the inference functions, use the `timeout` parameter with the underlying libraries (e.g., PyTorch, transformers) to set a time limit for the generation process.  This usually involves passing the `timeout` to the relevant function calls.
    4.  **Handle Timeout Exceptions:**  Wrap the inference code in a `try...except` block to catch timeout exceptions (e.g., `torch.cuda.TimeoutError` if using PyTorch with CUDA).
    5.  **Error Handling:**  When a timeout exception occurs:
        *   Log the event securely.
        *   Raise a custom exception (e.g., `FooocusTimeoutError`) that can be handled by the calling code.
    6. **Default Timeout:** Set a reasonable default timeout value in the configuration (e.g., `config.txt`) if one is not provided.
    7. **Expose Timeout in Configuration:** Allow users to configure the timeout value through the `config.txt` file (or a similar mechanism).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents excessively long generation times.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Partial):** (Severity: **High**) - Helps mitigate DoS attacks that rely on slow requests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion.
    *   **DoS:** Provides some protection.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeout parameters and logic need to be added to the inference functions within Fooocus.
    *   Exception handling for timeouts needs to be implemented.
    *   Configuration options for timeouts need to be added.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management (Within Fooocus)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management__within_fooocus_.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Review `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:** Carefully examine the file that lists Fooocus's dependencies (likely `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`).
    2.  **Pin Exact Versions:**  Specify *exact* versions for *all* dependencies, including transitive dependencies.  Use a tool like `pip freeze` to generate a requirements file with pinned versions *after* testing a known-good configuration.  Example:
        ```
        # Instead of:
        torch
        transformers

        # Use:
        torch==2.0.1
        transformers==4.30.2
        # ... and so on for ALL dependencies
        ```
    3.  **Justify Each Dependency:**  Ensure that every dependency is *absolutely necessary*.  Remove any unused or optional dependencies.
    4.  **Regular Updates (with Testing):**  Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies.  This involves:
        *   Updating the pinned versions in the requirements file.
        *   Running *thorough* tests to ensure that the updates don't introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
        *   *Only* deploying the updated dependencies after successful testing.
    5. **Consider a Separate Virtual Environment:** Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to isolate Fooocus's dependencies from other Python projects on the system. This is a general best practice, but it's particularly important for managing dependencies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** (Severity: **High**) - Reduces the risk of using dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Partial):** (Severity: **High**) - Pinning versions makes it harder for an attacker to inject a malicious dependency through an unexpected update.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** Significantly reduces risk by controlling the versions used.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Provides some protection.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Fooocus likely has a `requirements.txt` or similar file, but it may not have *strictly* pinned versions for *all* dependencies.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Ensure *all* dependencies are pinned to exact versions.
    *   Establish a rigorous process for updating and testing dependencies.
