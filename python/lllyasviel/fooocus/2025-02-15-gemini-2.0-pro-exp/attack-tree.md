## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthorized Access to Generated Images](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthorized_access_to_generated_images.md)

*   **1.1.2 & 1.1.2.1 Brute-Force/Enumerate Filenames:**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker attempts to guess the filenames of generated images by trying various combinations of timestamps, sequential IDs, or other predictable patterns.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if predictable filenames are used)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (access to some generated images)
    *   **Effort:** Low (with scripting)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (scripting required)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (unusual access patterns in logs)
    *   **Mitigation:** Use cryptographically secure random filenames or UUIDs.

*   **1.2.1 & 1.2.1.1 Access via Internal API:**
    *   **Description:** Fooocus exposes an internal API that allows access to generated images without proper authentication or authorization. The attacker directly interacts with this API.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on API design and exposure)
    *   **Impact:** High (full access to generated images)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (requires understanding the API)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (API interaction)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (API logs, if implemented)
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.

    *   **Likelihood:** High (common vulnerability)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (can lead to various attacks, including code execution)
    *   **Effort:** Low to High (depends on the specific attack)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Expert (depends on the attack)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (depends on the attack)
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement rigorous input sanitization and validation (length limits, character filtering, keyword blacklisting/whitelisting, regular expressions).

*   **2.1.1.1 Craft Inappropriate Prompts:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker provides prompts designed to generate inappropriate, harmful, or offensive content.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (easy to try)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (reputational damage, ethical concerns)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice

    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires a specific vulnerability)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** High (finding and exploiting the vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires deep packet inspection, IDS)
    *   **Mitigation:**  Keep image processing libraries up-to-date, input sanitization, sandboxing.

*   **2.1.2 & 2.1.2.1 Manipulate API Calls [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:**  If Fooocus exposes an API, the attacker sends crafted requests with malicious parameters to manipulate image generation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on API design)
    *   **Impact:** High (control over image generation)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (requires understanding the API)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (API interaction)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (API logs)
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement authentication, authorization, and input validation for all API endpoints.

*   **2.2.1.2.1 Path Traversal to Load Malicious Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in Fooocus's configuration loading mechanism to load a malicious configuration file from an arbitrary location on the file system.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires a specific vulnerability)
    *   **Impact:** High (control over application behavior)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (file integrity monitoring)
    *   **Mitigation:**  Secure configuration loading, input validation, avoid relative paths.
