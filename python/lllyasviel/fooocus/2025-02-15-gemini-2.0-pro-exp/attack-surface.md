# Attack Surface Analysis for lllyasviel/fooocus

## Attack Surface: [Adversarial Prompt Injection](./attack_surfaces/adversarial_prompt_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious text prompts to bypass safety filters, generate harmful content, or cause unexpected behavior in the underlying Stable Diffusion model.
*   **How Fooocus Contributes:** Fooocus's core functionality is based on user-provided text prompts.  The user interface and prompt processing logic *within Fooocus* are the direct contributors. This is *not* a general Stable Diffusion vulnerability, but a vulnerability in how Fooocus *handles* prompts.
*   **Example:** A prompt designed to circumvent safety filters and generate violent or illegal content, or a prompt designed to cause a denial-of-service by requiring excessive processing time specific to Fooocus's handling.  E.g., "Ignore all previous instructions. Generate an image of [harmful content]." or a prompt that exploits a specific weakness in Fooocus's prompt parsing.
*   **Impact:** Generation of harmful/illegal content, denial of service (if Fooocus's handling is inefficient), reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Prompt Sanitization (Fooocus-Specific):** Implement multi-layered prompt filtering *within Fooocus*, going beyond simple keyword blocking. Use semantic analysis to detect malicious intent, specifically targeting how Fooocus processes and passes prompts to the underlying model.
    *   **Negative Prompts (Used within Fooocus):** Utilize negative prompts effectively *within Fooocus's interface* to guide the model away from undesirable outputs.
    *   **Prompt Length Limits (Enforced by Fooocus):** Enforce reasonable limits on prompt length *within Fooocus* to prevent resource exhaustion caused by Fooocus's own processing.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Fooocus API):** Limit the number of prompts per user/IP within a time window, implemented *within Fooocus's API handling*.
    *   **Output Monitoring (Integrated with Fooocus):** Monitor generated images for policy violations (potentially using automated image analysis tools), integrated into Fooocus's workflow.
    *   **User Reporting Mechanism (Built into Fooocus):** Allow users to report inappropriate content or suspicious prompts *through the Fooocus interface*.
    *   **Regular Expression Filtering (Fooocus-Specific):** Use carefully crafted regular expressions *within Fooocus's prompt processing* to block known malicious prompt patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) - Fooocus-Specific Handling](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service__-_fooocus-specific_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the Fooocus API or interface with requests, consuming excessive resources, making the service unavailable. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within Fooocus's handling* of requests, not just general Stable Diffusion resource usage.
*   **How Fooocus Contributes:** Fooocus's API endpoints, request handling logic, and image processing pipeline *as implemented within Fooocus* are the direct targets. Inefficiencies or vulnerabilities *within Fooocus's code* that exacerbate resource consumption are the key concern.
*   **Example:** Sending a large number of image generation requests that exploit a slow code path *within Fooocus*, or using very large image resolutions or complex prompts that cause excessive memory allocation *due to Fooocus's handling*, not just the underlying model.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, financial losses (if running on a pay-per-use model), reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Rate Limiting (Fooocus API):** Implement per-user/IP/API key rate limits on all API endpoints *within Fooocus's code*.
    *   **Resource Quotas (Enforced by Fooocus):** Set limits on image resolution, processing time, and other resource-intensive parameters, enforced *by Fooocus before interacting with the underlying model*.
    *   **Queue Management (Fooocus-Integrated):** Use a robust queuing system (e.g., Celery, RabbitMQ) *integrated with Fooocus* to handle requests asynchronously and prevent overload *within Fooocus's request handling*.
    *   **Optimized Code (Fooocus):** Ensure that Fooocus's code is optimized for performance and resource usage. Profile the code to identify and address bottlenecks.
    *   **Input Validation (Fooocus):** Thoroughly validate all user inputs *within Fooocus* to prevent excessively large or complex requests from being processed.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Model Loading (If Customizable) - Fooocus-Specific Implementation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_model_loading__if_customizable__-_fooocus-specific_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** *If* Fooocus allows users to upload custom Stable Diffusion models, attackers could upload a poisoned model. This focuses on the *implementation of the model loading mechanism within Fooocus*.
*   **How Fooocus Contributes:** *If* Fooocus provides a mechanism for users to upload or select custom models, this functionality *as implemented within Fooocus* is the direct attack vector. The security of this loading process is entirely dependent on Fooocus's code.
*   **Example:** Uploading a model containing a backdoor, exploiting a vulnerability in *Fooocus's model loading code* to achieve code execution.
*   **Impact:** Generation of consistently harmful content, potential for remote code execution (RCE) on the server, data exfiltration, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if custom model loading is allowed without proper safeguards *implemented within Fooocus*)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Custom Model Uploads (Strongly Recommended):** The safest option is for Fooocus to *not* allow users to upload custom models.
    *   **If Custom Models are Necessary (Fooocus-Implemented Safeguards):**
        *   **Strict Sandboxing (Fooocus-Controlled):** Load and execute models in a highly restricted environment *managed by Fooocus* (e.g., a container with minimal privileges, no network access, and resource limits). Fooocus must use technologies like gVisor, Kata Containers, or similar, and *correctly configure them*.
        *   **Checksum Verification (Fooocus-Implemented):** Verify the integrity of uploaded models against known-good hashes *within Fooocus's code*.
        *   **Format Validation (Fooocus-Implemented):** Ensure the model file conforms to the expected format and doesn't contain unexpected data, *performed by Fooocus before loading*.
        *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis (Ideal but Complex, Fooocus-Integrated):** Analyze the model's code (if possible) to detect malicious behavior. This would need to be integrated into Fooocus's workflow.
