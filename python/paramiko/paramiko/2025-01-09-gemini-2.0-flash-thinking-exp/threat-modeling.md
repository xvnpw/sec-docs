# Threat Model Analysis for paramiko/paramiko

## Threat: [Private Key Compromise (Paramiko Involvement)](./threats/private_key_compromise__paramiko_involvement_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to SSH private keys *handled by Paramiko*. This could occur if the application stores keys insecurely *before loading them into Paramiko*, or if vulnerabilities in Paramiko's key handling expose them during runtime. The attacker can then use these keys with Paramiko to impersonate legitimate users/applications.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of remote systems accessible with the compromised key via Paramiko. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, system disruption.
*   **Affected Paramiko Component:** `paramiko.RSAKey`, `paramiko.DSSKey`, `paramiko.EdDSAKey`, `paramiko.ECDSAKey` (key loading, storage in memory).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store private keys *before* they are loaded into Paramiko (using OS keychains, HSMs, etc.).
    *   Avoid hardcoding or storing keys in application code or configuration files accessible to attackers.
    *   Regularly rotate keys used by Paramiko.
    *   Review and audit how the application loads and manages keys within Paramiko.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack (Host Key Bypass via Paramiko)](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack__host_key_bypass_via_paramiko_.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the initial SSH connection. If the application using Paramiko is configured to bypass or weakly verify host keys (e.g., using `AutoAddPolicy` without scrutiny), Paramiko will establish a connection with the attacker's server, believing it to be legitimate.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted via Paramiko. The attacker can eavesdrop, inject commands, or establish a foothold.
*   **Affected Paramiko Component:** `paramiko.SSHClient.connect()`, `paramiko.WarningPolicy`, `paramiko.RejectPolicy`, `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy` (how Paramiko handles host key verification).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict host key verification in Paramiko. Avoid using `AutoAddPolicy` in production.
    *   Use `WarningPolicy` or `RejectPolicy` for initial connections and establish trust through manual verification or trusted sources.
    *   Securely manage and update the `known_hosts` file if used.

## Threat: [Command Injection via `exec_command` (Paramiko)](./threats/command_injection_via__exec_command___paramiko_.md)

**Description:** The application uses Paramiko's `exec_command` (or related methods) to execute commands on remote servers. If the command string is constructed by concatenating untrusted input without proper sanitization *before being passed to Paramiko*, an attacker can inject malicious commands.
*   **Impact:** Remote command execution on the target server via Paramiko, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Paramiko Component:** `paramiko.SSHClient.exec_command()`, `paramiko.Channel.exec_command()` (Paramiko's command execution functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid string concatenation for building commands passed to Paramiko.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to Paramiko's command execution functions.
    *   If possible, use more structured or parameterized methods for interacting with remote systems instead of raw commands.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Paramiko Itself](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_paramiko_itself.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities *within the Paramiko library code*. This could involve sending crafted SSH packets that trigger bugs in Paramiko's parsing or processing logic, leading to crashes, remote code execution within the application using Paramiko, or other malicious outcomes.
*   **Impact:** Can range from denial of service of the application using Paramiko, to remote code execution within the application's process, potentially compromising the entire system.
*   **Affected Paramiko Component:** Various modules and functions within the Paramiko library, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Paramiko updated to the latest stable version.** This is the most critical mitigation.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories related to Paramiko to be informed of new vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in your application's usage of Paramiko.
