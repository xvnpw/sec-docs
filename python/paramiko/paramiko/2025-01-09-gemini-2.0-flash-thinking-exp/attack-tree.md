# Attack Tree Analysis for paramiko/paramiko

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to the application's resources or execute arbitrary code on the application server by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Paramiko library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Paramiko](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_paramiko.md)

- This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of Paramiko vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_weaknesses.md)

- This node represents a failure in the application's ability to verify the identity of the user or system attempting to connect. Successful exploitation here grants initial access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-force Password Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_password_authentication.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker attempts numerous login attempts with different username and password combinations to guess valid credentials.
- Contributing Factors:
  - Lack of rate limiting on login attempts.
  - Weak or default passwords used by users or for system accounts.
  - No account lockout policy after multiple failed attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Key Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_key_management.md)

- This node represents vulnerabilities in how the application stores, protects, and uses private keys for SSH authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromised Private Key](./attack_tree_paths/compromised_private_key.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker gains access to a private key used for SSH authentication.
- Contributing Factors:
  - Private keys stored in world-readable locations.
  - Private keys stored unencrypted in version control systems.
  - Private keys stored on developer machines with inadequate security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Application as SSH Client)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__application_as_ssh_client_.md)

- This node represents vulnerabilities that can be exploited when the application initiates an SSH connection to a remote server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Connecting to a Malicious SSH Server](./attack_tree_paths/connecting_to_a_malicious_ssh_server.md)

- Attack Vector: The application is tricked into connecting to an SSH server controlled by the attacker.
- Contributing Factors:
  - Lack of or improperly implemented host key verification.
  - No mechanism to verify the authenticity of the remote server.
  - Application connects to dynamically provided or untrusted server addresses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Host Key Verification Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/host_key_verification_bypass.md)

- Attack Vector: The application bypasses or incorrectly implements the process of verifying the remote server's host key.
- Contributing Factors:
  - Accepting any host key without verification.
  - Ignoring host key verification errors.
  - Using insecure or default host key policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Paramiko-Specific Bugs and Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_paramiko-specific_bugs_and_vulnerabilities.md)

- This node represents the risk of using a version of Paramiko with known security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Publicly Disclosed CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_publicly_disclosed_cves.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker leverages a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in the specific version of Paramiko used by the application.
- Contributing Factors:
  - Using an outdated version of the Paramiko library.
  - Failure to apply security patches and updates.
  - Publicly available exploits for known vulnerabilities.
