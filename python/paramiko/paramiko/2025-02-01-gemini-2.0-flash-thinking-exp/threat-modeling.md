# Threat Model Analysis for paramiko/paramiko

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network communication between the client application and the SSH server. By subverting or bypassing host key verification in Paramiko, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate server. This allows them to eavesdrop on communication, steal credentials, and potentially inject malicious commands.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Confidentiality breach: Sensitive data transmitted over SSH can be intercepted.
    *   Integrity breach: Attacker can modify data in transit or inject malicious commands.
    *   Unauthorized access: Stolen credentials can be used for further unauthorized access.
*   **Paramiko Component Affected:** `paramiko.SSHClient.connect()`, `paramiko.HostKeys`, `paramiko.client.AutoAddPolicy`, `paramiko.client.WarningPolicy`, `paramiko.client.RejectPolicy` (Host key policy and connection establishment)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Host Key Verification:** Implement robust host key verification using `paramiko.HostKeys` to load and validate known host keys.
    *   **Avoid `AutoAddPolicy` in Production:**  Do not use `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()` in production environments as it automatically accepts new host keys without user confirmation, weakening MITM protection. Use `paramiko.WarningPolicy` or `paramiko.RejectPolicy` instead.
    *   **Secure Host Key Storage:** Store the `known_hosts` file securely and protect it from unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Out-of-Band Host Key Verification:** For initial connections, verify the server's host key fingerprint through a secure, separate channel.

## Threat: [Insecure Private Key Handling in Application Code using Paramiko](./threats/insecure_private_key_handling_in_application_code_using_paramiko.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Private Key Handling in Application Code using Paramiko
*   **Description:**  Developers may mishandle private keys within the application code that utilizes Paramiko. This includes storing private keys in plaintext, embedding them directly in code, or using insecure storage mechanisms. If these keys are compromised, attackers can impersonate authorized users and gain unauthorized SSH access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access: Attackers can use compromised private keys to authenticate to SSH servers.
    *   Privilege escalation: If the compromised key belongs to a privileged account, attackers gain elevated access.
    *   System compromise:  Successful key compromise can lead to full system control and data breaches.
*   **Paramiko Component Affected:** `paramiko.SSHClient.connect(key_filename=...)`, `paramiko.RSAKey`, `paramiko.DSSKey`, `paramiko.ECDSAKey`, `paramiko.EdDSAPrivateKey` (Key loading and authentication)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Private Key Storage:** Never store private keys in plaintext in code or configuration files.
    *   **Encrypted Key Storage:** Utilize secure key storage mechanisms like operating system keychains, dedicated secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted file systems to protect private keys at rest.
    *   **Restrict Access to Key Files:** Implement strict file system permissions to limit access to private key files to only authorized users and processes.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Keys:** Load private keys from secure configuration files or environment variables, not directly within the application code.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Implement and enforce regular SSH key rotation policies to minimize the impact of a potential key compromise.
    *   **Passphrase-Protected Keys:** Encrypt private keys with strong passphrases for an additional layer of security.

## Threat: [Command Injection](./threats/command_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection
*   **Description:** If application code using `paramiko.SSHClient.exec_command()` constructs shell commands by directly embedding user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation, attackers can inject malicious commands. Paramiko will then execute these injected commands on the remote server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the remote server with the privileges of the SSH user.
    *   System Compromise: Command injection can be leveraged to gain full control of the server, install malware, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
    *   Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify data on the server or disrupt services.
*   **Paramiko Component Affected:** `paramiko.SSHClient.exec_command()` (Command execution)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:**  Refrain from building shell commands by directly concatenating user input.
    *   **Parameterized Commands or Secure Methods:** If possible, use parameterized command execution methods or libraries that inherently prevent command injection.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data before incorporating it into commands. Use allowlists and escape special characters appropriately for the target shell.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Execute commands with the minimum necessary privileges. Use dedicated service accounts with restricted permissions whenever feasible.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in SFTP Operations](./threats/path_traversal_in_sftp_operations.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal in SFTP Operations
*   **Description:** When application code using `paramiko.SFTPClient` constructs file paths for SFTP operations (like upload or download) based on user input without proper validation, attackers can manipulate these paths to access files or directories outside the intended scope. Paramiko's SFTP client will then operate on these potentially malicious paths.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized File Access: Attackers can read, write, or delete files they are not authorized to access.
    *   Data Breach: Sensitive files located outside the intended directory can be accessed and exfiltrated.
    *   Data Manipulation or Loss: Attackers could modify or delete critical system files if they gain access to sensitive directories through path traversal.
*   **Paramiko Component Affected:** `paramiko.SFTPClient.get()`, `paramiko.SFTPClient.put()`, `paramiko.SFTPClient.listdir()`, `paramiko.SFTPClient.remove()` (SFTP file operations)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Path Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied file paths used in SFTP operations.
    *   **Path Allowlists:** Define and enforce allowlists of permitted directories and file names.
    *   **Secure Path Construction:** Use functions like `os.path.join()` to construct paths, but always validate the resulting path to ensure it remains within allowed boundaries.
    *   **Server-Side SFTP Restrictions:** Configure the SSH server or SFTP subsystem to restrict user access to specific directories, limiting the scope of potential path traversal attacks.
    *   **Chroot Jails (Server-Side):** Consider using chroot jails on the SSH server to confine SFTP users to a specific directory, effectively preventing access to files outside that directory.
