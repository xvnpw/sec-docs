# BUSINESS POSTURE

Paramiko is a Python implementation of the SSHv2 protocol, providing both client and server functionality. It enables secure communication between systems, primarily used for remote access, file transfer, and automation tasks.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Enable secure remote system administration and management.
  - Facilitate secure data transfer between systems.
  - Provide a robust and reliable SSH library for Python applications.
  - Support automation workflows requiring secure remote execution.
  - Offer an open-source and community-driven solution for SSH in Python.

- Most important business risks:
  - Vulnerabilities in Paramiko could lead to unauthorized access to systems relying on it.
  - Compromise of Paramiko could result in data breaches and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  - Bugs or instability in Paramiko could disrupt critical business operations that depend on SSH for remote management or data transfer.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting Paramiko's dependencies or build process could introduce malicious code.
  - Lack of timely security updates and patches could leave systems vulnerable to known exploits.

# SECURITY POSTURE

## DEPLOYMENT

Paramiko is primarily a library, so its deployment is dependent on how it's used. Here are a few deployment scenarios:

- Scenario 1: Paramiko as a library in a Python application (most common).
- Scenario 2: Paramiko used in automation scripts executed on a system.
- Scenario 3: Paramiko server used to provide SSH access to a system (less common, but possible).

Let's focus on Scenario 1: Paramiko as a library in a Python application deployed on a server.
