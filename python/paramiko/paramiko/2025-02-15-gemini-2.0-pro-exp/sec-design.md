# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a stable, well-maintained, and secure Python implementation of the SSHv2 protocol for a wide range of users and applications.
*   Maintain compatibility with a variety of operating systems and Python versions.
*   Offer a user-friendly API that simplifies secure remote interactions.
*   Ensure the library is performant and reliable for use in production environments.
*   Foster a community-driven development model with contributions from external developers.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to unauthorized access to systems using Paramiko, potentially causing significant damage to users and their data.
*   Compatibility issues with different platforms or Python versions could limit the library's adoption and usefulness.
*   Performance bottlenecks could hinder the library's ability to handle large-scale deployments or high-frequency operations.
*   Lack of maintenance or slow response to bug reports could damage the library's reputation and user trust.
*   Failure to comply with relevant security standards and best practices could expose users to legal and compliance risks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Cryptographic primitives are used for secure communication (encryption, key exchange, message authentication). Implemented using cryptography library and own implementations.
*   security control: Authentication mechanisms are implemented to verify user identities (passwords, public keys). Implemented in `paramiko.auth_handler`.
*   security control: Host key verification is performed to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Implemented in `paramiko.client.SSHClient`.
*   security control: Regular security audits and code reviews are conducted (as evidenced by the project's history and community involvement).
*   security control: Use of linters and static analysis tools (e.g., flake8, as seen in the `.github/workflows` directory).
*   security control: Automated testing suite to identify and prevent regressions (as seen in the `tests` directory).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies (e.g., `cryptography`, `bcrypt`, `pynacl`) introduces potential supply chain risks.
*   accepted risk: Some older or less common cryptographic algorithms may be supported for compatibility reasons, which could pose a risk if used improperly.
*   accepted risk: The library's complexity and the nature of SSH itself mean that undiscovered vulnerabilities may exist.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a formal vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   security control: Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to actively monitor and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   security control: Consider implementing fuzz testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in input handling.
*   security control: Provide clear documentation and guidance on secure configuration and usage of the library.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong password-based authentication with appropriate hashing and salting.
    *   Support for public key authentication using various key types (RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks (e.g., rate limiting, account lockout).
    *   Secure storage and handling of private keys.
*   Authorization:
    *   Mechanisms to control access to specific commands and resources on the remote system (e.g., through server-side configuration).
    *   Integration with existing authorization systems (e.g., PAM, LDAP) where applicable.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user-provided input to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Careful handling of escape sequences and special characters.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   Secure key exchange mechanisms (e.g., Diffie-Hellman group exchange).
    *   Proper implementation of encryption and message authentication to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
    *   Regular review and updates of cryptographic implementations to address new threats and vulnerabilities.
    *   Support for modern cryptographic standards and best practices.

    Test -- "Next" --> Build["Build Package (wheel, sdist)"]
    Build -- "Next" --> Publish["Publish to PyPI (on tag)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Code Commit:** A developer commits code changes to the Paramiko repository on GitHub.
2.  **GitHub Actions Trigger:** A push event to the repository triggers the GitHub Actions workflow.
3.  **Checkout Code:** The workflow checks out the latest code from the repository.
4.  **Setup Python:** The workflow sets up the appropriate Python environment.
5.  **Install Dependencies:** The workflow installs the necessary dependencies for building and testing Paramiko (specified in `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, etc.).
6.  **Lint:** The workflow runs a linter (flake8) to check for code style and potential errors.  This is a security control.
7.  **Test:** The workflow runs the test suite (using pytest) to ensure that the code functions correctly and that no regressions have been introduced. This is a security control.
8.  **Build Package:** If the tests pass, the workflow builds the Paramiko package into a wheel and source distribution.
9.  **Publish to PyPI:** If the build is triggered by a tag (indicating a new release), the workflow publishes the package to PyPI.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   **Linters (flake8):** Enforce code style and identify potential errors, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.
*   **Automated Testing (pytest):** Ensures code quality and helps prevent regressions, reducing the likelihood of introducing new vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** Dependencies are explicitly defined, allowing for tracking and auditing.  SCA tools should be used to monitor these.
*   **GitHub Actions:** Provides a controlled and auditable build environment.
*   **PyPI Publishing:** Requires authentication and authorization, preventing unauthorized releases.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Secure remote access to systems: Paramiko is used to access and manage remote systems, so ensuring its security is critical to preventing unauthorized access.
*   Automated tasks and workflows: Many users rely on Paramiko for automating tasks, so its reliability and stability are essential.
*   Data transfer: Paramiko is used for transferring files securely, so protecting the confidentiality and integrity of this data is important.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   **Credentials (passwords, private keys):** Highly sensitive. Must be protected at rest and in transit. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to systems.
*   **Host keys:** Moderately sensitive. Used to verify the identity of remote servers. Compromise could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Data transmitted over SSH:** Sensitivity varies depending on the specific data being transferred. Could range from non-sensitive to highly confidential.
*   **Configuration data:** Moderately sensitive. Could reveal information about the system and its security configuration.
*   **Source code:** Moderately sensitive. Could contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
