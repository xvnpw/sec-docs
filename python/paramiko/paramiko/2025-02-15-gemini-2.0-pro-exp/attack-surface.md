# Attack Surface Analysis for paramiko/paramiko

## Attack Surface: [Missing or Incorrect Host Key Verification](./attack_surfaces/missing_or_incorrect_host_key_verification.md)

*Description:* Failure to properly verify the SSH server's host key, allowing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  This is a direct misuse of Paramiko's API.
*Paramiko Contribution:* Paramiko *provides* the mechanisms for host key verification (policies, loading known hosts), and the vulnerability arises from *not using them correctly*.
*Example:*  The application uses `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()`, blindly accepting any host key. An attacker intercepts the connection.
*Impact:*  Man-in-the-middle attacks; interception of sensitive data; compromise of the SSH connection.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   *Never* use `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()` in production.
        *   Use `paramiko.RejectPolicy()` and explicitly load known host keys (`client.load_system_host_keys()` or `client.load_host_keys()`).
        *   Implement a secure mechanism for managing and updating known host keys.
        *   Handle `BadHostKeyException` appropriately (don't ignore it).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Paramiko Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_paramiko_itself.md)

*Description:*  Security flaws *within* the Paramiko library code, potentially leading to various exploits (e.g., buffer overflows, denial-of-service).
*Paramiko Contribution:* This is a *direct* vulnerability within Paramiko.
*Example:*  A buffer overflow vulnerability in Paramiko's packet handling could allow remote code execution.
*Impact:*  Varies (DoS, information disclosure, remote code execution), but can be **Critical**.
*Risk Severity:*  **Variable (High to Critical)**, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Keep Paramiko *up-to-date*. Apply security patches promptly.
        *   Use a dependency management system.
        *   Monitor security advisories and the Paramiko changelog.
        *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Key Exchange/Cipher Algorithms](./attack_surfaces/weak_key_exchangecipher_algorithms.md)

*Description:* Use of cryptographically weak key exchange or cipher algorithms during the SSH handshake, making the connection vulnerable.
*Paramiko Contribution:* Paramiko *supports* a range of algorithms. The vulnerability is in *allowing* weak ones to be used.
*Example:* The application allows `diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`.
*Impact:* Loss of confidentiality; potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Explicitly configure Paramiko to use *only* strong key exchange algorithms and ciphers (e.g., curve25519-sha256, chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com).
        *   Disable weaker algorithms. Use `Transport.get_security_options()` to inspect and modify the allowed algorithms.
        *   Regularly review and update based on current best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Handling of SSH Channels and Sessions (Resource Exhaustion)](./attack_surfaces/improper_handling_of_ssh_channels_and_sessions__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*Description:* Incorrect management of SSH channels and sessions within Paramiko, potentially leading to resource exhaustion (DoS) on either the client or the server. This is a direct misuse of the Paramiko API.
*Paramiko Contribution:* Paramiko provides the channel and session abstractions, and the vulnerability arises from not closing them properly or creating too many.
*Example:* The application creates many channels in a loop without closing them, eventually exhausting server resources.
*Impact:* Denial of Service (DoS).
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Always explicitly close channels and sessions using `channel.close()` and `client.close()`.
        *   Use `try...finally` blocks to ensure cleanup even if exceptions occur.
        *   Set appropriate timeouts to prevent indefinite hangs.
        *   Avoid creating an excessive number of channels or sessions.
