## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Weak/Default Host Key Verification (Application-Level Misconfiguration)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_weakdefault_host_key_verification__application-level_misconfiguration_.md)

Exploit: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. The attacker intercepts the connection between the application and the legitimate SSH server.  The attacker presents a forged server key. Because the application is misconfigured (e.g., using `AutoAddPolicy` in production or disabling verification entirely), it accepts the forged key, allowing the attacker to decrypt and potentially modify the traffic.
Likelihood: Medium (Common misconfiguration)
Impact: High (MITM, potential RCE)
Effort: Low (MITM setup, no exploit development)
Skill Level: Intermediate
Detection Difficulty: Hard (MITM can be subtle; relies on application not logging key mismatches)
Mitigation:
    *Never* disable host key verification (`RejectPolicy`).
    Use `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy` *only* in strictly controlled testing environments, *never* in production.
    Prefer `paramiko.WarningPolicy` or, ideally, implement a custom policy that checks against a known, trusted list of host keys.  Store this list securely.
    Log any host key mismatches.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4 Use of Weak Ciphers/MACs (Application-Level Misconfiguration or Paramiko Default)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_use_of_weak_ciphersmacs__application-level_misconfiguration_or_paramiko_default_.md)

Exploit: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. The attacker intercepts the connection and forces a downgrade to a weak cipher or MAC (e.g., DES, 3DES, RC4, MD5) that has known vulnerabilities.  The attacker then exploits these weaknesses to decrypt or modify the traffic.
Likelihood: Medium (Requires misconfiguration or outdated defaults)
Impact: Medium to High (MITM, potential data decryption/modification)
Effort: Medium (Requires MITM and knowledge of weak cipher exploits)
Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
Detection Difficulty: Hard (MITM, requires deep packet inspection)
Mitigation:
    Explicitly configure Paramiko to use *only* strong, modern ciphers and MACs (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20, SHA-256, SHA-512).
    Regularly review and update the allowed cipher/MAC list.
    Use `Transport.get_security_options()` to inspect the negotiated algorithms.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Improper Sanitization of User Input in `exec_command` (Application-Level Misconfiguration)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_improper_sanitization_of_user_input_in__exec_command___application-level_misconfiguration_.md)

Exploit: Command injection. The application uses user-supplied input (e.g., from a web form, API request) directly in the command string passed to Paramiko's `exec_command` function without proper sanitization.  The attacker injects shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `` ` ``, `$()`) to execute arbitrary commands on the target server.
Likelihood: Medium (Common programming error)
Impact: High (RCE on the target server)
Effort: Low (Requires finding an unsanitized input)
Skill Level: Intermediate
Detection Difficulty: Medium (Unusual commands might be logged; input validation failures might be detected)
Mitigation:
    *Thoroughly* sanitize *all* user-supplied input before passing it to `exec_command`.
    Use a whitelist approach (allow only known-good characters) rather than a blacklist approach.
    Consider using a dedicated library for shell escaping, if necessary.
    Avoid using user input directly in commands whenever possible.  If possible, use parameterized commands or APIs that don't involve shell execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Cryptography Library (e.g., `cryptography`, `pyca/cryptography`)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_cryptography_library__e_g____cryptography____pycacryptography__.md)

Exploit: A vulnerability is discovered and exploited in the underlying cryptography library used by Paramiko (most commonly `pyca/cryptography`). This could lead to various attacks, including key compromise, signature forgery, or decryption of data.
Likelihood: Low (Cryptography libraries are heavily scrutinized)
Impact: Very High (Could compromise all cryptographic operations)
Effort: Very High (Requires finding and exploiting a zero-day in a major library)
Skill Level: Expert
Detection Difficulty: Very Hard (Unless the vulnerability is widely known)
Mitigation:
    Keep the cryptography library up-to-date.  Implement a robust vulnerability management process.
    Subscribe to security advisories for the cryptography library.
    Use a dependency management tool to track and update dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Phishing for SSH Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_phishing_for_ssh_credentials.md)

Exploit: The attacker sends phishing emails or uses other social engineering techniques to trick a user with legitimate SSH access into providing their credentials (username, password, or private key).
Likelihood: High (Phishing is a common attack vector)
Impact: High (Gives attacker direct access)
Effort: Low (Phishing kits are readily available)
Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires user awareness and email filtering)
Mitigation:
    User education and awareness training on phishing and social engineering.
    Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for SSH access.
    Use strong, unique passwords.
    Implement email security measures (e.g., spam filtering, DMARC, DKIM, SPF).

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Compromising a Developer's Machine](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_compromising_a_developer's_machine.md)

Exploit: The attacker gains access to a developer's workstation through various means (e.g., malware, phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities).  Once compromised, the attacker steals SSH keys, credentials, source code, or other sensitive information that can be used to compromise the application or its infrastructure.
Likelihood: Low to Medium (Depends on the developer's security practices)
Impact: Very High (Could compromise the entire application)
Effort: Medium to High (Requires targeting a specific individual)
Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
Detection Difficulty: Hard (Requires detecting the initial compromise of the developer's machine)
Mitigation:
    Implement strong endpoint protection (antivirus, EDR) on developer workstations.
    Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.
    Use a secure key management system or hardware security module (HSM) to store SSH keys.
    Implement least privilege access controls.
    Regularly patch and update developer workstations.
    Conduct security awareness training for developers.
    Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromised workstation.
