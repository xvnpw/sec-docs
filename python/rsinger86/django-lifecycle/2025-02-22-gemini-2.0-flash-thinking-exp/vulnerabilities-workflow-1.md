## Combined Vulnerability List

The following vulnerability has been identified in the project.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Default Django Settings (DEBUG True and Hardcoded SECRET_KEY)

  - **Description:**
    The project’s testing settings (in `tests/settings.py`) use a hardcoded secret key and have `DEBUG` set to `True`. Although these settings are meant for test purposes only, if a publicly available instance is accidentally deployed using these insecure defaults, an external attacker can trigger detailed error pages and gain insight into the application’s internal configuration. This information may then be used to craft further attacks (for example, forging session cookies or exploiting other weaknesses based on the exposed internal state).
    - **Steps to Trigger:**
      1. Deploy the application using the settings module defined in `tests/settings.py` (where `DEBUG = True` and the secret key is hardcoded).
      2. Visit a URL that causes an unhandled exception (or any misconfigured endpoint) so that Django displays its full error page.
      3. An attacker views the debug output, which reveals sensitive information such as the SECRET_KEY, file paths, and stack traces.

  - **Impact:**
    An attacker can obtain sensitive internal details—including the hardcoded SECRET_KEY—that may allow the forging of session cookies, bypass of authentication mechanisms, or further reconnaissance to exploit other vulnerabilities in the application. The disclosure of internal error messages and configurations increases the risk of targeted attacks.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    There are no mitigations in place in the repository. The insecure settings are present in the test configuration file and are not automatically separated from production–capable configurations.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Do not deploy the test settings in a production environment.
    - Use environment variables (or a secure vault) to inject the `SECRET_KEY` at runtime rather than hardcoding it.
    - Ensure that `DEBUG` is set to `False` in production settings.
    - Clearly separate test/development settings from production settings.

  - **Preconditions:**
    The vulnerability can be exploited if a developer or system operator accidentally deploys the application using the test settings (from `tests/settings.py`) in a publicly accessible environment.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    In `tests/settings.py` the following lines expose the sensitive configuration:
    ```python
    SECRET_KEY = "o)04)%_us9ed1l7*cv&5@t(2*r#$^r7o(q^4p@y9@b20_ay_jv"
    DEBUG = True
    ```
    These hardcoded values and the enabled debug mode cause Django to emit detailed error information when an exception occurs. When `DEBUG` is set to `True` in Django, and an unhandled exception occurs during a request, Django's error handling middleware will generate a detailed HTML error page. This page includes a stack trace, local variables, and the settings that Django is currently using.  Critically, if the application is running with the test settings, this page will expose the hardcoded `SECRET_KEY`. An attacker viewing this page can simply copy the `SECRET_KEY` directly from the HTML source.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application using the `tests/settings.py` settings module (or simulate a misconfiguration that uses these settings). This can be achieved by setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to `tests.settings`.
    2. Deliberately trigger an error. A simple way to do this is to access a non-existent URL, which will cause a `Page not found` exception, or force an exception in a view by adding `raise Exception('Test Exception')` in a view function and accessing the associated URL.
    3. Using a web browser, navigate to the URL that triggers the error.
    4. Observe the error page displayed. Verify that the error page shows detailed debug information, including stack traces and Django settings.
    5. Inspect the HTML source of the error page (usually by right-clicking on the page and selecting "View Page Source" or "Inspect").
    6. Search within the HTML source for the string "SECRET_KEY". Confirm that the hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` value (`o)04)%_us9ed1l7*cv&5@t(2*r#$^r7o(q^4p@y9@b20_ay_jv`) is present and visible in the HTML source.
    7. (Optional but recommended for full validation) Attempt to use the exposed `SECRET_KEY` to forge a Django session cookie. This typically involves using a tool or script that can generate signed cookies using the `SECRET_KEY`. If successful, you should be able to use this forged cookie to access parts of the application that normally require authentication, demonstrating a compromise of session security.
