## Vulnerability list:

There are no identified vulnerabilities with a rank of high or critical in the provided project files for django-lifecycle library itself. The library provides lifecycle hooks for Django models and the code appears to be well-structured and secure in its design and implementation.

It's important to note that while no vulnerabilities are found in the library's code, improper usage of lifecycle hooks by developers in their Django applications *could* introduce security vulnerabilities. However, such vulnerabilities would be considered application-specific issues and not vulnerabilities within the `django-lifecycle` library itself, and are explicitly excluded by the problem description.

Therefore, based on the provided project files and the given constraints, there are no vulnerabilities to report for the django-lifecycle project.
