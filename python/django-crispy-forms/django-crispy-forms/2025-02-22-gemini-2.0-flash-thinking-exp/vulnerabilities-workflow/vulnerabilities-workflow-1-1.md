Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you want me to process. I need the list to be able to update it according to your instructions.

Once you provide the list, I will:

1.  **Analyze each vulnerability** in the list against your exclusion and inclusion criteria.
2.  **Filter out** the vulnerabilities that do not meet the inclusion criteria and/or meet the exclusion criteria.
3.  **Format the remaining vulnerabilities** in markdown, keeping the existing descriptions for each vulnerability section (vulnerability name, description, impact, vulnerability rank, currently implemented mitigations, missing mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, security test case).

I am ready to help as soon as you provide the vulnerability list.
