Okay, I understand the instructions.

Based on your statement that "Based on the provided project files, no new high-rank vulnerabilities have been identified in `django-crispy-forms` itself that are directly exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance, excluding developer misuse, denial-of-service, missing documentation or explicitly using insecure code patterns.", and that the vulnerability list is currently empty, I will return an empty list in markdown format as requested.
