    *   Potentially handling other background maintenance tasks.
*   **Key Technologies:**  Likely integrated with Celery Beat or a similar scheduling library within the Flask application.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Ensuring only authorized users can create or modify scheduled tasks to prevent malicious scheduling.
    *   Protecting the scheduler configuration to prevent unauthorized modification of task execution times or targets.

### 3.3. Worker Queue (Celery)

*   **Description:** A message broker facilitating asynchronous communication between the API server and worker processes.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Receiving and queuing tasks from the API server (e.g., query execution requests).
    *   Distributing tasks to available worker processes.
    *   Ensuring reliable task delivery and potentially persistence.
*   **Key Technologies:** Redis or RabbitMQ.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Access to the message broker should be restricted to authorized Redash components.
    *   Consider using authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by the message broker.
    *   Message integrity and confidentiality can be a concern; consider using secure connection protocols if sensitive data is passed in task payloads.

### 3.4. Worker (Celery)

*   **Description:** Processes tasks from the worker queue, primarily focusing on data interaction and query execution.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Connecting to configured data sources using stored credentials.
    *   Executing queries against data sources.

## 5. Deployment Architecture (Common Scenarios)

Redash deployments can vary in complexity. Here are a few common scenarios:

*   **Single Server Deployment:** All components (API server, worker, scheduler, database, cache, message broker) are installed and run on a single physical or virtual machine. This is suitable for development or small deployments but has limitations in terms of scalability and resilience.
    *   **Security Considerations:**  Increased attack surface as all components are co-located. Proper firewalling and OS-level security are crucial.
*   **Containerized Deployment (Docker/Kubernetes):** Each component is packaged as a Docker container and orchestrated using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. This offers better scalability, isolation, and easier management.
    *   **Security Considerations:**  Container security becomes important (e.g., image scanning, resource limits). Network policies within the container orchestration platform are crucial for isolating components. Secrets management for database and data source credentials needs careful consideration.
*   **Cloud-Based Deployment:** Leveraging cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for managed databases, message queues, and container orchestration. This offers high availability and scalability.
    *   **Security Considerations:**  Leveraging cloud provider security features (e.g., IAM, security groups, managed secrets). Understanding the shared responsibility model for security in the cloud is essential. Secure configuration of cloud resources is critical.

## 6. Security Considerations (Component-Specific)
