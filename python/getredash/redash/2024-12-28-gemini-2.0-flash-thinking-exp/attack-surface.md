Here's the updated key attack surface list focusing on high and critical elements directly involving Redash:

*   **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection via the Query Editor
    *   **Description:** Malicious SQL code is injected through the Redash query editor and executed against the connected database.
    *   **How Redash Contributes:** Redash's core functionality involves allowing users to write and execute SQL queries against configured data sources. The query editor is a direct input point for SQL.
    *   **Example:** A user with query creation privileges crafts a query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1'; --` which could bypass authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive data), data modification or deletion, potential for command execution on the database server depending on database permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent direct injection of SQL. Enforce strict input validation and sanitization on any user-provided input that becomes part of the SQL query.
        *   **Users:** Grant the least privilege necessary to users creating queries. Regularly review and audit queries for suspicious activity.

*   **Attack Surface:** API Key Exposure
    *   **Description:** Redash API keys, used for programmatic access, are exposed to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **How Redash Contributes:** Redash uses API keys for authentication when accessing the application programmatically. These keys grant significant access to Redash's functionality.
    *   **Example:** An API key is accidentally committed to a public code repository, or a user shares their API key insecurely.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Redash data, dashboards, and queries. Potential for malicious actions like data exfiltration, modification, or deletion via the API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Store API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables or secrets management). Implement proper API key generation and rotation mechanisms. Provide granular API key scopes to limit access.
        *   **Users:** Treat API keys as highly sensitive credentials. Avoid storing them in code or easily accessible locations. Regularly regenerate API keys. Utilize API key scopes to restrict access to only necessary resources.

*   **Attack Surface:** Data Source Credential Leakage
    *   **Description:** Credentials used by Redash to connect to data sources are compromised.
    *   **How Redash Contributes:** Redash needs to store credentials for various data sources to execute queries. Vulnerabilities in how these credentials are stored or managed can lead to leakage.
    *   **Example:** Data source credentials are stored in plain text in the Redash database or configuration files, or are exposed through error messages or logs.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the underlying data sources, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion outside of Redash.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Store data source credentials securely using encryption at rest. Implement robust access controls on the credential storage. Avoid logging or exposing credentials in error messages.
        *   **Users:** Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring data source connections. Regularly review and update data source credentials.
