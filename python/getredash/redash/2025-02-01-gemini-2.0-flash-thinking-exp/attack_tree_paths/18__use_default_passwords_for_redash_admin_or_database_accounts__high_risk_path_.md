### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Use Default Passwords for Redash Admin or Database Accounts

#### 4.1 Detailed Description of the Attack Vector

The "Use Default Passwords for Redash Admin or Database Accounts" attack vector exploits a common security oversight: the failure to change default credentials after software installation or deployment.  Attackers are aware that many systems and applications are shipped with well-known default usernames and passwords for administrative and service accounts. They leverage this knowledge to gain unauthorized access.

In the context of Redash, this attack vector can manifest in several ways:

*   **Redash Admin Account:** During the initial setup of Redash, an administrator account is created. If the default username (often `admin`) and password are not changed, attackers can easily guess or find these credentials through public documentation, online forums, or automated scripts.
*   **Database Accounts:** Redash relies on a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store its data.  Default credentials might exist at several levels:
    *   **Database Administrator Account (e.g., `postgres`, `root`):**  If the underlying database server is not properly secured, default database administrator credentials could be vulnerable. While Redash itself might not directly expose these, compromise of the server hosting Redash could lead to access to the database server.
    *   **Redash Database User Account:**  The user account that Redash uses to connect to its database might also have default credentials if not properly configured during deployment.  While less likely to be a *well-known* default, weak or easily guessable passwords in this context also fall under the broader category of poor credential management.

**Attack Scenario:**

1.  **Reconnaissance:** An attacker identifies a publicly accessible Redash instance (e.g., through Shodan, Censys, or general web crawling).
2.  **Credential Guessing:** The attacker attempts to log in to the Redash web interface using common default usernames like `admin`, `administrator`, or `redash` and associated default passwords such as `password`, `admin`, `123456`, `redash`, or `changeme`. They may also consult public lists of default credentials.
3.  **Database Access Attempt (Indirect):** If the Redash web interface is not directly vulnerable, the attacker might attempt to identify the underlying database server (if exposed) and try default credentials for database administrator accounts (e.g., `postgres`/`postgres`, `root`/`password`). This is less direct but possible if the Redash environment is not properly segmented.
4.  **Successful Login:** If default credentials are still in use, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the Redash application as an administrator or potentially to the underlying database.
5.  **Exploitation:** Once logged in, the attacker can perform various malicious actions depending on the level of access gained (see "Potential Impact" below).

#### 4.2 Potential Impact (Deep Dive)

Exploiting default passwords in Redash or its database can have severe consequences, leading to a range of critical impacts:

*   **Data Breach and Confidentiality Loss:**
    *   **Access to Sensitive Data:** Redash is designed to visualize and analyze data, often including sensitive business information, customer data, financial records, or operational metrics.  Admin access allows attackers to view, download, and exfiltrate this data.
    *   **Exposure of Database Credentials:** If database credentials are compromised, attackers gain direct access to the underlying database, potentially bypassing Redash security controls and accessing all stored data.
*   **Data Manipulation and Integrity Compromise:**
    *   **Dashboard and Report Tampering:** Attackers can modify dashboards and reports within Redash to present misleading information, disrupt operations, or sabotage decision-making processes.
    *   **Data Source Modification:**  Attackers could alter data source configurations, potentially injecting malicious queries or redirecting Redash to attacker-controlled data sources.
    *   **Data Deletion or Corruption:**  In the worst case, attackers with database access could delete or corrupt critical data, leading to data loss and operational disruption.
*   **System and Service Disruption (Availability Impact):**
    *   **Redash Service Disruption:** Attackers could disable or disrupt the Redash service, preventing legitimate users from accessing dashboards and reports.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Malicious queries or resource-intensive operations initiated by attackers could overload the Redash server or database, leading to performance degradation or denial of service.
*   **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:**
    *   **Server Compromise:** If database credentials are compromised, attackers might be able to leverage database access to gain access to the underlying server hosting Redash and the database. This could facilitate further attacks and lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Account Takeover:**  Compromising the Redash admin account allows attackers to create new administrative accounts, further solidifying their control and potentially locking out legitimate administrators.
*   **Reputational Damage and Compliance Violations:**
    *   **Loss of Customer Trust:** A data breach resulting from default password exploitation can severely damage an organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
    *   **Regulatory Fines and Penalties:**  Failure to secure sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access can lead to significant fines and penalties under data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA).

#### 4.3 Recommended Mitigations (Detailed and Actionable)

The primary focus must be on **Preventing Default Credentials Usage**.  Account lockout policies are a secondary, less effective measure in this context.

**Prevent Default Credentials Usage (Primary Focus):**

*   **Mandatory Password Change on First Login (Critical):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Force users to change default passwords immediately upon their first login to Redash and database accounts. This should be a mandatory step during the initial setup process.
    *   **Technical Enforcement:** Redash setup scripts and database configuration should be designed to enforce this requirement. For example, Redash could display a prominent prompt to change the default admin password upon first access. Database setup scripts should similarly require password setting during initial user creation.
*   **Secure Password Generation and Enforcement (Critical):**
    *   **Password Complexity Policies:** Implement and enforce strong password complexity requirements for all Redash and database accounts. This includes minimum length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and preventing the use of common words or patterns.
    *   **Password Strength Meters:** Integrate password strength meters into the Redash user interface during password creation to guide users in choosing strong passwords.
    *   **Discourage Default Password Usage:**  Clearly communicate the risks of using default passwords to users during setup and ongoing security awareness training.
*   **Automated Password Generation (Best Practice):**
    *   **Consider Automated Password Generation:** For service accounts (like the Redash database user), consider using automated password generation tools during deployment to create strong, unique passwords that are securely stored and managed (e.g., using secrets management systems).
*   **Regular Password Audits and Reviews (Proactive Security):**
    *   **Periodic Password Audits:** Implement regular password audits to identify weak or default passwords that might have been inadvertently set or remain unchanged. Tools can be used to scan for common default passwords.
    *   **Password Rotation Policies:**  Establish password rotation policies for administrative and service accounts, requiring periodic password changes (while balancing usability and security).
*   **Secure Deployment and Configuration Practices (Foundation):**
    *   **Secure Installation Procedures:**  Develop and document secure installation procedures for Redash and its database, emphasizing the importance of changing default credentials as a critical step.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to automate the secure deployment and configuration of Redash, including password management and secure settings.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Incorporate security best practices into IaC templates to ensure that Redash deployments are consistently secure from the outset.

**Account Lockout Policies (Secondary Mitigation - Less Effective for Default Passwords):**

*   **Implement Account Lockout Policies (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts to the Redash web interface and database access points to slow down brute-force attacks.
    *   **Account Lockout Thresholds:** Configure account lockout policies to temporarily disable accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    *   **Lockout Duration:** Define an appropriate lockout duration to deter attackers while minimizing disruption to legitimate users.
    *   **Caution:** While account lockout can help against brute-force attacks, it is less effective against attackers who are specifically targeting *default* credentials, as they may try a limited set of well-known defaults rather than extensive brute-forcing.  Changing default passwords remains the primary and most effective mitigation.

**Additional Recommendations:**

*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate users and administrators about the risks associated with default passwords and the importance of strong password practices.
*   **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct periodic security assessments, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and address potential weaknesses in Redash deployments, including default credential vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious login attempts, account lockouts, and other security-related events that might indicate an attack.

#### 4.4 Risk Assessment and Prioritization

The "Use Default Passwords for Redash Admin or Database Accounts" attack path is classified as **HIGH RISK**.  This is due to:

*   **High Likelihood of Exploitation:** Default passwords are a well-known and easily exploitable vulnerability. Attackers actively scan for and target systems with default credentials.
*   **Critical Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, data manipulation, system disruption, and reputational damage.
*   **Ease of Mitigation:**  The mitigations are relatively straightforward and cost-effective to implement, primarily involving configuration changes and secure deployment practices.

**Prioritization:** Addressing this attack path should be a **HIGH PRIORITY** for the development and operations teams.  Implementing mandatory password changes and secure deployment practices should be considered essential security controls for any Redash deployment.
