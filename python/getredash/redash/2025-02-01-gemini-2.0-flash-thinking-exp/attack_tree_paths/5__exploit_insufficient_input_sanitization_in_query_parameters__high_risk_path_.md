### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Insufficient Input Sanitization in Query Parameters

#### 4.1. Understanding Insufficient Input Sanitization

Insufficient input sanitization occurs when an application fails to properly validate, filter, or encode user-provided input before using it in a security-sensitive context, such as constructing database queries. In the context of Redash, this means that if user-supplied parameters within a query are not adequately sanitized, an attacker can manipulate these parameters to inject malicious code into the query itself.

**Why is this a problem in Redash?**

Redash is designed to allow users to create and execute queries against various data sources. This inherently involves taking user input (the query itself, and potentially parameters within the query) and using it to interact with databases. If Redash relies on simply concatenating user input directly into query strings without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to query injection.

**Example Scenario (Illustrative - Specific Redash implementation needs verification):**

Imagine a Redash query that allows users to filter results based on a parameter named `user_id`.  The query might be constructed something like this (pseudocode):

```
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + user_provided_user_id_parameter;
execute_query(query);
```

If `user_provided_user_id_parameter` is taken directly from user input without sanitization, an attacker could provide a malicious value like:

```
1 OR 1=1 --
```

This would result in the following query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1 --
```

The `--` is a SQL comment, effectively removing anything after it. The `OR 1=1` condition is always true, causing the query to return all rows from the `users` table, bypassing the intended filtering and potentially exposing sensitive data.

More sophisticated attacks can involve:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Using `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from other tables or databases.
*   **Data Modification:** Using `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements to modify or delete data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some database systems, attackers might be able to execute stored procedures or system commands with elevated privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** Crafting queries that consume excessive resources and cause the database or Redash application to become unresponsive.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Techniques

Attackers can exploit insufficient input sanitization in Redash query parameters through various interfaces:

*   **Query Editor:** Directly injecting malicious code into parameters within queries written in the Redash query editor.
*   **API Endpoints:**  If Redash exposes API endpoints that accept query parameters (e.g., for executing queries programmatically or embedding dashboards), these can be targeted.
*   **Embedded Dashboards/Visualizations:** If parameters are passed through URLs or embedded code to dashboards or visualizations, these can also be manipulated.

**Common Query Injection Techniques:**

*   **SQL Injection (if using SQL databases):**
    *   **UNION-based SQL Injection:**  Used to retrieve data from different tables by appending `UNION SELECT` statements.
    *   **Boolean-based Blind SQL Injection:**  Used to infer information by observing the application's response to true/false conditions injected into the query.
    *   **Time-based Blind SQL Injection:**  Similar to boolean-based, but relies on time delays introduced by injected SQL code (e.g., using `SLEEP()` function).
    *   **Error-based SQL Injection:**  Exploiting database error messages to extract information about the database structure or data.
    *   **Second-Order SQL Injection:**  Malicious input is stored in the database and later used in a vulnerable query without proper sanitization.
*   **NoSQL Injection (if using NoSQL databases):**  Depending on the NoSQL database and query language used by Redash, similar injection techniques can be employed, although the syntax and methods will differ. For example, in MongoDB, attackers might inject malicious JavaScript code or manipulate query operators.

#### 4.3. Potential Impact

Successful exploitation of insufficient input sanitization in query parameters can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, financial information, business secrets, etc.
*   **Data Manipulation/Integrity Loss:**  Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to inaccurate reports, business disruption, and potential financial losses.
*   **Account Takeover:**  In some cases, attackers might be able to manipulate queries to gain access to other user accounts or even administrative accounts.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Resource-intensive queries can be injected to overload the database or Redash server, causing service disruptions.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  A security breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Redash, leading to loss of customer trust and business opportunities.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Data breaches can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and significant fines.

#### 4.4. Recommended Mitigations

To effectively mitigate the risk of query injection due to insufficient input sanitization, the following mitigations are recommended for the Redash development team:

*   **Input Validation (Strongly Recommended):**
    *   **Whitelist Validation:** Define allowed characters, data types, formats, and lengths for each input parameter. Reject any input that does not conform to these rules.
    *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that input parameters are of the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, date).
    *   **Format Validation:**  Validate input against specific formats (e.g., email address, phone number, date format).
    *   **Length Validation:**  Limit the length of input parameters to prevent buffer overflows or excessively long queries.
    *   **Contextual Validation:**  Validate input based on the context in which it is used. For example, if a parameter is expected to be a user ID, validate that it corresponds to a valid user ID format.

    **Example (Conceptual - Python/Redash context):**

    ```python
    def sanitize_user_id(user_id_param):
        if not isinstance(user_id_param, str) or not user_id_param.isdigit():
            raise ValueError("Invalid user_id format")
        return int(user_id_param) # Convert to integer after validation

    try:
        user_id = sanitize_user_id(request.args.get('user_id'))
        query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}" # Still consider parameterized queries for best practice
        # ... execute query ...
    except ValueError as e:
        # Handle invalid input error
        return "Invalid user ID", 400
    ```

*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) (Strongly Recommended):**
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries:**  Instead of concatenating user input directly into query strings, use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the database driver. This separates the query structure from the user-provided data.
    *   **Database Driver Responsibility:** Parameterized queries rely on the database driver to handle the proper escaping and sanitization of parameters, preventing injection.

    **Example (Conceptual - Python with database driver):**

    ```python
    user_id = request.args.get('user_id') # Input validation still needed!

    # Assuming using a database library like psycopg2 for PostgreSQL
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s" # %s is a placeholder
    cursor.execute(query, (user_id,)) # Pass user_id as a parameter
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    ```

*   **Output Encoding (Context-Aware) (Less Directly Applicable to Query Injection, but Good Practice):**
    *   While primarily for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention, context-aware output encoding can indirectly help in some cases. If user input is reflected back in error messages or logs that are later used in queries (though this is less common for query injection itself), encoding can prevent injection in those scenarios.
    *   **Focus on Input Sanitization and Parameterized Queries as primary defenses against Query Injection.**

*   **Least Privilege Principle:**
    *   **Database User Permissions:** Ensure that the database user Redash uses to connect to the database has only the minimum necessary privileges required for its functionality. Avoid granting excessive permissions that could be exploited in case of a successful query injection attack.

*   **Code Reviews (Crucial):**
    *   **Dedicated Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where user input is processed and incorporated into database queries.
    *   **Security Focus:** Train developers to identify and address potential input sanitization vulnerabilities during code reviews.
    *   **Automated Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automatically detect potential code vulnerabilities, including input sanitization issues.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Deploy a WAF:**  A WAF can provide an additional layer of security by inspecting HTTP requests and responses for malicious patterns, including common query injection attempts.
    *   **WAF Rules:** Configure WAF rules to detect and block suspicious query parameters and SQL injection payloads.

*   **Regular Security Testing:**
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities, including query injection flaws.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in Redash and its dependencies.

#### 4.5. Conclusion

Insufficient input sanitization in query parameters represents a **high-risk vulnerability** in Redash that can lead to severe security breaches through query injection attacks.  **Prioritizing input validation and the adoption of parameterized queries are critical steps** to mitigate this risk effectively.  The development team should implement these mitigations promptly and incorporate secure coding practices into their development lifecycle to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. Regular code reviews, security testing, and the principle of least privilege are also essential components of a robust security strategy for Redash.
