### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Trick Redash Users into Revealing Credentials

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Name: Trick Redash Users into Revealing Credentials

This attack vector directly targets the human element of security. It bypasses technical security controls by manipulating users into willingly providing their credentials, effectively granting attackers legitimate access to the Redash application.

#### 4.2. Description Breakdown and Elaboration

**Description:** "Attackers employ various social engineering tricks and manipulations to deceive Redash users into willingly providing their login credentials."

This description highlights the core tactic: **social engineering**. Attackers are not attempting to exploit software vulnerabilities in Redash directly in this path. Instead, they are focusing on exploiting human psychology and trust to gain access.

**Elaboration on Social Engineering Tricks and Manipulations:**

Attackers can employ a wide range of social engineering techniques to trick Redash users. These can be categorized into several common approaches:

*   **Phishing:** This is the most prevalent technique. Attackers create deceptive communications (emails, messages, websites) that mimic legitimate Redash login pages or communications from trusted sources (e.g., Redash administrators, IT department).
    *   **Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing attacks aimed at specific individuals or groups within the Redash user base, often leveraging publicly available information to make the attack more convincing. For example, an attacker might impersonate a manager requesting access to a specific dashboard.
    *   **Whaling:** Phishing attacks targeting high-profile individuals within the organization, such as executives or data officers, who may have elevated privileges within Redash.
    *   **Smishing (SMS Phishing):** Phishing attacks conducted via SMS messages, potentially directing users to fake Redash login pages on mobile devices.
    *   **Vishing (Voice Phishing):** Phishing attacks conducted over voice calls, where attackers impersonate support staff or administrators to trick users into revealing credentials verbally.

*   **Baiting:** Offering something enticing (e.g., free software, access to exclusive data, help with a Redash issue) in exchange for credentials. This could involve fake download links or support requests that lead to credential-harvesting pages.

*   **Pretexting:** Creating a fabricated scenario or pretext to gain the user's trust and elicit credentials. For example, an attacker might impersonate a Redash support technician claiming to need credentials to troubleshoot an issue.

*   **Quid Pro Quo:** Offering a service or benefit in exchange for credentials. Similar to baiting, but often framed as a reciprocal exchange. For example, offering "technical support" for Redash in exchange for login details.

*   **Watering Hole Attacks (Indirectly related):** While not directly tricking users into *revealing* credentials, compromising a website frequently visited by Redash users could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that steal credentials when users log in to Redash through that compromised network.

**Redash Specific Scenarios:**

Attackers might tailor their social engineering attacks to the Redash context:

*   **Fake Dashboard Sharing Requests:**  Sending emails that appear to be legitimate Redash dashboard sharing requests, but the link leads to a phishing page mimicking the Redash login.
*   **Urgent Data Access Requests:** Impersonating a manager or executive requesting urgent access to Redash data and asking for credentials to "expedite" the process.
*   **Redash System Maintenance Notifications:** Sending fake notifications about system maintenance requiring users to re-authenticate via a provided link (phishing).
*   **Help Desk Impersonation for Redash Issues:**  Impersonating Redash support to "help" users with a supposed issue, requesting credentials to "verify" their account.

#### 4.3. Potential Impact Expansion

**Potential Impact:** "Leads directly to Phishing/Credential Harvesting and its impacts."

While the description correctly identifies phishing/credential harvesting as the immediate impact, the *consequences* of successful credential theft in a Redash environment can be significant and far-reaching:

*   **Unauthorized Data Access and Exfiltration:**  Attackers gain access to sensitive data stored and visualized within Redash. This could include business intelligence data, customer information, financial data, and other confidential information. Data can be exfiltrated for malicious purposes, including sale on the dark web, competitive advantage, or reputational damage.
*   **Data Manipulation and Integrity Compromise:**  Attackers with compromised credentials can not only view data but also potentially modify or delete dashboards, queries, and data sources within Redash. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Falsification:**  Altering data visualizations to misrepresent information, potentially leading to incorrect business decisions.
    *   **Denial of Service (Data):**  Deleting critical dashboards or data sources, disrupting business operations and data analysis capabilities.
    *   **Planting Backdoors:**  Creating malicious dashboards or queries that could be used for further attacks or to maintain persistent access.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised Redash accounts might be used as a stepping stone to gain access to other systems within the organization's network, especially if users reuse passwords across multiple platforms.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A data breach resulting from compromised Redash credentials can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the type of data accessed (e.g., PII, financial data), a breach could lead to violations of data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and significant fines.
*   **Business Disruption:**  The consequences of data breaches and system compromise can lead to significant business disruption, requiring incident response, system recovery, and potential downtime.

**In summary, the impact extends far beyond simple credential theft and can have severe consequences for data security, business operations, and organizational reputation.**

#### 4.4. Recommended Mitigations Deep Dive

**Recommended Mitigations:**

*   **User Security Awareness (Primary Focus):** All mitigations for Social Engineering and Phishing directly prevent this attack step.
*   **Promote Secure Password Practices:** Encourage users to use strong, unique passwords and password managers, and to be cautious about where they enter their credentials.

**Deep Dive and Actionable Steps:**

**4.4.1. User Security Awareness (Primary Focus):**

This is the *most critical* mitigation for this attack path.  A robust user security awareness program is essential to educate Redash users about social engineering threats and how to recognize and avoid them.

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Regular Security Awareness Training:** Implement mandatory, recurring security awareness training for all Redash users. This training should specifically cover:
    *   **What is Social Engineering and Phishing?** Explain the concepts in clear, non-technical language.
    *   **Recognizing Phishing Emails and Websites:** Teach users to identify red flags in emails and websites, such as:
        *   Suspicious sender addresses (look-alike domains, generic public email addresses).
        *   Generic greetings ("Dear User" instead of personalized names).
        *   Urgent or threatening language.
        *   Requests for sensitive information (passwords, credentials, personal data).
        *   Links to unfamiliar or suspicious URLs (hover over links to preview the actual destination).
        *   Grammatical errors and typos.
        *   Inconsistencies in branding or logos.
    *   **Redash Specific Phishing Scenarios:**  Include examples of phishing attacks tailored to Redash users, such as fake dashboard sharing requests or system maintenance notifications (as mentioned in 4.2).
    *   **Safe Password Practices:** Reinforce the importance of strong, unique passwords and password managers (covered in more detail below).
    *   **Reporting Suspicious Activity:**  Clearly define the process for users to report suspicious emails, messages, or websites. Encourage reporting and assure users that reporting is encouraged and will be taken seriously.
    *   **Consequences of Credential Compromise:**  Explain the potential impact of falling victim to social engineering attacks, both for the organization and for the individual user.
*   **Phishing Simulations:** Conduct regular, simulated phishing attacks to test user awareness and identify areas for improvement in training. Track click rates and reporting rates to measure the effectiveness of the program.
*   **Communication and Reminders:**  Regularly communicate security awareness messages to users through various channels (email newsletters, intranet announcements, posters, etc.). Reinforce key security tips and provide updates on emerging threats.
*   **"Think Before You Click" Culture:**  Promote a security-conscious culture where users are encouraged to be skeptical and "think before they click" on links or open attachments, especially in unsolicited communications.

**4.4.2. Promote Secure Password Practices:**

While user awareness is primary, strong password practices are a crucial secondary defense layer. Even if a user is tricked into entering their credentials on a fake page, a strong, unique password can limit the damage if that password is not reused elsewhere.

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Password Complexity Requirements:** Enforce strong password complexity requirements for Redash accounts (minimum length, character types, etc.).
*   **Password Rotation Policy (Considered but with Caution):**  While mandatory password rotation was once a common recommendation, modern security guidance often advises against it, as it can lead to users creating weaker, predictable passwords.  Consider password rotation policies carefully and prioritize password complexity and uniqueness.
*   **Discourage Password Reuse:**  Educate users about the dangers of password reuse across different accounts. Emphasize that if a password is compromised on one site, it can be used to access other accounts if the same password is used.
*   **Promote Password Managers:**  Strongly encourage the use of password managers. Password managers help users create and store strong, unique passwords for each account, reducing the burden of remembering complex passwords and mitigating the risk of password reuse. Provide guidance and potentially organizational recommendations for reputable password managers.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - *Crucially Important and Should be a Primary Mitigation, not Secondary*:**  **MFA is a critical mitigation and should be considered a primary defense against credential compromise, not just a secondary measure.**  Implementing MFA for Redash logins adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords. Even if an attacker obtains a user's password through social engineering, they will still need a second factor (e.g., a code from a mobile app, a hardware token) to gain access. **MFA significantly reduces the risk of successful credential-based attacks.**

#### 4.5. Additional Mitigations

Beyond the recommended mitigations, consider these additional security measures to further strengthen defenses against this attack path:

*   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - *Reiterated as Primary*:** As mentioned above, MFA is paramount. Enable and enforce MFA for all Redash user accounts. This is arguably the most effective technical control to mitigate the impact of compromised credentials.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing, including social engineering testing, to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in user awareness and security controls.
*   **Network Security Controls:** Implement network security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and web application firewalls (WAF) to detect and block malicious traffic and attempts to access Redash from suspicious locations.
*   **Endpoint Security:** Ensure users' devices are protected with up-to-date antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and operating system patches to reduce the risk of malware infections that could lead to credential theft.
*   **Email Security Solutions:** Implement email security solutions (e.g., spam filters, phishing detection, DMARC, DKIM, SPF) to reduce the likelihood of phishing emails reaching users' inboxes.
*   **URL Filtering and Web Security Gateways:** Use URL filtering and web security gateways to block access to known phishing websites and malicious domains.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan that includes procedures for handling suspected credential compromise and data breaches.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring of Redash user activity, including login attempts, data access, and query execution. This can help detect suspicious activity and potential breaches.
*   **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts and account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks and limit the impact of compromised credentials.
*   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Patching of Redash:** While this attack path focuses on social engineering, ensure the Redash application itself is regularly scanned for vulnerabilities and patched promptly to prevent attackers from exploiting technical weaknesses as an alternative entry point.

#### 4.6. Risk Assessment (Reiteration)

**HIGH RISK PATH:** The "Trick Redash Users into Revealing Credentials" path is correctly classified as a **HIGH RISK PATH**. This is because:

*   **High Likelihood:** Social engineering attacks are increasingly sophisticated and effective, making it highly likely that users can be tricked, especially if security awareness is lacking.
*   **High Impact:** As detailed in section 4.3, the potential impact of successful credential compromise in Redash is significant, ranging from data breaches and financial losses to reputational damage and compliance violations.
*   **Bypasses Technical Controls:** This attack path directly circumvents technical security measures by exploiting the human element, making it a particularly dangerous vulnerability.

#### 4.7. Conclusion

The "Trick Redash Users into Revealing Credentials" attack path represents a significant security risk for Redash deployments.  While Redash itself may be secure from technical vulnerabilities, the human element remains a critical attack vector.

**Addressing this risk requires a multi-layered approach with a strong emphasis on user security awareness and robust security controls.**  Implementing the recommended mitigations, particularly **user security awareness training, promoting secure password practices, and crucially, enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, is essential to significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of successful attacks through this path.

**Actionable Recommendations for Development Team and Redash Administrators:**
