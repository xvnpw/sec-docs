### 4. Deep Analysis of "Exploit Weak Credential Storage" Attack Path

This attack path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how Redash manages and protects data source credentials.  Successful exploitation can grant attackers unauthorized access to sensitive data sources connected to Redash.

**4.1. Potential Vulnerabilities and Attack Scenarios:**

Based on general security principles and common web application vulnerabilities, we can identify several potential weaknesses in Redash's credential storage that attackers could exploit:

*   **4.1.1. Weak or No Encryption:**
    *   **Description:** Redash might store data source credentials without encryption or using weak, outdated encryption algorithms (e.g., easily reversible ciphers, insufficient key length).
    *   **Attack Scenario:**
        1.  Attacker gains unauthorized access to the Redash server's file system or database (e.g., through server-side vulnerabilities, compromised accounts, or misconfigurations).
        2.  Attacker locates the credential storage location (configuration files, database tables).
        3.  If credentials are not encrypted or weakly encrypted, the attacker can easily decrypt or reverse the encryption to obtain plaintext credentials.
    *   **Redash Specific Considerations:**  Investigate how Redash stores connection strings and passwords. Does it use any encryption by default? If so, what algorithm and key management are employed? Are there options to disable encryption or use weaker methods?

*   **4.1.2. Insecure Storage Locations:**
    *   **Description:** Credentials might be stored in easily accessible locations, such as:
        *   **Plain Text Configuration Files:** Storing credentials directly in configuration files (e.g., `settings.py`, `.env` files) without proper access controls.
        *   **Web-Accessible Directories:** Placing configuration files containing credentials in directories accessible via the web server (e.g., `/static/`, `/public/`).
        *   **Unprotected Database Tables:** Storing credentials in database tables without proper access controls or encryption.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**
        1.  Attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain read access to the Redash server's file system or database (e.g., Local File Inclusion, Directory Traversal, SQL Injection).
        2.  Attacker navigates to the insecure storage location and retrieves the configuration file or database record containing credentials.
        3.  Credentials are exposed due to the insecure storage location.
    *   **Redash Specific Considerations:**  Examine Redash's deployment practices and default configurations. Where are configuration files typically located? Are there any recommendations for secure storage locations in the documentation? Are database access controls properly configured by default?

*   **4.1.3. Credential Leakage through Code Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Redash's codebase could unintentionally expose credentials:
        *   **Logging Sensitive Information:**  Accidentally logging credentials in plaintext in application logs, error messages, or debugging output.
        *   **Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities like Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Path Traversal, or insecure API endpoints could be exploited to leak configuration files or database contents containing credentials.
        *   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities:**  SQL Injection, Command Injection, or other injection vulnerabilities could allow attackers to query the database directly and extract credential information.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**
        1.  Attacker identifies and exploits a code vulnerability in Redash.
        2.  The vulnerability allows the attacker to access sensitive information, including logs, configuration files, or database contents.
        3.  Credentials are leaked through the exploited vulnerability.
    *   **Redash Specific Considerations:**  Analyze Redash's codebase for potential logging of sensitive data, information disclosure points, and injection vulnerabilities, especially in modules related to data source management and connection handling.

*   **4.1.4. Weak Key Management:**
    *   **Description:** Even if encryption is used, weak key management practices can undermine its effectiveness:
        *   **Hardcoded Encryption Keys:** Storing encryption keys directly in the codebase or configuration files.
        *   **Same Key for All Deployments:** Using a single, default encryption key across all Redash installations.
        *   **Insecure Key Storage:** Storing encryption keys in the same insecure locations as the encrypted credentials themselves.
        *   **Lack of Key Rotation:** Not regularly rotating encryption keys, increasing the risk of key compromise over time.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**
        1.  Attacker gains access to the Redash codebase or configuration files.
        2.  Attacker extracts the hardcoded or insecurely stored encryption key.
        3.  Attacker uses the key to decrypt the encrypted credentials.
    *   **Redash Specific Considerations:**  Investigate how Redash manages encryption keys (if encryption is used). Are keys generated dynamically? Are they stored securely (e.g., using dedicated secrets management solutions)? Is key rotation implemented or recommended?

**4.2. Potential Impact:**

Successful exploitation of weak credential storage leads directly to **Data Source Credential Theft**, as outlined in the attack tree. The impacts of this are significant:

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers gain full access to the data sources connected to Redash. This can include sensitive customer data, financial records, intellectual property, and other confidential information.
*   **Data Breach and Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate large volumes of data from the compromised data sources, leading to data breaches and regulatory compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Data Manipulation and Integrity Compromise:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the data sources, compromising data integrity and potentially disrupting business operations.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised data source credentials can be used to pivot and gain access to other systems and resources within the organization's network.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A data breach resulting from weak credential storage can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
*   **Financial Losses:**  Data breaches can lead to significant financial losses due to regulatory fines, legal fees, remediation costs, and loss of business.
