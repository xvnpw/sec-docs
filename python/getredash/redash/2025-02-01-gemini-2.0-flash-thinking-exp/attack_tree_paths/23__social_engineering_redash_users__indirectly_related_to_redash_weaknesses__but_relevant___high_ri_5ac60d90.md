### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Social Engineering Redash Users

**Attack Vector Name:** Social Engineering Redash Users

**Description:** Attackers target Redash users through social engineering tactics, such as phishing, to trick them into revealing their credentials or performing malicious actions. While not a direct Redash vulnerability, it's a significant threat to any system with human users.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors & Redash Context:**

*   **Phishing (Email, Spear Phishing, Whaling):**
    *   **Email Phishing (Mass Phishing):** Attackers send mass emails disguised as legitimate Redash notifications or communications (e.g., password reset requests, dashboard sharing notifications, system alerts). These emails contain malicious links leading to fake Redash login pages designed to steal credentials.
        *   **Redash Context:** Attackers might mimic Redash's email templates (if publicly available or through reconnaissance) or create generic-looking emails related to data visualization or business intelligence to lure users.
    *   **Spear Phishing (Targeted Phishing):** Attackers research specific Redash users (e.g., administrators, data analysts, executives) and craft highly personalized phishing emails. These emails might reference specific dashboards, data sources, or projects within Redash to increase credibility.
        *   **Redash Context:** Attackers could leverage publicly available information (e.g., LinkedIn profiles, company websites) to identify Redash users and their roles. They might also try to infer user roles based on publicly accessible Redash instances (if any) or through social media mentions.
    *   **Whaling (Executive Phishing):** Spear phishing attacks targeting high-profile individuals within the organization who likely have access to sensitive data through Redash.
        *   **Redash Context:**  Executives might use Redash to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and business metrics. Compromising their accounts could provide access to highly sensitive strategic information.

*   **Pretexting:** Attackers create a fabricated scenario (pretext) to trick users into divulging information or performing actions.
    *   **Redash Context:** An attacker might impersonate Redash support staff or IT personnel, contacting users via phone or email claiming there's a problem with their Redash account or a data source connection. They might request login credentials or ask users to perform actions that compromise security (e.g., disabling security features, granting unauthorized access).

*   **Baiting:** Attackers offer something enticing (bait) to lure users into a trap.
    *   **Redash Context:** Attackers could leave USB drives labeled "Redash Dashboards" or "Company Data Analysis" in common areas, hoping users will plug them into their computers. These drives could contain malware designed to steal credentials or compromise the system.  Less likely in a purely web-based context, but still a possibility if users access Redash from company-managed workstations.

*   **Quid Pro Quo:** Attackers offer a service or benefit in exchange for information or access.
    *   **Redash Context:** An attacker might impersonate IT support and call users offering "help" with Redash performance issues or data connection problems. In exchange for this "help," they might ask for login credentials or remote access to the user's machine.

*   **Watering Hole Attacks (Indirectly related to Redash users):** Attackers compromise websites frequently visited by Redash users (e.g., internal company portals, industry news sites). When users visit these compromised websites, their browsers can be exploited to install malware or steal credentials.
    *   **Redash Context:** If Redash users regularly visit specific websites for work-related purposes, these websites could be targeted to indirectly compromise Redash user accounts.

**Potential Impact (Detailed & Redash Specific):**

*   **Account Compromise:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dashboards & Data:** Attackers gain access to sensitive dashboards, visualizations, and underlying data sources connected to Redash. This can lead to unauthorized data viewing, analysis, and potentially manipulation (if the compromised user has write access).
    *   **Query Manipulation & Data Integrity Issues:** Attackers could modify existing queries or create new malicious queries to extract specific data, alter data visualizations to present misleading information, or even inject malicious code into queries (if Redash allows for such vulnerabilities, though less likely in standard Redash usage).
    *   **Data Source Credential Theft:** If users store data source credentials within Redash (even if encrypted), a compromised account could potentially be used to access and exfiltrate these credentials, leading to broader data breaches beyond Redash itself.
    *   **User Impersonation & Lateral Movement:** Attackers can impersonate compromised users to gain further access to other systems and resources within the organization, especially if users reuse passwords across different platforms.

*   **Data Breach:**
    *   **Exfiltration of Sensitive Data:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data visualized and managed through Redash, including business intelligence data, customer information, financial data, and operational metrics.
    *   **Reputational Damage & Compliance Violations:** Data breaches resulting from compromised Redash accounts can lead to significant reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and potential fines for non-compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

*   **Malware Infection:**
    *   **Compromised User Workstations:** If users are tricked into downloading and executing malware through social engineering attacks (e.g., malicious attachments, links), their workstations can be infected. This can lead to data theft, keylogging, and further compromise of the Redash environment and other systems.
    *   **Lateral Movement within Network:** Malware infections can facilitate lateral movement within the organization's network, potentially allowing attackers to reach more critical systems and data beyond Redash.

**Recommended Mitigations (In-depth Evaluation & Redash Context):**

*   **Security Awareness Training (Crucial):**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Highly effective in reducing susceptibility to social engineering attacks, especially phishing, when delivered regularly and tailored to the specific threats faced by Redash users.
    *   **Feasibility:** Relatively easy to implement. Training materials can be developed internally or purchased from security awareness vendors. Redash-specific examples and scenarios should be included.
    *   **Cost:** Moderate cost, primarily for training material development/purchase and employee time for training.
    *   **User Impact:** Positive impact in the long run, empowering users to become a strong first line of defense. Initial training might require some time commitment from users.
    *   **Redash Contextualization:** Training should specifically address phishing emails disguised as Redash notifications, fake Redash login pages, and scenarios where attackers impersonate Redash support. Emphasize the importance of verifying links and sender addresses, and reporting suspicious emails.

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Extremely effective in preventing account compromise even if credentials are stolen through phishing. Adds a crucial second layer of security.
    *   **Feasibility:** Highly feasible for Redash. Redash supports various MFA methods (e.g., TOTP, WebAuthn). Implementation requires enabling MFA in Redash configuration and user onboarding.
    *   **Cost:** Low to moderate cost, depending on the chosen MFA solution. Many free or low-cost MFA options are available.
    *   **User Impact:** Minor inconvenience for users during login, but significantly enhances security. Clear communication and user-friendly MFA setup are crucial for user adoption.
    *   **Redash Contextualization:**  MFA should be enforced for all Redash user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges or access to sensitive data sources. Clearly communicate the security benefits of MFA to users to encourage adoption.

*   **Phishing Simulations:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Highly effective in testing user awareness and identifying areas where training needs improvement. Provides valuable metrics on user susceptibility to phishing attacks.
    *   **Feasibility:** Relatively easy to implement using phishing simulation platforms or by creating in-house simulations. Requires planning and execution of simulations, and analysis of results.
    *   **Cost:** Moderate cost, depending on the chosen simulation platform or in-house development effort.
    *   **User Impact:** Minimal direct user impact during simulations. Post-simulation feedback and targeted training can improve user awareness without significant disruption.
    *   **Redash Contextualization:** Simulations should mimic realistic phishing attacks targeting Redash users, using Redash branding and scenarios relevant to their roles and responsibilities. Results should be used to refine security awareness training and identify users who might need additional support.

*   **Email Security Measures:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Effective in reducing the volume of phishing emails reaching users' inboxes. Spam filters, DMARC, SPF, and DKIM are industry-standard email security measures.
    *   **Feasibility:** Highly feasible to implement. These measures are typically configured at the email server/domain level and require technical expertise to set up correctly.
    *   **Cost:** Low to moderate cost, depending on existing email infrastructure and chosen solutions. Many email providers offer built-in or add-on security features.
    *   **User Impact:** Minimal direct user impact. Improved email security enhances overall user experience by reducing spam and phishing attempts.
    *   **Redash Contextualization:** Implement robust email security measures for the organization's email domain to minimize the risk of phishing emails targeting Redash users. Regularly review and update email security configurations to adapt to evolving threats.

**Additional Mitigations & Best Practices:**

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Review and Optimization:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure users are granted only the minimum necessary permissions within Redash. Regularly review and adjust RBAC settings to prevent excessive access.
    *   **Redash Context:**  Carefully define roles and permissions in Redash to limit the impact of a compromised account. For example, restrict data source creation and modification to authorized administrators only.
