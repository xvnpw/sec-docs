### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 17. Default Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)

**Attack Vector Name:** Default Credentials

**Description:** Redash, like many applications and systems, relies on various components, including databases and potentially other services. These components, and even Redash itself, might be configured with default usernames and passwords upon initial installation. If these default credentials are not changed during the deployment and configuration process, they become a readily available and easily exploitable vulnerability. Attackers can leverage publicly available lists of default credentials or automated scanning tools to identify systems still using them.

**4.1. Potential Locations of Default Credentials in Redash and its Environment:**

*   **Redash Application Admin User:**  Historically, and potentially in some deployment methods, Redash might have a default administrative user account (e.g., username 'admin' and password 'password' or similar). This account, if unchanged, grants immediate access to the Redash application itself.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over Redash dashboards, queries, data sources, users, and settings.
*   **Database User for Redash:** Redash requires a database (PostgreSQL is commonly used) to store its data. The database connection configuration within Redash might be pre-configured with default database credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Direct access to the Redash database, potentially allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete sensitive data, bypass Redash application logic, and potentially gain access to the underlying database server.
*   **Underlying Operating System (Server):**  If Redash is deployed on a server (e.g., Linux), the operating system itself might have default user accounts (e.g., 'root' or 'administrator' with weak or default passwords). While less directly related to Redash, gaining OS access can indirectly compromise Redash and the entire server environment.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the server, including Redash application, data, and potentially other applications and services running on the same server.
*   **Redis (if used):** Redash can utilize Redis for caching and task queuing. If Redis is deployed with default settings and no password, it can be vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:**  Access to cached data, potential disruption of Redash functionality, and in some cases, depending on Redis configuration, potential for command injection.
*   **Other Dependencies:** Depending on the specific Redash deployment and integrations, other components (e.g., message queues, monitoring tools) might also have default credentials.

**4.2. Attack Vectors and Exploitation Techniques:**

*   **Publicly Available Default Credential Lists:** Attackers commonly use readily available lists of default usernames and passwords for various applications, databases, and operating systems. Redash and its common dependencies are likely to be included in such lists.
*   **Automated Scanning Tools:** Attackers employ automated scanning tools that can quickly probe systems for open ports and attempt logins using default credentials. These tools can efficiently identify vulnerable Redash instances exposed to the internet or internal networks.
*   **Documentation and Configuration Files:**  Default credentials might be inadvertently exposed in publicly accessible documentation, example configuration files, or even within the Redash codebase itself (though less likely for production-critical credentials, more likely for initial setup examples).
*   **Social Engineering (Less likely for default credentials, but possible):** In some scenarios, attackers might attempt to guess default credentials based on common patterns or by targeting less technically proficient administrators.

**Exploitation Steps:**

1.  **Discovery:** Attacker identifies a Redash instance (e.g., through port scanning, web application fingerprinting).
2.  **Credential Guessing:** Attacker attempts to log in using default usernames and passwords for Redash admin, database, or underlying OS/services.
3.  **Access Granted:** If default credentials are still in use, the attacker gains unauthorized access.
4.  **Malicious Actions:**  Once inside, the attacker can perform various malicious actions depending on the level of access gained (see "Potential Impact" below).

**4.3. Potential Impact (Detailed):**

*   **Critical System Compromise (Redash and potentially underlying infrastructure):**
    *   **Full Administrative Control of Redash:**  Default admin credentials grant complete control over the Redash application. This allows attackers to:
        *   **Modify Dashboards and Visualizations:**  Spread misinformation, manipulate data presentation, and disrupt business operations.
        *   **Access and Modify Queries:**  View sensitive queries, potentially revealing business logic, data access patterns, and even embedded credentials within queries. Modify queries to extract or alter data.
        *   **Manage Data Sources:**  Access connection details for connected databases and data sources, potentially leading to further compromise of backend systems. Add malicious data sources to exfiltrate data or inject malicious content.
        *   **Manage Users and Permissions:**  Create new administrative accounts, escalate privileges, lock out legitimate users, and maintain persistent access.
        *   **Execute Arbitrary Code (Potentially):** In some scenarios, vulnerabilities within Redash, combined with admin access, could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Underlying Server Compromise (if OS default credentials are used):** Gaining access to the underlying server operating system allows for complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, denial-of-service attacks, and pivoting to other systems on the network.

*   **Data Breach (Sensitive data managed by Redash and connected data sources):**
    *   **Direct Data Access:**  Access to the Redash database grants direct access to all data stored by Redash, including user information, dashboard configurations, query history, and potentially cached data.
    *   **Access to Connected Data Sources:**  Compromising Redash can provide access to connection details for connected databases and data sources. Attackers can then use these credentials to directly access and exfiltrate sensitive data from these backend systems, which are often the primary sources of valuable information visualized by Redash.
    *   **Data Manipulation and Integrity Loss:**  Attackers can modify data within Redash and potentially in connected data sources, leading to data integrity issues, inaccurate reporting, and flawed decision-making based on compromised data.

*   **Reputational Damage:** A publicly disclosed data breach or system compromise due to default credentials can severely damage an organization's reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to financial losses.

**4.4. Recommended Mitigations (Detailed and Actionable):**

*   **Change Default Credentials Immediately (Critical):**
    *   **Redash Admin User:**  During the initial setup of Redash, or immediately if default credentials are still in use, change the default administrator username and password. This is typically done through the Redash web interface or configuration files (depending on the deployment method).  Refer to Redash documentation for specific instructions on changing the admin password.
    *   **Database User for Redash:**  When setting up the database for Redash, ensure you create a dedicated database user with a strong, unique password specifically for Redash to connect to the database.  Do *not* use default database administrator credentials for Redash. Configure Redash to use these newly created database credentials.
    *   **Underlying Operating System:**  Change default passwords for any default user accounts on the server hosting Redash. Disable or remove unnecessary default accounts. Implement strong password policies for all server accounts.
    *   **Redis (if used):** If using Redis, configure a strong password for Redis authentication. Ensure Redis is not accessible without authentication.
    *   **Document the process:**  Clearly document the steps taken to change default credentials for future reference and for consistent deployments.

*   **Password Management Policies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Implement and enforce strong password policies for all Redash users, database users, and server accounts. This includes:
        *   **Minimum Length:**  Enforce a minimum password length (e.g., 12-16 characters or more).
        *   **Complexity Requirements:**  Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
        *   **Password History:**  Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
        *   **Regular Password Changes (Considered but with caution):** While regular password changes were once recommended, modern best practices often favor longer, more complex passwords changed less frequently, combined with multi-factor authentication. Evaluate the need for forced password rotation based on your organization's risk profile and user behavior.
    *   **Encourage Password Managers:**  Promote the use of password managers among administrators and users to generate and securely store strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the necessary permissions within Redash and the underlying systems. Avoid granting administrative privileges unnecessarily.

*   **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Credential Review:**  Periodically audit user accounts and credentials for Redash, databases, and servers to ensure default credentials are not inadvertently reintroduced or still in use.
    *   **Automated Security Scans:**  Implement regular automated security scans (vulnerability scanning) of the Redash environment to detect potential vulnerabilities, including the presence of default credentials (though this might be less effective for application-level default credentials).
    *   **Manual Configuration Reviews:**  Conduct periodic manual reviews of Redash configuration files, database configurations, and server configurations to verify security settings and identify any misconfigurations that could lead to default credential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Access Control Reviews:** Regularly review user access rights and permissions within Redash to ensure the principle of least privilege is maintained and no unnecessary administrative accounts exist.

**4.5. Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** **HIGH**. The likelihood of default credentials being present and exploitable is high, especially in quick deployments, development/testing environments that are moved to production without proper hardening, or in organizations with weak security practices. Attackers actively scan for and exploit default credentials, making this a common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** **CRITICAL**. As detailed above, the potential impact of exploiting default credentials in Redash is critical, leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and significant reputational damage.

**Conclusion:**

The "Default Credentials" attack path is a **critical security risk** for Redash deployments. It is a low-effort, high-reward attack vector for malicious actors.  **Immediate and diligent mitigation is paramount.**  The development team must prioritize implementing the recommended mitigations, particularly changing default credentials immediately and establishing strong password management policies. Regular security audits are crucial to ensure ongoing protection against this and other vulnerabilities. By addressing this critical attack path, the organization can significantly enhance the security posture of its Redash application and protect sensitive data and systems.
