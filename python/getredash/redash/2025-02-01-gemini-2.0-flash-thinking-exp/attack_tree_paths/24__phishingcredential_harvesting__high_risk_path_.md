### 4. Deep Analysis: Phishing/Credential Harvesting

#### 4.1. Detailed Attack Path Breakdown

The "Phishing/Credential Harvesting" attack path can be broken down into the following stages:

1.  **Reconnaissance (Optional but Common):**
    *   Attackers may gather information about the target organization and its Redash usage. This could involve:
        *   Identifying Redash URLs used by the organization (e.g., through website analysis, job postings, or social media).
        *   Identifying Redash users (e.g., through LinkedIn, company directories, or publicly accessible Redash dashboards if any).
        *   Understanding the organization's email communication patterns and branding.

2.  **Phishing Campaign Preparation:**
    *   **Choosing a Phishing Vector:** Attackers select a method to deliver the phishing attempt. Common vectors include:
        *   **Email Phishing:** Crafting deceptive emails that appear to be from legitimate sources (e.g., Redash administrators, IT support, or even automated system notifications).
        *   **Website Spoofing:** Creating fake login pages that closely resemble the legitimate Redash login page. These pages are hosted on attacker-controlled domains or potentially through compromised websites.
        *   **SMS Phishing (Smishing):** Sending deceptive text messages with links to fake login pages.
        *   **Social Media/Messaging Platforms:**  Using social media or messaging platforms to send phishing links.
    *   **Crafting the Phishing Content:**  Developing convincing phishing content that tricks users into taking action. This includes:
        *   **Email/Message Content:**  Creating compelling subject lines and body text that creates a sense of urgency, authority, or fear (e.g., password expiration warnings, security alerts, system maintenance notifications).
        *   **Spoofed Login Page Design:**  Replicating the visual appearance of the legitimate Redash login page, including branding, logos, and layout.  Attackers may even dynamically pull content from the real Redash page to make the fake page more convincing.
        *   **URL Manipulation:** Using techniques to make the phishing URL appear legitimate at first glance (e.g., using look-alike domains, URL shortening services, or subdomains that mimic legitimate domains).

3.  **Phishing Campaign Execution:**
    *   **Distribution:** Sending phishing emails, messages, or distributing links to the fake login page to targeted Redash users. This could be done through:
        *   Mass email campaigns.
        *   Spear phishing targeting specific individuals or departments.
        *   Watering hole attacks (compromising websites frequently visited by Redash users and injecting phishing links).
    *   **User Interaction:**  Waiting for users to interact with the phishing attempt. This involves users:
        *   Opening the phishing email or message.
        *   Clicking on the malicious link.
        *   Landing on the fake login page.
        *   Entering their Redash username and password into the fake login form.

4.  **Credential Harvesting:**
    *   **Data Capture:** The fake login page is designed to capture the credentials entered by the user. This data is typically sent to an attacker-controlled server or database.
    *   **Redirection (Optional but Common):** After capturing credentials, attackers may redirect the user to the legitimate Redash login page or a generic error page to reduce suspicion.

5.  **Account Compromise and Exploitation (Leads to "Social Engineering Redash Users"):**
    *   **Credential Verification:** Attackers may test the harvested credentials on the legitimate Redash login page to confirm their validity.
    *   **Redash Access:**  Successful credential harvesting grants the attacker access to the user's Redash account.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Once inside Redash, the attacker can perform various malicious actions depending on the compromised user's permissions and the attacker's objectives. This could include:
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing and downloading sensitive data from Redash dashboards and queries.
        *   **Dashboard Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting dashboards, reports, and visualizations to disrupt operations or spread misinformation.
        *   **Query Manipulation:** Modifying or creating malicious queries to extract further data or potentially inject malicious code (though less likely in standard Redash usage, depending on data source connections and query capabilities).
        *   **Privilege Escalation (if possible):** Attempting to escalate privileges within Redash if the compromised account has sufficient permissions or if vulnerabilities exist.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Using Redash access as a stepping stone to access other systems or data within the organization's network (if Redash is integrated with other systems).

#### 4.2. Potential Impact

Successful Phishing/Credential Harvesting can have significant impacts:

*   **Data Breach:**  Exposure and potential exfiltration of sensitive data stored and accessed through Redash. This could include business intelligence data, customer information, financial data, and more, depending on the organization's use of Redash.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A data breach resulting from compromised Redash accounts can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Costs associated with incident response, data breach notification, regulatory fines, legal liabilities, and potential business disruption.
*   **Operational Disruption:**  Manipulation or deletion of dashboards and reports can disrupt business operations and decision-making processes.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  Compromised accounts can lead to breaches of confidentiality (data exposure), integrity (data manipulation), and availability (service disruption).
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Data breaches may lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and industry-specific compliance standards.

#### 4.3. Redash Specific Considerations and Vulnerabilities

*   **Default Authentication:** Redash often uses username/password authentication by default, which is inherently vulnerable to phishing if not supplemented with stronger security measures.
*   **User Awareness:**  Users may not be adequately trained to recognize sophisticated phishing attempts, especially those that closely mimic legitimate Redash communications.
*   **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) by Default:** While Redash supports SSO and potentially MFA through external providers, it's not enforced by default in all deployment scenarios.  Lack of MFA significantly increases the risk of credential compromise from phishing.
*   **Password Complexity Policies (If Weak or Not Enforced):** Weak password policies or lack of enforcement can make brute-forcing or guessing harvested passwords easier, although phishing bypasses password complexity in the first place.
*   **Publicly Accessible Redash Instances (If Misconfigured):** If Redash instances are publicly accessible without proper access controls or VPN, they become easier targets for phishing campaigns.
*   **Trust in Email Communications:** Users may be accustomed to receiving legitimate emails from Redash (e.g., report notifications, sharing invitations), making them more susceptible to phishing emails that mimic these communications.

#### 4.4. Recommended Mitigations (Detailed and Actionable)

To effectively mitigate the "Phishing/Credential Harvesting" attack path, a layered security approach is crucial.  Here are detailed and actionable mitigations, categorized for clarity:

**A. Technical Mitigations (Implementation by Development/IT Team):**

1.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **Action:** Enforce MFA for all Redash users. This is the **most critical technical mitigation**.
    *   **Implementation:** Integrate Redash with an MFA provider (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy, Duo, or enterprise SSO solutions with MFA).  Configure Redash to require MFA for login.
    *   **Benefit:** Even if credentials are phished, attackers cannot gain access without the second factor.

2.  **Strengthen Password Policies:**
    *   **Action:** Enforce strong password complexity requirements (minimum length, character types).
    *   **Implementation:** Configure Redash password policies to mandate strong passwords. Regularly review and update password policies.
    *   **Benefit:** While phishing bypasses passwords directly, strong passwords reduce the risk of brute-force attacks if phished credentials are reused elsewhere.

3.  **Implement Account Lockout Policies:**
    *   **Action:** Configure account lockout policies to temporarily lock accounts after multiple failed login attempts.
    *   **Implementation:** Configure Redash to lock accounts after a defined number of incorrect password attempts within a specific timeframe.
    *   **Benefit:**  Limits the effectiveness of brute-force attacks if attackers attempt to guess passwords after harvesting usernames.

4.  **Enable Security Headers:**
    *   **Action:** Implement security headers in the Redash web server configuration.
    *   **Implementation:** Configure headers like:
        *   `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`: To mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and potentially reduce the effectiveness of some phishing techniques that rely on injecting malicious scripts.
        *   `X-Frame-Options`: To prevent clickjacking attacks, which could be used in conjunction with phishing.
        *   `HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`: To enforce HTTPS and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring users connect to the legitimate Redash site.
        *   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: To prevent MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Benefit:** Enhances overall web application security and can indirectly reduce the attack surface for phishing.
