- Provide self-service data exploration and visualization capabilities to non-technical users.
- Centralize data access and reporting from disparate data sources.
- Improve efficiency in data analysis and reporting processes.
- Facilitate data sharing and collaboration within teams and across the organization.

Business Risks:
- Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data through the Redash platform.
- Data integrity issues due to vulnerabilities in data processing or visualization components.
- Availability disruptions impacting business operations reliant on Redash dashboards and reports.
- Compliance violations related to data privacy and security regulations if Redash is not properly secured.
- Misleading or inaccurate insights derived from Redash due to data quality issues or misconfigurations.

- security control: Implement security information and event management (SIEM) or logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
- security control: Data encryption at rest for sensitive data stored within Redash database.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and request throttling to protect against denial-of-service attacks.
- security control: Establish a security incident response plan to handle security breaches effectively.
- security control: Conduct security awareness training for Redash users and administrators.

- What is the organization's risk appetite regarding data security and system availability? (This influences the prioritization of security controls).
- What existing security infrastructure and tools are already in place within the organization? (This helps integrate Redash security controls with existing systems).

Assumptions:
- Redash will be deployed in a cloud environment for scalability and manageability.
- Data sources connected to Redash contain sensitive business data that requires protection.
- Users accessing Redash will include business users, data analysts, and system administrators with varying levels of access and permissions.
