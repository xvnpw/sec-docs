# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for getredash/redash

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Data Source Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_data_source_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within Redash, navigate to the data source configuration settings.
    2.  For each data source, review the currently configured database user credentials.
    3.  Determine the minimum necessary database permissions required for Redash to function for that specific data source (e.g., `SELECT` on specific tables, `EXECUTE` for stored procedures).
    4.  If necessary, create dedicated database users with these minimal permissions directly in your database system.
    5.  Update the data source configuration in Redash to use these newly created, least-privileged database user credentials.
    6.  Regularly review and adjust these data source credentials and permissions within Redash as data access needs change.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Limits the scope of data accessible if Redash itself is compromised, as the database credentials used by Redash are restricted.
    *   **SQL Injection Exploitation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the potential damage from SQL injection, as the compromised Redash connection has limited database privileges.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **SQL Injection Exploitation:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Database users are used in Redash data source configurations, but not consistently enforced for least privilege across all sources.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing strict enforcement of least privilege for all data source connections configured within Redash. Requires review and refinement of permissions for each data source in Redash.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Educate Redash users on how to write parameterized queries within the Redash query editor.
    2.  Provide Redash-specific documentation and examples on using parameters in queries for different data source types supported by Redash.
    3.  Encourage the use of parameterized queries for all new queries created in Redash, especially when queries involve user-provided input.
    4.  Review existing Redash queries and dashboards to identify and refactor any queries that are not parameterized and could be vulnerable to SQL injection.
    5.  Implement a query review process within the Redash workflow to specifically check for parameterization in new or modified queries.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Parameterized queries, when used in Redash, directly prevent SQL injection attacks by separating SQL code from user-supplied data within the query construction process in Redash.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are aware of parameterized queries in Redash and use them sometimes, but consistent usage and enforcement within Redash workflows are lacking.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing consistent enforcement and review of parameterized queries within Redash query creation and modification processes. Need to integrate parameterization best practices into Redash user training and query review workflows.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Dashboards and Queries](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__for_dashboards_and_queries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within Redash's Admin settings, define user groups that correspond to different roles and access levels within your organization.
    2.  Assign Redash users to appropriate groups based on their job functions and data access requirements, using Redash's user management interface.
    3.  For each dashboard and query created in Redash, configure access permissions using Redash's built-in permission settings. Grant access to specific user groups based on the principle of least privilege.
    4.  Regularly review user group memberships and dashboard/query permissions within Redash to ensure they remain aligned with current access needs and security policies.
    5.  Utilize Redash's user interface for managing users, groups, and permissions for dashboards and queries.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Dashboards and Data (High Severity):** Redash's RBAC directly controls who can view and interact with dashboards and queries within the application, preventing unauthorized data access.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Accidental or Malicious Access (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting access to sensitive information within Redash based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of compromised Redash user accounts by restricting their access based on their assigned role within Redash.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Dashboards and Data:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches due to Accidental or Malicious Access:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic user roles and groups are used in Redash, but consistent application of permissions to all dashboards and queries is needed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing comprehensive RBAC implementation across all dashboards and queries within Redash. Requires defining clear roles in Redash, mapping users to groups, and consistently configuring permissions for all Redash assets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Redash Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_redash_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Monitor Redash's official release channels (GitHub releases, mailing lists) for new version announcements and security advisories.
    2.  Plan and schedule regular updates to the latest stable Redash version.
    3.  Before updating the production Redash instance, test the update in a staging or development Redash environment to ensure compatibility and identify potential issues.
    4.  Apply Redash updates promptly, especially security updates, to patch known vulnerabilities within the Redash application code.
    5.  Document the Redash update process and maintain a record of the Redash version history.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Updating Redash patches known security vulnerabilities in the application code itself, preventing attackers from exploiting these weaknesses in Redash.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Redash is updated occasionally, but not on a regular schedule, and security updates are not consistently prioritized.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing a formal process for regular Redash updates and proactive monitoring of Redash security advisories. Need to establish a scheduled update process for Redash and prioritize security updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify Redash users who should be required to use MFA (e.g., administrators, users accessing sensitive dashboards).
    2.  Choose an MFA method supported by Redash (e.g., SAML/OAuth integration with MFA providers, if Redash supports it directly or via reverse proxy).
    3.  Enable and configure MFA within Redash's authentication settings or through integration with an external authentication provider.
    4.  Enforce MFA for login attempts for the identified users within Redash.
    5.  Provide user documentation and support for setting up and using MFA with Redash.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover via Credential Compromise (High Severity):** MFA, when enabled in Redash, adds an extra layer of security to Redash user accounts, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain access even if they compromise passwords.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover via Credential Compromise:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not currently implemented. MFA is not enabled for Redash user logins.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing MFA implementation for Redash users. Need to enable and configure MFA within Redash or integrate with an external MFA provider for Redash authentication.
