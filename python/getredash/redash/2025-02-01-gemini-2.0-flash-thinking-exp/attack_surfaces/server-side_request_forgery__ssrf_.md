### 4. Deep Analysis of SSRF Attack Surface in Redash

#### 4.1. Attack Vectors

Several attack vectors can be exploited to trigger SSRF vulnerabilities in Redash:

*   **4.1.1. Data Source Connection String Manipulation:**
    *   **Description:** When configuring a new data source in Redash, users typically provide a connection string or parameters that specify the database server, hostname, port, and other connection details. If Redash does not properly validate these inputs, an attacker could inject a malicious hostname or IP address, forcing Redash to connect to an unintended target.
    *   **Example:**  Instead of connecting to a legitimate database server, an attacker could provide a connection string like `http://internal-admin-panel:8080` or `http://attacker-controlled-domain.com`. Redash, attempting to establish a connection (even if it fails later), would make a request to this attacker-specified URL.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and lack of URL whitelisting during data source configuration. Redash might rely on basic checks or not perform adequate validation of the hostname/IP address and protocol.

*   **4.1.2. Query Manipulation (Indirect SSRF):**
    *   **Description:** While less direct, certain data sources and query functionalities might allow for indirect SSRF. If a data source supports external data retrieval or allows embedding URLs within queries (e.g., some NoSQL databases or custom data connectors), an attacker could craft a query that instructs the data source to fetch data from a malicious URL. Redash, in turn, would process the data retrieved by the data source, potentially triggering an SSRF.
    *   **Example:** Imagine a custom data source connector in Redash that allows fetching data from external APIs based on URLs provided in the query. An attacker could craft a query that includes a malicious URL, causing the connector (and indirectly Redash) to make a request to that URL.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Overly permissive data source connectors or query functionalities that allow for external data retrieval without proper sanitization and validation of URLs. Redash's trust in the data source's behavior could be exploited.

*   **4.1.3. Dashboard Embedding/External Integrations (Potential):**
    *   **Description:** If Redash offers features for embedding dashboards in external websites or integrates with other external services (e.g., for alerts, notifications, or data export), these integrations could potentially introduce SSRF risks. If the embedding mechanism or integration involves Redash making requests based on external input, vulnerabilities could arise.
    *   **Example:** If a dashboard embedding feature allows specifying a callback URL or relies on external configuration that is not properly validated, an attacker might be able to manipulate this to trigger SSRF. Similarly, if alert notifications involve sending data to external webhook URLs, these could be exploited.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Lack of input validation and URL whitelisting in dashboard embedding features or external integrations. Over-reliance on external configurations without proper security checks.

*   **4.1.4. API Endpoints (Less Likely, but Possible):**
    *   **Description:** Redash API endpoints, especially those related to data source management, query execution, or configuration, could potentially be vulnerable to SSRF if they accept URLs or hostnames as parameters without proper validation.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint designed to test a data source connection might accept a hostname parameter. If this parameter is not validated, an attacker could use the API to test connections to internal resources.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Insufficient input validation in API endpoints that handle URLs or hostnames.

#### 4.2. Vulnerabilities Enabling SSRF

The underlying vulnerabilities that enable SSRF in Redash stem from:

*   **4.2.1. Insufficient Input Validation:**
    *   Lack of robust validation of user-provided inputs, especially connection strings, hostnames, and URLs. Redash might rely on weak or incomplete validation mechanisms, allowing malicious inputs to bypass security checks.
    *   Failure to sanitize or escape user inputs before using them in network requests.

*   **4.2.2. Lack of URL Whitelisting/Blacklisting:**
    *   Absence of a strict whitelist of allowed destination hosts and ports for Redash to connect to. Blacklisting approaches are generally less effective and can be easily bypassed.
    *   Not enforcing restrictions on allowed protocols (e.g., allowing `file://`, `gopher://`, etc., in addition to `http://` and `https://`).

*   **4.2.3. Overly Permissive Network Configuration:**
    *   Deploying Redash in a network environment that allows unrestricted outbound access to internal networks and the public internet. This expands the potential targets for SSRF attacks.

*   **4.2.4. Trust in Data Sources/External Systems:**
    *   Implicitly trusting the behavior of data sources or external systems integrated with Redash. This can lead to vulnerabilities if these external systems are compromised or maliciously designed.

#### 4.3. Impact of SSRF Exploitation

Successful SSRF exploitation in Redash can have significant security impacts:

*   **4.3.1. Access to Internal Resources:**
    *   Attackers can use Redash as a proxy to access internal services and resources that are not directly accessible from the public internet. This includes internal web applications, databases, APIs, and cloud metadata services.
    *   Example: Accessing internal admin panels, configuration interfaces, or sensitive data stores.

*   **4.3.2. Information Disclosure:**
    *   Retrieving sensitive information from internal resources, such as configuration files, API keys, internal documentation, or data from internal services.
    *   Example: Reading cloud metadata to obtain AWS credentials or other sensitive information.

*   **4.3.3. Compromise of Internal Services:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in internal services that are now accessible through Redash's SSRF capability.
    *   Example: If an internal service is vulnerable to command injection or other attacks, SSRF in Redash can be used to reach and exploit it.

*   **4.3.4. Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   Overloading internal services with requests initiated through Redash, leading to denial of service.
    *   Example:  Directing Redash to make a large number of requests to an internal service, causing it to become unavailable.

*   **4.3.5. Data Exfiltration (Indirect):**
    *   In some scenarios, attackers might be able to indirectly exfiltrate data by using SSRF to send data to attacker-controlled external servers. This is less direct than direct data access but still a potential risk.

#### 4.4. Redash Specific Considerations

*   **Variety of Data Sources:** Redash's support for a wide range of data sources increases the complexity of managing SSRF risks. Each data source type might have its own connection mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **User Roles and Permissions:** Redash's user role and permission system is crucial for controlling who can configure data sources and execute queries. Properly configured permissions can limit the attack surface by restricting access to sensitive features.
*   **Community Data Source Connectors:**  The use of community-developed data source connectors introduces potential risks if these connectors are not thoroughly vetted for security vulnerabilities, including SSRF.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies (Deep Dive and Redash Specific Recommendations)

Building upon the general mitigation strategies, here are more detailed and Redash-specific recommendations to mitigate SSRF risks:

*   **5.1. Network Segmentation ( 강화된 네트워크 분리):**
    *   **Implementation:** Deploy Redash within a tightly controlled network segment (e.g., a dedicated VLAN or subnet).
    *   **Outbound Access Control:** Implement strict firewall rules to limit Redash's outbound network access.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Destinations:**  Explicitly whitelist only the necessary external hosts and ports that Redash *must* connect to (e.g., specific database servers, external APIs if absolutely required). Deny all other outbound traffic by default.
        *   **Internal Network Segmentation:**  Further segment the internal network to limit Redash's access to only the necessary internal resources. Prevent Redash from directly accessing sensitive internal networks or services unless absolutely required and properly justified.
    *   **Rationale:** Network segmentation significantly reduces the potential impact of SSRF by limiting the attacker's ability to reach internal resources even if SSRF is successfully exploited in Redash.

*   **5.2. Input Validation and Whitelisting in Redash (강력한 입력 검증 및 화이트리스팅):**
    *   **Data Source Connection String Validation:**
        *   **Protocol Whitelisting:**  Strictly whitelist allowed protocols for data source connections (e.g., `postgresql://`, `mysql://`, `https://` for specific APIs). Deny protocols like `file://`, `gopher://`, `ftp://`, etc., which are often abused in SSRF attacks.
        *   **Hostname/IP Address Validation and Whitelisting:**
            *   Implement robust validation to ensure that hostnames and IP addresses provided in connection strings are valid and conform to expected formats.
            *   **Prefer Whitelisting:**  Implement a whitelist of allowed destination hostnames or IP address ranges for each data source type. This is more secure than blacklisting.
            *   **DNS Resolution Validation:**  If possible, perform DNS resolution of provided hostnames and validate the resolved IP addresses against the whitelist. Be cautious of DNS rebinding attacks; consider resolving hostnames server-side and validating the resolved IP.
        *   **Port Whitelisting:**  Whitelist allowed ports for each data source type. Restrict to standard ports where possible (e.g., 5432 for PostgreSQL, 3306 for MySQL, 443 for HTTPS).
    *   **Query Parameter Validation (for Indirect SSRF):**
        *   If data source connectors or query functionalities allow for external URL inclusion, implement strict validation and sanitization of these URLs.
        *   Apply URL whitelisting and protocol restrictions within query processing logic as well.
    *   **API Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all inputs to Redash API endpoints, especially those that handle URLs or hostnames. Apply the same validation and whitelisting principles as for data source connections.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Implement secure error handling. Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages that could aid attackers in SSRF exploitation.

*   **5.3. Disable Unnecessary Features and Data Sources (불필요한 기능 및 데이터 소스 비활성화):**
    *   **Disable Unused Data Source Types:** If certain data source types are not required in your Redash deployment, disable or remove support for them to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Restrict Feature Access:** Use Redash's permission system to restrict access to data source configuration and other potentially risky features to only authorized users.
    *   **Review and Disable External Integrations:** Carefully review all external integrations and disable any that are not essential or introduce unnecessary SSRF risks.

*   **5.4. Content Security Policy (CSP) (콘텐츠 보안 정책):**
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) for Redash. While CSP primarily mitigates client-side vulnerabilities like XSS, it can offer some defense-in-depth against certain types of SSRF exploitation by limiting the browser's ability to load resources from unexpected origins if SSRF leads to reflected output in the Redash UI.

*   **5.5. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (정기적인 보안 감사 및 침투 테스트):**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on SSRF vulnerabilities in Redash. This helps identify and address potential weaknesses proactively.

*   **5.6. Stay Updated and Patch Regularly (최신 업데이트 및 정기적인 패치):**
    *   Keep Redash updated to the latest version. Security patches often address known vulnerabilities, including SSRF. Subscribe to Redash security advisories and apply updates promptly.

By implementing these comprehensive mitigation strategies, developers and operators can significantly reduce the SSRF attack surface in Redash and enhance the overall security posture of their deployments. Remember that defense in depth is crucial, and a combination of these strategies provides the most robust protection.
