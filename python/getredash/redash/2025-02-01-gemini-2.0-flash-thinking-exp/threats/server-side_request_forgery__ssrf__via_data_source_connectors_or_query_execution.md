### 4. Deep Analysis of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Redash

#### 4.1. Technical Details of SSRF in Redash Context

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing. In the context of Redash, this threat is particularly relevant due to its core functionality: connecting to various data sources and executing queries against them.

**How SSRF can occur in Redash:**

*   **Data Source Connectors:** Redash relies on data source connectors to interact with different database systems, APIs, and services. These connectors often require configuration parameters, such as hostnames, IP addresses, and URLs. If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious URLs or hostnames. When Redash attempts to establish a connection to the data source using these attacker-controlled parameters, it could be tricked into making requests to unintended destinations.

    *   **Example:** Imagine a data source connector for a REST API. If the "API Endpoint URL" field is vulnerable, an attacker could replace the legitimate API endpoint with a URL pointing to an internal service (e.g., `http://internal-admin-panel:8080/`) or an external attacker-controlled server. When Redash tries to connect to this "data source," it will inadvertently make a request to the attacker-specified URL.

*   **Query Execution Logic:**  Some data sources or query types might allow users to specify URLs or external resources within their queries. If Redash's query execution engine processes these URLs without proper validation, it could be exploited for SSRF.

    *   **Example:**  Consider a data source that allows fetching data from external URLs within a query (e.g., using a function like `LOAD_DATA_INFILE` in MySQL or similar functionalities in other databases or custom connectors). If Redash doesn't restrict the URLs that can be accessed during query execution, an attacker could craft a query that forces Redash to fetch data from internal resources or attacker-controlled external servers.

*   **Vulnerable Data Source Connector Implementations:**  Even if Redash core attempts to sanitize inputs, vulnerabilities might exist within the specific implementations of individual data source connectors.  Connectors might use external libraries or have custom logic that is susceptible to SSRF if not carefully designed and reviewed.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors

Attackers can exploit SSRF in Redash through various vectors:

1.  **Malicious Data Source Configuration:**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker with permissions to create or modify data sources could inject malicious URLs into data source configuration parameters (e.g., hostname, API endpoint URL, connection string).
    *   **Mechanism:**  When Redash attempts to connect to the data source, it will make requests to the attacker-controlled URL.
    *   **Access Level Required:** Requires user permissions to manage data sources.

2.  **Exploiting Vulnerable Query Parameters:**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker crafts a query that includes malicious URLs or references to internal resources, leveraging features of the data source or connector that allow URL inclusion in queries.
    *   **Mechanism:**  Redash's query execution engine, or the underlying data source connector, processes the malicious URL, causing Redash to make an unintended request.
    *   **Access Level Required:** Requires user permissions to execute queries against a vulnerable data source.

3.  **Bypassing Input Validation (if any):**
    *   **Scenario:**  Redash might have some input validation in place, but it could be insufficient or bypassable. Attackers might use techniques like URL encoding, URL redirection, or DNS rebinding to circumvent these validations.
    *   **Mechanism:**  Attackers craft payloads that appear benign to the validation logic but ultimately resolve to malicious destinations during request processing.
    *   **Access Level Required:** Depends on the specific vulnerability and validation bypass technique.

4.  **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Data Source Connectors:**
    *   **Scenario:**  A specific data source connector might have inherent vulnerabilities in its code that allow SSRF, even if Redash core is secure.
    *   **Mechanism:**  Attackers target vulnerabilities within the connector's code to manipulate its network requests.
    *   **Access Level Required:** Depends on the specific vulnerability and connector.

#### 4.3. Impact Breakdown

The impact of a successful SSRF attack in Redash can range from information disclosure to potentially remote code execution, depending on the targeted resources and the attacker's objectives.

*   **Access to Internal Resources:**
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can use Redash as a proxy to access internal services and resources that are not directly accessible from the internet. This includes internal web applications, databases, APIs, and cloud services.
    *   **Examples:** Accessing internal admin panels, retrieving configuration files from internal servers, interacting with internal APIs.

*   **Information Disclosure about Internal Network:**
    *   **Impact:**  By probing internal IP addresses and hostnames, attackers can map the internal network topology, identify running services, and gather information about internal infrastructure.
    *   **Examples:** Port scanning internal networks, banner grabbing from internal services, identifying internal service versions.

*   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Internal Services:**
    *   **Impact:**  If vulnerable internal services are discovered through SSRF, attackers can leverage Redash to exploit these vulnerabilities. This could lead to further compromise of internal systems.
    *   **Examples:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in internal web applications, databases, or APIs.

*   **Authentication Bypass and Privilege Escalation:**
    *   **Impact:** In some cases, internal services might rely on IP-based authentication or trust requests originating from the Redash server. SSRF can be used to bypass these authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to internal services with elevated privileges.
    *   **Examples:** Accessing internal services without proper authentication by making requests from the Redash server's IP address.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can use SSRF to overload internal or external services by forcing Redash to make a large number of requests.
    *   **Examples:**  Targeting internal services with a flood of requests, causing resource exhaustion and service disruption.

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Less Likely, but Possible):**
    *   **Impact:** In specific scenarios, SSRF could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution. This is less direct but could occur if:
        *   An attacker can access an internal service vulnerable to RCE via HTTP requests.
        *   The data source connector itself has vulnerabilities that can be exploited through SSRF to achieve RCE on the Redash server.
        *   The targeted internal service allows file uploads or other actions that can be leveraged for RCE.
    *   **Examples:** Exploiting RCE vulnerabilities in internal web applications accessible via SSRF, or in very specific and unlikely scenarios, within the data source connector itself.

#### 4.4. Real-World Examples and Context

While specific publicly disclosed SSRF vulnerabilities in Redash might be less common, SSRF is a well-known vulnerability class, and similar issues have been found in other data visualization and business intelligence tools.

*   **General SSRF Examples in Similar Tools:** Many data visualization and reporting tools that connect to external data sources have been found to be vulnerable to SSRF. This is because the core functionality often involves making network requests based on user-provided or configured parameters.
*   **Cloud Metadata Services:** SSRF is frequently exploited in cloud environments to access cloud metadata services (e.g., AWS metadata at `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`). Attackers can use SSRF to retrieve sensitive information like API keys, instance roles, and other cloud configuration details. In Redash, if deployed in a cloud environment, SSRF could potentially be used to access these metadata services if outbound traffic is not properly restricted.
*   **Internal Service Discovery:** SSRF is a common technique used in penetration testing and red teaming to discover and enumerate internal services within a network. Redash, if vulnerable, could be used as a tool for such reconnaissance.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies (Deep Dive)

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's expand on them with more specific and actionable recommendations:

**1. Carefully Review and Audit Redash Data Source Connectors for SSRF Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Action:** Conduct a thorough security audit of all Redash data source connectors, both built-in and any custom connectors.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Verify that all user-provided inputs to data source connectors (especially URLs, hostnames, IP addresses, connection strings) are rigorously validated and sanitized. Implement whitelisting of allowed protocols (e.g., `http`, `https`) and restrict allowed hostnames/IP ranges if possible.
    *   **URL Parsing and Handling:**  Ensure that URL parsing logic within connectors is robust and resistant to manipulation techniques like URL encoding, redirection, and DNS rebinding. Use well-vetted URL parsing libraries and avoid custom parsing logic if possible.
    *   **Network Request Libraries:**  Review the network request libraries used by connectors. Ensure they are up-to-date and configured securely to prevent SSRF. For example, when using libraries like `requests` in Python, ensure proper handling of redirects and consider disabling features that might facilitate SSRF.
    *   **Code Review:**  Perform manual code review of connector implementations, specifically looking for patterns that could lead to SSRF vulnerabilities. Pay attention to how external resources are accessed and how user inputs are processed.
    *   **Automated Security Scanning:**  Utilize static application security testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan the Redash codebase and data source connectors for potential SSRF vulnerabilities.

**2. Implement Network Segmentation and Firewall Rules to Restrict Redash's Outbound Network Access:**

*   **Action:**  Implement network segmentation to isolate the Redash server within a restricted network zone. Configure firewalls to strictly control outbound network traffic from the Redash server.
*   **Specific Rules:**
    *   **Whitelist Outbound Destinations:**  Instead of blacklisting, implement a whitelist approach for outbound traffic. Only allow Redash to connect to explicitly approved external services and data sources.
    *   **Restrict Ports:**  Limit outbound traffic to only necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443 for HTTP/HTTPS, and specific ports required for allowed data sources). Block all other outbound ports.
    *   **Internal Network Segmentation:**  Segment the internal network to limit the impact of SSRF. If Redash is compromised, restrict its access to sensitive internal networks and services.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Consider deploying a WAF in front of Redash to detect and block malicious requests, including those attempting to exploit SSRF. WAF rules can be configured to inspect request parameters and headers for suspicious patterns.

**3. Disable or Restrict Access to High-Risk Data Source Types or Features:**

*   **Action:**  Evaluate the risk associated with each data source type and feature in Redash. Disable or restrict access to data sources or features that are deemed high-risk from an SSRF perspective, especially if they are not essential for business operations.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **External Data Sources:**  Data sources that connect to external APIs or services over the internet might pose a higher SSRF risk compared to internal database connections.
    *   **Custom Connectors:**  Exercise caution when using custom or third-party data source connectors, as their security posture might be less well-vetted than built-in connectors.
    *   **Features Allowing URL Input in Queries:**  If certain data sources or query features allow users to directly specify URLs within queries, carefully assess the risk and consider disabling or restricting these features if they are not strictly necessary.
    *   **User Access Control:**  Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) in Redash. Restrict data source creation and modification permissions to only authorized users. Limit query execution permissions based on user roles and data sensitivity.

**4. Use Network Policies to Restrict Outbound Traffic from Redash Server (Especially in Containerized Environments):**

*   **Action:**  In containerized deployments (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker), leverage network policies to enforce strict network isolation and control outbound traffic at the container level.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Kubernetes Network Policies:**  Define Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict outbound traffic from Redash pods to only allowed destinations.
    *   **Docker Network Configuration:**  Utilize Docker network features to isolate Redash containers and control their network access.
    *   **Service Mesh:**  If using a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd), leverage its policy enforcement capabilities to control outbound traffic from Redash services.

**5. Implement Input Validation and Sanitization in Redash Core:**

*   **Action:**  Enhance input validation and sanitization within the Redash core application itself, beyond just the data source connectors.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **Centralized Input Validation:**  Implement a centralized input validation framework within Redash to consistently validate all user-provided inputs, including data source configurations, query parameters, and any other user-controlled data that could influence network requests.
    *   **URL Whitelisting:**  Maintain a whitelist of allowed URL schemes, hostnames, and IP ranges for outbound requests. Enforce this whitelist at the Redash core level.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate certain types of SSRF attacks and limit the browser's ability to load resources from unexpected origins. While CSP primarily protects the client-side, it can offer some defense-in-depth against certain SSRF scenarios.

**6. Monitoring and Logging:**

*   **Action:**  Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to detect and respond to potential SSRF attacks.
*   **Monitoring Points:**
    *   **Outbound Network Connections:**  Monitor outbound network connections from the Redash server for unusual or unauthorized destinations. Alert on connections to internal IP ranges or unexpected external domains.
    *   **Error Logs:**  Monitor Redash error logs for error messages related to network requests, connection failures, or suspicious activity.
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate Redash logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and detect potential SSRF attack patterns.

**7. Regular Security Assessments and Penetration Testing:**

*   **Action:**  Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing of the Redash application, specifically focusing on SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Frequency:**  Perform security assessments at least annually, and more frequently after significant code changes or updates to data source connectors.
*   **Penetration Testing Scope:**  Include SSRF testing as a key component of penetration testing engagements. Simulate real-world attack scenarios to identify and validate SSRF vulnerabilities.
