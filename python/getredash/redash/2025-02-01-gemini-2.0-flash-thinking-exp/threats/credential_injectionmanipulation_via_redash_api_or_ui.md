### 4. Deep Analysis of Credential Injection/Manipulation via Redash API or UI

#### 4.1 Threat Description Breakdown

The threat "Credential Injection/Manipulation via Redash API or UI" can be broken down into the following key components:

*   **Target:** Redash Data Source Management Module, API endpoints, and UI components responsible for handling data source connections.
*   **Attack Vector:** Redash API and UI input fields that accept data source connection parameters (e.g., hostname, port, username, password, database name, connection strings, etc.).
*   **Attack Type:** Injection and Manipulation.
    *   **Injection:**  Injecting malicious payloads into data source connection parameters. These payloads could be designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how Redash or the underlying database drivers process these parameters.
    *   **Manipulation:** Modifying existing data source connection parameters, potentially replacing legitimate credentials or connection details with attacker-controlled ones.
*   **Goal:**
    *   **Gain unauthorized access to data sources:** By injecting credentials or manipulating connection details to point to attacker-controlled databases or systems.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Once connected to a data source (legitimate or attacker-controlled), extract sensitive data.
    *   **Data Modification:**  Modify data within the connected data source, potentially leading to data integrity issues or further exploitation.
    *   **Redirection to Malicious Data Sources:**  Subtly change connection parameters to redirect Redash queries to attacker-controlled data sources, potentially capturing sensitive queries or injecting malicious data into Redash results.

#### 4.2 Technical Details and Potential Vulnerabilities

Redash connects to various data sources, each requiring specific connection parameters. These parameters are typically provided by users through the Redash UI or API when creating or modifying data sources.  Potential vulnerabilities can arise in how Redash handles and processes these parameters:

*   **Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization:**  If Redash does not properly validate and sanitize user-provided input for data source connection parameters, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks. For example:
    *   **SQL Injection:** If connection parameters are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code. This is less likely in direct connection parameters but could be relevant if Redash internally constructs queries based on these parameters for testing connections or metadata retrieval.
    *   **NoSQL Injection:** Similar to SQL injection, if Redash connects to NoSQL databases and connection parameters are not properly handled, NoSQL injection vulnerabilities could be exploited.
    *   **LDAP Injection:** If Redash integrates with LDAP for authentication or data sources, and connection parameters related to LDAP are vulnerable, LDAP injection could be possible.
    *   **OS Command Injection:** In extreme cases, if connection parameters are processed in a way that allows execution of OS commands (e.g., through insecure deserialization or vulnerable libraries), OS command injection could be possible. This is less likely but should be considered in a thorough analysis.
    *   **Format String Vulnerabilities:**  If connection parameters are used in format strings without proper handling, format string vulnerabilities could be exploited, potentially leading to information disclosure or even code execution.

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** If Redash uses serialization/deserialization for storing or transmitting data source connection parameters, and this process is not secure, it could be vulnerable to insecure deserialization attacks. An attacker could inject malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code or manipulate data.

*   **Lack of Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  If Redash uses dynamically constructed queries based on connection parameters instead of parameterized queries or prepared statements, it increases the risk of injection vulnerabilities. Parameterized queries ensure that user-provided input is treated as data, not code, preventing injection attacks.

*   **Weak Authorization and Access Control:** If authorization checks for data source creation and modification are weak or missing, an attacker could potentially manipulate data sources even with limited privileges. This could involve escalating privileges or bypassing authorization checks to modify connection parameters.

*   **UI Vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS):** While less directly related to credential injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Redash UI could be leveraged to manipulate data source settings indirectly. For example, an attacker could use XSS to inject JavaScript that modifies the data source form or sends malicious API requests to change connection parameters on behalf of an authenticated user.

#### 4.3 Attack Vectors

Attackers could exploit this threat through the following vectors:

1.  **Redash API Endpoints:**
    *   **Data Source Creation Endpoint:**  An attacker could send malicious API requests to the data source creation endpoint, injecting malicious payloads into connection parameters during the creation process.
    *   **Data Source Modification Endpoint:**  If an attacker gains authorization (or exploits authorization vulnerabilities), they could use the data source modification endpoint to alter existing connection parameters, replacing legitimate credentials or redirecting connections.
    *   **Bulk Import/Export Features (if any):** If Redash has features for bulk importing or exporting data source configurations, these could be potential attack vectors if the import/export process is not properly secured and validated.

2.  **Redash UI:**
    *   **Data Source Creation Form:** An attacker with access to the Redash UI (either legitimate or through compromised credentials) could manually enter malicious payloads into the data source creation form fields.
    *   **Data Source Modification Form:**  Similarly, an attacker could modify existing data source settings through the UI, injecting malicious parameters.
    *   **Social Engineering:** An attacker could use social engineering techniques to trick a legitimate Redash user into creating or modifying a data source with attacker-controlled parameters.
    *   **XSS Exploitation (Indirect):** As mentioned earlier, XSS vulnerabilities in the UI could be used to indirectly manipulate data source settings by injecting malicious scripts that alter form behavior or send unauthorized API requests.

#### 4.4 Impact Analysis (Detailed)

Successful exploitation of this threat can have severe consequences:

*   **Unauthorized Data Access and Data Exfiltration:**
    *   **Direct Data Source Access:**  An attacker could manipulate connection parameters to connect Redash to an attacker-controlled data source. This allows them to execute queries against the attacker's database, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data that Redash users might unknowingly query.
    *   **Redirection to Malicious Data Source (Data Capture):**  An attacker could subtly redirect a legitimate data source connection to a malicious intermediary server that mimics the legitimate data source. This allows the attacker to intercept and log queries sent by Redash users, potentially capturing sensitive data within the queries themselves (e.g., credentials, personal information, confidential business data).
    *   **Compromise of Legitimate Data Sources:** If an attacker can inject malicious code into connection parameters that are processed by the underlying database driver or Redash itself, they might be able to gain unauthorized access to the *legitimate* data sources that Redash is intended to connect to.

*   **Data Modification and Integrity Issues:**
    *   **Malicious Data Insertion/Update/Deletion:**  Once connected to a data source (attacker-controlled or compromised legitimate), an attacker could modify data, insert malicious records, or delete critical information. This can lead to data integrity issues, inaccurate reports, and potentially disrupt business operations that rely on Redash data.
    *   **Backdoor Creation:** An attacker could modify data within a legitimate data source to create backdoors for persistent access, even after the initial vulnerability is patched.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Maliciously crafted connection parameters could potentially cause Redash or the underlying database drivers to consume excessive resources, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Service Disruption:**  Manipulating data source connections to invalid or non-existent servers could disrupt Redash's ability to function correctly and provide data visualization services.

*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack leading to data breaches or data integrity issues can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Redash.

#### 4.5 Likelihood Assessment

The likelihood of this threat being exploited is considered **High** due to the following factors:

*   **Complexity of Data Source Connections:** Redash supports a wide range of data sources, each with its own connection parameters and potential vulnerabilities. Managing input validation and sanitization across all these data sources is complex and prone to errors.
*   **Common Web Application Vulnerabilities:** Injection vulnerabilities are consistently ranked among the top web application security risks (e.g., OWASP Top Ten).  If Redash developers are not vigilant in implementing secure coding practices, these vulnerabilities are likely to exist.
*   **Attractiveness of Redash as a Target:** Redash is used to access and visualize data, often including sensitive business information. This makes it an attractive target for attackers seeking to gain access to valuable data.
*   **Publicly Available Codebase:** Redash is open-source, which means attackers can study the codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities more easily. While open-source also allows for community security reviews, it also lowers the barrier for attackers to find weaknesses.

### 5. Summary of Findings

The "Credential Injection/Manipulation via Redash API or UI" threat poses a significant risk to Redash deployments.  Insufficient input validation, lack of parameterized queries, and weak authorization controls in the Data Source Management module, API endpoints, and UI components could allow attackers to inject malicious payloads or manipulate connection parameters. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, data modification, denial of service, and reputational damage. The likelihood of this threat being exploited is considered high due to the complexity of data source connections, the prevalence of injection vulnerabilities in web applications, and the attractiveness of Redash as a target.

### 6. Mitigation Strategies (Reiteration and Elaboration)

The provided mitigation strategies are crucial and should be implemented rigorously:

*   **Implement Robust Input Validation and Sanitization for Data Source Connection Parameters:**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:** Define strict whitelists for allowed characters, formats, and values for each connection parameter. Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Sanitize input based on the context in which it will be used. For example, if a parameter is used in a SQL query, apply SQL-specific escaping or encoding.
    *   **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific patterns and formats for connection parameters.
    *   **Input Length Limits:** Enforce reasonable length limits for all input fields to prevent buffer overflow or other length-based attacks.

*   **Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements:**
    *   **Mandatory Implementation:**  Ensure that all database interactions, especially those involving data source connection parameters, are performed using parameterized queries or prepared statements. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL and NoSQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Framework/Library Utilization:** Leverage the parameterized query features provided by the database drivers and frameworks used by Redash.

*   **Enforce Strong Authorization Checks for Data Source Creation/Modification:**
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control who can create, modify, and delete data sources.  Restrict these privileges to only necessary users and roles.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required for their tasks.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization at API Level:**  Ensure that API endpoints for data source management are properly authenticated and authorized to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Implement comprehensive audit logging for all data source creation, modification, and deletion activities to track changes and detect suspicious behavior.

*   **Regular Security Code Reviews and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Conduct regular security code reviews using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase. Perform dynamic analysis and penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable weaknesses in the deployed application.
    *   **Third-Party Security Audits:** Consider engaging third-party security experts to conduct independent security audits and penetration tests to gain an unbiased assessment of Redash's security posture.
    *   **Security Training for Developers:** Provide regular security training to the development team to educate them about common web application vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and the importance of security throughout the development lifecycle.

**Additional Mitigation Recommendations:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Redash Service Account:**  The Redash service account used to connect to data sources should be granted only the minimum necessary privileges required to perform its functions. Avoid using highly privileged accounts like database administrators.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Redash application and its data sources within a segmented network to limit the impact of a potential breach.
*   **Regular Security Updates and Patching:**  Keep Redash and all its dependencies (including database drivers, operating system, and libraries) up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS vulnerabilities in the Redash UI.
*   **Regular Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious activity related to data source connections and API access.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and continuously monitoring for potential vulnerabilities, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of "Credential Injection/Manipulation via Redash API or UI" and enhance the overall security of their Redash deployments.
