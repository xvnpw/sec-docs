# Attack Surface Analysis for getredash/redash

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into user inputs that are used to construct database queries within Redash.
*   **Redash Contribution:** Redash's core functionality of allowing users to write and execute SQL queries against connected data sources directly introduces this attack surface. Improper input sanitization in Redash query editor or parameter handling makes it vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A user crafts a malicious SQL query in Redash's query editor, injecting code that bypasses intended data access restrictions or extracts sensitive data from the database. For instance, in a query parameter, they might inject `'; DROP TABLE users; --` to attempt to delete the `users` table.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, data deletion, potential database server compromise, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Parameterization:**  Developers must ensure Redash properly sanitizes and parameterizes all user inputs used in query construction. Utilize prepared statements or parameterized queries provided by database drivers within Redash's backend.
    *   **Least Privilege Database Access:** Users should configure Redash to connect to databases with the least privileges necessary. Avoid granting Redash database users excessive permissions like `CREATE`, `DROP`, or `ALTER` unless absolutely required and carefully controlled.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Development team should conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on SQL injection vulnerabilities in Redash query execution paths.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates Redash to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.
*   **Redash Contribution:** Redash's ability to connect to various data sources and potentially interact with external services during query execution or data source configuration creates opportunities for SSRF if input validation is insufficient.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a data source connection string within Redash or crafts a query that forces Redash to make a request to an internal service (e.g., `http://internal-admin-panel`) or an external malicious site, potentially leaking internal information or exploiting vulnerabilities in those services.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential compromise of internal services, denial of service, exfiltration of data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Developers should deploy Redash within a network segment with restricted outbound access. Limit Redash's ability to connect to internal networks or the public internet to only strictly necessary resources.
    *   **Input Validation and Whitelisting in Redash:** Developers must implement strict input validation and whitelisting within Redash for allowed hosts and ports for data source connections and any features that make external requests. Prevent users from directly specifying arbitrary URLs in connection settings or queries where possible.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Users should disable or restrict Redash features that are not essential and might increase SSRF risk, such as integrations with external services if not strictly needed.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers circumvent Redash's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Redash Contribution:** Vulnerabilities within Redash's authentication logic, session management, or API authentication directly lead to this attack surface. This could stem from coding errors in Redash itself or using outdated versions with known flaws.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Redash's login process allows an attacker to craft a special request that bypasses password verification and grants them administrative or user access without valid credentials. Or, a flaw in Redash's API key generation or validation allows unauthorized API access.
*   **Impact:** Complete unauthorized access to Redash, data breaches, data manipulation, account takeover, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Redash Updated:** Developers and users must ensure Redash is regularly updated to the latest stable version to patch known authentication bypass vulnerabilities and other security flaws within Redash code.
    *   **Strong Password Policies and MFA:** Users should enforce strong password policies for all Redash users. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security, especially for administrative accounts within Redash.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Development team should conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on Redash's authentication mechanisms and access control implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages served by Redash and viewed by other Redash users.
*   **Redash Contribution:** Redash displays user-generated content, including query results, dashboard visualizations, and potentially user-defined dashboard elements. If Redash's frontend code doesn't properly sanitize this content before rendering it in the browser, XSS vulnerabilities are introduced.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a query name, dashboard title, or visualization description within Redash. When another user views this dashboard or query result in Redash, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting them to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf within Redash.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover within Redash, session hijacking, defacement of Redash dashboards, information theft, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding and Input Sanitization in Redash Frontend:** Developers must implement robust output encoding for all user-generated content displayed by Redash's frontend. Sanitize user inputs within Redash's backend to remove or neutralize potentially malicious scripts before storing them in the database.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Developers should implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) for Redash to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Development team should conduct regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on XSS vulnerabilities in Redash's UI and data rendering components.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Source Credential Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_source_credential_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive credentials for connected data sources are stored insecurely by Redash, making them vulnerable to compromise if Redash itself is compromised.
*   **Redash Contribution:** Redash's design requires storing credentials to connect to various data sources. How Redash manages and stores these credentials directly impacts this attack surface. If Redash stores them in plaintext or uses weak encryption, it becomes a vulnerability.
*   **Example:** Data source credentials are stored in plaintext in Redash's configuration files or database. An attacker gaining access to the Redash server or database could easily retrieve these credentials and compromise the connected data sources.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of connected data sources, data breaches affecting systems beyond Redash, unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by external databases.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Storage within Redash:** Developers should ensure Redash stores data source credentials securely using strong encryption mechanisms. Ideally, Redash should integrate with secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to retrieve credentials at runtime instead of storing them directly.
    *   **Access Control to Redash Configuration and Data:** Users should implement strict access controls to Redash's configuration files, database, and any systems where Redash stores credentials. Limit access to only authorized personnel and processes.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Development team and users should regularly audit Redash's credential storage mechanisms and access controls to ensure they remain secure and aligned with best practices.
