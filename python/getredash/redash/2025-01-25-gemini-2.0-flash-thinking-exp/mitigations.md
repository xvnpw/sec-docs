# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for getredash/redash

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Data Source Credentials (Redash Context)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_data_source_credentials__redash_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within Redash, navigate to the data source configuration settings.
    2.  For each configured data source, review the currently stored database credentials.
    3.  Verify that the database user associated with these credentials has only the *minimum* necessary privileges required for Redash to function with that specific data source. This typically means `SELECT` for read-only dashboards and potentially `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` only if write-back functionalities are explicitly used through Redash (which is less common).
    4.  If over-privileged accounts are identified, create new, restricted database user accounts directly within your database system.
    5.  Update the corresponding data source connection settings *within Redash* to use these newly created, least-privileged accounts.
    6.  Document the minimum required privileges for each data source type connected to Redash for future reference and consistency.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection Exploitation via Redash (Medium to High Severity):** If a SQL injection vulnerability exists in Redash itself or in how users construct queries *within Redash*, a compromised, overly privileged database account amplifies the potential damage.
    *   **Data Breach via Redash Compromise (High Severity):** If Redash is compromised, an attacker leveraging overly permissive database credentials *configured in Redash* can exfiltrate sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection Exploitation via Redash:** High impact reduction. Limits the potential damage from SQL injection vulnerabilities exploited through Redash queries.
    *   **Data Breach via Redash Compromise:** High impact reduction. Significantly reduces the scope of data accessible if Redash itself is compromised.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are using dedicated Redash database users, but a systematic review within Redash data source configurations is needed to ensure least privilege is consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  A focused review and tightening of database user privileges *specifically within Redash data source settings* across all connections. Documentation of required privileges per data source type for Redash.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Credential Management (Redash Context)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_credential_management__redash_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Examine how database credentials are currently managed *for Redash data sources*. Are they directly in Redash's database, configuration files, or environment variables?
    2.  If credentials are in Redash's database or configuration files, plan to migrate to environment variables or a secrets manager.
    3.  Configure Redash to read data source credentials from environment variables. This involves modifying Redash's configuration files or deployment scripts to utilize environment variables for database connection strings.
    4.  For enhanced security, consider integrating Redash with a secrets management solution. This would require configuring Redash to authenticate with and retrieve credentials from the secrets manager API.
    5.  Ensure access control to environment variables or the secrets manager is properly secured at the operating system or secrets management platform level.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Theft from Redash Server (High Severity):** If the Redash server is compromised, easily accessible credentials *stored within Redash's environment* can be stolen.
    *   **Exposure of Credentials in Redash Configuration (Medium Severity):** Storing credentials in Redash's configuration files increases the risk of accidental exposure through misconfigurations or unauthorized access to the server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Theft from Redash Server:** High impact reduction. Makes it harder to obtain credentials even if the Redash server is compromised by moving them outside of Redash's direct storage.
    *   **Exposure of Credentials in Redash Configuration:** Medium impact reduction. Reduces the risk of accidental credential exposure related to Redash's configuration.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Environment variables are used for some newer data sources *connected to Redash*, but older connections might still rely on less secure methods.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Complete migration to environment variables or a secrets manager *for all data source connections within Redash*. Standardize on environment variables for now as a minimum improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Query Parameterization (Redash User Education & Practice)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_query_parameterization__redash_user_education_&_practice_.md)

    3.  Map each Redash role to specific permissions *within Redash* (e.g., access to specific Redash data sources, query creation permissions in Redash, dashboard editing permissions in Redash, Redash user management permissions).
    4.  Assign users to Redash roles based on the principle of least privilege, granting them only the necessary access *within Redash*.
    5.  Regularly review and update Redash roles and permissions *within the Redash platform*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Redash Features and Data (Medium to High Severity):** Users with overly broad Redash permissions can access Redash features and data sources they shouldn't, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications *within Redash*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Redash (Medium Severity):**  Improperly defined Redash roles can allow users to gain unintended privileges *within the Redash system*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Redash Features and Data:** High impact reduction. Redash RBAC is crucial for controlling access to Redash functionalities and data sources *through Redash*.
