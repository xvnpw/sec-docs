### 4. Deep Analysis of Regular Permission Reviews (Redash User & Role Context)

#### 4.1. Strategy Breakdown and Effectiveness Against Threats

The "Regular Permission Reviews (Redash User & Role Context)" strategy is structured around a cyclical process of auditing and adjusting user permissions within the Redash platform. Let's analyze its effectiveness against each identified threat:

*   **Privilege Creep within Redash (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Effectiveness:** **High**. This strategy directly targets privilege creep. By regularly reviewing user roles and permissions, administrators can identify instances where users have accumulated unnecessary privileges over time. This might occur due to role changes, project completion, or simply users being granted overly broad permissions initially. The scheduled review process ensures that permissions are actively managed and aligned with current user needs within Redash.
    *   **Mechanism:** The audit process (step 2) is crucial. It involves comparing current user permissions against their current roles and responsibilities within the Redash context. This comparison highlights discrepancies and potential privilege creep. Step 4, "Remove or adjust Redash permissions," directly addresses the identified creep by rectifying excessive permissions.

*   **Orphaned Redash Accounts (Low to Medium Severity):**
    *   **Effectiveness:** **Medium to High**. Regular permission reviews indirectly address orphaned accounts. While the strategy description doesn't explicitly mention identifying inactive accounts, the review process naturally leads to their discovery. During reviews, administrators will likely encounter users who are no longer active in Redash or the organization.
    *   **Mechanism:**  Step 3, "Identify users who no longer require Redash access or whose Redash roles have changed," is key to addressing orphaned accounts.  Reviewing user activity logs (if available within Redash or externally) and consulting with team managers during the review process can help identify inactive users.  Removing access for these users in step 4 mitigates the risk associated with orphaned accounts.

#### 4.2. Impact Assessment

*   **Privilege Creep within Redash:**
    *   **Impact Reduction:** **Medium to High**.  Regular reviews can significantly reduce the impact of privilege creep. By proactively managing permissions, the likelihood of unauthorized access or actions due to excessive privileges is substantially decreased. The impact is medium because even with regular reviews, there's still a window of time between reviews where privilege creep can occur. However, the periodic nature of the reviews keeps this window contained and manageable.

*   **Orphaned Redash Accounts:**
    *   **Impact Reduction:** **Low to Medium**. The impact reduction for orphaned accounts is lower because the strategy is not solely focused on them. While reviews will likely identify orphaned accounts, the primary driver is permission management. The impact is still positive as it contributes to better account hygiene and reduces the attack surface. The severity of orphaned accounts is generally lower than privilege creep, hence the lower impact reduction is still valuable.

#### 4.3. Feasibility and Implementation within Redash

*   **Feasibility:** **High**. Implementing regular permission reviews within Redash is highly feasible. Redash provides the necessary administrative features to manage users, roles, and permissions.
    *   **Redash Features:** Redash's admin interface allows administrators to:
        *   View a list of users.
        *   View user roles (Admin, Default, Viewer).
        *   Assign users to groups (which can be used for permission management).
        *   Manage data sources and their permissions.
        *   Manage dashboards and queries and their permissions (indirectly through groups and roles).
    *   **Manual Implementation:** The described strategy is primarily manual, which aligns well with Redash's current capabilities.  Administrators can manually review user lists and permissions through the admin interface.
    *   **Automation Potential (Future):** While the initial strategy is manual, there is potential for future automation. Redash API could be leveraged to script parts of the review process, such as generating reports of user roles and last login times.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Define Review Schedule:** Determine the frequency of reviews (e.g., monthly, quarterly, bi-annually). Consider factors like user churn rate and sensitivity of data accessed through Redash.
    2.  **Assign Responsibility:** Clearly assign ownership of the review process to specific individuals or teams (e.g., Security team, Redash administrators, team leads).
    3.  **Document Review Procedure:** Create a documented procedure outlining the steps for conducting reviews, including:
        *   Identifying users to review (all users or a subset based on roles/groups).
        *   Gathering information (Redash user list, roles, last login times, team/department information).
        *   Consulting with team managers or stakeholders to verify user roles and access needs.
        *   Documenting review findings and decisions.
        *   Implementing necessary changes within Redash (adjusting roles, removing users).
        4.  **Conduct Initial Review:** Perform an initial review to establish a baseline and address any existing privilege creep or orphaned accounts.
    5.  **Establish Ongoing Review Cycle:** Implement the defined schedule for regular reviews and consistently follow the documented procedure.
    6.  **Track and Report:** Track review activities, findings, and actions taken. Generate reports to demonstrate compliance and identify trends.

#### 4.4. Benefits and Limitations

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Reduced Security Risk:** Directly mitigates privilege creep and reduces the risk associated with orphaned accounts within Redash.
    *   **Improved Access Control:** Enhances the overall access control posture of the Redash application.
    *   **Enhanced Compliance:** Supports compliance requirements related to user access management and data security audits.
    *   **Increased Visibility:** Provides better visibility into who has access to Redash and their assigned permissions.
    *   **Resource Optimization (Minor):** Removing orphaned accounts can potentially free up minor Redash resources (user licenses, database connections if applicable, though likely negligible).
    *   **Proactive Security Approach:** Shifts from a reactive to a proactive security approach by regularly managing user permissions.

*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Manual Effort:** The described strategy is primarily manual, requiring ongoing administrative effort. This can be time-consuming, especially in larger Redash deployments.
    *   **Potential for Human Error:** Manual reviews are susceptible to human error. Reviewers might overlook issues or make incorrect decisions.
    *   **Scope Limited to Redash:** This strategy focuses solely on permissions *within* Redash. It does not address access control outside of Redash, such as database access credentials used by Redash to connect to data sources.  If database access is not properly managed, Redash permission reviews alone are insufficient.
    *   **Review Frequency Trade-off:**  More frequent reviews are more effective but also more resource-intensive. Finding the right balance is crucial.
    *   **Lack of Automation (Initially):** The initial implementation is manual. Automation would improve efficiency and reduce human error in the long run, but requires additional effort to develop and implement.

#### 4.5. Cost and Resource Implications

*   **Implementation Cost:** **Low**. The primary cost is the time and effort required to:
    *   Define the review process and schedule.
    *   Document the review procedure.
    *   Conduct the initial review.
    *   Train personnel responsible for conducting reviews.
    *   No new software or hardware is likely required as it leverages existing Redash features.

*   **Ongoing Maintenance Cost:** **Medium**. The ongoing cost is primarily the time and effort required to:
    *   Conduct regular reviews according to the defined schedule.
    *   Document review findings and actions.
    *   Implement permission changes within Redash.
    *   Periodically review and update the review process itself.
    *   The cost will scale with the number of Redash users and the frequency of reviews.

#### 4.6. Alternative and Complementary Strategies

*   **Automated Permission Reporting:** Develop scripts or utilize Redash API to automate the generation of reports listing users, roles, permissions, and last login times. This can significantly reduce the manual effort in gathering information for reviews.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Optimization:**  Review and refine the existing Redash roles and group structure to ensure they are granular and aligned with the principle of least privilege. Well-defined RBAC minimizes the need for frequent permission adjustments.
*   **Integration with Identity Provider (IdP):** If not already implemented, consider integrating Redash with an Identity Provider (like Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace). This can centralize user management and potentially automate user provisioning and de-provisioning, which can complement regular reviews.
*   **User Activity Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement logging and monitoring of user activity within Redash. Set up alerts for suspicious activities or access patterns that might indicate privilege abuse or compromised accounts. This provides a continuous monitoring layer in addition to periodic reviews.
*   **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access (Less Applicable to Redash Roles):** JIT access is less directly applicable to Redash's role-based system. However, for highly sensitive data sources or functionalities, consider more stringent approval processes or temporary permission elevation workflows if Redash's features allow for such granular control.

#### 4.7. Implementation Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Initial Implementation:** Implement the manual regular permission review process as described. It provides immediate security benefits and establishes a foundation for future improvements.
2.  **Start with a Reasonable Review Frequency:** Begin with quarterly or bi-annual reviews and adjust the frequency based on experience and observed changes in user roles and permissions.
3.  **Document Everything:** Thoroughly document the review process, procedures, findings, and actions taken. This is crucial for consistency, auditability, and continuous improvement.
4.  **Leverage Redash API for Automation (Future Phase):** Explore the Redash API to automate report generation and potentially parts of the permission adjustment process in future iterations.
5.  **Integrate with Existing User Management Processes:** Align the Redash permission review process with broader organizational user access management policies and procedures.
6.  **Communicate the Process:** Inform Redash users about the regular permission review process to ensure transparency and cooperation.

#### 4.8. Metrics for Success

*   **Number of Permission Adjustments per Review Cycle:** Track the number of roles or permissions changed during each review. A high number initially might indicate significant privilege creep, which should decrease over time as reviews become routine.
*   **Number of Orphaned Accounts Identified and Disabled/Removed:** Monitor the number of inactive accounts identified and addressed during reviews.
*   **Time Spent per Review Cycle:** Track the time spent conducting each review cycle to optimize the process and identify areas for efficiency improvements.
*   **Feedback from Reviewers and Stakeholders:** Gather feedback on the review process to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
*   **Reduction in Security Incidents Related to Redash Access (Indirect):** While difficult to directly attribute, monitor for any reduction in security incidents or unauthorized data access related to Redash after implementing regular permission reviews.
