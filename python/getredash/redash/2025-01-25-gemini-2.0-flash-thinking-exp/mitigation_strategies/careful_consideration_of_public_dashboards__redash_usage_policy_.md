### 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy: Careful Consideration of Public Dashboards

#### 4.1. Description Breakdown and Analysis

The "Careful Consideration of Public Dashboards" strategy is composed of four key elements:

1.  **Establish a clear policy for public dashboard use:**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a foundational element. A policy provides a formal framework and guidelines for users. It sets expectations and defines acceptable use of public dashboards. Without a policy, there's no clear standard to adhere to, leading to inconsistent practices and increased risk.
    *   **Effectiveness:** High potential effectiveness. A well-defined policy proactively addresses the risk by setting rules and boundaries.
    *   **Feasibility:** Highly feasible. Policy creation is primarily a documentation and communication effort. Requires collaboration with stakeholders to define acceptable use cases and restrictions.

2.  **Rigorous review process for any dashboard intended to be made public in Redash:**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a crucial control to prevent accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive data. A review process acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring dashboards are vetted before being made public.  The "rigorous" aspect is key â€“ it needs to be more than a cursory glance.
    *   **Effectiveness:** High potential effectiveness. A robust review process can catch potential data leakage issues before they become public. Effectiveness depends on the thoroughness of the review and the expertise of the reviewers.
    *   **Feasibility:** Moderately feasible. Requires establishing a review workflow, defining roles and responsibilities (e.g., security team, data owners, dashboard creators), and potentially implementing tools to facilitate the review process.  May introduce some overhead to the dashboard publishing process.

3.  **Data sanitization or aggregation techniques should be applied to public dashboards to minimize sensitive information exposure through Redash visualizations:**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a technical control focused on reducing the sensitivity of data displayed on public dashboards. Techniques like aggregation, anonymization, masking, or removing granular details can significantly reduce the risk of data leakage even if a dashboard becomes public. This acknowledges that even with policy and review, mistakes can happen.
    *   **Effectiveness:** High potential effectiveness. Proactive data sanitization minimizes the impact of accidental public exposure. Effectiveness depends on the appropriate selection and implementation of sanitization techniques based on the data and visualization types.
    *   **Feasibility:** Moderately feasible to Highly feasible. Feasibility depends on the complexity of the data and the required sanitization techniques. Redash's query and visualization capabilities might offer built-in features for aggregation or data transformation.  Requires training users on data sanitization best practices within Redash.

4.  **Clearly communicate the risks of public dashboards to Redash users and provide guidelines for appropriate content:**
    *   **Analysis:** User awareness and education are vital.  Even with policies and processes, users need to understand the risks and their responsibilities. Clear communication ensures users are informed and can make responsible decisions when creating and publishing dashboards. Guidelines provide practical advice on what types of data are appropriate (or inappropriate) for public dashboards.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Medium to High effectiveness.  User awareness is a crucial layer of defense. Effective communication can significantly reduce unintentional data exposure.
    *   **Feasibility:** Highly feasible. Communication can be achieved through various channels like documentation, training sessions, internal newsletters, and embedded guidance within Redash itself (e.g., warnings when making a dashboard public).

#### 4.2. Threat Mitigation Analysis

The strategy directly addresses the identified threat: **Data Leakage via Public Dashboards (High Severity).**

*   **Policy and Review Process:** These are primarily *preventative* measures. They aim to stop sensitive dashboards from becoming public in the first place. The policy defines what's acceptable, and the review process acts as a checkpoint to enforce the policy.
*   **Data Sanitization:** This is a *mitigating* measure. Even if a dashboard *does* become public (despite policy and review failures), data sanitization reduces the severity of the leakage by minimizing the sensitive information exposed.
*   **User Communication:** This is both *preventative* and *awareness-building*. Informed users are less likely to unintentionally create risky public dashboards and are more likely to adhere to policies and best practices.

By combining these elements, the strategy provides a layered approach to mitigating the data leakage threat. It doesn't rely on a single control but uses a combination of policy, process, technical controls, and user education.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The strategy claims a **High impact reduction** in data leakage via public dashboards. This is a realistic assessment, *if implemented effectively*.

*   **High Impact Potential:**  A well-implemented strategy encompassing all four components can significantly reduce the risk.  Policy and review processes can prevent most accidental exposures. Data sanitization acts as a safety net. User awareness fosters a security-conscious culture.
*   **Dependency on Implementation:** The actual impact is heavily dependent on the *quality* of implementation. A weak policy, a superficial review process, poorly implemented sanitization, or ineffective communication will significantly reduce the impact.
*   **Residual Risk:** Even with a strong implementation, some residual risk will always remain.  No strategy is foolproof.  There's always a possibility of human error or unforeseen circumstances. However, this strategy aims to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.

#### 4.4. Implementation Analysis (Current vs. Missing)

*   **Currently Implemented: Partially implemented. Some awareness of public dashboard risks, but no formal policy or review process specifically for Redash public dashboards.**
    *   **Analysis:**  "Awareness" is a weak control on its own. Without formal policies and processes, awareness is unlikely to be consistently translated into secure practices. The "partially implemented" status indicates a significant gap in security posture regarding public dashboards.

*   **Missing Implementation: Formal policy for Redash public dashboard usage. Mandatory review process for public dashboards in Redash. Guidelines for data sanitization on public dashboards within Redash.**
    *   **Analysis:** These missing components are critical for the strategy's effectiveness. Their absence represents significant vulnerabilities.  Without them, the strategy is essentially incomplete and provides limited protection against data leakage.

#### 4.5. SWOT Analysis

| **Strengths**                                  | **Weaknesses**                                     | **Opportunities**                                      | **Threats**                                          |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Directly addresses a high-severity threat.     | Currently only partially implemented.              | Full implementation can significantly reduce risk.    | Lack of buy-in from users or management.             |
