### 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy

Let's proceed with a detailed analysis of each component of the "Secure Sharing of Dashboards and Queries (Redash Feature Usage)" mitigation strategy.

#### 4.1. Description Components Analysis

**1. Educate Redash users about Redash's sharing options (private, organization, public) and their security implications *within the Redash sharing context*.**

*   **Analysis:** This is a foundational step and crucial for user awareness.  Users need to understand the different sharing levels within Redash and the associated risks. Focusing "within the Redash sharing context" is important as it clarifies that this education is about Redash-specific features, not general data sharing principles (though those are related).
*   **Effectiveness:** High effectiveness in reducing accidental mis-sharing if done well.  Users who understand the options are less likely to make mistakes.
*   **Feasibility:** Relatively easy to implement. Can be achieved through documentation, training sessions, and internal communication.
*   **Potential Issues/Challenges:**  Requires ongoing effort. Initial training is not enough; reinforcement and readily available documentation are needed.  Users may still make mistakes if the information is not easily accessible or understood.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Develop clear and concise documentation explaining Redash sharing options with security implications highlighted (e.g., "Public links are accessible to anyone with the link and are discoverable").
    *   Incorporate security awareness training into onboarding for new Redash users and periodic refreshers for existing users.
    *   Consider in-app tooltips or help text within Redash itself to provide context-sensitive guidance on sharing options.

**2. Provide guidelines on appropriate use of each Redash sharing option. Discourage public links for sensitive data *shared via Redash*.**

*   **Analysis:**  Education is not enough; clear guidelines are needed to dictate *how* to use the sharing options appropriately.  Explicitly discouraging public links for sensitive data is vital.  This moves beyond awareness to policy and expected behavior.
*   **Effectiveness:** High effectiveness in preventing intentional or unintentional public sharing of sensitive data if guidelines are followed and enforced.
*   **Feasibility:**  Requires policy creation and communication. Enforcement can be challenging without technical controls (addressed in later points).
*   **Potential Issues/Challenges:**  Guidelines need to be practical and easy to follow. Overly restrictive guidelines might hinder legitimate use cases.  Enforcement relies on user compliance and potentially manual audits initially.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Create a formal "Redash Data Sharing Policy" document.
    *   Clearly define "sensitive data" within the policy to avoid ambiguity.
    *   Provide examples of appropriate and inappropriate use cases for each sharing option.
    *   Emphasize the principle of least privilege when sharing dashboards and queries.
    *   Communicate the policy clearly and regularly to all Redash users.

**3. Configure Redash to default new dashboards and queries to private visibility *within Redash settings, if possible*.**

*   **Analysis:**  This is a proactive technical control. Defaulting to private visibility significantly reduces the risk of accidental public or organization-wide sharing.  Leveraging Redash settings is the most efficient way to implement this.
*   **Effectiveness:** High effectiveness in preventing accidental over-sharing by making private the default.  Reduces the burden on users to remember to set visibility correctly.
*   **Feasibility:**  Technically feasible if Redash settings allow for default visibility configuration.  Requires checking Redash configuration options.
*   **Potential Issues/Challenges:**  May slightly impact user workflow initially if users are accustomed to different defaults.  Requires clear communication about the change in default behavior.  Need to verify if Redash actually offers this default setting.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Verify Redash Configuration:**  Check Redash documentation and settings to confirm if default visibility for new dashboards and queries can be configured.
    *   **Implement Default Private Visibility:** If configurable, immediately set the default visibility to "Private" for new dashboards and queries.
    *   **Communicate the Change:** Inform users about the change in default visibility and the reasons behind it.

**4. Implement policies or controls to restrict public links for sensitive data dashboards *shared through Redash*.**

*   **Analysis:** This is a crucial control to enforce the guidelines and prevent public sharing of sensitive data.  "Policies" reinforce the rules, while "controls" provide technical enforcement.  This point acknowledges the need for both policy and technical implementation.
*   **Effectiveness:** High effectiveness in preventing public sharing of sensitive data if controls are robust and policies are enforced.
*   **Feasibility:**  Feasibility depends on the capabilities of Redash and the organization's technical infrastructure.  Technical controls might require custom development or integration with other security tools if Redash doesn't offer built-in restrictions.
*   **Potential Issues/Challenges:**  Implementing technical controls can be complex and time-consuming.  May require changes to Redash configuration or even code modifications.  Need to balance security with usability; overly restrictive controls might hinder legitimate use cases.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Explore Redash Built-in Controls:** Investigate if Redash offers any built-in features to restrict public link creation or sharing based on data sensitivity or dashboard content.
    *   **Implement Data Sensitivity Tagging (If feasible):** If possible, implement a system to tag dashboards and queries with sensitivity levels.  Use these tags to enforce sharing restrictions.
    *   **Consider API-Based Controls:** If Redash API allows, explore developing custom scripts or integrations to monitor and restrict public link creation based on defined criteria.
    *   **Implement Approval Workflow (For Public Links):** For sensitive data use cases where public sharing might be necessary, implement an approval workflow to review and authorize public link creation.

**5. Regularly audit publicly shared dashboards and queries *within Redash* to ensure appropriate content and sharing settings.**

*   **Analysis:**  Auditing is essential for ongoing monitoring and enforcement.  Regular audits help detect and remediate accidental or unauthorized public sharing.  Focusing "within Redash" clarifies the scope of the audit.
*   **Effectiveness:** Medium to High effectiveness in detecting and correcting mis-sharing over time.  Provides a safety net and helps identify gaps in other controls or user understanding.
*   **Feasibility:**  Feasibility depends on the volume of dashboards and queries and the availability of tools for auditing Redash sharing settings.  Manual audits can be time-consuming; automation is desirable.
*   **Potential Issues/Challenges:**  Manual audits can be resource-intensive and prone to errors.  Automated auditing requires development effort and integration with Redash.  Defining clear audit criteria and remediation processes is crucial.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Develop an Audit Schedule:** Establish a regular schedule for auditing publicly shared dashboards and queries (e.g., weekly or monthly).
    *   **Automate Auditing (If possible):** Explore Redash API or database access to automate the process of identifying publicly shared content.  Develop scripts to generate reports of public links.
    *   **Define Audit Criteria:**  Establish clear criteria for what constitutes "inappropriate content" or "incorrect sharing settings" during audits.
    *   **Establish Remediation Process:** Define a clear process for addressing issues identified during audits, including contacting users, changing sharing settings, or removing public links.
    *   **Document Audit Findings:**  Keep records of audit findings and remediation actions to track trends and improve the overall mitigation strategy.

#### 4.2. Threats Mitigated Analysis

*   **Data Leakage via Public Redash Sharing (High Severity):**  Accidental public sharing of sensitive dashboards/queries *through Redash's public link feature*.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a critical threat directly addressed by the mitigation strategy. Public links, while convenient, pose a significant risk if not managed properly. The "High Severity" rating is justified as public exposure of sensitive data can have severe consequences (reputational damage, regulatory fines, competitive disadvantage).
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** The strategy, if fully implemented, is highly effective in mitigating this threat by reducing the likelihood of accidental public sharing through education, default settings, restrictions, and audits.

*   **Unauthorized Access via Organization-Wide Redash Sharing (Medium Severity):** Over-sharing within the organization *using Redash's organization sharing feature*.
    *   **Analysis:** This threat addresses the risk of sharing dashboards and queries with the entire organization when a more restricted audience is appropriate.  "Medium Severity" is reasonable as the impact is internal unauthorized access, less severe than public data leakage, but still undesirable.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** The strategy is moderately effective in mitigating this threat through education and guidelines promoting least privilege sharing.  Defaulting to private visibility also indirectly helps. However, the strategy could be strengthened by explicitly addressing organization-wide sharing in guidelines and audits.

#### 4.3. Impact Analysis

*   **Data Leakage via Public Redash Sharing:** High impact reduction. Reduces risk of accidental public exposure *through Redash sharing*.
    *   **Analysis:**  The stated impact is accurate.  By implementing the mitigation strategy, the risk of accidental public data leakage via Redash sharing features is significantly reduced.

*   **Unauthorized Access via Organization-Wide Redash Sharing:** Medium impact reduction. Promotes controlled sharing *within Redash*.
    *   **Analysis:** The stated impact is also accurate. The strategy promotes more controlled sharing within the organization, reducing the risk of unnecessary organization-wide access. However, the impact is medium because the strategy relies more on user behavior and less on strict technical controls for organization-wide sharing compared to public sharing.

#### 4.4. Currently Implemented & Missing Implementation Analysis

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Informal guidance on Redash sharing exists, but public sharing is enabled *in Redash*.
    *   **Analysis:** "Partially implemented" accurately reflects the current state. Informal guidance is a weak first step, but without formal policies, technical controls, and audits, the mitigation is incomplete and risks remain high.  "Public sharing is enabled" highlights a significant vulnerability.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal Redash sharing guidelines. Default private visibility in Redash. Controls to restrict public sharing *in Redash for sensitive content*. Regular audits of public Redash content. *Focus on Redash's sharing features*.
    *   **Analysis:** The "Missing Implementation" list accurately identifies the key gaps in the current mitigation strategy. Addressing these missing components is crucial to achieve a robust and effective security posture for Redash data sharing.  The emphasis on "Redash's sharing features" is important to keep the scope focused and actionable.
