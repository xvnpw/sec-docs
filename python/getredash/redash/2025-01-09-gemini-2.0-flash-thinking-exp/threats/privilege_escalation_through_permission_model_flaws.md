## Deep Analysis: Privilege Escalation through Permission Model Flaws in Redash

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Privilege Escalation through Permission Model Flaws" threat within the Redash application, as identified in the provided threat model. We will delve into potential attack vectors, technical details, impact assessment, and expand on the suggested mitigation strategies.

**1. Understanding the Threat in the Redash Context:**

Redash relies on a permission model to control access to its various functionalities, including:

* **Data Sources:** Connecting to and managing databases and other data sources.
* **Queries:** Creating, editing, and executing queries.
* **Visualizations:** Building and managing charts and dashboards.
* **Dashboards:** Organizing visualizations and sharing insights.
* **Users and Groups:** Managing user accounts and their roles/permissions.
* **Settings:** Configuring Redash instance-wide parameters.

The core of this threat lies in potential weaknesses within the code and logic that governs these permissions. If an attacker with limited privileges can manipulate the system to bypass or circumvent these checks, they can gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.

**2. Potential Threat Actors and Their Motivations:**

* **Malicious Insider:** A Redash user with legitimate but limited access (e.g., a data analyst with query creation permissions) who seeks to gain broader control for malicious purposes (e.g., accessing sensitive data sources, disrupting operations, exfiltrating information).
* **Compromised Account:** An attacker who has gained access to a legitimate Redash user account with limited privileges through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means. They then use this foothold to escalate their privileges.
* **External Attacker (Post-Initial Access):** An attacker who has already gained some initial access to the Redash server or network (e.g., through a separate vulnerability) and is now leveraging Redash's permission flaws to gain deeper control within the application.

**Motivations:**

* **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data from connected data sources.
* **System Disruption:** Modifying critical settings, deleting resources, or disabling the Redash instance.
* **Lateral Movement:** Using Redash as a stepping stone to access other systems within the network accessible through Redash's data source connections.
* **Reputational Damage:** Compromising the integrity of data or dashboards, leading to incorrect reporting and loss of trust.
* **Financial Gain:**  Depending on the data and systems accessible through Redash, the attacker could potentially gain financially.

**3. Detailed Analysis of Potential Attack Vectors:**

This section explores specific ways an attacker could exploit flaws in Redash's permission model:

* **Inconsistent Permission Checks:**
    * **UI vs. API Discrepancies:** Permissions might be enforced differently through the Redash web interface compared to its API endpoints. An attacker might find API calls that lack the same level of authorization checks as their corresponding UI actions.
    * **Granularity Issues:** Permission checks might be too broad. For example, a user might have permission to "manage queries" without fine-grained control over *which* queries they can manage, potentially allowing them to modify queries belonging to administrators.
* **Missing Authorization Checks:**
    * **Newly Introduced Features:**  New functionalities might be added without proper integration into the existing permission model, leaving them vulnerable.
    * **Edge Cases and Unforeseen Interactions:** Complex interactions between different features might create scenarios where authorization checks are missed.
* **Logic Flaws in Permission Evaluation:**
    * **Role Hierarchy Issues:**  If roles and permissions are not correctly structured or evaluated, an attacker might be able to manipulate their role or group memberships to gain unintended privileges.
    * **Incorrect "OR" vs. "AND" Logic:**  Permissions might be incorrectly combined using logical operators, leading to overly permissive access.
    * **Race Conditions:** In concurrent scenarios, a race condition in permission checks could allow an attacker to perform an action before their permissions are fully evaluated or revoked.
* **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) in Permission Context:**
    * An attacker might be able to manipulate object IDs (e.g., query IDs, data source IDs) in API requests to access or modify resources they shouldn't have access to, even if general permission checks are in place.
* **Exploiting Default Permissions or Weak Configurations:**
    * Default roles or permissions might be overly permissive.
    * Misconfigured settings could inadvertently grant broader access than intended.
* **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:**
    * If Redash relies on external libraries for authentication or authorization, vulnerabilities in those libraries could be exploited to bypass Redash's internal permission model.
* **API Key Exploitation (if applicable):**
    * If API keys are used for authentication, vulnerabilities in their management or usage could lead to privilege escalation. For example, if an attacker can obtain an API key with higher privileges.
* **SQL Injection in Permission-Related Queries:**
    * Although less likely in the core permission model, if database queries are used to determine permissions and are vulnerable to SQL injection, an attacker could manipulate these queries to grant themselves higher privileges.

**4. Impact Assessment (Expanded):**

The consequences of a successful privilege escalation attack can be severe:

* **Full Control of Redash Instance:** The attacker gains administrative privileges, allowing them to:
    * **Manage Users and Groups:** Create new admin accounts, elevate their own privileges, revoke access for legitimate users.
    * **Manage Data Sources:** Access sensitive data sources, potentially modify or delete data, create new malicious data sources.
    * **Modify Queries and Visualizations:** Access sensitive query logic, steal intellectual property, manipulate data displayed in dashboards, potentially leading to incorrect business decisions.
    * **Modify System Settings:** Disable security features, expose sensitive information, disrupt service availability.
* **Data Breach and Exfiltration:** Accessing and stealing sensitive data from connected databases and other data sources.
* **Service Disruption and Denial of Service:**  Disabling the Redash instance, deleting critical resources, or overloading the system.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Compromised dashboards and data can lead to a loss of trust from users and stakeholders.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Unauthorized access to and modification of data can lead to breaches of regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
* **Lateral Movement and Further Compromise:** Using Redash as a pivot point to access other systems and resources within the network.
* **Financial Loss:**  Due to data breaches, service disruption, legal repercussions, and recovery costs.

**5. Expanding on Mitigation Strategies:**

The initial mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's elaborate on them and add more specific recommendations:

* **Thoroughly Review and Test the Redash Permission Model for Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Code Audits:** Conduct regular and thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on the permission management module and related code. Look for the potential attack vectors outlined above.
    * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase related to authorization and access control.
    * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to test the running application for permission-related flaws by simulating real-world attacks.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Engage experienced security professionals to perform penetration testing, specifically targeting privilege escalation vulnerabilities within Redash.
    * **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to test the robustness of the permission model by providing unexpected or malformed inputs.
* **Implement the Principle of Least Privilege within Redash:**
    * **Granular Roles and Permissions:** Define specific and granular roles with the minimum necessary permissions required for each role. Avoid broad, overly permissive roles.
    * **Default-Deny Approach:**  Permissions should be explicitly granted rather than implicitly allowed. Start with a restrictive permission set and grant access only when necessary.
    * **Regularly Review and Refine Roles:**  As the application evolves, review and adjust roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and secure.
    * **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Consider implementing ABAC for more fine-grained control based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental factors.
* **Regularly Audit User Permissions and Roles within Redash:**
    * **Automated Auditing:** Implement automated scripts or tools to regularly review user permissions and identify any deviations from the intended configuration.
    * **Manual Reviews:**  Periodically conduct manual reviews of user roles and permissions to ensure they align with business needs and security policies.
    * **Log Analysis:** Monitor Redash logs for suspicious activity related to permission changes or attempts to access unauthorized resources.
    * **Implement a Clear Process for Granting and Revoking Permissions:** Ensure there is a well-defined and documented process for managing user access and permissions.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs to prevent manipulation of permission-related parameters.
    * **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which could potentially be used to manipulate the UI and bypass permission checks.
    * **Secure API Design:**  Design API endpoints with security in mind, ensuring proper authentication and authorization for all requests.
    * **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials or Sensitive Information:**  Store sensitive information securely and avoid hardcoding it in the codebase.
* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * Educate developers and administrators about common privilege escalation vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
* **Keep Redash Up-to-Date:**
    * Regularly update Redash to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
* **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * Enforce MFA for all Redash users to add an extra layer of security against account compromise.
* **Network Segmentation:**
    * Isolate the Redash instance within a secure network segment to limit the impact of a potential breach.
* **Implement Rate Limiting:**
    * Protect API endpoints related to permission management with rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks or excessive requests.
