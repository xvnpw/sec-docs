## Deep Dive Threat Analysis: Query Manipulation in Redash

This document provides a detailed analysis of the "Query Manipulation leading to Information Disclosure or Data Modification" threat within the context of a Redash application.

**1. Threat Analysis:**

This threat leverages the inherent functionality of Redash, which allows users to create and execute queries against connected data sources. The core vulnerability lies in the potential for authorized Redash users, or potentially attackers who have gained unauthorized access to Redash accounts, to craft and execute queries that go beyond their intended or authorized scope.

**Breakdown of the Attack:**

* **Attacker Profile:**  The attacker is assumed to have some level of access to the Redash platform. This could be a legitimate user with overly broad permissions, a compromised user account, or potentially an insider threat.
* **Attack Vector:** The primary attack vector is the **Query Editor** within Redash. An attacker can directly type or modify existing queries.
* **Malicious Query Construction:**  Attackers can craft malicious queries in several ways:
    * **Unauthorized Data Access:**  Queries can be crafted to select data from tables or columns the user is not intended to access. This bypasses application-level access controls if the underlying database permissions are not properly configured or if Redash doesn't enforce granular permissions.
    * **Data Aggregation and Inference:**  Even without direct access to sensitive columns, attackers might be able to infer sensitive information by aggregating and analyzing seemingly innocuous data.
    * **Data Modification (if permissions allow):** If the connected database user associated with Redash has write permissions, malicious queries can perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations. This is a significant risk if Redash doesn't provide adequate safeguards.
    * **Exploiting Database-Specific Features:** Attackers familiar with the underlying database system could leverage specific SQL features or functions for malicious purposes.
    * **Bypassing Redash's Intended Logic:**  Attackers might find ways to manipulate queries to bypass intended filtering or logic implemented within Redash visualizations or dashboards.

**Key Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Redash User Authentication and Authorization:** The security of this threat heavily relies on the effectiveness of Redash's user authentication and authorization mechanisms. Weak passwords, compromised accounts, or overly permissive role assignments increase the risk.
* **Underlying Database Permissions:** The permissions granted to the database user that Redash uses to connect to the data source are critical. If this user has excessive privileges, Redash's own access controls might be circumvented.
* **Redash's Query Execution Engine:** The security of the query execution engine is important. While Redash itself doesn't typically introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities in the traditional sense (as the user is directly writing the SQL), it's crucial that the engine handles query execution securely and doesn't introduce unintended side effects.
* **Auditing and Logging:** The effectiveness of detecting and responding to this threat depends on robust auditing and logging capabilities within Redash.

**2. Technical Details:**

* **Query Editor:** This is the primary interface for crafting and modifying queries. It typically offers features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion, but these features do not inherently prevent malicious query construction.
* **Query Execution Engine:** This component takes the user-defined query and executes it against the connected data source using the configured database connection. It's crucial that this engine respects the underlying database permissions.
* **Data Source Connections:** Redash stores connection details for various data sources. The permissions associated with these connections are paramount.
* **User and Group Management:** Redash's user and group management features are used to control access to data sources and potentially other Redash functionalities. Misconfigured user roles can exacerbate this threat.
* **Query Parameters:** While intended for security (preventing SQL injection in some contexts), improper use of query parameters could still be exploited if the underlying logic is flawed.

**3. Attack Vectors (Detailed):**

* **Direct Query Manipulation by Authorized Users:**  A user with legitimate access to the Query Editor crafts a malicious query. This is the most straightforward attack vector.
* **Compromised Redash Account:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a legitimate Redash user account (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in Redash's authentication). They can then use the compromised account to create and execute malicious queries.
* **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate Redash access intentionally crafts queries for unauthorized data access or modification.
* **Exploiting Weak Permissions:**  If Redash's permission model is not granular enough or if administrators assign overly broad permissions, attackers can exploit these weaknesses.
* **Social Engineering:** An attacker might trick a legitimate user into running a malicious query they have crafted.

**4. Impact Assessment (Expanded):**

* **Confidentiality Breach:**
    * **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:**  Attackers can access personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, trade secrets, health records, or other confidential information stored in the connected data sources.
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker can extract the retrieved data from Redash through various means (e.g., downloading query results, copying data from visualizations).
* **Integrity Breach:**
    * **Data Corruption:** Malicious queries can modify or delete critical data in the connected databases, leading to inaccurate reporting, business disruption, and potential financial losses.
    * **Data Falsification:** Attackers could manipulate data to hide fraudulent activities or misrepresent information.
* **Availability Breach (Less Likely but Possible):**
    * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Extremely complex or inefficient malicious queries could potentially overload the database, leading to performance degradation or denial of service. This is less likely to be the primary goal of this threat but could be a side effect.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack leading to data breaches or data corruption can severely damage the organization's reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to legal liabilities.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA).

**5. Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this threat being exploited depends on several factors:

* **Complexity of Redash Permissions:**  If Redash's permission model is complex and difficult to configure correctly, misconfigurations are more likely, increasing the likelihood of exploitation.
* **Awareness and Training:**  Lack of awareness among Redash users about the risks of malicious queries and the importance of secure query practices increases the likelihood.
* **Strength of Authentication:** Weak passwords or lack of multi-factor authentication for Redash accounts increase the likelihood of account compromise.
* **Underlying Database Security:**  If the underlying databases lack proper access controls, Redash's limitations become less relevant, and the likelihood of successful exploitation increases.
* **Presence of Sensitive Data:**  Organizations storing highly sensitive data in connected data sources are a more attractive target, increasing the likelihood of targeted attacks.
* **Internal Threat Landscape:**  The presence of disgruntled or malicious insiders increases the likelihood of this threat being exploited.

**Given the potential impact and the inherent flexibility of SQL queries, the initial "High" risk severity assessment is justified.**

**6. Detailed Mitigation Strategies (Expanded):**

* **Implement the Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access:**
    * **Granular Database Permissions:** Ensure the database user used by Redash has the absolute minimum necessary permissions to perform its intended functions. This should be on a table and column level, restricting write access where not explicitly required.
    * **Separate Read and Write Accounts:** Consider using separate database accounts for Redash, with a read-only account for most visualizations and a separate, more restricted account for specific write operations (if absolutely necessary).
* **Implement Query Review and Approval Processes within Redash:**
    * **Workflow Integration:** Utilize Redash's features or integrate with external workflow tools to require review and approval for queries against sensitive data sources or those involving write operations.
    * **Designated Reviewers:** Assign specific individuals or teams responsible for reviewing queries before execution.
    * **Automated Analysis:** Explore tools that can perform static analysis of SQL queries to identify potentially malicious or risky patterns.
* **Consider Using Parameterized Queries Where Possible within Redash's Query Editor:**
    * **Educate Users:** Train users on the benefits and proper usage of parameterized queries.
    * **Enforce Parameterization:**  Where feasible, configure Redash or develop custom extensions to encourage or enforce the use of parameters, especially for user-provided input.
    * **Note on Limitations:** While parameterized queries help prevent traditional SQL injection where user input is directly injected into the query string, they don't completely prevent malicious query construction by authorized users.
* **Monitor Query Execution Logs within Redash for Suspicious Activity:**
    * **Centralized Logging:** Ensure Redash logs are forwarded to a centralized security information and event management (SIEM) system for analysis.
    * **Alerting Rules:** Configure alerts for suspicious query patterns, such as:
        * Queries accessing tables or columns rarely accessed by the user.
        * Queries performing `DELETE` or `UPDATE` operations (especially if these are not common).
        * Queries with unusual syntax or keywords.
        * High volumes of data being retrieved.
        * Queries executed outside of normal business hours.
    * **Regular Review:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing query logs for anomalies.
* **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Redash:**
    * **Granular Permissions:** Define roles with specific permissions to access data sources, create/modify queries, and manage dashboards.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Assign users to roles that grant them only the necessary access to perform their job functions.
    * **Regular Review of Roles and Assignments:** Periodically review user roles and assignments to ensure they remain appropriate.
* **Secure Redash Instance:**
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep the Redash instance up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    * **Secure Network Configuration:**  Restrict access to the Redash instance to authorized networks and individuals.
    * **Input Validation:** While Redash primarily deals with SQL, ensure any other input fields within the application are properly validated to prevent other types of attacks.
* **Data Masking and Anonymization:**
    * **Implement Data Masking:**  Consider masking sensitive data at the database level or within Redash visualizations to limit the exposure of sensitive information.
    * **Data Anonymization:** For certain use cases, anonymize data before it's accessible through Redash.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Redash configuration and deployment.
    * **Test Access Controls:** Specifically test the effectiveness of Redash's access controls and the underlying database permissions.
* **User Training and Awareness:**
    * **Security Best Practices:** Educate Redash users about the risks of malicious queries and the importance of secure query practices.
    * **Reporting Suspicious Activity:** Encourage users to report any suspicious query activity they observe.

**7. Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Query Logging:**  Redash provides query execution logs. Ensure these logs are enabled and configured to capture relevant information (user, query text, execution time, status).
* **Database Audit Logs:**  Enable and monitor audit logs on the connected databases to track data access and modification activities.
* **SIEM Integration:** Integrate Redash and database logs with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and alerting.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection rules within the SIEM to identify unusual query patterns or data access behaviors.
* **Alerting Mechanisms:** Configure alerts for suspicious activity based on log analysis.
* **Regular Review of Logs:**  Establish a process for security teams to regularly review Redash and database logs for potential security incidents.

**8. Prevention Best Practices (Beyond Mitigation):**

* **Secure Development Practices:**  If developing custom extensions or integrations for Redash, follow secure development practices to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities.
* **Infrastructure Security:**  Ensure the underlying infrastructure hosting Redash is secure, including proper patching, firewall configurations, and intrusion detection systems.
* **Data Governance Policies:**  Establish clear data governance policies that define who can access what data and under what circumstances.
* **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop an incident response plan to handle potential security breaches related to query manipulation.

**9. Specific Redash Considerations:**

* **Data Source Permissions:**  Leverage Redash's built-in features for managing data source permissions and access control.
* **Query Ownership and Sharing:** Be mindful of how queries are shared and who has access to modify them.
* **Visualization Security:**  Ensure that visualizations do not inadvertently expose sensitive data or allow for further data manipulation.
* **API Security:** If Redash's API is used, ensure it is properly secured and authenticated to prevent unauthorized access and query execution.

**10. Conclusion:**

The "Query Manipulation leading to Information Disclosure or Data Modification" threat is a significant concern for Redash deployments, primarily due to the inherent power and flexibility of SQL queries. A multi-layered approach combining robust access controls within Redash and the underlying databases, query review processes, monitoring, and user training is essential to mitigate this risk effectively. Organizations using Redash must prioritize securing their data sources and implementing appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and data manipulation through malicious queries. Regularly reviewing and updating security measures is crucial to adapt to evolving threats and maintain a strong security posture.
