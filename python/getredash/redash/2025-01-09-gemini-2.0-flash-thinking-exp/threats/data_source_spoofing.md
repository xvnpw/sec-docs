## Deep Dive Analysis: Data Source Spoofing Threat in Redash

This document provides a detailed analysis of the "Data Source Spoofing" threat identified in the Redash application threat model. We will delve into the attack mechanics, potential impacts, likelihood, and expand on mitigation strategies, providing actionable insights for the development team.

**1. Threat Breakdown and Attack Mechanics:**

The core of this threat lies in an attacker's ability to manipulate the connection details of a configured data source within Redash. This manipulation redirects queries intended for a legitimate database or API to a server controlled by the attacker. Let's break down the typical attack flow:

* **Initial Access:** The attacker needs sufficient privileges within Redash to modify data source configurations. This could be achieved through:
    * **Compromised User Account:** An attacker gains access to a legitimate Redash user account with the necessary permissions (e.g., an admin or a user with "Manage Data Sources" privileges).
    * **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with lower privileges exploits a vulnerability within Redash to elevate their permissions.
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious or compromised insider with legitimate access to Redash configuration settings.
* **Data Source Modification:** Once access is gained, the attacker navigates to the data source management section within Redash. They identify a target data source and modify its connection parameters. This could involve changing:
    * **Hostname/IP Address:** Pointing to the attacker's malicious server.
    * **Port Number:** Directing traffic to a specific service on the attacker's server.
    * **Credentials (if applicable):**  While less likely for immediate spoofing, the attacker might also attempt to steal or modify credentials for later use or to further compromise the legitimate data source.
    * **Database Name/Schema:**  Depending on the data source type, these parameters could be manipulated to target specific resources on the attacker's server.
    * **SSL/TLS Settings:**  The attacker might disable or downgrade security settings to facilitate interception of communication.
* **Query Execution and Data Interception/Injection:**  When a Redash user executes a query that targets the spoofed data source, the request is now sent to the attacker's server.
    * **Data Interception:** The attacker can capture the query itself, including potentially sensitive information embedded within it (e.g., filters, parameters). They can also capture authentication details if they are being passed in the connection string (though Redash typically handles this securely).
    * **Data Injection:** The attacker's server can respond with fabricated or manipulated data. This data will be presented to the Redash user as if it originated from the legitimate source.
* **Persistence (Optional):** The attacker might maintain the spoofed configuration for an extended period to continuously intercept data or inject malicious information.

**2. Deeper Impact Analysis:**

While the initial impact description is accurate, let's expand on the potential consequences:

* **Data Integrity Compromise:** This is the most direct impact. Redash users will be presented with incorrect or fabricated data, leading to:
    * **Flawed Business Intelligence:**  Reports, dashboards, and visualizations will be based on unreliable information, leading to poor decision-making.
    * **Erosion of Trust:** Users will lose confidence in the data presented by Redash, potentially undermining its value.
    * **Compliance Violations:** If Redash is used for reporting sensitive or regulated data, manipulated data could lead to legal and regulatory repercussions.
* **Credential Theft (Indirect):** While the primary goal isn't direct credential theft from the legitimate database, the attacker could:
    * **Capture Credentials Passed Through Redash:** If users are embedding credentials within queries (a bad practice, but possible), the attacker could intercept them.
    * **Phishing Attacks:** The attacker could craft responses that mimic legitimate data source errors, prompting users to enter their credentials, which are then captured by the attacker.
* **Lateral Movement Potential:** If the spoofed data source is a system within the organization's network, the attacker could potentially use this as a stepping stone for further attacks. For example, if the spoofed server is configured to exploit vulnerabilities in other internal systems.
* **Reputational Damage:** If the data manipulation leads to significant errors or public disclosure of incorrect information, the organization's reputation could be severely damaged.
* **System Instability:**  Depending on the attacker's malicious server, it could potentially overload Redash or other systems if it sends back large amounts of data or triggers unexpected behavior.
* **Supply Chain Attacks (Indirect):** If Redash is used to monitor or interact with third-party data sources, spoofing could be used to inject malicious data into the supply chain, potentially impacting downstream processes.

**3. Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this threat being exploited depends on several factors:

* **Redash Access Control Maturity:**  Weak or poorly enforced access control policies significantly increase the likelihood. If many users have the ability to manage data sources, the attack surface is larger.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Lack of awareness among Redash users about phishing or social engineering tactics could lead to compromised accounts.
* **Vulnerability Management Practices:**  Unpatched vulnerabilities in Redash itself could be exploited for privilege escalation.
* **Internal Threat Landscape:**  The presence of disgruntled or compromised insiders increases the risk.
* **Complexity of Data Source Management:**  If the data source configuration process is complex and not well-documented, it might be easier for attackers to make subtle changes that go unnoticed.

**Given the potential impact and the possibility of gaining sufficient privileges through various means, the "High" risk severity assigned is justified.**

**4. Detailed Mitigation Strategies and Enhancements:**

Let's expand on the proposed mitigation strategies and add more technical depth:

* **Implement Strict Access Control Policies for Managing Data Sources within Redash:**
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a granular RBAC system within Redash. Clearly define roles with specific permissions related to data source management (e.g., "Data Source Admin," "Data Source Viewer").
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid granting broad "admin" privileges unnecessarily.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all Redash users, especially those with administrative privileges, to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise.
    * **Regular Access Reviews:** Periodically review user roles and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and remove access for individuals who no longer require it.
    * **Session Management:** Implement appropriate session timeouts and controls to limit the window of opportunity for attackers with compromised credentials.

* **Regularly Audit Data Source Configurations within Redash for Unexpected Changes:**
    * **Audit Logging:** Ensure comprehensive audit logging is enabled within Redash, specifically tracking changes to data source configurations (creation, modification, deletion). These logs should include timestamps, user IDs, and the specific changes made.
    * **Automated Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement automated tools or scripts to monitor the audit logs for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized modifications to data source connections. Alert security teams or administrators immediately upon detection.
    * **Configuration Baselines:** Establish a baseline of legitimate data source configurations. Regularly compare the current configurations against the baseline to identify deviations.
    * **Integrity Checks:** Consider implementing mechanisms to periodically verify the integrity of data source configurations, potentially using checksums or digital signatures.

* **Consider Implementing Mechanisms within Redash to Verify the Identity of Data Sources:**
    * **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** For data sources that support it, implement mTLS authentication. This requires both Redash and the data source to authenticate each other using digital certificates, significantly reducing the risk of connecting to a spoofed server.
    * **Whitelisting:**  Implement a whitelist of allowed data source endpoints. Redash should only allow connections to explicitly approved servers.
    * **Connection String Validation:**  Implement checks within Redash to validate the format and content of connection strings, looking for suspicious patterns or deviations from expected values.
    * **Secure Credential Management:**  Avoid storing data source credentials directly in the Redash configuration. Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate them with Redash.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While primarily for web browser security, a well-configured CSP can help prevent Redash from inadvertently loading malicious content if the attacker manages to inject it through the spoofed data source.

**5. Detection and Monitoring Strategies:**

Beyond the mitigation strategies, it's crucial to have mechanisms to detect if a data source spoofing attack has occurred:

* **Anomaly Detection in Query Execution:** Monitor query execution patterns for unusual destinations or connection attempts to unexpected servers.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network traffic originating from the Redash server for connections to unfamiliar or suspicious IP addresses and ports.
* **Data Integrity Monitoring:** Implement checks to detect inconsistencies or anomalies in the data returned by queries. This could involve comparing data against historical trends or known good values.
* **User Behavior Analytics (UBA):** Monitor user activity for unusual behavior, such as a user with limited data source management privileges suddenly modifying configurations.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Integration:** Integrate Redash audit logs with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and correlation with other security events.

**6. Prevention Best Practices:**

Beyond the specific threat, general security best practices are crucial:

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments of the Redash application and infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Keep Redash and Dependencies Updated:**  Apply security patches and updates promptly to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Infrastructure:** Ensure the underlying infrastructure hosting Redash is secure, with proper network segmentation, firewalls, and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
* **Secure Development Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities in Redash itself.

**7. Conclusion:**

Data Source Spoofing is a significant threat to the integrity and trustworthiness of data within Redash. By understanding the attack mechanics, potential impacts, and implementing robust mitigation, detection, and prevention strategies, we can significantly reduce the risk. The development team should prioritize implementing the enhanced mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, focusing on strengthening access controls, improving auditability, and exploring mechanisms for verifying data source identity. Continuous monitoring and proactive security assessments are also essential to maintain a strong security posture.
