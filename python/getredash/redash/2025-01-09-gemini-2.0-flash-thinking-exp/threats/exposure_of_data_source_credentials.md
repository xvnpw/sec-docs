## Deep Dive Threat Analysis: Exposure of Data Source Credentials in Redash

This document provides a detailed analysis of the "Exposure of Data Source Credentials" threat within the context of the Redash application. We will explore the technical intricacies, potential attack vectors, impact, likelihood, and provide actionable mitigation strategies for the development team.

**1. Threat Identification and Context:**

* **Threat Name:** Exposure of Data Source Credentials
* **Application:** Redash (specifically the data source configuration storage component)
* **Severity:** Critical
* **Underlying Vulnerability:** Insecure storage of sensitive data (data source credentials)
* **Attacker Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to connected data sources.

**2. Technical Deep Dive:**

The core vulnerability lies in how Redash manages and stores the credentials required to connect to various data sources (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, etc.). Potential insecure storage locations and mechanisms within Redash include:

* **Configuration Files (e.g., `redash.conf`):**
    * **Plain Text Storage:** Credentials might be directly embedded as plain text values for configuration parameters. This is the most egregious and easily exploitable scenario.
    * **Weak Encryption:**  Credentials might be encrypted using weak or easily reversible encryption algorithms, rendering the encryption ineffective against a determined attacker.
    * **Shared Secrets:**  Using a single, static encryption key for all credentials, which if compromised, unlocks all data sources.
* **Database Storage:**
    * **Plain Text Storage in `data_sources` Table:**  Credentials might be stored directly in the `data_sources` table (or equivalent) without any encryption or hashing.
    * **Weak Encryption in Database:** Similar to configuration files, using weak or easily reversible encryption within the database.
    * **Lack of Access Controls:** Insufficient access controls on the `data_sources` table allowing unauthorized users or processes to read the credentials.
* **Environment Variables:**
    * **Direct Storage:** While slightly better than configuration files, storing credentials directly in environment variables can still be vulnerable if the server environment is compromised or if the application logs expose these variables.
* **Codebase (Less Likely but Possible):**
    * **Hardcoded Credentials:**  Accidentally hardcoding credentials within the application code itself, although highly unlikely in a mature project like Redash.
* **Logging:**
    * **Accidental Logging:** Credentials might be inadvertently logged during the data source connection process or during debugging, potentially exposing them in log files.

**3. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through various means, depending on their access level and the specific weaknesses in Redash's implementation:

* **Server Compromise:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Redash itself or its underlying infrastructure (operating system, web server) to execute arbitrary code on the server. This grants the attacker direct access to the filesystem and database.
    * **Web Application Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities like SQL Injection (if Redash interacts with its own database insecurely), Local File Inclusion (LFI) to access configuration files, or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to potentially access internal resources where credentials might be stored.
    * **Weak Authentication/Authorization:** Brute-forcing or exploiting weaknesses in Redash's user authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain administrative access.
* **Insider Threat:**
    * **Malicious or Negligent Employees:** Individuals with legitimate access to the Redash server or its configuration files could intentionally or accidentally expose the credentials.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    * **Compromised Dependencies:** If Redash relies on third-party libraries with vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these to gain access to the server and subsequently the credentials.
* **Misconfiguration:**
    * **Insecure Permissions:** Incorrect file system permissions on configuration files or database backups could allow unauthorized access.
    * **Publicly Accessible Backups:** If database backups containing credentials are stored in publicly accessible locations.

**Scenario Example:**

1. An attacker identifies a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Redash application.
2. They successfully exploit this vulnerability, gaining shell access to the Redash server.
3. The attacker navigates the file system and locates the `redash.conf` file.
4. They open the file and find the database credentials for the connected PostgreSQL database stored in plain text.
5. Using these credentials, the attacker connects directly to the PostgreSQL database, bypassing Redash's access controls.
6. They execute malicious SQL queries to exfiltrate sensitive customer data or modify critical records.

**4. Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

The impact of this threat being realized is **critical** due to the potential for severe consequences:

* **Direct and Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Attackers gain unfettered access to the connected data sources, potentially containing highly sensitive information like customer PII, financial records, intellectual property, and trade secrets.
* **Data Breach:** This direct access can lead to large-scale data breaches, resulting in significant financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities (e.g., GDPR, CCPA violations), and loss of customer trust.
* **Data Modification or Deletion:** Attackers can not only steal data but also modify or delete crucial information, leading to business disruption, inaccurate reporting, and potential financial losses.
* **Business Disruption:**  Compromise of core data sources can significantly disrupt business operations, impacting decision-making, service delivery, and overall productivity.
* **Compliance Violations:** Exposure of sensitive data can lead to severe penalties and sanctions from regulatory bodies.
* **Loss of Control:** The organization loses control over its data when unauthorized individuals gain direct access.
* **Lateral Movement:** Compromised data source credentials could potentially be used to pivot and gain access to other systems within the organization's network if those systems share similar credentials or access patterns.
* **Reputational Damage:** A data breach resulting from this vulnerability can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

**5. Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this threat being exploited depends on several factors:

* **Redash's Implementation:** The primary factor is how Redash actually stores data source credentials. Plain text storage significantly increases the likelihood.
* **Security Posture of the Redash Server:** The overall security of the server hosting Redash is crucial. Vulnerabilities in the operating system, web server, and other components increase the attack surface.
* **Access Controls:** Strong access controls on the Redash server and its configuration files can reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.
* **Security Awareness:** Awareness among developers and administrators about the risks of insecure credential storage is essential.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regular assessments can help identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
* **Patching and Updates:** Keeping Redash and its dependencies up-to-date with security patches is crucial to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

**6. Detailed Mitigation Strategies (Expanding on Provided Suggestions):**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but we need to elaborate on the implementation details:

* **Implement Secure Storage Mechanisms for Data Source Credentials *within Redash*:**
    * **Utilize a Dedicated Secrets Management System:** This is the **recommended best practice**. Integrate with systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager. These systems offer:
        * **Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Credentials are encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.
        * **Access Control Policies:** Granular control over who can access specific secrets.
        * **Auditing:** Logging of secret access and modifications.
        * **Rotation:** Automated or manual rotation of credentials to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
        * **Dynamic Credential Generation:** Some systems allow for generating temporary credentials, further enhancing security.
    * **Implement Encrypted Storage within Redash:** If a dedicated system is not immediately feasible:
        * **Utilize Strong Encryption Algorithms:** Employ industry-standard encryption algorithms like AES-256 for encrypting credentials before storing them in the database or configuration files.
        * **Secure Key Management:** The encryption keys must be stored securely and separately from the encrypted data. Consider using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or Key Management Services (KMS) for key storage and management.
        * **Implement Proper Access Controls:** Restrict access to the encryption keys to only authorized components and personnel.
        * **Consider using a well-vetted encryption library:** Ensure the chosen library is actively maintained and has a good security track record.
* **Avoid Storing Credentials Directly in Redash's Configuration Files:**
    * **Configuration as Code with Secrets Management:** Store configuration parameters, including references to secrets in the secrets management system, rather than the actual credentials.
    * **Environment Variables (with Caution):** If using environment variables, ensure the server environment is properly secured and avoid logging these variables. Consider using tools that specifically manage secrets within environment variables.
    * **Externalized Configuration:** Explore options for externalizing configuration, possibly using a secure configuration server that Redash can securely access.
* **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Redash:**  Limit access to data sources based on user roles and responsibilities. This minimizes the impact if a single user account is compromised.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing specifically targeting credential storage mechanisms, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation on all inputs related to data source configuration to prevent injection attacks that could potentially be used to extract credentials.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Train developers on secure coding practices, emphasizing the importance of secure credential management and avoiding common pitfalls.
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep Redash and all its dependencies updated with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and least privilege principles for user access to Redash.
* **Secure Logging Practices:** Avoid logging sensitive information, including credentials. Implement mechanisms to redact or mask sensitive data in logs.
* **Secure Deployment Practices:** Ensure the Redash server is deployed in a secure environment with proper network segmentation, firewall rules, and access controls.
* **Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor configuration files and other sensitive files for unauthorized modifications.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test an incident response plan to effectively handle potential security breaches, including procedures for credential revocation and data source lockdown.

**7. Detection and Monitoring:**

Implementing detection and monitoring mechanisms can help identify potential exploitation attempts:

* **Monitor Access Logs:** Analyze Redash access logs for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual data source connections.
* **Database Audit Logging:** Enable audit logging on the Redash database to track access to sensitive tables, including those potentially storing credentials.
* **Secrets Management System Monitoring:** Monitor the logs and alerts provided by the secrets management system for any unusual access patterns or failed authentication attempts.
* **Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Implement network monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns related to data source connections.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Redash logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and detect potential attacks.
* **Alerting on Failed Authentication:** Implement alerts for repeated failed authentication attempts to data sources or within Redash itself.

**8. Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Prioritize the implementation of a dedicated secrets management system.** This is the most secure and recommended approach.
* **If a secrets management system is not immediately feasible, implement robust encryption within Redash, focusing on strong algorithms and secure key management.**
* **Conduct a thorough security review of the existing codebase and configuration to identify any instances of insecure credential storage.**
* **Implement RBAC to limit the impact of potential compromises.**
* **Integrate security testing, including static and dynamic analysis, into the development lifecycle.**
* **Provide security training to the development team on secure credential management and other security best practices.**
* **Establish clear guidelines and policies for handling sensitive data, including data source credentials.**
* **Consider using a security champion within the development team to advocate for security best practices.**

**Conclusion:**

The "Exposure of Data Source Credentials" threat is a critical vulnerability that must be addressed with the utmost urgency. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly the adoption of a dedicated secrets management system or robust encryption, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this threat being exploited. A proactive and security-conscious approach to development is essential to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the Redash application and the connected data sources.
