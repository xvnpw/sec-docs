## Deep Dive Analysis: Insecure Data Source Credential Storage in Redash

This analysis focuses on the "Insecure Data Source Credential Storage" attack surface within the Redash application. We will delve into the technical aspects, potential attack vectors, and provide more granular mitigation strategies.

**Expanding on the Description:**

While the initial description highlights the core issue, let's expand on the different ways this vulnerability can manifest:

* **Plaintext Storage:** The most severe scenario where credentials are stored directly in configuration files, database tables, or even code without any encryption.
* **Weak Encryption:** Using outdated or easily breakable encryption algorithms (e.g., simple XOR, weak hashing without salting) to protect credentials.
* **Hardcoded Encryption Keys:** Storing encryption keys within the application code or configuration alongside the encrypted credentials, effectively negating the encryption.
* **Insufficient Access Controls:**  Even with encryption, if access controls to the storage mechanism (database, filesystem) are weak, attackers can potentially gain access to the encrypted data and attempt decryption.
* **Credentials in Memory:** While not persistent storage, if Redash processes store credentials in memory without proper safeguards (e.g., not clearing them after use, vulnerabilities leading to memory dumps), they could be exposed.
* **Logging Sensitive Data:**  Accidentally logging connection strings or credentials during debugging or error handling.
* **Third-Party Dependencies:** Vulnerabilities in libraries or dependencies used by Redash for credential management could be exploited.

**Detailed Attack Vectors:**

Let's explore how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability:

* **Internal Attackers (Malicious Insider):**
    * **Direct Database Access:** An employee with access to the Redash database could directly query the credential storage table.
    * **Filesystem Access:** An employee with access to the Redash server's filesystem could read configuration files or access the database files directly.
    * **Memory Dump Analysis:** An employee with privileged access could potentially dump the memory of the Redash process and search for credentials.
* **External Attackers (Gaining Unauthorized Access):**
    * **Web Application Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Remote Code Execution (RCE), or Local File Inclusion (LFI) in Redash to gain access to the server or database.
    * **Compromised Server:**  If the Redash server itself is compromised through operating system vulnerabilities or weak security configurations, attackers can access the filesystem and database.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising a dependency used by Redash that handles credential storage or encryption.
    * **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:** If Redash uses weak authentication for administrative access, attackers could gain access and then explore the credential storage mechanisms.
* **Cloud Environment Specific Attacks (If Redash is hosted in the cloud):**
    * **Compromised Cloud Account:** If the cloud account hosting Redash is compromised, attackers could gain access to the underlying infrastructure and data.
    * **Misconfigured Cloud Resources:**  Openly accessible storage buckets or databases containing Redash data.

**Technical Details and Redash Specifics:**

To provide a more targeted analysis, we need to consider how Redash *actually* handles credential storage. While I don't have access to the internal Redash codebase, we can make educated assumptions and highlight areas for investigation:

* **Database Storage:** Redash likely stores data source connection details in its database (likely PostgreSQL). The critical question is how the `password` or `connection string` fields are handled.
    * **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Plaintext storage:**  If these fields are stored directly without encryption.
        * **Weak encryption:**  If a simple or custom encryption method is used.
        * **Same encryption key for all credentials:** If a single key is used to encrypt all data source credentials, compromising that key compromises all connections.
* **Configuration Files:**  Redash might store some configuration details in files (e.g., `.env` files). While less likely for direct credentials, these files might contain information that could aid an attacker.
* **Environment Variables:**  While generally a better practice than config files, if environment variables are not properly secured or if the server environment is compromised, they can be exposed.
* **Secrets Management Integration:** Redash *might* offer integration with dedicated secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.). If so, the security relies on the correct configuration and security of these external systems. **This is a positive point if implemented correctly.**
* **Code Review:**  A thorough code review of the Redash codebase is essential to understand the exact implementation of credential storage and encryption.

**Impact Assessment (Further Detail):**

The impact of compromised data source credentials extends beyond a simple data breach:

* **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can steal sensitive data from the connected data sources.
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the connected data sources, leading to incorrect reporting, business disruptions, and potential legal issues.
* **Lateral Movement:** Compromised data source credentials can be used to access other systems and resources within the organization's network.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could disrupt the availability of the connected data sources.
* **Reputational Damage:** A significant data breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Redash.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Data breaches can lead to significant fines and penalties under regulations like GDPR, CCPA, etc.
* **Supply Chain Attacks (Indirect Impact):** If Redash is used to visualize data from customer systems, a compromise could indirectly impact those customers.

**Risk Severity Justification (Reinforced):**

The "Critical" risk severity is justified due to:

* **Direct Access to Sensitive Data:** Compromised credentials provide direct access to potentially highly sensitive data stored in connected data sources.
* **High Potential for Widespread Damage:**  The impact can extend beyond Redash itself, affecting multiple critical systems.
* **Ease of Exploitation (Potentially):** Depending on the implementation, exploiting this vulnerability might not require advanced skills.
* **Significant Business Impact:** The consequences of a successful attack can be devastating for the organization.

**Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies (Granular and Actionable):**

**For Developers (Redash Core Team and Custom Implementations):**

* **Mandatory and Robust Encryption:**
    * **Use Industry-Standard Algorithms:** Employ strong, well-vetted encryption algorithms like AES-256 for encrypting credentials at rest.
    * **Proper Key Management:** Implement a secure key management system. Avoid storing encryption keys alongside the encrypted data. Consider using:
        * **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** For highly sensitive environments.
        * **Dedicated Secrets Management Solutions:** Integrate with solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault.
        * **Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):** If using password-based encryption, use strong KDFs like Argon2 or PBKDF2 with proper salting.
    * **Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Ensure credentials are encrypted both when stored persistently and during any transmission.
* **Avoid Plaintext Storage Absolutely:** This is the most critical step. Never store credentials in plaintext in any configuration files, database tables, or code.
