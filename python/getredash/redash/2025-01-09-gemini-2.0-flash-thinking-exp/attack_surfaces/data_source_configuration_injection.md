## Deep Analysis: Data Source Configuration Injection in Redash

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Data Source Configuration Injection" attack surface in Redash, as requested. We will delve into the technical details, potential attack vectors, and provide comprehensive mitigation strategies for both development and user perspectives.

**Attack Surface: Data Source Configuration Injection**

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the lack of robust input validation and sanitization when users configure data source connections within Redash. This feature, while essential for Redash's functionality, becomes a significant attack vector if not implemented securely. The vulnerability stems from the trust placed in user-supplied data, which, without proper safeguards, can be interpreted and executed as code or used to manipulate system behavior.

**Redash's Contribution to the Attack Surface:**

Redash's architecture directly contributes to this attack surface by:

* **Centralized Data Source Management:**  Redash provides a centralized interface for managing connections to various data sources. This convenience also concentrates the risk if this interface is vulnerable.
* **Dynamic Connection String Handling:**  Redash needs to dynamically process and utilize connection strings, which often contain sensitive information and parameters. This dynamic handling creates opportunities for injection if not carefully managed.
* **Interaction with External Systems:**  The configured data sources are external systems (databases, APIs, etc.). A successful injection can leverage Redash as a bridge to compromise these external systems.
* **Persistence of Configuration:** Connection details are typically stored persistently within Redash's database. If an attacker can inject malicious configurations, they can potentially maintain persistent access or trigger malicious actions at a later time.

**Detailed Examination of Potential Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

Beyond the basic example of malicious SQL commands, several attack vectors can be exploited through data source configuration injection:

* **SQL Injection (Beyond Basic Queries):**
    * **Connection String Manipulation:**  Attackers can inject malicious SQL within the connection string itself, targeting parameters like `OPTIONS`, `CONNECTION ATTR`, or database-specific settings. This could lead to:
        * **Privilege Escalation:** Modifying session settings to gain elevated privileges within the target database.
        * **Information Disclosure:** Executing queries to extract sensitive data from the target database.
        * **Data Manipulation:** Inserting, updating, or deleting data within the target database.
        * **Remote Code Execution (Database Dependent):** Some database systems allow executing operating system commands through specific SQL functions or extensions.
    * **Driver-Specific Exploits:**  Certain database drivers might have vulnerabilities that can be triggered through specific connection string parameters.
* **Command Injection (Operating System):**
    * **Through Database Features:**  If the connected database allows executing OS commands (e.g., `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server), attackers can leverage SQL injection within the connection string to execute commands on the database server.
    * **Through Redash Server (Less Direct):** In rare scenarios, vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries used by Redash to connect to certain data sources might allow command execution on the Redash server itself, triggered by crafted connection parameters.
* **LDAP Injection (for LDAP Data Sources):**
    * When configuring LDAP data sources, attackers can inject malicious LDAP queries into connection parameters like the base DN or filter. This can lead to:
        * **Information Disclosure:** Retrieving sensitive user and group information from the LDAP directory.
        * **Authentication Bypass:**  Potentially bypassing authentication checks.
        * **Denial of Service:** Crafting queries that overload the LDAP server.
* **API Endpoint Manipulation (for API Data Sources):**
    * When configuring API data sources, attackers might be able to manipulate the base URL or authentication parameters to point to malicious APIs under their control. This could lead to:
        * **Data Exfiltration:**  Redash sending data to the attacker's API.
        * **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting communication between Redash and the legitimate API.
* **File Inclusion/Path Traversal (Less Likely, but Possible):**
    * In highly specific scenarios, if the data source configuration involves file paths or includes, vulnerabilities might allow attackers to include arbitrary files from the Redash server or the connected system.

**Technical Deep Dive into Potential Vulnerabilities within Redash:**

To understand how these attacks are possible, we need to consider potential weaknesses in Redash's implementation:

* **Insufficient Input Validation:**
    * **Lack of Whitelisting:** Not explicitly defining allowed characters, formats, and values for connection parameters.
    * **Blacklisting Inadequacies:** Relying solely on blacklisting malicious keywords, which can be easily bypassed with obfuscation.
    * **Missing Data Type Validation:** Not ensuring that input data conforms to the expected data type (e.g., expecting an integer but receiving a string containing malicious code).
* **Lack of Proper Sanitization/Escaping:**
    * Not encoding special characters that have meaning in the target system's query language or configuration format.
    * Incorrect or incomplete escaping mechanisms.
* **Direct String Interpolation:**  Constructing connection strings by directly concatenating user-supplied input without proper sanitization. This is a major vulnerability.
* **Overly Permissive Data Source Configuration Options:**  Offering configuration options that are inherently risky if not carefully controlled (e.g., allowing arbitrary SQL execution through connection parameters).
* **Lack of Contextual Encoding:** Not encoding data appropriately for the specific context where it will be used (e.g., encoding for SQL but not for shell commands).
* **Insufficient Security Auditing:**  Lack of logging and monitoring of data source configuration changes, making it difficult to detect and respond to malicious modifications.

**Expanded Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful Data Source Configuration Injection attack can be severe:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** As highlighted, this is a critical risk, potentially allowing attackers to gain full control of the Redash server or the connected database server.
* **Data Breaches:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data from connected databases.
* **Data Manipulation/Corruption:** Modifying or deleting critical data within connected databases.
* **Lateral Movement:** Using compromised data sources as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crafting malicious configurations that overload or crash the Redash server or connected data sources.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining unauthorized access to higher-level functions within Redash or connected systems.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If Redash is used to connect to other internal systems, a compromise can potentially impact those systems as well.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust and credibility due to a security breach.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to protect sensitive data can lead to regulatory fines and penalties.

**Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate this attack surface, a multi-layered approach is required, involving both developers and users:

**For Developers (Implementing Secure Coding Practices):**

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelisting:**  Define and enforce strict rules for allowed characters, formats, and values for all connection parameters.
    * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that input data matches the expected data type.
    * **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific patterns for connection string components.
    * **Length Limitations:**  Restrict the maximum length of input fields to prevent buffer overflows or excessive resource consumption.
* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Crucially, when interacting with the database storing connection details, **always** use parameterized queries. This prevents SQL injection by treating user input as data, not executable code.
* **Secure Connection String Construction:**  Avoid direct string concatenation of user input. Use secure methods provided by the database driver or ORM to build connection strings.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Redash Application Database User:** Grant the Redash application's database user only the necessary permissions to read and write connection details. Avoid granting excessive privileges.
    * **Data Source Connection Users:** Encourage users to configure data source connections with the least privileges necessary for their intended use.
* **Contextual Encoding:** Encode user input appropriately for the specific context where it will be used (e.g., HTML escaping for display, SQL escaping for database queries).
* **Security Auditing and Logging:**
    * Log all attempts to create, modify, or delete data source configurations, including the user who made the change and the details of the change.
    * Implement monitoring for suspicious patterns in configuration changes.
* **Secure Secrets Management:**  Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in the database. Use secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to store and retrieve credentials.
* **Regular Security Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on the data source configuration functionality, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically identify potential security flaws in the code.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Use DAST tools to test the application's security while it is running, simulating real-world attacks.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

**For Users (Exercising Caution and Best Practices):**

* **Verify Connection Strings:**  Carefully review connection strings before using them, especially if they are copied from external sources. Understand the purpose of each parameter.
* **Avoid Untrusted Sources:** Be extremely cautious when copying connection strings from untrusted sources or individuals.
* **Understand Configuration Parameters:**  Familiarize yourself with the implications of each configuration parameter for the specific data source being connected.
* **Report Suspicious Activity:**  Report any unusual or unexpected behavior related to data source configurations to the security team.
* **Use Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Secure Redash user accounts to prevent unauthorized access to the data source configuration interface.
* **Regularly Review Data Source Configurations:**  Periodically review the configured data sources to ensure they are still necessary and configured correctly.
* **Educate Users:** Provide training to users on the risks associated with data source configuration and best practices for secure configuration.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

Beyond prevention, it's crucial to have mechanisms for detecting and responding to potential exploitation attempts:

* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor for unusual patterns in data source configuration changes, such as unexpected modifications or the introduction of potentially malicious parameters.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Redash logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and detect suspicious activity related to data source configurations.
* **Alerting:** Configure alerts for critical events, such as the creation of new data sources by unauthorized users or the modification of sensitive connection parameters.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the Redash instance and its configuration to identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

**Conclusion:**

The Data Source Configuration Injection attack surface in Redash presents a significant risk due to its potential for remote code execution and data breaches. Addressing this vulnerability requires a strong commitment to secure coding practices from the development team and a security-conscious approach from users. By implementing the comprehensive mitigation strategies outlined above, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and protect their sensitive data and systems. Continuous monitoring and vigilance are essential to maintain a secure environment.
