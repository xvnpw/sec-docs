# Attack Surface Analysis for getredash/redash

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Source Credential Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_source_credential_storage.md)

**Description:**  Redash stores credentials for connecting to various data sources. If this storage is not adequately secured, attackers could retrieve these credentials.

**How Redash Contributes:** Redash's core functionality relies on storing and managing these connection credentials. The implementation of this storage mechanism directly impacts the security.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Redash server's filesystem or database and is able to decrypt or retrieve plaintext credentials used to connect to sensitive databases.

**Impact:** Full compromise of connected data sources, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service on those systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Implement robust encryption for stored credentials using industry-standard algorithms and key management practices. Consider using dedicated secrets management solutions. Avoid storing credentials in application configuration files directly.
* **Users:** Regularly review and rotate data source credentials. Limit the permissions granted to the Redash user on the connected data sources to the minimum necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Data Source Configuration Injection](./attack_surfaces/data_source_configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** Redash allows users to configure data source connections. If input validation and sanitization are insufficient, attackers could inject malicious commands or connection parameters.

**How Redash Contributes:** The feature allowing users to configure data source connections introduces this attack surface. Lack of proper input handling within this feature is the core issue.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates the data source connection string to include malicious SQL commands that are executed when Redash attempts to connect to the data source.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the Redash server or the connected database server, potentially leading to full system compromise or data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data source configuration fields. Use parameterized queries when interacting with the database storing connection details. Enforce least privilege for the Redash application's database user.
* **Users:** Exercise caution when configuring data sources, especially when copying connection strings from untrusted sources. Understand the implications of each configuration parameter.

## Attack Surface: [Query Injection through User-Provided Parameters](./attack_surfaces/query_injection_through_user-provided_parameters.md)

**Description:** While Redash aims to prevent SQL injection, vulnerabilities can arise if user-provided parameters in queries are not properly handled, especially with specific data source types or custom query configurations.

**How Redash Contributes:**  The core function of Redash is to execute user-defined queries. The way Redash constructs and executes these queries, particularly when incorporating user input, creates this potential vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious query with specially crafted parameters that bypass Redash's sanitization and allow execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the connected database.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, or even remote code execution on the connected database server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**  Enforce the use of parameterized queries for all data sources. Implement strong input validation and sanitization for all user-provided query parameters. Regularly review and update data source drivers.
* **Users:** Be cautious when using user-provided parameters in queries. Understand the potential risks of dynamic query generation.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Scheduled Query Definitions](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_scheduled_query_definitions.md)

**Description:** If access controls are weak or vulnerabilities exist in the scheduling mechanism, attackers could modify scheduled queries to execute malicious code or access sensitive data.

**How Redash Contributes:** Redash's scheduling feature allows for automated query execution. The security of this scheduling mechanism is crucial.

**Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access and modifies a scheduled query to exfiltrate data to an external server or to execute commands on the Redash server.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, or code execution on the Redash server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Implement robust access controls for managing and modifying scheduled queries. Log all changes to scheduled queries. Consider implementing a "safe mode" or review process for new or modified scheduled queries.
* **Users:**  Regularly review scheduled queries and their owners. Restrict access to the scheduling functionality to authorized users only.

## Attack Surface: [API Vulnerabilities Specific to Redash Functionality](./attack_surfaces/api_vulnerabilities_specific_to_redash_functionality.md)

**Description:** Redash exposes an API for managing various aspects of the application. Vulnerabilities in these specific API endpoints could be exploited.

**How Redash Contributes:** The design and implementation of Redash's API directly contribute to this attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker exploits an API endpoint to bypass authentication and create a new administrative user or to modify sensitive data source configurations.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Redash functionality, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**  Implement secure coding practices for all API endpoints, including proper authentication, authorization, and input validation. Regularly audit the API for vulnerabilities. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
* **Users:**  Secure access to the Redash API through appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
