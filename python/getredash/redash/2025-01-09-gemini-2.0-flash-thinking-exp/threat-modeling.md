# Threat Model Analysis for getredash/redash

## Threat: [Data Source Spoofing](./threats/data_source_spoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges within Redash could modify the connection details of an existing data source *within Redash's configuration*, pointing it to a malicious server controlled by the attacker. When queries are executed through Redash against this spoofed data source, the attacker can capture sensitive information intended for Redash or inject malicious data back into Redash.

**Impact:** Redash could display fabricated or manipulated data, leading to incorrect business decisions. Sensitive credentials or data intended for the legitimate data source could be intercepted by the attacker *through Redash*.

**Affected Component:** Data Sources (specifically the data source configuration management module within Redash).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access control policies for managing data sources *within Redash*.
* Regularly audit data source configurations *within Redash* for unexpected changes.
* Consider implementing mechanisms *within Redash* to verify the identity of data sources.

## Threat: [User Impersonation via API Key Compromise](./threats/user_impersonation_via_api_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** If an API key belonging to a Redash user is compromised (e.g., through phishing, insecure storage *outside of Redash's direct control*), an attacker can use this key to impersonate that user and perform actions *within Redash* on their behalf. This includes viewing data, creating queries, modifying dashboards, and potentially accessing data sources depending on the user's permissions *within Redash*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data *within Redash*, modification of dashboards leading to misinformation, and potential compromise of connected data sources if the impersonated user has broad access *granted through Redash*.

**Affected Component:** API (Redash's API), User Authentication (Redash's user authentication).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Educate users on the importance of securely storing and managing their API keys *outside of Redash*.
* Implement mechanisms for API key rotation *within Redash*.
* Consider options for more secure API authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0) *supported by Redash*.
* Monitor API key usage *within Redash* for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Query Manipulation leading to Information Disclosure or Data Modification](./threats/query_manipulation_leading_to_information_disclosure_or_data_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker with the ability to create or modify queries *within Redash* could craft malicious queries to extract data they are not authorized to see *through Redash's data access mechanisms* or, if the underlying database permissions allow *and Redash doesn't prevent it*, modify or delete data in the connected data sources *via Redash*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data *accessible through Redash*, potential data corruption or loss in the connected data sources *if Redash's permissions allow it*.

**Affected Component:** Query Editor (within Redash), Query Execution Engine (within Redash).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement the principle of least privilege for database access â€“ the Redash user should only have the necessary permissions *and Redash should respect these*.
* Implement query review and approval processes *within Redash* for sensitive data sources.
* Consider using parameterized queries where possible *within Redash's query editor* to prevent SQL injection.
* Monitor query execution logs *within Redash* for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Exposure of Data Source Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_data_source_credentials.md)

**Description:** If Redash stores data source credentials insecurely (e.g., in plain text in Redash's configuration files or database), an attacker gaining access to the Redash server could retrieve these credentials and directly access the connected data sources without needing to go through Redash.

**Impact:** Direct and unauthorized access to sensitive data in the connected data sources, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.

**Affected Component:** Data Source Configuration Storage (within Redash).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement secure storage mechanisms for data source credentials *within Redash*, such as using a dedicated secrets management system or encrypted storage.
* Avoid storing credentials directly in Redash's configuration files.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Permission Model Flaws](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_permission_model_flaws.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Redash's permission model could allow an attacker with limited privileges *within Redash* to escalate their access and perform actions they are not authorized for *within Redash*, such as managing users, data sources, or modifying critical system settings.

**Impact:** An attacker could gain administrative control over the Redash instance, leading to full compromise of the application and potentially connected resources *accessible through Redash*.

**Affected Component:** Permission Management module (within Redash).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test the Redash permission model for vulnerabilities.
* Implement the principle of least privilege *within Redash*.
* Regularly audit user permissions and roles *within Redash*.
