## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Redash (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_redash__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective by leveraging Redash as the entry point.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Redash Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_redash_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Known Redash Vulnerabilities (CVEs) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers research publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting the specific version of Redash being used. They then utilize readily available exploit code or techniques to target these weaknesses.
    *   **Potential Exploits:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Authentication Bypass, Privilege Escalation.
*   **Exploit SQL Injection in Redash Queries (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious SQL queries through Redash's query interface. If input sanitization is insufficient, this malicious code is executed against the connected database.
    *   **Potential Exploits:** Data exfiltration, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the database, potentially command execution on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Redash Features for Malicious Purposes (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_redash_features_for_malicious_purposes__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Leverage Redash API with Stolen Credentials (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers obtain valid Redash API keys or user credentials through phishing, credential stuffing, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities. They then use the API to perform actions they are not authorized for.
    *   **Potential Exploits:** Data access, query execution, dashboard modification, user manipulation, potentially further access to connected data sources.
*   **Create Malicious Queries to Extract Sensitive Data (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers, with legitimate or compromised Redash access, craft queries that intentionally extract sensitive data from the connected databases. This might involve joining tables or using functions to access restricted information.
    *   **Potential Exploits:** Data exfiltration, unauthorized access to sensitive business information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Redash Infrastructure (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_redash_infrastructure__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the operating system, libraries, or services running on the Redash server. They might also exploit weak configurations or credentials to gain direct access to the server.
*   **Potential Exploits:** Remote code execution on the Redash server, access to sensitive files and configurations, the ability to manipulate the Redash installation, potentially pivoting to other systems on the network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Redash's Data Source Connections to Reach Application Databases (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_redash's_data_source_connections_to_reach_application_databases__high_risk_path__critical_no_5e4738ef.md)

*   **Leverage Stored Credentials in Redash Data Sources (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If Redash stores database credentials (usernames and passwords) for data source connections, attackers attempt to retrieve these credentials. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in Redash, accessing configuration files, or memory dumps.
    *   **Potential Exploits:** Direct access to the application's databases, bypassing application-level security controls, ability to read, modify, or delete application data.
