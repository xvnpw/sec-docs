We will break down potential attack vectors, assess their likelihood and impact, and suggest mitigation strategies for the development team.

**CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Application via Redash**

This node represents the attacker's ultimate goal: gaining unauthorized access and control over the application or its underlying infrastructure by exploiting Redash. Success here signifies a significant security breach with potentially severe consequences.

**Breaking Down the Attack Path (Potential Sub-Nodes and Attack Vectors):**

To achieve this critical node, an attacker can employ various tactics targeting different aspects of the Redash application. Here's a breakdown of potential sub-nodes and specific attack vectors:

**1. Exploiting Redash Web Interface Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Attack Vector:** **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into Redash pages viewed by other users. This can be achieved through vulnerable input fields in queries, dashboards, or visualizations.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High, especially if input sanitization is not robust.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of dashboards, execution of arbitrary JavaScript in user browsers, potentially leading to further internal network reconnaissance.
    *   **Detection:** Regular security scanning, penetration testing, monitoring for unusual JavaScript execution.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding (escaping) for all user-supplied data. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

*   **Attack Vector:** **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
    *   **Description:** Injecting malicious SQL code into Redash queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the underlying database or even executing operating system commands if database permissions are misconfigured.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, depending on how queries are constructed and if parameterized queries are consistently used.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data modification, denial of service, potentially gaining control over the database server.
    *   **Detection:** Static code analysis, penetration testing, monitoring database logs for suspicious queries.
    *   **Mitigation:** **Strictly use parameterized queries (prepared statements)** for all database interactions. Implement least privilege principles for database user accounts. Regularly audit database permissions.

*   **Attack Vector:** **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
    *   **Description:** Tricking an authenticated Redash user into performing unintended actions on the application, such as creating new users, modifying data sources, or running queries.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, especially if proper CSRF protection mechanisms are not implemented.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized changes to Redash configuration, data manipulation, potential escalation of privileges.
    *   **Detection:** Penetration testing, code review focusing on state-changing operations.

*   **Attack Vector:** **Leveraging Redash for Lateral Movement**
    *   **Description:** Once inside Redash, an attacker can use it as a stepping stone to access connected data sources or internal networks. This could involve running malicious queries, exploiting vulnerabilities in the data sources themselves, or using Redash's network access to scan for other targets.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, depending on the network segmentation and security posture of connected systems.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of other internal systems and data, expanding the scope of the attack.
