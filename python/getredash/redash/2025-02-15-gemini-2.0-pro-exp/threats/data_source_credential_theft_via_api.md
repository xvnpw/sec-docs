Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Data Source Credential Theft via API" threat for Redash.

## Deep Analysis: Data Source Credential Theft via API (Redash)

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Data Source Credential Theft via API" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors, and propose concrete, actionable recommendations to mitigate the risk.  We aim to go beyond the initial threat model description and provide a detailed understanding of *how* this attack could be executed and *how* to prevent it.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the Redash application and its API, particularly endpoints related to data source management.  We will consider:

*   **Redash API Endpoints:**  `/api/data_sources`, and any other endpoints that might expose data source details or credentials.
*   **Data Source Management Code:**  Relevant Python code within the Redash codebase, including `redash.models.DataSource` and `redash.handlers.data_sources`, and any related modules involved in handling data source credentials.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:**  How Redash authenticates API requests (API keys, user sessions) and enforces authorization (permissions).
*   **Credential Storage:**  How and where Redash currently stores data source credentials (database, configuration files, environment variables).
*   **Secrets Management Integration:**  The potential for and best practices of integrating Redash with a dedicated secrets management solution.

We will *not* cover:

*   General network security issues (e.g., DDoS attacks) unrelated to the specific API threat.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or database, unless directly relevant to Redash's credential handling.
*   Threats unrelated to data source credential theft.

**1.3. Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Redash source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand how data source credentials are handled, stored, and accessed via the API.  This will involve searching for potential vulnerabilities like insufficient authorization checks, insecure credential storage, and improper input validation.
2.  **API Documentation Review:** Analyze the official Redash API documentation (if available) to identify all relevant endpoints and their parameters.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) or publicly disclosed security issues related to Redash and data source credential management.
4.  **Best Practices Analysis:**  Compare Redash's current implementation against industry best practices for API security, authentication, authorization, and secrets management.
5.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Use the findings from the above steps to refine the initial threat model description, providing more specific details about attack vectors and mitigation strategies.
6.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Develop concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating the identified risks, prioritized based on their impact and feasibility.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Attack Vectors and Vulnerabilities:**

Based on the threat description and our understanding of Redash, the following attack vectors and vulnerabilities are likely:

*   **Compromised API Key:**  An attacker gaining access to a valid Redash API key (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or a leaked key) would have the same API access as the user/service associated with that key.  If the key has permissions to view data source details, the attacker could retrieve credentials.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**  Even with a valid API key, the `/api/data_sources` endpoint (or similar) might not properly enforce granular permissions.  A user with limited access might still be able to retrieve credentials for data sources they shouldn't have access to.  This could be due to:
    *   **Missing Permission Checks:**  The code might not explicitly check if the requesting user/API key has the `view_data_source` permission (or a similar permission) for *each* data source.
    *   **Incorrect Permission Logic:**  The permission checks might be flawed, allowing unauthorized access in certain scenarios.
    *   **Bypassing Authorization:**  There might be vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to bypass the authorization checks altogether (e.g., through parameter tampering or injection attacks).
*   **Insecure Credential Storage:**  If Redash stores data source credentials directly in its database (e.g., in plain text or weakly encrypted), an attacker who gains access to the database (e.g., through SQL injection or a database backup leak) could retrieve all credentials.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The API endpoint might not properly validate input parameters, potentially allowing for injection attacks or other exploits that could lead to unauthorized access or credential disclosure.
*   **Session Hijacking:** If Redash uses session cookies for API authentication, an attacker could hijack a valid user session and use it to access the API.
*  **Missing or Weak Encryption in Transit:** While HTTPS is mentioned, it's crucial to verify the configuration. Weak ciphers or outdated TLS versions could allow for man-in-the-middle attacks, exposing API requests and responses, including credentials.

**2.2. Code Review Findings (Hypothetical - Requires Access to Specific Code Version):**

*This section would contain specific code examples and analysis based on reviewing the Redash codebase.  Since we're working hypothetically, we'll outline the *types* of findings we'd expect and look for.*

*   **`redash.handlers.data_sources`:**
    *   We would examine the handlers for the `/api/data_sources` endpoint (and any related endpoints like `/api/data_sources/<id>`).
    *   We would look for code that retrieves data source information, paying close attention to how credentials are accessed and returned in the API response.
    *   We would check for the presence and correctness of authorization checks (e.g., `self.require_permission('view_data_source')` or similar).  We'd verify that these checks are applied consistently and correctly for all relevant data sources.
    *   We would look for any potential vulnerabilities related to input validation (e.g., lack of sanitization of user-provided parameters).
*   **`redash.models.DataSource`:**
    *   We would examine the `DataSource` model to understand how data source credentials are stored.
    *   We would look for fields that store credentials (e.g., `password`, `connection_string`, etc.).
    *   We would check if these fields are stored in plain text, encrypted, or if they reference a secrets manager.
    *   We would analyze any methods related to accessing or modifying credentials.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Logic:**
    *   We would examine the code responsible for authenticating API requests (e.g., verifying API keys or session cookies).
    *   We would analyze the code that enforces authorization (e.g., checking user permissions).
    *   We would look for any potential weaknesses in these mechanisms.

**2.3. Vulnerability Research (Example):**

A search for "Redash data source credential vulnerability" might reveal:

*   **CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):**  Official reports of security vulnerabilities in Redash.  We would analyze any CVEs related to data source credential management or API security.
*   **GitHub Issues:**  Discussions or reports of security issues on the Redash GitHub repository.
*   **Security Blog Posts/Articles:**  Analyses of Redash security by security researchers or penetration testers.
*   **Forum Discussions:**  Discussions on forums or communities related to Redash security.

**2.4. Best Practices Analysis:**

Redash's credential management should be compared against these best practices:

*   **Never Store Credentials in Code or Configuration Files:**  Credentials should never be hardcoded in the source code or stored in configuration files (e.g., `settings.py`).
*   **Use a Secrets Manager:**  A dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager) should be used to store and manage data source credentials.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  API keys and users should only have the minimum necessary permissions.  A key used for querying data should not have permission to modify data source configurations.
*   **Regular API Key Rotation:**  API keys should be rotated regularly (e.g., every 90 days) to minimize the impact of a compromised key.
*   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints.
*   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Thoroughly validate all input parameters and encode output to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Audit Logging:**  Log all API requests, including successful and failed attempts, to access data source information.  This allows for detection of suspicious activity.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **HTTPS with Strong Ciphers:**  Enforce HTTPS with strong ciphers and up-to-date TLS versions.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies (Refined and Prioritized)

Based on the analysis, the following mitigation strategies are recommended, prioritized by their impact and feasibility:

**High Priority (Must Implement):**

1.  **Secrets Management Integration (Critical):**
    *   **Action:**  Integrate Redash with a secure secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  Modify the Redash code to retrieve data source credentials from the secrets manager at runtime, *never* storing them directly in the Redash database or configuration files.
    *   **Rationale:**  This is the most critical mitigation, as it removes the primary target for attackers.  Even if the Redash API or database is compromised, the attacker won't be able to directly access the data source credentials.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Choose a secrets management solution that meets your organization's requirements.
        *   Configure the secrets manager to store the credentials for each data source.
        *   Modify the `redash.models.DataSource` and `redash.handlers.data_sources` code to retrieve credentials from the secrets manager using its API.
        *   Ensure that the secrets manager is properly secured and access is restricted.
2.  **Strict API Key Management (Critical):**
    *   **Action:**  Implement a robust API key management system with the following features:
        *   **Regular Rotation:**  Automatically rotate API keys on a regular schedule (e.g., every 90 days).
        *   **Limited Permissions:**  Create different API keys with specific, limited permissions.  For example, create separate keys for read-only access, query execution, and data source management.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor API key usage and set up alerts for suspicious activity (e.g., excessive requests, access from unusual locations).
        *   **Revocation:**  Provide a mechanism to quickly revoke compromised API keys.
    *   **Rationale:**  This minimizes the impact of a compromised API key and allows for better control over API access.
3.  **Enhanced Authorization Checks (Critical):**
    *   **Action:**  Thoroughly review and enhance the authorization checks on all API endpoints related to data source management.  Ensure that:
        *   The code explicitly checks if the requesting user/API key has the necessary permissions to view, modify, or delete *each* data source.
        *   The permission checks are granular and based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   There are no bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   **Rationale:**  This prevents unauthorized access to data source credentials, even with a valid API key.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Review the code in `redash.handlers.data_sources` and any related modules.
        *   Add or modify permission checks using Redash's authorization framework (e.g., `self.require_permission()`).
        *   Test the authorization checks thoroughly with different user roles and API keys.

**Medium Priority (Should Implement):**

4.  **Comprehensive Audit Logging (High):**
    *   **Action:**  Implement comprehensive audit logging for all API requests, including:
        *   Timestamp
        *   User/API key
        *   Endpoint accessed
        *   Request parameters
        *   Response status (success/failure)
        *   IP address
    *   **Rationale:**  This allows for detection of suspicious activity and provides valuable information for incident response.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Use a logging library (e.g., Python's `logging` module) to log API requests.
        *   Store the logs in a secure location with restricted access.
        *   Consider using a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) for easier analysis.
5.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (High):**
    *   **Action:**  Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints, particularly those related to data source management.  Validate all user-provided parameters to prevent injection attacks and other exploits.
    *   **Rationale:**  This prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in the API code to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Use a validation library (e.g., `cerberus`, `marshmallow`) to define validation rules for each API endpoint.
        *   Sanitize user input to remove any potentially harmful characters or code.
        *   Test the input validation thoroughly with various attack payloads.

**Low Priority (Consider Implementing):**

6.  **Rate Limiting (Medium):**
    *   **Action:**  Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Rationale:**  This protects the API from being overwhelmed by malicious requests.
7.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (Medium):**
    *   **Action:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests of the Redash application and its API.
    *   **Rationale:**  This helps identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
8. **Review and Harden HTTPS Configuration (Medium):**
    * **Action:** Ensure only strong cipher suites are enabled. Disable support for outdated TLS versions (TLS 1.0 and 1.1). Verify the certificate chain is valid and trusted.
    * **Rationale:** Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks that could intercept API credentials.

### 4. Conclusion

The "Data Source Credential Theft via API" threat is a critical risk for Redash deployments.  By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly integrating with a secrets management solution, enforcing strict API key management, and enhancing authorization checks, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this threat.  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and ongoing monitoring are essential to maintain a strong security posture. This deep analysis provides a roadmap for securing Redash against this specific threat, contributing to a more secure data analysis environment.
