Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized Dashboard Access via Shared Link Manipulation" threat for Redash.

## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Dashboard Access via Shared Link Manipulation in Redash

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Unauthorized Dashboard Access via Shared Link Manipulation" threat, identify its root causes within the Redash codebase, evaluate the effectiveness of existing mitigations, and propose concrete improvements to enhance Redash's security posture against this threat.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis will focus specifically on the following aspects of Redash:

*   **Dashboard Sharing Mechanism:**  The code responsible for generating, validating, and controlling access to shared dashboard links.  This includes, but is not limited to, `redash.handlers.dashboards.show` and related functions within `redash.models.Dashboard`.
*   **Access Control Logic:**  The code that determines whether a user (authenticated or unauthenticated) is permitted to view a specific dashboard, particularly in the context of shared links.
*   **URL Handling:** How Redash parses and processes dashboard URLs, especially those containing shared link tokens or identifiers.
*   **Configuration Options:**  Redash settings related to dashboard sharing, public access, and link expiration.
*   **Authentication Mechanisms:** How Redash handles user authentication, and how this interacts with shared dashboard access.

We will *not* be focusing on broader security topics like general SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities, unless they directly contribute to this specific threat.

**1.3. Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Code Review:**  We will meticulously examine the relevant Redash source code (primarily Python) to understand the implementation details of dashboard sharing and access control.  We will use the provided GitHub repository link (https://github.com/getredash/redash) as our primary source.
*   **Static Analysis:** We will use static analysis principles to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as insecure URL parsing, insufficient access checks, and predictable link generation.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  While we won't be performing live penetration testing, we will conceptually outline how an attacker might exploit the identified vulnerabilities.  This will involve constructing hypothetical attack scenarios.
*   **Mitigation Review:** We will assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies in the threat model, identifying any gaps or weaknesses.
*   **Best Practices Review:** We will compare Redash's implementation against industry best practices for secure sharing and access control.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Threat Description Breakdown:**

The threat describes an attacker gaining unauthorized access to Redash dashboards through manipulation of shared links.  This can occur in several ways:

*   **Guessing:**  If shared links are generated using predictable patterns (e.g., sequential IDs), an attacker could potentially guess valid links.
*   **Social Engineering:**  An attacker might trick a legitimate user into revealing a shared link.
*   **Compromised Account:**  If an attacker gains access to a user's account (e.g., through phishing), they could access any shared links associated with that account.
*   **URL Manipulation:**  An attacker might modify a known shared link (e.g., changing a dashboard ID or token) to attempt to access other dashboards.

**2.2. Codebase Analysis (Focusing on `redash.handlers.dashboards.show` and `redash.models.Dashboard`):**

*   **`redash.handlers.dashboards.show` (Hypothetical - Requires Code Inspection):**  This handler likely handles requests for viewing dashboards, including those accessed via shared links.  Key areas of concern:
    *   **Link Validation:**  How does the code validate the shared link?  Does it simply check for the existence of a matching token in the database, or are there additional checks (e.g., expiration, user permissions)?
    *   **Access Control:**  After validating the link, does the code *re-check* the user's permissions to access the dashboard?  A vulnerability could exist if the code assumes that a valid link implies authorization.
    *   **URL Parameter Handling:**  How are URL parameters (e.g., dashboard ID, token) parsed and used?  Are there any potential injection vulnerabilities?
    *   **Error Handling:**  What happens if an invalid link is provided?  Does the code leak any information that could aid an attacker?

*   **`redash.models.Dashboard` (Hypothetical - Requires Code Inspection):**  This model likely represents a dashboard in the database.  Key areas of concern:
    *   **Shared Link Storage:**  How are shared links stored?  Are they stored as plain text, or are they hashed or encrypted?
    *   **Expiration:**  Does the model include fields for tracking link expiration (e.g., creation time, expiration time, view count)?
    *   **Permissions:**  Does the model store information about which users or groups have access to the dashboard, even when accessed via a shared link?

**2.3. Attack Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1:  Predictable Link Guessing:**
    1.  Redash generates shared links using a simple, sequential ID (e.g., `dashboard/1`, `dashboard/2`, etc.).
    2.  An attacker starts requesting URLs with incrementing IDs.
    3.  If a dashboard exists at that ID and is publicly shared, the attacker gains access.

*   **Scenario 2:  URL Manipulation:**
    1.  An attacker obtains a valid shared link for dashboard A (e.g., `dashboard/A?token=xyz`).
    2.  The attacker modifies the URL to access dashboard B (e.g., `dashboard/B?token=xyz`).
    3.  If Redash only validates the token and doesn't re-check permissions for dashboard B, the attacker gains unauthorized access.

*   **Scenario 3:  Expired Link Still Active:**
    1.  A shared link is created with an expiration time.
    2.  The expiration time passes.
    3.  Due to a bug in the code, the link remains active.
    4.  An attacker who obtains the expired link can still access the dashboard.

*   **Scenario 4: Missing Authentication for "Public" Dashboards:**
    1.  A user creates a "public" dashboard, intending it to be accessible to anyone with the link.
    2.  Redash does not require any form of authentication for accessing this dashboard.
    3.  An attacker discovers the link (e.g., through web crawling) and accesses sensitive data.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**

*   **Strong Authentication for Shared Links:**  This is a **highly effective** mitigation.  Requiring authentication prevents unauthorized access even if the link is compromised.  However, it's crucial to ensure that the authentication process itself is secure.
*   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  ACLs are **essential** for fine-grained control.  They allow administrators to specify exactly which users or groups can access a dashboard, regardless of how they obtain the link.
*   **Link Expiration:**  This is a **good practice** that limits the window of opportunity for an attacker.  However, it's not a foolproof solution, as an attacker could still gain access before the link expires.
*   **Audit Logging:**  Audit logging is **crucial** for detecting and investigating unauthorized access attempts.  It doesn't prevent attacks, but it provides valuable information for incident response.
*   **Disable Public Sharing:**  This is the **most restrictive** but also the **most secure** option.  If public sharing is not strictly necessary, disabling it eliminates the risk of unauthorized access via shared links.

**2.5. Potential Vulnerabilities (Based on Common Patterns):**

*   **Insufficient Access Checks:**  The most likely vulnerability is that Redash might validate the shared link token but fail to *re-check* the user's permissions against the specific dashboard being accessed. This is a classic authorization bypass.
*   **Predictable Link Generation:**  If shared links are generated using a predictable algorithm (e.g., sequential IDs, easily guessable tokens), attackers could brute-force their way to valid links.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  If the code doesn't properly validate URL parameters, it might be vulnerable to injection attacks that could allow an attacker to bypass access controls.
*   **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Issues:**  A race condition could exist where the code checks the link's validity and then, before granting access, the link's status changes (e.g., it expires or is revoked).
*   **Missing or Incomplete Error Handling:**  Error messages might reveal information about the system's internal workings, aiding an attacker in crafting exploits.

### 3. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

1.  **Mandatory Authentication for Shared Links:**  Enforce authentication for *all* shared dashboard links.  Do not rely solely on the secrecy of the link.  This should be the default behavior, with an option to explicitly disable it (with appropriate warnings) if absolutely necessary.

2.  **Robust Access Control Re-validation:**  After validating a shared link, *always* re-check the user's permissions against the target dashboard.  Ensure that the user has explicit permission to access that specific dashboard, even if they have a valid link.  This is the most critical fix.

3.  **Cryptographically Secure Link Generation:**  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create shared link tokens.  Avoid predictable patterns or sequential IDs.  Consider using UUIDs or similar mechanisms.

4.  **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all URL parameters, especially dashboard IDs and tokens.  Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks.

5.  **Link Expiration Enforcement:**  Ensure that link expiration is correctly implemented and enforced.  Test the expiration logic thoroughly to prevent TOCTOU issues.

6.  **Comprehensive Audit Logging:**  Log all access attempts to shared dashboards, including successful and failed attempts.  Include the user's identity (if authenticated), IP address, timestamp, and the specific dashboard accessed.

7.  **Configuration Review:**  Review and document all Redash configuration options related to dashboard sharing.  Provide clear guidance to administrators on how to configure Redash securely.  Consider adding a "security hardening" guide.

8.  **Code Review and Testing:**  Conduct a thorough code review of the `redash.handlers.dashboards.show` and `redash.models.Dashboard` modules, focusing on the areas of concern identified in this analysis.  Perform penetration testing to simulate the attack scenarios described above.

9.  **Consider Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on dashboard access via shared links to mitigate brute-force attacks aimed at guessing valid links.

10. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Redash to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

By implementing these recommendations, the Redash development team can significantly enhance the security of the dashboard sharing mechanism and protect against unauthorized access via shared link manipulation. This will improve the overall security posture of Redash and protect sensitive data.
