Okay, here's a deep analysis of the SQL Injection threat, tailored for the Redash application, following the structure you outlined:

## Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Query Parameter Manipulation in Redash

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the threat of SQL Injection via query parameter manipulation within the Redash application, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete steps to mitigate the risk.  This goes beyond the high-level threat model description to provide actionable insights for the development team.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses specifically on how Redash handles query parameters, particularly within the `redash.tasks.queries.execute_query` function and its interaction with data source connectors.  We will examine:
    *   The code path from user input (creating/modifying a query) to query execution.
    *   The implementation of parameterized queries within Redash and its connectors.
    *   Potential bypasses or misconfigurations that could lead to SQL injection.
    *   The interaction between Redash's internal query handling and the underlying database systems.
    *   The effectiveness of existing mitigation strategies.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a static code analysis of relevant Redash components, including:
        *   `redash/tasks/queries.py` (especially `execute_query`)
        *   `redash/query_runner/` (all connector implementations, e.g., `pg.py`, `mysql.py`, `big_query.py`, etc.)
        *   `redash/models/queries.py` (how queries and parameters are stored and retrieved)
        *   `redash/handlers/queries.py` (API endpoints related to query creation and execution)
    2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We will conduct dynamic testing using a local Redash instance and various database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).  This will involve:
        *   Crafting malicious SQL payloads designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Attempting to bypass parameterized query mechanisms.
        *   Testing edge cases and boundary conditions.
        *   Monitoring database logs to observe the actual SQL queries executed.
    3.  **Configuration Review:** We will examine Redash's configuration options related to database connections and query execution to identify any settings that could increase the risk of SQL injection.
    4.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities in Redash and its dependencies (database drivers, ORMs, etc.) that could be relevant to SQL injection.
    5. **Threat Modeling Refinement:** Based on the findings, we will refine the initial threat model and provide specific recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

This section details the findings from applying the methodology.  This is a *hypothetical* analysis, as I don't have access to the live Redash codebase or a running instance.  A real analysis would replace these hypotheticals with concrete code snippets, test results, and configuration details.

**2.1 Code Review Findings (Hypothetical Examples):**

*   **`redash/tasks/queries.py`:**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:**  Let's assume we find a section in `execute_query` where, under *certain conditions* (e.g., a specific data source type or a feature flag), the code constructs a SQL query string by concatenating user-provided parameters *without* proper escaping or parameterization.  This could be a legacy code path or a newly introduced bug.
        ```python
        # HYPOTHETICAL VULNERABLE CODE
        if data_source.type == "legacy_db":
            query = "SELECT * FROM " + table_name + " WHERE id = " + parameter  # VULNERABLE!
            cursor.execute(query)
        else:
            # (Hopefully) Correctly parameterized query
            cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM {} WHERE id = %s".format(table_name), (parameter,))
        ```
    *   **Mitigation:**  Remove the vulnerable code path.  Ensure *all* query execution uses parameterized queries, regardless of the data source type or feature flags.  Add unit tests to specifically target this scenario.

*   **`redash/query_runner/pg.py` (PostgreSQL Connector):**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:**  Even if Redash *intends* to use parameterized queries, the connector itself might have a flaw.  For example, it might incorrectly handle certain data types (e.g., arrays, JSON) or have a bug in its escaping logic.  Or, it might use a vulnerable version of the `psycopg2` library.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly review the connector code for any manual string manipulation or escaping.  Ensure the connector uses the latest stable version of the database driver (`psycopg2` in this case) and that the driver is configured securely.  Add integration tests that specifically target the connector with various data types and malicious inputs.

*   **`redash/models/queries.py`:**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:** If Redash stores query parameters as plain text without any type information, it might be difficult to enforce proper parameterization later.  An attacker might be able to inject malicious code that *appears* to be a valid parameter value.
    *   **Mitigation:** Store query parameters with their associated data types.  This allows Redash to enforce type-specific validation and escaping.

*   **`redash/handlers/queries.py`:**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:** The API endpoint that handles query creation/modification might not perform sufficient input validation.  An attacker might be able to inject malicious code into the query parameters before they are even passed to the execution engine.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation on all API endpoints that handle query parameters.  Use a whitelist approach to allow only expected characters and data types.

**2.2 Dynamic Analysis Findings (Hypothetical Examples):**

*   **Test Case 1: Basic Injection:**
    *   **Payload:** `' OR 1=1 --`
    *   **Expected Result (Mitigated):** The query should fail or return no results (depending on the database and parameterization).
    *   **Vulnerable Result:** The query returns all rows from the table, indicating successful injection.
*   **Test Case 2: Second-Order Injection:**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker creates a query with a seemingly harmless parameter.  This parameter is stored in the database.  Later, another user (or the same attacker) executes the query.  The stored parameter is then used in a vulnerable way.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Ensure that *all* parameters, even those stored in the database, are treated as untrusted and properly parameterized when used in queries.
*   **Test Case 3: Data Type Mismatch:**
    *   **Payload:**  Attempt to inject a string into a numeric parameter, or vice-versa.
    *   **Expected Result (Mitigated):** The query should fail due to a type error.
    *   **Vulnerable Result:** The query executes, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or injection.
*   **Test Case 4: Connector-Specific Attacks:**
    *   **Scenario:**  Test payloads specifically designed to exploit known vulnerabilities in the database drivers used by Redash's connectors (e.g., `psycopg2`, `mysqlclient`).
    *   **Mitigation:**  Keep database drivers up-to-date and regularly review their security advisories.

**2.3 Configuration Review Findings (Hypothetical Examples):**

*   **Potential Vulnerability:**  A Redash configuration setting might disable parameterized queries or allow raw SQL execution for specific data sources.  This could be a misconfiguration or a hidden "debug" feature.
*   **Mitigation:**  Review all configuration options related to database connections and query execution.  Ensure that parameterized queries are enforced globally and that there are no options to disable them.

**2.4 Vulnerability Research Findings (Hypothetical Examples):**

*   **CVE-202X-XXXX:**  A hypothetical CVE in `psycopg2` that allows SQL injection under specific circumstances.
*   **Mitigation:**  Update `psycopg2` to the patched version.

**2.5 Threat Modeling Refinement:**

Based on the hypothetical findings, we can refine the threat model:

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Direct manipulation of query parameters via the Redash UI.
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities in data source connectors.
    *   Second-order injection through stored query parameters.
    *   Bypassing input validation on API endpoints.
*   **Specific Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Conditional code paths that bypass parameterized queries.
    *   Incorrect handling of data types in connectors.
    *   Vulnerable versions of database drivers.
    *   Insufficient input validation on API endpoints.
    *   Misconfigured Redash settings.
*   **Enhanced Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests:**  Create a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests that specifically target SQL injection vulnerabilities.  These tests should cover all code paths, data source connectors, and data types.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., Bandit, CodeQL) into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Redash codebase and its dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Implement a robust dependency management system to ensure that all dependencies (including database drivers) are up-to-date and secure.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user accounts used by Redash have the least privileges necessary.  This limits the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
    * **Harden Database Configuration:** Beyond Redash, configure the database itself to minimize the impact of SQLi. This includes disabling dangerous stored procedures, limiting user permissions, and enabling auditing.

### 3. Conclusion

This deep analysis provides a framework for understanding and mitigating the threat of SQL Injection in Redash.  By combining code review, dynamic testing, configuration review, and vulnerability research, the development team can identify and address specific vulnerabilities.  The refined mitigation strategies, including comprehensive testing, static analysis, and regular security audits, are crucial for ensuring the long-term security of Redash against SQL injection attacks.  The hypothetical examples illustrate the *types* of vulnerabilities that might be found and the corresponding mitigation steps.  A real-world analysis would replace these hypotheticals with concrete findings.
