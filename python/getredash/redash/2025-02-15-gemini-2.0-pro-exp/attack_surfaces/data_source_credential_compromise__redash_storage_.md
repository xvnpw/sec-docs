Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Data Source Credential Compromise (Redash Storage)" attack surface, tailored for a development team working with Redash:

# Deep Analysis: Data Source Credential Compromise (Redash Storage)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which Redash stores and handles data source credentials.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities and weaknesses within Redash's code and configuration that could lead to credential compromise.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate these risks, focusing on code-level changes and secure development practices.
*   Establish a clear understanding of the threat model associated with this attack surface.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the *internal* mechanisms of Redash related to data source credential storage and handling.  It includes:

*   **Code Review:** Examination of the Redash codebase (Python, primarily) responsible for:
    *   Storing credentials (database interactions, configuration files).
    *   Retrieving credentials for data source connections.
    *   Encrypting and decrypting credentials.
    *   Handling environment variables related to credentials.
    *   Access control mechanisms for data source configuration.
*   **Configuration Analysis:** Review of default Redash configurations and recommended deployment practices related to credential security.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Assessment of third-party libraries used by Redash that might introduce vulnerabilities related to credential handling.
*   **Database Schema Analysis:** Understanding how credentials are stored within the Redash database (e.g., table structure, encryption flags).

This analysis *excludes* external factors like network security, server hardening, and operating system vulnerabilities, *except* where they directly interact with Redash's credential handling.  Those are important, but are addressed by broader security practices.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Static Code Analysis:**  Using automated tools (e.g., Bandit, SonarQube) and manual code review to identify potential security flaws in the Redash codebase related to credential handling.  This will focus on:
    *   Hardcoded credentials.
    *   Weak encryption algorithms or key management practices.
    *   SQL injection vulnerabilities that could expose credentials.
    *   Improper access control to credential-related API endpoints or database tables.
    *   Insecure handling of environment variables.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Controlled Environment):**  Setting up a test Redash instance and performing penetration testing techniques to attempt to:
    *   Retrieve credentials from the database.
    *   Exploit known vulnerabilities (if any) to gain access to credentials.
    *   Bypass access control mechanisms to modify or view data source configurations.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Developing a threat model to understand the potential attackers, their motivations, and the attack vectors they might use.
4.  **Documentation Review:**  Examining Redash's official documentation, security advisories, and community forums for known issues and best practices.
5.  **Database Schema Inspection:** Directly examining the Redash database schema to understand how credentials are stored and protected.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Codebase Analysis (Key Areas)

Based on the Redash repository (https://github.com/getredash/redash), the following areas are critical for credential handling and require deep scrutiny:

*   **`redash/models/data_sources.py`:** This file likely contains the database model for data sources, including how credentials are stored (encrypted or not) and the associated fields.  We need to examine:
    *   The `DataSource` model definition.
    *   How the `options` field (likely a JSON field) stores credentials.
    *   The encryption/decryption logic (if any) applied to the `options` field.
    *   Any methods that access or modify the `options` field.
*   **`redash/query_runner/__init__.py` and specific query runner implementations:** These files handle the actual connection to data sources.  We need to examine:
    *   How credentials are retrieved from the `DataSource` object.
    *   How credentials are used to establish connections (e.g., are they passed securely?).
    *   Any potential for credential leakage in logging or error messages.
*   **`redash/settings/__init__.py` and related configuration files:** These files define how Redash is configured, including environment variables.  We need to examine:
    *   How `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` and other sensitive settings are handled.
    *   How environment variables are used to override default settings.
    *   Any potential for misconfiguration that could expose credentials.
*   **`redash/handlers/data_sources.py`:** This file likely contains the API endpoints for managing data sources.  We need to examine:
    *   Access control checks for creating, updating, and deleting data sources.
    *   Input validation to prevent injection attacks.
    *   How credentials are handled in API requests and responses.
*   **Encryption-related code:** Search the codebase for any custom encryption/decryption functions or usage of libraries like `cryptography`.  We need to assess:
    *   The strength of the encryption algorithms used.
    *   The key management practices (where are keys stored, how are they rotated?).
    *   The initialization vectors (IVs) and salts used (are they unique and random?).

### 2.2. Potential Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses

Based on common security issues and the nature of Redash, the following vulnerabilities are likely candidates:

*   **Weak Encryption:**  Redash might use a weak encryption algorithm (e.g., DES) or a short key length, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  Even strong algorithms can be weakened by poor key management.
*   **Hardcoded Secrets:**  Developers might have inadvertently left hardcoded credentials or encryption keys in the codebase.
*   **Insecure Key Storage:**  The `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` (or other encryption keys) might be stored insecurely (e.g., in a configuration file that's easily accessible).
*   **SQL Injection:**  Vulnerabilities in the data source configuration API or query runner code could allow attackers to inject SQL code and retrieve credentials from the database.
*   **Broken Access Control:**  Insufficient access control checks could allow unauthorized users to view or modify data source configurations, including credentials.
*   **Credential Leakage:**  Credentials might be logged in plain text or exposed in error messages.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Third-party libraries used by Redash might have known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise credentials.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** If Redash uses insecure deserialization of data source options, it could be vulnerable to code execution attacks.
* **Missing Input sanitization:** If Redash does not properly sanitize user input, it could be vulnerable to various injection attacks.

### 2.3. Threat Model

*   **Attacker Profile:**
    *   **External Attacker:**  An attacker with no prior access to the Redash system.  They might exploit vulnerabilities in the web application or network infrastructure.
    *   **Internal Attacker (Malicious Insider):**  A user with legitimate access to Redash but with malicious intent.  They might abuse their privileges to access data source credentials.
    *   **Internal Attacker (Compromised Account):**  An attacker who has gained access to a legitimate Redash user account through phishing or other means.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploiting Web Application Vulnerabilities:**  SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc., to gain access to the Redash server or database.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attempting to crack weak encryption keys or guess Redash user passwords.
    *   **Social Engineering:**  Tricking Redash users into revealing their credentials or installing malware.
    *   **Exploiting Server Vulnerabilities:**  Gaining access to the server through unpatched software or misconfigurations.
    *   **Abusing Redash API:**  Using the Redash API to create, modify, or delete data sources with malicious intent.
*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Data Theft:**  Stealing sensitive data from connected data sources.
    *   **Financial Gain:**  Selling stolen data or using it for fraud.
    *   **Espionage:**  Gaining access to confidential information for competitive advantage.
    *   **Sabotage:**  Disrupting operations by deleting or modifying data.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies (Developer-Focused)

The following mitigation strategies are specifically tailored for the Redash development team:

1.  **Strengthen Encryption:**
    *   **Use a Strong Algorithm:**  Ensure Redash uses a strong, modern encryption algorithm like AES-256 with GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
    *   **Secure Key Management:**  Implement a robust key management system.  The `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` should *never* be hardcoded or stored in the codebase.  Use a dedicated key management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault) or a secure environment variable.
    *   **Key Rotation:**  Implement automatic key rotation at regular intervals (e.g., every 90 days).
    *   **Unique IVs/Salts:**  Ensure that unique and cryptographically random initialization vectors (IVs) and salts are used for each encryption operation.

2.  **Secure Credential Storage:**
    *   **Environment Variables:**  *Always* store data source credentials in environment variables, *never* directly in the database or configuration files.  The Redash codebase should retrieve credentials from environment variables.
    *   **Database Encryption:**  If credentials *must* be stored in the database (e.g., for legacy reasons), ensure they are encrypted at rest using the strong encryption practices described above.

3.  **Prevent SQL Injection:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* database interactions.  *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating strings with user input.
    *   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):**  Leverage Redash's ORM (if it uses one) to abstract database interactions and reduce the risk of SQL injection.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user input before using it in database queries or other sensitive operations.

4.  **Implement Robust Access Control:**
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement a fine-grained RBAC system to restrict access to data source configurations based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that users have only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    *   **API Authentication and Authorization:**  Secure all API endpoints with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.

5.  **Prevent Credential Leakage:**
    *   **Secure Logging:**  Configure logging to *never* include sensitive information like credentials.  Use a secure logging framework and review logs regularly.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Implement secure error handling that does not reveal sensitive information to users.
    *   **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and prevent potential credential leakage.

6.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep all third-party libraries up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use automated tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:**  Regularly audit dependencies to understand their security posture and potential risks.

7.  **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    *  Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data, especially in the data source configuration forms and API endpoints. This helps prevent various injection attacks.

8.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.

9. **Code Review Checklist (Specific to this Attack Surface):**
    *   Are credentials stored in environment variables?
    *   Is a strong encryption algorithm used?
    *   Is key management secure?
    *   Are parameterized queries used for all database interactions?
    *   Is input validation and sanitization implemented?
    *   Is access control enforced correctly?
    *   Are credentials protected from leakage in logs and error messages?
    *   Are dependencies up to date and free of known vulnerabilities?
    *   Is there any evidence of hardcoded secrets?
    *   Is deserialization handled securely?
