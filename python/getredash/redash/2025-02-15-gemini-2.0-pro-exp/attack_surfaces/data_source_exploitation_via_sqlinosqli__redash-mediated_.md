Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Data Source Exploitation via SQLi/NoSQLi (Redash-Mediated)" attack surface for the Redash application.

## Deep Analysis: Data Source Exploitation via SQLi/NoSQLi (Redash-Mediated)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Redash's role in facilitating SQL injection (SQLi) and NoSQL injection (NoSQLi) attacks against connected data sources.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities within Redash's code and architecture that could enable such attacks, and to propose concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigation.  This goes beyond simply stating best practices; we want to pinpoint *where* and *how* Redash needs to improve.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on Redash's contribution to data source exploitation.  We are *not* analyzing the security of the data sources themselves (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB configurations).  We are concerned with:

*   Redash's input handling mechanisms for all supported data source types.
*   Redash's query construction and execution processes for all supported data source types.
*   Redash's internal data flow related to user-provided query parameters.
*   The codebase related to query runners for different data sources (e.g., `redash/query_runner/`).
*   Any existing security mechanisms (or lack thereof) intended to prevent injection attacks.

**Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  A manual, line-by-line examination of the relevant Redash source code (primarily Python) from the provided GitHub repository (https://github.com/getredash/redash).  We will focus on:
    *   Identifying all entry points where user input related to queries is received.
    *   Tracing the flow of this input through the application.
    *   Analyzing how queries are constructed and passed to data source connectors.
    *   Searching for patterns of string concatenation, dynamic query building, or insufficient escaping.
    *   Checking for the use (or absence) of parameterized queries/prepared statements.
    *   Reviewing data source specific query runner implementations.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** While we won't be performing live dynamic analysis in this document, we will describe *how* dynamic analysis would be conducted to complement the code review. This includes:
    *   Setting up a test environment with Redash and various data sources.
    *   Crafting malicious payloads designed to exploit potential SQLi/NoSQLi vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitoring Redash's behavior and the queries sent to the data sources.
    *   Using debugging tools to inspect variables and execution flow.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically identify potential attack scenarios based on the code review and dynamic analysis findings.  This will help us prioritize vulnerabilities and understand their potential impact.

4.  **Best Practice Comparison:** We will compare Redash's implementation against established security best practices for preventing injection attacks, such as those outlined by OWASP.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

Based on the provided description and the methodology outlined above, we can perform the following deep analysis:

**2.1.  Potential Vulnerability Areas (Code Review Focus):**

*   **`redash/query_runner/` Directory:** This is the *critical* area to examine.  Each data source type (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) will have its own query runner implementation within this directory.  We need to analyze each of these files individually.  Key questions:
    *   **How does the query runner receive user input?**  Is it through a direct API call, a form submission, or some other mechanism?
    *   **How is the user-provided query string handled?** Is it directly concatenated into a larger query string?  Are there any sanitization or escaping functions applied?  Are these functions *specific* to the target data source type?
    *   **Does the query runner use parameterized queries/prepared statements?**  If so, is this consistently applied for *all* query types and parameters?  If not, *why not*?
    *   **Are there any known vulnerabilities in the underlying database libraries used by the query runner?**  (e.g., outdated versions of `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL).
    *   **Are there any custom escaping functions implemented?** If so, are they robust and thoroughly tested against known injection techniques?
    *   **How are errors handled?**  Are error messages potentially revealing sensitive information about the database structure?

*   **`redash/handlers/queries.py` (and related handlers):**  This file (and others in the `redash/handlers/` directory) likely handles the API endpoints and web interfaces where users interact with queries.  We need to examine:
    *   **How user input is validated and sanitized *before* being passed to the query runners.**  Is there any input validation at all?  Is it sufficient to prevent common injection payloads?
    *   **How are query parameters handled?**  Are they properly separated from the query string itself?
    *   **Are there any CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protections in place?**  Could an attacker trick a user into submitting a malicious query?

*   **`redash/models.py` (and related models):**  This file defines the data models for Redash.  While less directly involved in query execution, it's worth checking:
    *   **Are there any data types or fields that could be misused to store malicious payloads?** (e.g., storing a query string in a text field without proper validation).

**2.2.  Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual Approach):**

1.  **Setup:**  Create a Redash instance connected to various data sources (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.).  Ensure that the data sources contain some sample data.

2.  **Payload Crafting:**  Develop a set of malicious payloads targeting each data source type.  These payloads should include:
    *   **Classic SQLi:**  `' OR 1=1 --`, `' UNION SELECT ...`, etc.
    *   **Time-based SQLi:**  Payloads that introduce delays based on the truthiness of a condition.
    *   **Error-based SQLi:**  Payloads that trigger database errors to reveal information.
    *   **NoSQLi (MongoDB):**  `{$ne: 1}`, `{$gt: ''}`, etc. (and similar payloads for other NoSQL databases).
    *   **Data Source Specific Exploits:**  Research any known vulnerabilities specific to the versions of the data sources being used.

3.  **Testing:**  For each data source and payload:
    *   Submit the payload through the Redash query interface.
    *   Observe the results.  Does the query execute successfully?  Does it return unexpected data?  Does it trigger an error?
    *   Use Redash's debugging tools (if available) to inspect the query that is sent to the data source.  Is the payload modified or escaped in any way?
    *   Monitor the database server logs to see the exact query that is executed.

4.  **Iteration:**  Refine the payloads based on the results of the testing.  Try different variations and combinations of injection techniques.

**2.3.  Threat Modeling:**

Based on the code review and dynamic analysis, we can identify several potential threat scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1:  Unauthenticated SQLi:** An attacker, without any Redash credentials, crafts a malicious SQL query and submits it through a publicly accessible Redash API endpoint (if any exist).  This could lead to data exfiltration or database modification.

*   **Scenario 2:  Authenticated SQLi (Low Privilege):**  A user with low privileges in Redash crafts a malicious SQL query to gain access to data they are not authorized to see.  This could involve bypassing Redash's access control mechanisms.

*   **Scenario 3:  Authenticated SQLi (High Privilege):**  A user with high privileges in Redash (e.g., an administrator) intentionally or unintentionally executes a malicious SQL query, leading to widespread data compromise.

*   **Scenario 4:  NoSQLi against MongoDB:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Redash's MongoDB query runner to bypass authentication or access control checks, potentially leading to data manipulation or denial of service.

*   **Scenario 5:  Stored XSS via SQLi:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the database via SQLi. This code is then rendered in the Redash UI, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack against other Redash users.

**2.4.  Best Practice Comparison:**

Redash's implementation should be compared against the following best practices:

*   **OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet:**  [https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
*   **OWASP NoSQL Injection:** [https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf)
*   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  The *primary* defense against SQLi.  Redash should use these *exclusively* for all data source interactions.
*   **Input Validation:**  While not a primary defense, input validation can help prevent many common injection attacks.  Redash should validate user input *before* constructing queries.
*   **Least Privilege:**  Redash should connect to data sources using accounts with the *minimum* necessary privileges.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Redash should undergo regular security audits, including code reviews and penetration testing.
*   **Dependency Management:** Keep all the libraries updated.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies (Reinforced and Specific)

Based on the deep analysis, the following mitigation strategies are *critical* and should be prioritized:

1.  **Parameterized Queries (Non-Negotiable):**  Redash *must* use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* data source interactions.  This is the *single most important* mitigation.  The code review should identify *every* instance where parameterized queries are *not* being used, and these instances should be refactored.  This is a *developer responsibility* and should be enforced through code reviews and automated testing.

2.  **Data Source-Specific Input Sanitization:**  Redash *must* implement robust input sanitization that is *specific to each supported data source type*.  Generic escaping functions are *not sufficient*.  The sanitization logic should be located within the corresponding query runner in `redash/query_runner/`.  This requires a deep understanding of the syntax and escaping rules for each data source.  This is an *ongoing effort* as new data sources are added and existing data sources evolve.

3.  **Input Validation (Whitelist Approach):**  Implement strict input validation using a whitelist approach.  Define a set of allowed characters and patterns for each input field, and reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.  This should be done *before* any sanitization or query construction.

4.  **Least Privilege (Database Connections):**  Ensure that Redash connects to data sources using database accounts that have the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  This limits the potential damage from a successful injection attack.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.  This should include both automated and manual testing.

6.  **Dependency Management:** Regularly update all dependencies, including database drivers and libraries, to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `pip-audit` to identify vulnerable packages.

7.  **Error Handling:**  Review and improve error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information about the database structure or internal workings of Redash.  Use generic error messages and log detailed errors separately.

8. **WAF as a secondary defense:** Use WAF, but do not rely on it.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Data Source Exploitation via SQLi/NoSQLi (Redash-Mediated)" attack surface. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the Redash development team can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack. The key is to focus on *proactive* security measures, such as parameterized queries and data source-specific input sanitization, rather than relying solely on reactive measures like WAFs.
