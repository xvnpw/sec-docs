# Deep Analysis of Redash Attack Tree Path: Compromise Data Source Credentials -> Weak Data Source Credentials

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, understand, and mitigate the risks associated with weak data source credentials within a Redash deployment.  This includes understanding how an attacker might exploit weak credentials, the potential impact of such an exploit, and concrete steps the development team can take to prevent this vulnerability.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations that can be directly integrated into the development and deployment lifecycle.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Redash Version:**  We'll assume the analysis applies to the latest stable release of Redash available on the provided GitHub repository (https://github.com/getredash/redash), but will also consider potential vulnerabilities in older versions if relevant.  Specific version numbers will be noted where applicable.
*   **Data Source Types:**  The analysis will consider all data source types supported by Redash (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, etc.).  We will highlight any data source-specific considerations.
*   **Credential Storage:**  We will examine how Redash stores data source credentials and the security mechanisms in place.
*   **User Roles and Permissions:**  We will consider how user roles and permissions within Redash might interact with this vulnerability.
*   **Deployment Environment:** We will consider common deployment environments (e.g., cloud-based, on-premise) and their impact on the vulnerability.
* **Exclusions:** This analysis *does not* cover:
    *   Attacks that do not directly involve weak data source credentials (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection *within* Redash itself, unless they directly lead to credential compromise).
    *   Physical security of the Redash server.
    *   Compromise of the underlying operating system, unless directly related to Redash credential management.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the Redash source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand how data source credentials are handled, stored, and used.  This includes searching for relevant keywords like "password," "credential," "secret," "encryption," "connection string," etc.
2.  **Documentation Review:**  We will review the official Redash documentation, including setup guides, security recommendations, and best practices.
3.  **Vulnerability Database Search:**  We will search public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for known vulnerabilities related to Redash and data source credentials.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling techniques to identify potential attack vectors and scenarios related to weak credentials.
5.  **Best Practice Analysis:**  We will compare Redash's credential management practices against industry best practices for secure credential storage and handling.
6.  **Penetration Testing Principles:** While we won't conduct live penetration testing, we will apply penetration testing principles to identify potential weaknesses and attack paths.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Data Source Credentials -> Weak Data Source Credentials

**4.1. Threat Description:**

This attack path focuses on an attacker gaining unauthorized access to a data source connected to Redash due to the use of weak credentials.  "Weak credentials" can include:

*   **Default Credentials:**  Using the default username and password provided by the data source vendor (e.g., "admin/admin," "root/password").
*   **Easily Guessable Passwords:**  Using simple, common passwords (e.g., "password123," "qwerty," "123456").
*   **Short Passwords:**  Using passwords that are too short to be resistant to brute-force attacks.
*   **Passwords without Complexity Requirements:**  Using passwords that lack a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
*   **Reused Passwords:**  Using the same password for the data source as for other accounts (e.g., the Redash admin account, personal email).
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** Storing credentials directly within the Redash configuration files or source code in plain text.

**4.2. Attack Vectors:**

An attacker could exploit weak data source credentials through several attack vectors:

*   **Brute-Force Attack:**  The attacker attempts to guess the credentials by systematically trying different combinations of usernames and passwords.  This is particularly effective against default and easily guessable passwords.
*   **Dictionary Attack:**  The attacker uses a list of common passwords (a "dictionary") to try and gain access.
*   **Credential Stuffing:**  The attacker uses credentials obtained from data breaches of other services, hoping that the user has reused the same password for the data source.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker tricks a Redash administrator or user with access to the data source credentials into revealing them.
*   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious or negligent insider with access to the Redash configuration or data source credentials leaks or misuses them.
*   **Configuration File Exposure:** If the Redash configuration file (which may contain credentials, especially in older or misconfigured setups) is accidentally exposed (e.g., through a misconfigured web server, a publicly accessible S3 bucket, or a compromised server), the attacker can directly read the credentials.
* **Redash Vulnerabilities:** While the path focuses on *weak* credentials, a separate vulnerability in Redash itself *could* expose even strong credentials.  This is a related, but distinct, attack path.

**4.3. Impact:**

Successful exploitation of weak data source credentials can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker gains unauthorized access to the data stored in the connected data source.  This could include sensitive customer data, financial records, intellectual property, or other confidential information.
*   **Data Modification:**  The attacker could modify or delete data in the data source, leading to data corruption, business disruption, and reputational damage.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker could copy the data and sell it on the black market or use it for other malicious purposes.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker could use the compromised data source as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.  For example, if the data source is a database server, the attacker might be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the database server to gain access to the underlying operating system.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Data breaches can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA), resulting in significant fines and legal penalties.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A data breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization, leading to loss of customer trust and business.

**4.4. Code Review Findings (Illustrative Examples - Requires Actual Code Inspection):**

*   **`redash/settings/__init__.py`:**  Examine how environment variables are used to configure data source connections.  Look for any hardcoded defaults or insecure handling of sensitive information.  Check for the use of `os.environ.get()` with appropriate defaults and error handling.
*   **`redash/models/data_sources.py`:**  Analyze how data source credentials are encrypted and stored in the Redash database.  Identify the encryption algorithm used and the key management strategy.  Look for any potential weaknesses in the encryption process.  Check for the use of a strong, randomly generated encryption key.
*   **`redash/query_runner/__init__.py` and specific query runner files (e.g., `redash/query_runner/pg.py`):**  Examine how the query runners establish connections to the data sources.  Verify that credentials are not logged or exposed in error messages.  Check for secure connection practices (e.g., using TLS/SSL).
*   **`redash/tasks/queries.py`:**  Review how queries are executed and how credentials are passed to the query runners.  Ensure that credentials are not exposed in the query execution process.

**Example (Hypothetical - Illustrative):**

Let's say we find the following in `redash/models/data_sources.py`:

```python
# ... (other code) ...

def decrypt_credentials(self, encrypted_credentials):
    # INSECURE: Using a weak, hardcoded key!
    key = "MySecretKey"
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
    return cipher.decrypt(encrypted_credentials).decode('utf-8')

# ... (other code) ...
```

This would be a **critical finding**, as it uses a hardcoded, weak encryption key.  An attacker who gains access to the Redash database could easily decrypt all data source credentials.

**4.5. Documentation Review Findings:**

*   **Redash Setup Guide:**  Does the official setup guide provide clear instructions on securely configuring data source credentials?  Does it recommend using strong passwords and avoiding default credentials?
*   **Redash Security Documentation:**  Does Redash have dedicated security documentation that addresses credential management best practices?
*   **Data Source Specific Documentation:**  Does Redash provide specific guidance for securely connecting to different types of data sources?

**4.6. Vulnerability Database Search:**

Search CVE and NVD for vulnerabilities related to "Redash" and "credentials" or "data source."  Any relevant vulnerabilities should be documented and analyzed.

**4.7. Threat Modeling (STRIDE):**

*   **Spoofing:**  An attacker could potentially spoof a legitimate user to gain access to Redash and then attempt to brute-force data source credentials.
*   **Tampering:**  An attacker could tamper with the Redash configuration file to inject malicious code or modify existing credentials.
*   **Repudiation:**  If logging is insufficient, it might be difficult to trace back an attack to a specific user or action.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Weak credentials, or vulnerabilities in Redash, could lead to the disclosure of data source credentials.
*   **Denial of Service:**  An attacker could potentially use weak credentials to launch a denial-of-service attack against the data source.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:**  An attacker who gains access to a data source with weak credentials might be able to elevate their privileges within the data source or the connected system.

**4.8. Best Practice Analysis:**

*   **Password Complexity:**  Redash should enforce strong password policies for data source credentials, requiring a minimum length, a mix of character types, and disallowing common passwords.
*   **Credential Storage:**  Credentials should be encrypted at rest using a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256) and a securely managed key.  The key should *never* be hardcoded in the source code.  Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
*   **Least Privilege:**  The principle of least privilege should be applied to data source credentials.  Redash should only be granted the minimum necessary permissions to access the data it needs.
*   **Regular Password Rotation:**  Data source credentials should be rotated regularly to minimize the impact of a potential compromise.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  If supported by the data source, MFA should be enabled to add an extra layer of security.
*   **Auditing and Logging:**  Redash should log all attempts to access data sources, including successful and failed attempts.  This can help detect and respond to attacks.
* **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store sensitive information, rather than hardcoding them in configuration files.

## 5. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

1.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**  Implement strong password policies for data source credentials within Redash.  This should include:
    *   Minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters).
    *   Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    *   Password blacklist (disallow common passwords).
    *   Password history (prevent reuse of recent passwords).
2.  **Secure Credential Storage:**
    *   Use a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256 with a secure mode like GCM or CTR) to encrypt data source credentials at rest.
    *   Use a securely managed key.  **Never hardcode the key.**
    *   Strongly consider integrating with a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).  This provides centralized key management, auditing, and rotation capabilities.
3.  **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that Redash is only granted the minimum necessary permissions on the data source.  Avoid granting overly permissive roles (e.g., "superuser").
4.  **Regular Password Rotation:**  Implement a process for regularly rotating data source credentials.  The frequency of rotation should be based on the sensitivity of the data and the organization's risk tolerance.
5.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA for data source access whenever possible.
6.  **Auditing and Logging:**  Enable comprehensive auditing and logging of data source access within Redash.  Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
7.  **Security Training:**  Provide security training to Redash administrators and users on best practices for credential management and data security.
8.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Redash deployment, including penetration testing and code reviews.
9.  **Vulnerability Management:**  Establish a process for monitoring and addressing security vulnerabilities in Redash and its dependencies.
10. **Configuration Hardening:**  Review and harden the Redash configuration to minimize the attack surface.  This includes disabling unnecessary features and services.
11. **Environment Variables:** Ensure that all sensitive information, including data source credentials, is stored in environment variables and *not* in configuration files or source code.
12. **Documentation Updates:** Update the Redash documentation to clearly reflect these security recommendations and best practices.
13. **Code Review Checklist:** Add specific checks to the code review checklist to ensure that developers are following secure credential management practices.

## 6. Conclusion

The use of weak data source credentials represents a significant security risk for Redash deployments. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of a successful attack.  Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and a strong security culture are essential for maintaining the long-term security of the Redash deployment.
