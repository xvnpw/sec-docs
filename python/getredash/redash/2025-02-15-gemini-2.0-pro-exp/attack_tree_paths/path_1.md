Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on SQL Injection vulnerabilities within Redash, tailored for a development team audience.

## Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Query Parameters in Redash

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly understand the specific attack vector of SQL Injection via query parameters in Redash, identify the root causes, assess the potential impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies for the development team.  This analysis aims to prevent attackers from exploiting this vulnerability to compromise the Redash application and its underlying data.

### 2. Scope

*   **Target Application:** Redash (specifically, versions potentially vulnerable to this attack; we'll need to consider version history).  We are assuming the application is deployed and accessible.
*   **Attack Vector:**  SQL Injection specifically through manipulated query parameters.  This excludes other forms of SQLi (e.g., through POST data, headers, or cookies) and other vulnerabilities within Redash.
*   **Focus:**  We will focus on the technical details of how this vulnerability can be exploited, the underlying code weaknesses that allow it, and practical remediation steps.
* **Exclusions:** This analysis will *not* cover broader security topics like network security, operating system hardening, or physical security, except where they directly relate to mitigating this specific SQLi vulnerability.  We also won't delve into general Redash feature functionality unless it's relevant to the attack.

### 3. Methodology

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Examine the Redash codebase (from the provided GitHub repository: [https://github.com/getredash/redash](https://github.com/getredash/redash)) for areas where user-supplied query parameters are used to construct SQL queries.
    *   Identify specific files, functions, and code blocks involved in handling query parameters and database interactions.
    *   Look for patterns of unsafe string concatenation, lack of parameterization, or inadequate input validation/sanitization.
    *   Analyze how Redash connects to different database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) and whether the database drivers used offer built-in protection against SQLi.
    *   Review relevant security advisories, CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), and bug reports related to SQL Injection in Redash.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   Set up a local, isolated instance of Redash for testing (using Docker is highly recommended to avoid impacting production systems).
    *   Craft malicious SQL payloads designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities in query parameters.  Examples include:
        *   **Basic Injection:** `' OR 1=1 --`
        *   **Union-Based Injection:** `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`
        *   **Time-Based Blind Injection:** `' AND SLEEP(5) --`
        *   **Error-Based Injection:**  Triggering SQL errors to reveal database structure.
    *   Attempt to inject these payloads through various Redash features that utilize query parameters (e.g., dashboards, queries, visualizations).
    *   Monitor the application's responses, database logs, and error messages to determine if the injection was successful.
    *   Test different database backends to see if the vulnerability is specific to certain database types.

3.  **Impact Assessment:**
    *   Determine the potential consequences of a successful SQL Injection attack, including:
        *   Data breaches (reading sensitive data).
        *   Data modification (altering or deleting data).
        *   Data exfiltration (stealing data).
        *   Privilege escalation (gaining administrative access to Redash or the database).
        *   Denial of service (making the application or database unavailable).
        *   Potential for remote code execution (RCE) in extreme cases, depending on the database and configuration.

4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   Provide specific, actionable recommendations for the development team to fix the identified vulnerabilities.
    *   Prioritize recommendations based on their effectiveness and ease of implementation.
    *   Suggest code changes, configuration adjustments, and security best practices.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path:  Compromise Redash Application -> Query Parameterization Vulnerabilities -> SQL Injection via Query Parameters (Redash)

**4.1.  Understanding the Attack Path**

This attack path describes a scenario where an attacker targets a Redash instance.  The attacker leverages the application's handling of query parameters (values passed in the URL, typically after a `?` character) to inject malicious SQL code.  If Redash doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize these inputs, the injected code becomes part of the SQL query executed against the database.

**4.2.  Code Review (Static Analysis - Examples & Hypothetical Scenarios)**

Let's examine some *hypothetical* code snippets that could represent vulnerabilities within Redash.  These are simplified examples for illustrative purposes.  The actual Redash code may be more complex, but the underlying principles remain the same.

**Vulnerable Example 1:  Direct String Concatenation (Python)**

```python
# Hypothetical Redash code (VULNERABLE)
def get_data(request):
    user_id = request.GET.get('user_id')  # Get user_id from query parameter
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + user_id
    # ... execute the query ...
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  The `user_id` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query string.  An attacker could provide a value like `1; DROP TABLE users; --` to delete the `users` table.
*   **Explanation:**  The database interprets the entire string as a single SQL command.  The attacker's input becomes part of the command, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL.

**Vulnerable Example 2:  Insufficient Sanitization (Python)**

```python
# Hypothetical Redash code (VULNERABLE)
def get_data(request):
    user_id = request.GET.get('user_id')
    user_id = user_id.replace("'", "''")  # Attempt to escape single quotes
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '{user_id}'"
    # ... execute the query ...
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  While the code attempts to escape single quotes, this is often insufficient.  An attacker might be able to bypass this with techniques like:
    *   Using different quoting characters (if the database allows it).
    *   Exploiting character encoding issues.
    *   Using other SQL keywords or functions to achieve their goal without needing single quotes.
*   **Explanation:**  Simple string replacement is not a robust defense against SQLi.  Attackers can often find ways to circumvent these basic sanitization attempts.

**Safe Example:  Parameterized Query (Python with psycopg2 - PostgreSQL)**

```python
# Hypothetical Redash code (SAFE)
import psycopg2

def get_data(request):
    user_id = request.GET.get('user_id')
    conn = psycopg2.connect(...)
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))  # Parameterized query
    # ... fetch and process results ...
```

*   **Safe:**  This uses psycopg2's parameterized query feature.  The `%s` placeholder is replaced with the `user_id` value *by the database driver*, not by string concatenation.
*   **Explanation:**  The database driver handles the proper escaping and quoting of the parameter, preventing SQL injection.  The database treats the parameter as data, not as part of the SQL command.  This is the *recommended* approach.

**Safe Example:  Using an ORM (Python with SQLAlchemy)**

```python
# Hypothetical Redash code (SAFE)
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

def get_data(request):
    user_id = request.GET.get('user_id')
    engine = create_engine(...)
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()
    user = session.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()
    # ... process the user object ...
```

*   **Safe:**  SQLAlchemy (an Object-Relational Mapper) constructs the SQL queries behind the scenes, using parameterized queries by default.
*   **Explanation:**  ORMs provide a higher-level abstraction over database interactions, reducing the risk of manual SQL query construction errors that can lead to SQLi.

**4.3. Dynamic Analysis (Testing)**

1.  **Setup:**  Deploy a Redash instance using Docker:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 redash/redash:latest
    ```
    (Note:  You'll likely need to configure data sources, etc., following Redash's documentation.)

2.  **Identify Target URLs:**  Examine Redash's UI and API documentation to find endpoints that accept query parameters.  Examples might include:
    *   `/queries/{query_id}?p_parameter_name=value` (if Redash uses parameterized queries)
    *   `/dashboards/{dashboard_id}?filter_column=value` (if filtering is implemented via URL parameters)

3.  **Craft Payloads:**  Create a series of payloads to test different injection techniques.  Start with simple payloads and gradually increase complexity.

    *   **Simple Test:**  `' OR 1=1 --`  (Attempts to bypass authentication or retrieve all rows)
    *   **Union Select:**  `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --` (Attempts to extract data from other tables)
    *   **Time Delay:**  `' AND SLEEP(5) --` (Attempts to cause a noticeable delay if the injection is successful)
    *   **Error-Based:**  `' AND 1=CONVERT(INT, (SELECT @@version)) --` (Attempts to trigger an error that reveals database version information)

4.  **Inject and Observe:**  For each identified URL and payload:
    *   Modify the URL in your browser or use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send the request.
    *   Observe the response:
        *   **Success:**  If the application returns unexpected data, behaves differently than expected (e.g., shows all data when it shouldn't), or experiences a noticeable delay (for time-based injections), the injection might be successful.
        *   **Failure:**  If the application returns an error message, but the error message *does not* reveal sensitive information about the database structure, the injection likely failed.  If the application behaves normally, the injection also likely failed.
    *   Check database logs (if accessible) for evidence of the injected SQL code.

**4.4. Impact Assessment**

The impact of a successful SQL injection attack on Redash can be severe:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can read any data accessible to the Redash database user, including:
    *   Data from connected data sources (e.g., customer data, financial records, proprietary information).
    *   Redash user credentials (usernames, hashed passwords).
    *   API keys and other secrets stored in Redash.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Attackers can modify or delete data in the connected data sources, potentially causing data corruption or loss.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  If the Redash database user has elevated privileges, the attacker might be able to gain control of the database server itself.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers can execute resource-intensive queries or drop tables, making Redash and its connected data sources unavailable.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE - Less Likely, but Possible):**  In some cases, depending on the database configuration and the presence of specific functions (e.g., `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server), SQL injection can lead to RCE on the database server. This would give the attacker complete control over the server.

**4.5. Mitigation Recommendations**

1.  **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  This is the *primary* and most effective defense.  *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating user-supplied input directly into the query string.  Use the parameterized query features provided by your database driver (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, `mysql.connector` for MySQL).

2.  **Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs):**  Consider using an ORM like SQLAlchemy (Python) or similar libraries in other languages.  ORMs typically use parameterized queries by default, reducing the risk of manual SQL construction errors.

3.  **Input Validation:**  While *not* a primary defense against SQLi, input validation is still important for defense-in-depth.
    *   **Whitelist Validation:**  If possible, validate user input against a strict whitelist of allowed values.  For example, if a parameter is expected to be a number, ensure it contains only digits.
    *   **Type Checking:**  Ensure that the input data type matches the expected type (e.g., integer, string, date).
    *   **Length Restrictions:**  Limit the length of input strings to reasonable values.

4.  **Least Privilege Principle:**  Ensure that the database user account used by Redash has only the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Do *not* use a database administrator account.  This limits the potential damage from a successful SQLi attack.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block common SQLi attack patterns.  However, a WAF should be considered a *secondary* layer of defense, not a replacement for secure coding practices.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including SQLi.

7.  **Keep Redash and Dependencies Updated:**  Regularly update Redash and all its dependencies (including database drivers) to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

8.  **Error Handling:**  Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to users.  These messages can reveal sensitive information about the database structure and aid attackers in crafting SQLi payloads.  Log errors securely for debugging purposes.

9. **Encoding:** Use proper output encoding to prevent the database from misinterpreting special characters.

**Specific to Redash:**

*   **Review Redash's Query Parameter Handling:**  Thoroughly review the Redash codebase, specifically focusing on how query parameters are used in constructing SQL queries.  Identify and fix any instances of unsafe string concatenation or inadequate sanitization.
*   **Consider Existing Security Features:**  Investigate if Redash has any built-in security features or configuration options that can help mitigate SQLi (e.g., input sanitization libraries, query parameter validation settings).
*   **Contribute Back:** If you identify and fix vulnerabilities, consider contributing your changes back to the Redash project (via a pull request on GitHub) to benefit the entire community.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the SQL Injection vulnerability via query parameters in Redash. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and protect the application and its data. Remember to prioritize parameterized queries and the principle of least privilege.
