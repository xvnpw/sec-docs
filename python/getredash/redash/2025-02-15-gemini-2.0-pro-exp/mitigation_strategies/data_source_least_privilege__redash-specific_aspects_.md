Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Data Source Least Privilege" mitigation strategy for Redash.

## Deep Analysis: Data Source Least Privilege in Redash

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness, implementation gaps, and potential improvements for the "Data Source Least Privilege" mitigation strategy within the context of our Redash deployment.  We aim to identify specific actions to strengthen this control and minimize the risk of unauthorized data access.

**Scope:**

This analysis will cover the following aspects of the mitigation strategy:

*   **Redash User/Group Permissions:**  Assessment of the current configuration of user and group permissions within Redash, focusing on data source access assignments.
*   **Query-Level Restrictions:**  Feasibility study and potential design considerations for implementing query-level restrictions within Redash (understanding this is a custom development effort).
*   **Audit Procedures:**  Evaluation of the existing audit process (or lack thereof) for reviewing Redash data source permissions, and recommendations for a robust audit schedule and methodology.
*   **Database-Level Considerations:** While the primary focus is on Redash-specific aspects, we will briefly touch upon the interaction between Redash permissions and underlying database permissions.  This is crucial for understanding the overall security posture.
* **Redash Version:** We assume that analysis is done for latest stable version of Redash.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Configuration Review:**  Direct examination of the Redash user and group management interface to analyze current data source access assignments.  This will involve:
    *   Listing all users and groups.
    *   Identifying the data sources each user/group has access to.
    *   Comparing assigned permissions against documented data access requirements (if available).
    *   Identifying any instances of overly permissive access (e.g., access to all data sources).

2.  **Code Review (for Query-Level Restrictions):**  Exploratory analysis of the Redash codebase (specifically, the query execution and data source connection components) to assess the feasibility and complexity of implementing query-level restrictions. This will involve:
    *   Identifying relevant code modules related to query processing and data source interaction.
    *   Evaluating potential injection points for custom authorization logic.
    *   Assessing the potential impact on performance and maintainability.

3.  **Process Review (for Audits):**  Review of any existing documentation or procedures related to auditing Redash user permissions.  If no formal process exists, we will develop a recommended audit procedure.

4.  **Interviews (Optional):**  If necessary, we may conduct brief interviews with Redash administrators and key users to gather additional context and insights.

5.  **Documentation Review:** Review of any existing security policies, data governance guidelines, or Redash-specific documentation that relates to data access control.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

Now, let's dive into the specific aspects of the mitigation strategy:

#### 2.1 Redash User/Group Permissions

**Current State (as described):** Partially implemented, inconsistent, and lacking strict granularity.

**Analysis:**

*   **Overly Permissive Access:** The primary concern is the lack of consistent and granular application of least privilege.  The description indicates that group-based permissions are used, but not to their full potential.  This likely means some users/groups have access to data sources they don't need.  This is a common issue and a significant security risk.
*   **Lack of Documentation:**  The absence of a clear mapping between users/groups, their roles, and their required data source access makes it difficult to determine if permissions are appropriate.  A well-defined data access matrix is crucial.
*   **Potential for "Permission Creep":**  Without regular reviews, permissions tend to accumulate over time.  Users may be added to groups for temporary tasks and never removed, leading to excessive access.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Comprehensive Permission Review:** Immediately conduct a thorough review of *all* Redash users and groups.  For each user/group, document:
    *   Their business role/function.
    *   The specific data sources they *require* access to (justification needed).
    *   The type of access needed (e.g., read-only, specific dashboards).
    *   Remove access from any data source that is not explicitly justified.

2.  **Implement a Strict Group-Based Policy:**  Organize users into groups based on their data access needs.  Avoid assigning data source permissions directly to individual users (except in rare, justified cases).  This simplifies management and reduces the risk of errors.

3.  **Document Data Access Requirements:** Create a formal data access matrix that maps roles/groups to required data sources.  This document should be reviewed and updated regularly.

4.  **Leverage Redash's "View Only Data Sources":** Redash has a feature to restrict users to only view results from a data source, preventing them from creating new queries. This should be used whenever possible.

#### 2.2 Query-Level Restrictions (Custom Development)

**Current State:** Not implemented; considered a fallback option.

**Analysis:**

*   **High Complexity:** Implementing query-level restrictions within Redash is a significant undertaking.  It would require modifying core components of the application, potentially impacting performance and stability.
*   **Potential Approaches:**
    *   **Query Parsing and Validation:**  Redash could be modified to parse user queries *before* execution, checking them against a set of allowed patterns or rules.  This is complex and prone to bypasses if not implemented carefully.
    *   **Data Source Proxy:**  A custom proxy could be placed between Redash and the data sources, intercepting and potentially modifying queries based on user roles and permissions.  This might be easier to implement than modifying Redash directly.
    *   **Leveraging Database Features:**  If the underlying database supports row-level security (RLS) or views, these features could be used to enforce query-level restrictions *outside* of Redash.  This is the preferred approach if feasible.
*   **Feasibility Assessment:**  A detailed code review is needed to determine the best approach and estimate the development effort.  This should be considered a long-term goal, prioritized *after* basic user/group permissions are tightened.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Prioritize Database-Level Controls:**  Before attempting custom development within Redash, thoroughly investigate the capabilities of the underlying databases.  If RLS, views, or other fine-grained access control mechanisms are available, leverage them. This is generally more secure and maintainable.
2.  **Conduct a Feasibility Study:** If database-level controls are insufficient, perform a detailed code review of Redash to assess the feasibility and complexity of implementing query-level restrictions.  Consider the different approaches (query parsing, proxy, etc.) and their trade-offs.
3.  **Prototype (if feasible):**  If the feasibility study is positive, develop a small-scale prototype to test the chosen approach and measure its performance impact.

#### 2.3 Regular Audits within Redash

**Current State:** Not implemented or not systematic.

**Analysis:**

*   **Crucial for Maintaining Least Privilege:**  Regular audits are essential to ensure that permissions remain appropriate over time.  Without audits, "permission creep" is inevitable.
*   **Audit Scope:**  Audits should cover:
    *   All user and group assignments.
    *   Data source access permissions for each user/group.
    *   Any changes made to permissions since the last audit.
    *   Verification that permissions align with the documented data access matrix.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Establish a Formal Audit Schedule:**  Conduct audits at least monthly, or more frequently if the environment is dynamic (e.g., frequent user onboarding/offboarding).
2.  **Develop a Standardized Audit Procedure:**  Create a checklist or script to ensure that audits are consistent and thorough.  This should include steps for:
    *   Generating a list of all users and groups.
    *   Retrieving data source permissions for each user/group.
    *   Comparing permissions against the data access matrix.
    *   Identifying and documenting any discrepancies.
    *   Reporting findings to relevant stakeholders (e.g., security team, data owners).
3.  **Automate (where possible):**  Explore the possibility of automating parts of the audit process using Redash's API or scripting.  This can save time and reduce the risk of human error.

#### 2.4 Database-Level Considerations

**Analysis:**

*   **Redash as a "Pass-Through":** Redash often acts as a "pass-through" for database credentials.  This means that the permissions granted to the Redash database user(s) directly impact what data Redash can access.
*   **Defense in Depth:**  Even with strict Redash permissions, it's crucial to implement least privilege at the database level as well.  This provides an additional layer of defense in case Redash is compromised or misconfigured.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Database User Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user accounts used by Redash have *only* the necessary permissions to access the required data.  Avoid granting overly broad privileges (e.g., `SELECT *` on all tables).
2.  **Separate Database Users (if possible):**  Consider using separate database user accounts for different data sources or groups of users within Redash.  This further limits the impact of a compromised Redash connection.
3.  **Regularly Review Database Permissions:**  Just as with Redash permissions, database permissions should be reviewed and audited regularly.

### 3. Conclusion and Overall Risk Reduction

By implementing the recommendations outlined above, the organization can significantly strengthen the "Data Source Least Privilege" mitigation strategy for Redash. This will reduce the risk of unauthorized data access from various threat vectors:

*   **Malicious Insider:** Risk reduced from High to Low/Medium (depending on the granularity of implemented controls).
*   **Accidental Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Compromised Redash Account:** Risk reduced from High to Low/Medium.

The most immediate priority is to conduct a comprehensive review and tightening of Redash user/group permissions.  This should be followed by establishing a regular audit process.  Exploring query-level restrictions is a longer-term goal that should be pursued after basic least privilege is firmly established.  Finally, ensuring least privilege at the database level is crucial for a robust defense-in-depth strategy.
