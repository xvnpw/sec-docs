# Threat Model Analysis for getredash/redash

## Threat: [Data Source Credential Theft via API](./threats/data_source_credential_theft_via_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Source Credential Theft via API

    *   **Description:** An attacker with API access (either through a compromised API key or a vulnerability in the API endpoint) could retrieve the stored credentials for connected data sources.  The attacker could use the `/api/data_sources` endpoint (or similar) to list all data sources and their configurations, potentially including sensitive credentials. This directly exploits Redash's API for managing data sources.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of connected data sources, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Redash API (`/api/data_sources` and related endpoints), Data Source Management module (`redash.models.DataSource`, `redash.handlers.data_sources`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **API Key Management:** Implement strict API key management, including regular rotation, limited permissions per key, and monitoring of API key usage.
        *   **Input Validation & Authorization:** Ensure robust input validation and authorization checks on all API endpoints, particularly those related to data source management.  Verify that the requesting user/API key has the necessary permissions.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Store data source credentials *only* in a secure secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  Redash should retrieve credentials from the secrets manager at runtime, *never* storing them directly in its database or configuration files.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Log all API requests, including successful and failed attempts, to access data source information.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Query Parameter Manipulation](./threats/sql_injection_via_query_parameter_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Query Parameter Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to create or modify queries *within Redash* attempts to inject malicious SQL code through improperly handled query parameters.  Even if Redash *intends* to use parameterized queries, a flaw in *Redash's* query execution logic or a misconfiguration in *Redash's* data source connector could allow injection. The attacker might try to manipulate parameters passed to the `redash.tasks.queries.execute_query` function. This is a direct threat to Redash's query handling.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, potential execution of arbitrary commands on the database server (depending on the database and its configuration).
    *   **Affected Component:** Query Execution Engine (`redash.tasks.queries.execute_query`), Data Source Connectors (e.g., `redash.query_runner.pg`, `redash.query_runner.mysql`), Query Result Handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Parameterized Query Enforcement:**  *Enforce* the use of parameterized queries at *all* levels: within Redash's query editor, in the query execution engine, and in the data source connectors.  Disable any features that allow raw SQL string construction with user-supplied input.
        *   **Input Validation (Secondary Defense):**  Implement strict input validation on all user-supplied parameters, even if parameterized queries are used.  This provides a defense-in-depth approach.
        *   **Data Source Connector Security:**  Ensure that all *Redash* data source connectors are up-to-date and configured securely to prevent SQL injection.  Regularly review connector code for potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF with rules to detect and block SQL injection attempts. While a WAF is a general defense, it's relevant here as it can protect *Redash's* exposed interface.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via User Management Flaws](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_user_management_flaws.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via User Management Flaws

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in *Redash's* user management system to gain elevated privileges (e.g., becoming an administrator).  This could involve manipulating user roles, creating new users with excessive permissions, or exploiting flaws in *Redash's* authentication or authorization logic (`redash.handlers.users`, `redash.models.User`, `redash.authentication`). This is a direct attack on Redash's user management functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Redash instance, allowing the attacker to access all data sources, modify configurations, and potentially compromise connected systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** User Management Module (`redash.handlers.users`, `redash.models.User`), Authentication and Authorization Logic (`redash.authentication`), API Endpoints related to user management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation on all user management forms and API endpoints to prevent attackers from manipulating user data or roles.
        *   **Secure Authentication:**  Enforce strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and secure session management.
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement a well-defined RBAC system to ensure that users have only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the user management system to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Limit Self-Registration:** If self-registration is enabled, ensure that newly registered users have minimal privileges by default.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Alerting Mechanism](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_alerting_mechanism.md)

* **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via Alerting Mechanism

    * **Description:** An attacker configures malicious alerts *within Redash* to exfiltrate data. They could set up alerts that trigger on specific conditions and send the results to an external endpoint controlled by the attacker (e.g., a webhook). This abuses the `redash.tasks.alerts.check_alerts` and related functions *within Redash*.
    * **Impact:** Sensitive data is sent to an attacker-controlled location, leading to a data breach.
    * **Affected Component:** Alerting System (`redash.tasks.alerts`, `redash.models.Alert`, `redash.destinations`), specifically webhook and email destinations.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Alert Destination Whitelisting:** Restrict the allowed destinations for alerts (e.g., only allow webhooks to specific, trusted domains). This is a configuration setting *within Redash*.
        * **Alert Content Review:** Implement a process for reviewing and approving new alert configurations, especially those that send data to external destinations.
        * **Alert Auditing:** Log all alert activity, including the alert configuration, trigger conditions, and destination.
        * **Limit Alert Frequency:** Restrict the frequency with which alerts can be triggered to prevent attackers from exfiltrating large amounts of data quickly.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Dashboard Access via Shared Link Manipulation](./threats/unauthorized_dashboard_access_via_shared_link_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Dashboard Access via Shared Link Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a shared dashboard link (either through guessing, social engineering, or a compromised account) and views data they are not authorized to see. The attacker might try to modify the URL of a shared dashboard (e.g., changing the dashboard ID) to access other dashboards. This exploits weaknesses in *Redash's* sharing mechanism (`redash.handlers.dashboards.show`, `redash.models.Dashboard`).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data disclosure, potentially leading to privacy violations or competitive disadvantage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dashboard Sharing Mechanism (`redash.handlers.dashboards.show`, `redash.models.Dashboard`), Access Control Logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication for Shared Links:** Require users to authenticate before accessing shared dashboards, even if they have the link. Avoid relying solely on "secret" URLs for security.
        *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement fine-grained ACLs to control which users or groups can access specific dashboards.
        *   **Link Expiration:** Configure shared links to expire after a certain period of time or a certain number of views.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Log all access to shared dashboards, including the user (if authenticated), IP address, and timestamp.
        * **Disable Public Sharing:** If possible, disable the ability to create publicly accessible dashboards entirely. This is a configuration option *within Redash*.
