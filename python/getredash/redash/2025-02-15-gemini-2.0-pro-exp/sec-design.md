*   Provide a user-friendly interface for creating visualizations and dashboards.
*   Facilitate sharing and collaboration on data insights.
*   Maintain a stable and reliable platform.
*   Foster a strong open-source community.

Business Goals:

*   Become a leading open-source data visualization tool.
*   Attract a large and active user base.
*   Grow the community of contributors.
*   Potentially offer a commercial/hosted version for revenue generation (observed in the repository).

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in connected data sources.
*   Service unavailability or performance issues impacting user productivity.
*   Vulnerabilities in the application leading to data corruption or loss.
*   Competition from other open-source and commercial data visualization tools.
*   Lack of adoption or engagement from the open-source community.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on observation of the repository):

*   security control: Authentication: User authentication via email/password, Google OAuth, SAML, and other methods. (Implemented in `redash/authentication.py` and related files).
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (Admin, User) and object-level permissions (queries, dashboards, data sources). (Described in documentation and implemented in `redash/permissions.py` and related files).
*   security control: Input Validation: Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. (Observed in query execution logic).
*   security control: API Security: API keys for controlling access to the Redash API. (Implemented in `redash/handlers/api.py` and related files).
*   security control: CSRF Protection: Measures to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery. (Observed in the codebase).
*   security control: Dependency Management: Use of requirements files and dependency management tools. (Observed in `requirements.txt`, `requirements_dev.txt`, etc.).
*   security control: Docker Deployment: Containerization for consistent and isolated deployments. (Observed in `Dockerfile` and related files).
*   security control: Configuration Management: Environment variables and configuration files for managing settings. (Observed throughout the codebase).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The project relies heavily on third-party libraries, introducing potential supply chain risks.
*   accepted risk: The open-source nature of the project means that vulnerabilities may be discovered and exploited before patches are available.
*   accepted risk: Users are responsible for securing their own data sources and network configurations.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
*   Introduce regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   Implement a comprehensive logging and monitoring system to detect and respond to security incidents.

*   Implement a vulnerability disclosure program.
*   Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA).
*   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support multiple authentication methods (email/password, OAuth, SAML).
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Provide session management with secure cookies.
    *   Consider 2FA/MFA.
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement granular role-based access control.
    *   Enforce object-level permissions.
    *   Regularly review and update permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user inputs on the server-side.
    *   Use parameterized queries for all database interactions.
    *   Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong encryption algorithms for storing sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication.
    *   Regularly update cryptographic libraries.

## BUILD

The Redash build process involves several steps, from code changes by developers to the creation of Docker images.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer(("Developer")) --> GitHub("GitHub Repository")
    GitHub --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions\n(CI/CD)"]
    GitHubActions --> Build("Build & Test\n(Python, Node.js)")
    Build --> Lint("Linting\n(ESLint, Flake8)")
    Lint --> Tests("Unit & Integration Tests")
    Tests --> SAST("SAST\n(Bandit, etc.)")
    SAST --> DockerBuild("Docker Image Build")
    DockerBuild --> DockerHub("Docker Hub\n(Image Registry)")
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions triggers a CI/CD workflow.
3.  The workflow builds the application (Python backend and React frontend).
4.  Linters (ESLint for JavaScript, Flake8 for Python) check code style and potential errors.
5.  Unit and integration tests are executed.
6.  Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (e.g., Bandit for Python) scan the codebase for vulnerabilities.
7.  If all checks pass, Docker images are built.
8.  The Docker images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Code Review: Pull requests and code reviews before merging changes.
*   Linting: Enforcing code style and identifying potential errors.
*   Automated Testing: Unit and integration tests to catch bugs and regressions.
*   SAST: Scanning for security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
*   Dependency Management: Using requirements files and tools to manage dependencies and track vulnerabilities.
*   Docker Image Security: Building secure Docker images by minimizing the attack surface, using trusted base images, and scanning for vulnerabilities.
*   CI/CD Pipeline Security: Securing the CI/CD pipeline itself (access control, secrets management).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Data Querying and Visualization: The core functionality of Redash, enabling users to analyze data.
*   Dashboard Creation and Sharing: Allowing users to create and share insights with others.
*   Data Source Connectivity: Connecting to various data sources to retrieve data.
*   User Authentication and Authorization: Managing user access and permissions.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Redash Metadata (PostgreSQL):
    *   User credentials (hashed passwords, API keys). Sensitivity: High
    *   Data source connection details (credentials, URLs). Sensitivity: High
    *   Query definitions and results (may contain sensitive data). Sensitivity: Variable, depends on the data source and queries.
    *   Dashboard configurations. Sensitivity: Medium
*   Data Source Data:
    *   Data stored in connected data sources. Sensitivity: Variable, depends on the data source. Redash acts as a conduit to this data.
