# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for getredash/redash

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Source Least Privilege (Redash-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/data_source_least_privilege__redash-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Redash User/Group Permissions:** Within Redash's user and group management interface, ensure that users and groups are granted access *only* to the specific data sources they require.  Do *not* grant blanket access to all data sources.
    2.  **Query-Level Restrictions (Ideal, but may require custom development):** Explore the possibility of implementing query-level restrictions within Redash. This is a more advanced mitigation and might involve modifying Redash's code. The goal is to limit users to specific types of queries or even specific tables/columns *within* a data source, even if the underlying database connection has broader permissions. This is a *fallback* if database-level least privilege is not fully achievable.
    3.  **Regular Audits within Redash:** Periodically (e.g., monthly) review the data source permissions assigned to users and groups *within the Redash UI*. Remove any unnecessary access.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Insider (High):** Limits the damage a malicious or compromised Redash user account can inflict. Even with Redash access, they are restricted to specific data sources.
    *   **Accidental Data Exposure (Medium):** Prevents users from accidentally accessing or sharing data they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Compromised Redash Account (High):** Reduces the scope of damage if a Redash user account is compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Insider:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low/Medium* (depending on the user's role and assigned data sources).
    *   **Accidental Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **Compromised Redash Account:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low/Medium*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Redash's group-based permissions are used, but not consistently or with the strictest possible granularity.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review and tightening of data source permissions for *all* users and groups within Redash.
    *   Exploration of query-level restrictions (custom development).
    *   Regular, scheduled audits of Redash user/group permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Query Parameterization (Redash-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_query_parameterization__redash-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **User Training (Focused on Redash):** Conduct training sessions specifically focused on how to use parameterized queries *within the Redash query editor*. Provide Redash-specific examples and demonstrate the correct syntax.
    2.  **Redash Documentation:** Create clear and concise documentation, integrated into Redash's help system or as a readily accessible resource, that explains parameterized queries *within Redash*.
    3.  **Query Validation (Custom Development within Redash):** This is the most crucial Redash-specific aspect.  Modify Redash's code to:
        *   **Detect Non-Parameterized Queries:** Implement logic to analyze queries *before* execution and identify those that do not use parameters.
        *   **Warn/Block Non-Parameterized Queries:**  Configure Redash to either *warn* the user or *block* the execution of non-parameterized queries.  Ideally, provide a clear error message explaining why the query was blocked and how to fix it.
        *   **Exemptions (Carefully Managed):**  Provide a mechanism for administrators to *carefully* exempt specific queries or users from this rule, if absolutely necessary (e.g., for legacy queries that cannot be easily parameterized).  This should be logged and audited.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical):** Parameterized queries, enforced *within Redash*, are the primary defense against SQL injection attacks originating from Redash.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Very Low* (if properly implemented and enforced within Redash).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Redash's query editor supports parameterized queries, and some documentation exists. However, usage is not enforced, and no validation mechanisms exist *within Redash*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Mandatory user training focused on Redash's parameterization features.
    *   *Crucially*: Custom development within Redash to detect, warn, and/or block non-parameterized queries.
    *   A system for managing exemptions to the parameterization rule.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) (Redash-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp___redash-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Redash's Code:** Thoroughly analyze Redash's frontend code (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) to identify all sources of content (scripts, styles, images, fonts, etc.).  Pay close attention to any third-party libraries used.
    2.  **Develop a Redash-Specific CSP:** Create a CSP that is tailored to Redash's specific needs.  Start with a very restrictive policy (e.g., `default-src 'none'`) and gradually add directives to allow only the necessary resources.  Consider using a tool to help generate the CSP.
    3.  **Integrate into Redash:** Modify Redash's code to include the CSP as an HTTP header (`Content-Security-Policy`). This typically involves modifying the server-side code that generates the HTML responses.
    4.  **Test within Redash:** Thoroughly test the CSP *within Redash* using a browser's developer tools.  Use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header during testing to identify violations without blocking resources.  Address any issues by adjusting the policy.
    5.  **Reporting URI (Redash Integration):** Configure a reporting URI within Redash to collect CSP violation reports. This might involve setting up a dedicated endpoint within Redash or using an external service.  Analyze these reports to identify and fix any remaining issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Critical):** A well-crafted CSP, implemented *within Redash*, is a powerful defense against XSS attacks targeting the Redash web interface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low* (with a well-crafted and maintained CSP).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Complete implementation of a comprehensive CSP, including code modifications within Redash, testing, and integration of a reporting URI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Redash Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_redash_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `.env` (or Environment Variables):** Carefully review *all* settings in Redash's configuration file (`.env` or the environment variables used).
    2.  **`REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY`:** Ensure these are set to strong, randomly generated values.  *Never* use default or easily guessable values.  These secrets are crucial for protecting session cookies and other sensitive data.
    3.  **`REDASH_ENFORCE_HTTPS`:** Set this to `true` if you are using HTTPS (which you should be). This enforces HTTPS connections to Redash.
    4.  **`REDASH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `REDASH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (if using Google OAuth):** Ensure these are properly configured and kept secret.
    5.  **Other Settings:** Review all other settings for potential security implications. Disable any unused features or data source types.
    6.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the Redash configuration to ensure it remains secure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Hijacking (High):** Strong `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` values protect against session hijacking.
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) (High):** These secrets also help protect against CSRF attacks.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Medium):** Proper configuration helps prevent unauthorized access to Redash.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **CSRF:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Some security-related settings are configured, but a comprehensive review and hardening of *all* settings is needed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough review and hardening of *all* Redash configuration settings.
    *   Regular, scheduled reviews of the configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Scheduled Queries and Alerts Review (Redash-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/scheduled_queries_and_alerts_review__redash-specific_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Access Redash's Scheduled Queries:** Within the Redash UI, navigate to the section that lists all scheduled queries and alerts.
    2.  **Review Each Entry:** For each scheduled query and alert:
        *   Verify that it is still needed.
        *   Confirm that the query logic is correct and does not contain any unintended actions.
        *   Check the schedule and ensure it is appropriate.
        *   Review the alert destinations (e.g., email addresses, Slack channels) and ensure they are still valid and secure.
    3.  **Disable/Delete Unnecessary Entries:** Disable or delete any scheduled queries or alerts that are no longer needed.
    4.  **Document Changes:** Document any changes made to scheduled queries or alerts, including the reason for the change.
    5. **Regularly review:** Regularly (e.g. monthly) review all scheduled queries.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Medium):** Prevents scheduled queries from being used to exfiltrate data without authorization.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Low):** Prevents unnecessary queries from consuming resources.
    *   **Outdated Alerts (Low):** Ensures that alerts are sent to the correct recipients and are still relevant.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from *Low* to *Negligible*.
    *   **Outdated Alerts:** Risk reduced from *Low* to *Negligible*.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Not implemented. No formal process for reviewing scheduled queries.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Implementation of a regular review process for all scheduled queries and alerts within Redash.
