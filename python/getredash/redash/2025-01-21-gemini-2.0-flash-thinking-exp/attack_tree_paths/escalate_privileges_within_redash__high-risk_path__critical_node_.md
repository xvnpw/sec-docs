### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Escalate Privileges within Redash

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in Redash's authorization logic to gain higher-level access than initially granted.

**Likelihood:** Low

**Impact:** High - ability to perform administrative actions within Redash.

**Effort:** Medium

**Skill Level:** Intermediate.

**Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

This attack path focuses on an attacker leveraging vulnerabilities within Redash's authorization mechanisms to elevate their privileges. While the likelihood is considered low, the potential impact is significant, making it a critical area of concern. The attacker requires an intermediate skill level, suggesting they possess a good understanding of web application security principles and are capable of identifying and exploiting subtle flaws.

**Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Techniques:**

* **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Administrative Endpoints:**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker with a regular user account might discover API endpoints intended for administrative tasks (e.g., managing users, data sources, queries) that use predictable or sequential IDs.
    * **Exploitation:** By manipulating the ID parameter in API requests, the attacker could potentially access or modify resources belonging to administrators or perform administrative actions.
    * **Example:**  An API endpoint like `/api/users/{user_id}/permissions` might allow an attacker to change the permissions of other users by simply incrementing or decrementing the `user_id`.

* **Missing Authorization Checks on Critical API Endpoints:**
    * **Scenario:** Certain API endpoints responsible for sensitive operations (e.g., creating data sources, modifying query schedules, accessing sensitive data) might lack proper authorization checks.
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker could directly access these endpoints without proper authentication or authorization, potentially gaining administrative control or accessing sensitive information.
    * **Example:** An endpoint like `/api/data_sources/create` might not verify if the requesting user has the necessary permissions to create new data sources.

* **Parameter Tampering to Bypass Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    * **Scenario:** Redash might rely on parameters in requests to determine user roles or permissions.
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker could manipulate these parameters to trick the application into granting them higher privileges.
    * **Example:**  A request to execute a query might include a parameter like `user_role=viewer`. An attacker might try to change this to `user_role=admin` to gain elevated privileges for that specific action.

* **Exploiting Flaws in the Role Assignment Logic:**
    * **Scenario:**  Vulnerabilities in the code responsible for assigning and managing user roles could be exploited.
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker might find a way to directly modify their own role or add themselves to administrative groups.
    * **Example:** A bug in the user registration or profile update process might allow an attacker to specify their desired role.

* **Session Hijacking or Fixation Leading to Privilege Escalation:**
    * **Scenario:** If Redash's session management is vulnerable to hijacking or fixation attacks, an attacker could potentially steal or force a session belonging to an administrator.
    * **Exploitation:** Once the attacker has control of an administrator's session, they can perform any action the administrator is authorized to do.

* **Data Injection Vulnerabilities Affecting Authorization:**
    * **Scenario:** While less direct, vulnerabilities like SQL injection (if user roles are stored in a database) or other data injection flaws could potentially be used to manipulate user roles or permissions.
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious code to modify database records related to user roles, granting themselves administrative privileges.

**Step-by-Step Attack Scenario (Example - IDOR):**

1. **Reconnaissance:** The attacker creates a regular user account on the Redash instance.
2. **Endpoint Discovery:** The attacker explores the Redash application and identifies API endpoints, potentially using browser developer tools or intercepting network traffic.
3. **Identify Potential IDOR:** The attacker notices an endpoint like `/api/users/{user_id}/permissions` when viewing their own permissions.
4. **Attempt ID Manipulation:** The attacker tries changing the `user_id` in the request to other values (e.g., 1, 2, etc.).
5. **Success:** The attacker finds that they can access the permissions of other users, including administrators.
6. **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker modifies their own permissions using the same endpoint, granting themselves administrative privileges.

**Impact of Successful Privilege Escalation:**

A successful privilege escalation attack can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** The attacker gains access to all data sources, queries, and dashboards within Redash, potentially exposing sensitive business information.
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete existing data sources, queries, and dashboards, disrupting operations and potentially causing financial loss.
* **System Disruption:** The attacker can perform administrative actions like disabling features, deleting users, or even potentially gaining access to the underlying server if Redash is not properly isolated.
* **Reputational Damage:** A security breach of this nature can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode trust with users and customers.
* **Compliance Violations:** Accessing and manipulating sensitive data without proper authorization can lead to violations of data privacy regulations.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of privilege escalation, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Robust Authorization Checks:** Implement thorough authorization checks on all API endpoints and functionalities, ensuring that users can only access resources and perform actions they are explicitly permitted to.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required for their roles. Avoid assigning broad administrative privileges unnecessarily.
* **Secure Direct Object Reference Handling:** Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in URLs or API requests. Use indirect references or implement access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access based on predictable IDs.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent parameter tampering and data injection attacks.
* **Secure Session Management:** Implement robust session management practices, including using secure cookies, HTTP Only and Secure flags, and implementing proper session invalidation mechanisms to prevent session hijacking and fixation.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting authorization logic to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Code Reviews:** Implement thorough code review processes, paying close attention to authorization-related code to identify potential flaws.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Best Practices:**  Ensure the RBAC implementation is robust and well-defined, with clear separation of roles and responsibilities. Regularly review and update role assignments.
* **Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection:** Implement rate limiting on sensitive API endpoints and monitor for unusual activity patterns that might indicate a privilege escalation attempt.
* **Security Headers:** Implement security headers like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy` to further enhance security.

**Detection and Response:**

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of all API requests, authentication attempts, and authorization decisions. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or changes in user roles.
* **Alerting:** Configure alerts for critical events, such as failed login attempts from unusual locations, attempts to access restricted resources, or changes to administrative user accounts.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Develop a clear incident response plan to handle potential privilege escalation incidents, including steps for containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.

**Conclusion:**

The "Escalate Privileges within Redash" attack path, while currently assessed as having a low likelihood, poses a significant risk due to its high potential impact. By understanding the potential vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack vector. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and a proactive approach to security are crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the Redash application and its data.
