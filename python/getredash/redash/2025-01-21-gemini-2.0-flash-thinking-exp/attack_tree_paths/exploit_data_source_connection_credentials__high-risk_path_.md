**4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Data Source Connection Credentials (High-Risk Path)**

This attack path represents a significant threat to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data accessed through Redash. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to connected data sources, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.

**Overall Attack Vector: Obtaining and using valid credentials for the connected data sources.**

The attacker's primary goal is to acquire legitimate credentials used by Redash to connect to external data sources (e.g., databases, APIs). Once these credentials are obtained, the attacker can impersonate Redash and directly access sensitive data, bypassing Redash's intended access controls and potentially leaving no trace within the Redash application itself. This makes it a high-risk path due to the potential for significant impact.

**Sub-Vector 1: Retrieve Stored Credentials (e.g., from Redash database)**

* **Description:** This sub-vector involves the attacker attempting to directly access the storage location where Redash saves data source connection credentials. This could be the Redash application database itself, configuration files, or other storage mechanisms.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Redash Database:** If credentials are stored within the Redash database, an attacker might attempt SQL injection attacks, exploit database vulnerabilities, or gain unauthorized access through compromised Redash application accounts.
    * **Configuration Files:** Credentials might be stored in configuration files, either in plain text or weakly encrypted. Accessing these files through file system vulnerabilities or compromised server access could expose the credentials.
    * **Other Storage Mechanisms:**  Less common, but credentials could be stored in environment variables, secrets management systems (if improperly configured), or even in application logs (a significant security flaw).
* **Likelihood:** Medium - While Redash likely implements some form of encryption, vulnerabilities in the implementation, weak encryption algorithms, or insufficient access controls could make this feasible.
* **Impact:** High - Successful retrieval of credentials grants direct access to connected data sources, potentially exposing vast amounts of sensitive information.
* **Effort:** Medium - Requires some technical skill to identify storage locations and potentially exploit vulnerabilities to gain access.
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate -  Understanding of database structures, file system navigation, and basic exploitation techniques is required.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium -  Detecting unauthorized database access or file system access can be challenging without robust monitoring and logging. An attacker might blend in with legitimate traffic or access patterns.
* **Insight:** The key insight here is the critical importance of **securely storing and managing data source credentials**. Strong encryption is paramount, along with strict access controls to the storage location. Regular security audits and penetration testing can help identify vulnerabilities in this area.

**Mitigation Strategies for "Retrieve Stored Credentials":**

* **Robust Encryption:** Implement strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) for storing credentials at rest. Ensure proper key management practices are in place.
* **Secure Storage Location:** Store credentials in a dedicated, secure location with restricted access. Avoid storing them directly in application code or easily accessible configuration files.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular RBAC within the Redash application and the underlying infrastructure to limit access to credential storage.
* **Database Security Hardening:**  Harden the Redash database against common attacks like SQL injection. Regularly patch and update the database software.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in credential storage and access mechanisms.
* **Secrets Management Tools:** Consider using dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and manage sensitive credentials.

**Sub-Vector 2: Exploit Credential Leakage (e.g., through insecure configuration) (High-Risk Path)**

* **Description:** This sub-vector focuses on exploiting situations where data source credentials are unintentionally exposed due to insecure configurations or practices. This could involve credentials being left in configuration files, environment variables, or even in logs.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Configuration Files:** Credentials might be inadvertently committed to version control systems, left in plain text in configuration files on servers, or exposed through misconfigured web server access.
    * **Environment Variables:** While sometimes used for configuration, storing sensitive credentials directly in environment variables can be risky if the environment is not properly secured.
    * **Logging:**  Accidental logging of connection strings or credentials can expose them to attackers who gain access to log files.
    * **Insecure Defaults:**  Default configurations might include placeholder credentials that are never changed or are easily guessable.
* **Likelihood:** Medium -  Human error and oversight in configuration management make this a realistic possibility.
* **Impact:** High -  Leaked credentials provide direct access to data sources, similar to the previous sub-vector.
* **Effort:** Low -  Finding leaked credentials often requires minimal effort, especially if they are publicly accessible or easily discoverable.
* **Skill Level:** Beginner -  Basic knowledge of file systems, environment variables, and configuration files is sufficient.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low -  Scanning for common credential patterns in configuration files or environment variables can be relatively straightforward. However, detecting accidental logging might be more challenging.
* **Insight:** This highlights the importance of **rigorous configuration management and secure development practices**. Regularly reviewing configurations and avoiding the storage of sensitive information in easily accessible locations is crucial.

**Mitigation Strategies for "Exploit Credential Leakage":**

* **Secure Configuration Management:** Implement secure configuration management practices, including:
    * **Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files.**
    * **Use environment variables or secrets management tools for sensitive information.**
    * **Implement version control for configuration files and regularly review changes.**
    * **Ensure configuration files are not publicly accessible.**
* **Secrets Management Tools:**  Utilize dedicated secrets management tools to securely store and manage credentials, preventing them from being directly embedded in configuration files or environment variables.
* **Environment Variable Security:** If using environment variables, ensure the environment is properly secured and access is restricted.
* **Log Sanitization:** Implement mechanisms to prevent sensitive information, including credentials, from being logged.
* **Regular Security Reviews:** Conduct regular security reviews of configuration files, environment variables, and logging practices to identify potential leaks.
* **Static Code Analysis:** Utilize static code analysis tools to scan for hardcoded credentials or potential credential leaks in the codebase.
* **Developer Training:** Educate developers on secure coding practices and the risks associated with storing credentials insecurely.

**5. Recommendations:**

Based on the analysis of the "Exploit Data Source Connection Credentials" attack path, the following recommendations are provided for the development team:

* **Prioritize Secure Credential Storage:** Implement robust encryption and access controls for storing data source credentials at rest. Explore and adopt dedicated secrets management solutions.
