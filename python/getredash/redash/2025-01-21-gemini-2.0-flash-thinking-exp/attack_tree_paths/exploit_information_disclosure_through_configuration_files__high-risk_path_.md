### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Information Disclosure through Configuration Files

**Attack Path:** Exploit Information Disclosure through Configuration Files

**Description:** This attack path involves an attacker gaining unauthorized access to configuration files used by the Redash application. These files often contain sensitive information crucial for the application's operation, such as database credentials, API keys for external services, secret keys used for encryption or signing, and SMTP server details. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to compromise the application and potentially related systems.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Sensitive Information at Risk:**
    * **Database Credentials:**  Username, password, and connection details for the Redash database. This allows the attacker to directly access and manipulate the application's data, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    * **API Keys:** Keys used to authenticate with external services (e.g., data sources, notification providers). Compromise allows the attacker to impersonate the Redash application and access or manipulate data in those external services.
    * **Secret Keys (e.g., `SECRET_KEY` in Django settings):** Used for cryptographic operations like session management, CSRF protection, and password hashing. Disclosure can lead to session hijacking, bypassing security measures, and potentially decrypting sensitive data.
    * **SMTP Credentials:** Username, password, and server details for sending emails. This allows the attacker to send emails on behalf of the application, potentially for phishing or spam campaigns.
    * **Other Environment Variables:**  Potentially containing sensitive information related to deployment, logging, or other configurations.

* **Attack Vectors:**

    * **Publicly Accessible Version Control Systems:**  Accidentally committing configuration files containing sensitive information to public repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) without proper redaction. This is a common beginner mistake and requires minimal skill.
    * **Misconfigured Web Servers:**  Web server configurations that allow direct access to application configuration directories (e.g., through directory listing or incorrect URL routing). This requires some understanding of web server configurations but is often exploitable with readily available tools.
    * **Insecure File Permissions:**  Configuration files stored with overly permissive file permissions on the application server, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read them. This requires local access to the server but can be exploited by low-skill attackers if permissions are poorly managed.
    * **Default Credentials:**  Using default or easily guessable credentials for accessing the application server or related infrastructure where configuration files are stored.
    * **Insider Threats:**  Malicious or negligent insiders with legitimate access to the server or development environment accessing and exfiltrating configuration files.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromise of development tools or dependencies that inadvertently expose configuration files.
    * **Lack of Secure Secrets Management:**  Storing sensitive information directly in configuration files instead of using secure secrets management solutions.
    * **Exposed Backup Files:**  Backup files containing configuration data stored in insecure locations.
    * **Exploiting Application Vulnerabilities:**  While not directly targeting configuration files, vulnerabilities in the Redash application itself could be exploited to gain access to the server's file system where these files reside.

* **Impact Assessment:**

    * **High Confidentiality Impact:**  Disclosure of sensitive credentials and secrets can lead to unauthorized access to databases, external services, and the application itself.
    * **High Integrity Impact:**  Attackers can modify data in the database or external services, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation. They could also alter the application's behavior by modifying configuration settings.
    * **High Availability Impact:**  Attackers could disrupt the application's operation by modifying critical configuration settings, leading to denial of service. They could also use compromised credentials to overload external services.
    * **Reputational Damage:**  A data breach or security incident resulting from this vulnerability can severely damage the reputation of the organization using the Redash application.
    * **Financial Loss:**  Potential costs associated with incident response, data breach notifications, legal fees, and loss of business.

* **Re-evaluation of Likelihood and Effort:**

    * **Likelihood: Medium (Remains Consistent):** While the attack vectors are relatively straightforward, successful exploitation often depends on developer oversight or misconfigurations. The prevalence of secure secrets management practices is increasing, which can lower the likelihood. However, the ease of accidental exposure (e.g., through version control) keeps the likelihood at a medium level.
    * **Effort: Low (Remains Consistent):**  Exploiting this vulnerability often requires minimal technical skill, especially in cases of publicly exposed files or default credentials. Tools and techniques for finding exposed secrets are readily available.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**

    * **Utilize Environment Variables:** Store sensitive configuration data (database credentials, API keys, etc.) as environment variables instead of directly in configuration files. This separates sensitive data from the codebase and makes it less likely to be accidentally committed to version control.
    * **Implement Secure Secrets Management Solutions:** Employ dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store, access, and manage sensitive credentials. These tools provide features like encryption at rest and in transit, access control, and audit logging.
    * **Restrict File Permissions:** Ensure that configuration files have restrictive file permissions, allowing only the necessary users and processes to read them.
    * **Secure Version Control Practices:** Implement strict policies against committing sensitive data to version control. Utilize tools like `.gitignore` to exclude configuration files and employ techniques like Git history rewriting (with caution) to remove accidentally committed secrets. Consider using Git hooks to prevent commits containing sensitive data.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential misconfigurations and vulnerabilities related to configuration management.
    * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security:** If using IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation), ensure that secrets are not hardcoded in the IaC templates and leverage secrets management integrations.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications accessing configuration data.
    * **Regularly Rotate Secrets:** Implement a policy for regularly rotating sensitive credentials to limit the window of opportunity for attackers if a secret is compromised.
    * **Secure Backup Practices:** Ensure that backups containing configuration data are stored securely and encrypted.
    * **Educate Developers:** Train developers on secure coding practices and the importance of proper configuration management.
    * **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerting for unauthorized access attempts to configuration files or changes in their content.

**Conclusion:**

The "Exploit Information Disclosure through Configuration Files" attack path represents a significant risk to Redash applications due to the sensitive nature of the data often stored within these files. The relatively low effort required for exploitation, coupled with the potentially high impact, makes this a critical area of focus for security. Implementing robust mitigation strategies, particularly the adoption of environment variables and dedicated secrets management solutions, is crucial for protecting Redash applications and the sensitive data they handle. Continuous vigilance, regular security assessments, and developer education are essential to minimize the risk associated with this attack vector.
