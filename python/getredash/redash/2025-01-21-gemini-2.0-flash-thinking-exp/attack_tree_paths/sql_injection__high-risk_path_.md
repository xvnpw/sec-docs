### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious SQL through Query Parameters

**Attack Vector:** SQL Injection

**Sub-Vector:** Inject Malicious SQL through Query Parameters (High-Risk Path)

This sub-vector focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities where user-provided data, typically passed through URL query parameters or form data, is directly concatenated or interpolated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements).

**Understanding the Mechanism:**

Imagine a Redash feature that allows users to filter data based on a specific value. This value might be passed through a URL parameter like `https://your-redash.com/queries/123?filter_column=name&filter_value=John`. If the backend code constructs the SQL query by directly embedding the `filter_value` without proper handling, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example of Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

```python
# Vulnerable Python code (Illustrative - Redash implementation may differ)
def execute_query(filter_column, filter_value):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE {filter_column} = '{filter_value}'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    return results
```

In this vulnerable example, if an attacker provides a malicious `filter_value` like `John' OR 1=1 --`, the resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John' OR 1=1 --'
```

The `OR 1=1` condition will always be true, effectively bypassing the intended filter and potentially returning all rows from the `users` table. The `--` comments out the remaining part of the query, preventing syntax errors.

**Analysis of Attributes:**

* **Likelihood: Medium:** While SQL injection is a well-known vulnerability, modern frameworks and development practices often incorporate safeguards. However, the complexity of web applications and the potential for developer oversight mean it's still a realistic threat. In the context of Redash, which interacts heavily with databases, the likelihood is elevated compared to applications with less database interaction. The "Medium" rating suggests that while not every endpoint is likely vulnerable, there's a reasonable chance of finding exploitable instances.

* **Impact: High:** Successful SQL injection can have severe consequences:
    * **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, business intelligence data, and potentially personally identifiable information (PII).
    * **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to data integrity issues and potential business disruption.
    * **Authentication Bypass:** In some cases, attackers can manipulate queries to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain administrative access.
    * **Remote Code Execution (in some scenarios):** Depending on the database system and its configuration, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary code on the database server.

* **Effort: Low:**  Exploiting basic SQL injection vulnerabilities through query parameters often requires relatively low effort. Numerous readily available tools and techniques exist to identify and exploit these flaws. For common scenarios, an attacker might only need to manipulate URL parameters or form fields.

* **Skill Level: Intermediate:** While basic SQL injection can be exploited with limited technical knowledge, crafting more sophisticated injection payloads or bypassing certain security measures might require an intermediate level of understanding of SQL syntax and database behavior.

* **Detection Difficulty: Medium:**  Detecting SQL injection attempts can be challenging. Simple attacks might be logged as errors, but more sophisticated attempts can blend in with legitimate traffic. Effective detection requires:
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Preventing malicious input from reaching the database in the first place.
    * **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  WAFs can identify and block suspicious SQL injection patterns in HTTP requests.
    * **Database Activity Monitoring:**  Monitoring database logs for unusual or malicious queries.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**  Aggregating and analyzing security logs from various sources to detect potential attacks.

* **Insight: Implement parameterized queries and input validation to prevent SQL injection.** This insight highlights the two most crucial preventative measures:

    * **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This technique involves separating the SQL query structure from the user-supplied data. Placeholders are used in the query, and the data is passed separately to the database driver. This ensures that the data is treated as data, not executable SQL code.

    **Example of Parameterized Query (Conceptual):**

    ```python
    # Secure Python code using parameterized query
    def execute_query_safe(filter_column, filter_value):
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE {} = %s".format(filter_column) # Note: Column names might need different handling
        cursor.execute(query, (filter_value,))
        results = cursor.fetchall()
        return results
    ```

    * **Input Validation:**  Verifying that user-supplied data conforms to expected formats and constraints. This includes:
        * **Type Checking:** Ensuring data is of the expected type (e.g., integer, string).
        * **Length Restrictions:** Limiting the length of input fields.
        * **Whitelisting:** Allowing only specific, known-good characters or patterns.
        * **Sanitization (with caution):**  Encoding or escaping potentially harmful characters. However, relying solely on sanitization can be risky, and parameterized queries are generally preferred.

**Potential Vulnerable Areas in Redash:**

Based on the understanding of Redash's functionality, potential areas where this vulnerability might exist include:

* **Data Source Connections:** When users configure data source connections, parameters like database names, table names, and connection strings might be vulnerable if not handled correctly.
* **Query Creation and Execution:**  The core functionality of Redash involves users writing and executing queries. If user-provided input (e.g., filters, parameters within the query editor) is directly embedded into the final SQL query sent to the database, it's a high-risk area.
* **Dashboard Parameterization:**  Dashboards often allow users to filter data using parameters. If these parameters are not properly sanitized before being used in the underlying queries, they could be exploited.
* **API Endpoints:**  Redash exposes API endpoints for various functionalities. If these endpoints accept user input that is used to construct SQL queries, they are potential targets.
* **Custom Visualizations:** If custom visualizations involve server-side processing of user input that interacts with the database, vulnerabilities could exist there.

**Detailed Attack Scenario:**

1. **Attacker Identifies a Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker discovers a Redash endpoint (e.g., a dashboard with a filter parameter) where user input seems to be directly used in a SQL query.
2. **Crafting a Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload designed to exploit the vulnerability. For example, if the vulnerable parameter is `filter_value`, the attacker might try: `'; DROP TABLE users; --`.
3. **Injecting the Payload:** The attacker injects the payload through the URL parameter or form data. For example, the URL might become: `https://your-redash.com/dashboards/1?filter_value='; DROP TABLE users; --`.
4. **Server-Side Processing:** The Redash backend receives the request and, due to the vulnerability, directly incorporates the malicious payload into the SQL query.
5. **Database Execution:** The database executes the modified query, which now includes the malicious SQL code (in this case, attempting to drop the `users` table).
6. **Impact:** If successful, this attack could lead to data loss, service disruption, or further exploitation of the system.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Prioritize Parameterized Queries:**  The development team should strictly adhere to using parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions where user-supplied data is involved. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection.
* **Implement Robust Input Validation:**  Validate all user input on the server-side. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters and patterns for input fields.
    * **Type Checking:** Ensure data types match expectations.
    * **Length Restrictions:** Enforce maximum lengths for input fields.
    * **Encoding/Escaping (with caution):**  Use appropriate encoding or escaping mechanisms for specific contexts, but avoid relying solely on this.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user accounts used by Redash have only the necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks. Avoid using overly permissive accounts.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns. Configure the WAF with rules specific to SQL injection prevention.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices, emphasizing the importance of preventing SQL injection and other common web application vulnerabilities.
* **Output Encoding:** When displaying data retrieved from the database, ensure proper output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which can sometimes be chained with SQL injection.
* **Database Security Hardening:** Implement security best practices for the underlying database system, such as strong password policies, regular patching, and access controls.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing SQL injection, a well-configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of successful attacks by limiting the resources the browser is allowed to load.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Database Activity Monitoring:** Monitor database logs for suspicious queries, such as those containing unusual SQL keywords or syntax.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs:** Analyze WAF logs for blocked SQL injection attempts.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS solutions to detect and potentially block malicious network traffic associated with SQL injection attacks.
* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information about the database structure or query execution, which could aid attackers.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate logs from various sources (web servers, databases, WAFs) into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Inject Malicious SQL through Query Parameters" attack path represents a significant security risk to the Redash application due to its high potential impact. While the likelihood is rated as medium, the ease of exploitation and the potential for severe consequences necessitate immediate and thorough mitigation efforts.

The development team must prioritize the implementation of parameterized queries and robust input validation across all areas of the application where user-supplied data interacts with the database. Regular security assessments and adherence to secure coding practices are crucial for maintaining a secure Redash environment. By proactively addressing this vulnerability, the team can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, service disruption, and other negative impacts associated with successful SQL injection attacks.
