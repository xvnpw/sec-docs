**Effort:** Can be low with readily available tools.

**Skill Level:** Intermediate.

**Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

#### 4.1. Attack Breakdown: How an Attacker Might Execute Malicious Queries

An attacker aiming to execute malicious queries through Redash would likely follow these steps:

1. **Identify Potential Entry Points:** The attacker would look for areas in the Redash interface where user input is used to construct or influence queries sent to the connected data sources. This could include:
    * **Query Editor:** Directly crafting malicious queries.
    * **Parameters in Queries:** Injecting malicious code into query parameters.
    * **Custom Visualizations:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom visualization code that interacts with data.
    * **API Endpoints:** Sending crafted requests to Redash's API to execute queries.
    * **Scheduled Queries:** Compromising scheduled queries to execute malicious code at a later time.

2. **Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker would craft queries designed to achieve their objectives. This could involve:
    * **SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute operating system commands (depending on database configuration). Examples include:
        * `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' OR '1'='1';` (Bypassing authentication)
        * `SELECT * FROM sensitive_data UNION ALL SELECT credit_card FROM payment_info;` (Data exfiltration)
        * `UPDATE users SET is_admin = TRUE WHERE username = 'victim';` (Data manipulation)
        * (For some databases with specific extensions) `SELECT pg_read_file('/etc/passwd');` (File access)
    * **NoSQL Injection:** Similar to SQL injection, but targeting NoSQL databases. Payloads would depend on the specific NoSQL database being used.
    * **OS Command Injection (Indirect):** In some scenarios, vulnerabilities in database extensions or stored procedures could be leveraged to execute operating system commands on the database server, potentially accessible through Redash.

3. **Execute the Malicious Query:** The attacker would then attempt to execute the crafted query through the identified entry point. This might involve:
    * Submitting the query through the Redash query editor.
    * Providing malicious input to query parameters.
    * Triggering a compromised scheduled query.
    * Sending a crafted API request.

4. **Exploit the Results:**  If the malicious query is successfully executed, the attacker can then exploit the results:
    * **Data Breach:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting critical data.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining access to higher privileges within the database or even the Redash application.
    * **Denial of Service:** Executing resource-intensive queries to overload the database.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Using compromised database credentials to access other systems.

#### 4.2. Potential Vulnerabilities Exploited

Several vulnerabilities within Redash or its environment could be exploited to facilitate this attack:

* **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization:** Insufficient validation and sanitization of user-provided input used in query construction. This is the primary enabler of injection attacks.
* **Dynamic Query Construction:** Building queries dynamically using string concatenation with user input, instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
* **Insufficient Access Controls:** Allowing users with limited needs to connect to data sources with broad permissions.
* **Vulnerabilities in Database Drivers or Extensions:** Exploitable flaws in the database drivers used by Redash or in database extensions enabled on the connected data sources.
* **Insecure Configuration of Connected Data Sources:** Databases configured with weak passwords, default credentials, or unnecessary features enabled (e.g., `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server).
* **Lack of Proper Output Encoding:** While not directly related to execution, improper output encoding could facilitate further attacks if malicious data is displayed to other users.
* **Vulnerabilities in Custom Visualizations:** If custom visualizations allow execution of arbitrary code or make insecure API calls, they could be leveraged to execute malicious queries indirectly.

#### 4.3. Potential Impacts

The successful execution of malicious queries can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data, leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.
* **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to business disruption, inaccurate reporting, and loss of trust.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain scenarios, particularly with vulnerable database configurations or extensions, attackers could execute arbitrary code on the database server, potentially compromising the entire system.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Executing resource-intensive queries can overload the database, making it unavailable to legitimate users and disrupting business operations.
* **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches resulting from this attack can lead to violations of data privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, etc.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of malicious query execution, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data that is used in query construction. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:** Only allowing known good characters or patterns.
    * **Blacklisting:** Blocking known malicious characters or patterns (less effective than whitelisting).
    * **Encoding:** Encoding special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as code.
* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases. This ensures that user-provided data is treated as data, not executable code.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users and Redash connections only the necessary permissions to access and manipulate data. Avoid using overly permissive database accounts.
* **Secure Database Configuration:** Harden the configuration of connected data sources by:
    * Using strong and unique passwords.
    * Disabling unnecessary features and extensions.
    * Regularly patching database software.
    * Implementing network segmentation to restrict access to the database server.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in Redash and its connected data sources.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block common injection attacks before they reach the Redash application.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which could potentially be chained with query injection.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices, particularly regarding input validation and secure database interactions.
* **Regularly Update Redash:** Keep the Redash application updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
* **Monitor Database Activity:** Implement robust database activity monitoring to detect suspicious query patterns and potential attacks.

#### 4.5. Detection and Monitoring

Detecting malicious query execution can be challenging, but the following methods can be employed:

* **Database Audit Logs:** Enable and regularly review database audit logs for suspicious query patterns, failed login attempts, and unauthorized data access.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System:** Integrate Redash and database logs into a SIEM system to correlate events and detect anomalies that might indicate an attack.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection rules to identify unusual query patterns, such as large data exports, unexpected data modifications, or queries executed by unauthorized users.
* **Alerting on Error Messages:** Monitor Redash and database error logs for messages that might indicate injection attempts or failed malicious queries.
* **Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  While less specific to query content, network-based systems can detect unusual network traffic patterns associated with data exfiltration.
* **Honeypots:** Deploy database honeypots to attract and detect attackers attempting to access sensitive data.

#### 4.6. Conclusion

The "Execute Malicious Queries" attack path represents a significant risk to Redash and its connected data sources. The potential impact of a successful attack is high, ranging from data breaches to remote code execution. By understanding the attack mechanics, potential vulnerabilities, and implementing robust mitigation and detection strategies, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this critical threat. A layered security approach, combining secure coding practices, input validation, parameterized queries, strong access controls, and continuous monitoring, is essential to protect against this attack vector.
