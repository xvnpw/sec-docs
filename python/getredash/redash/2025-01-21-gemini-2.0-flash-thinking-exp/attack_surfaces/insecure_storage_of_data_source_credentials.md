**Out of Scope:**

*   Security vulnerabilities unrelated to credential storage (e.g., XSS, SQL injection in other parts of the application).
*   Network security surrounding the Redash deployment.
*   Operating system level security of the Redash server.
*   Authentication and authorization mechanisms for Redash users (unless directly related to accessing stored credentials).

### 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be employed for this deep analysis:

1. **Review of Provided Attack Surface Description:**  The initial description of the "Insecure Storage of Data Source Credentials" will serve as the starting point and guide for the analysis.
2. **Code Review (Targeted):**  Focus on the Redash codebase related to data source management, credential storage, and encryption. This will involve examining relevant modules, functions, and database schemas.
3. **Configuration Analysis:**  Examine Redash's configuration files (e.g., `redash.conf`, environment variables) to identify how data source credentials are configured and potentially stored.
4. **Database Schema Analysis:**  Investigate the Redash database schema to understand how data source information, including credentials, is structured and stored.
5. **Attack Vector Identification:**  Based on the understanding of Redash's internal mechanisms, identify potential attack vectors that could lead to the exposure of stored credentials. This includes considering both internal and external attackers.
6. **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential consequences of a successful attack, focusing on the compromise of connected data sources and the potential for further exploitation.
7. **Evaluation of Existing Mitigations:**  Assess the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies already suggested in the attack surface description.
8. **Recommendation Development:**  Provide specific and actionable recommendations for the development team to improve the security of credential storage, building upon the existing mitigation strategies.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Insecure Storage of Data Source Credentials

**Core Vulnerability:** The fundamental issue is the potential for sensitive data source credentials to be stored in a manner that is easily accessible to unauthorized individuals or processes. This directly contradicts the principle of least privilege and increases the risk of significant data breaches.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Potential Storage Locations and Associated Risks:**
    *   **Plain Text in Configuration Files:** If credentials are stored directly in configuration files without encryption, anyone with access to the server's filesystem can easily retrieve them. This is a high-risk scenario.
    *   **Weakly Encrypted Database:**  Storing credentials in a database that uses weak or easily reversible encryption algorithms (e.g., simple obfuscation, outdated encryption methods) provides a false sense of security. Attackers with database access can potentially decrypt these credentials.
    *   **Environment Variables:** While seemingly more secure than configuration files, environment variables can still be accessed by users with sufficient privileges on the server. If not properly managed and secured, this can be a vulnerability.
    *   **Redash Database Tables:**  The primary storage for Redash data, including data source configurations, is the database. If the database itself is compromised (e.g., through SQL injection or stolen credentials), the stored credentials become immediately accessible if not properly encrypted.
    *   **In-Memory Storage (Less Likely but Possible):** While less likely for persistent storage, if credentials are held in memory without proper protection, vulnerabilities like memory dumps could expose them.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Server Compromise:** An attacker gaining access to the Redash server (e.g., through SSH brute-force, exploiting other application vulnerabilities, or insider threats) could directly access configuration files, environment variables, or the database.
    *   **Database Compromise:** If the Redash database is compromised (e.g., due to weak database credentials, SQL injection vulnerabilities in other applications sharing the database), attackers can directly query and retrieve stored credentials.
    *   **Application Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities within Redash itself (e.g., local file inclusion, arbitrary file read) could be exploited to access configuration files or the database.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with access to the Redash server or database could intentionally or unintentionally expose the credentials.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromise of dependencies or third-party libraries used by Redash could potentially lead to credential exposure.

*   **Impact:** The impact of successfully exploiting this vulnerability is **Critical**. Compromised data source credentials allow attackers to:
    *   **Access and Exfiltrate Data:** Gain unauthorized access to the connected databases and APIs, leading to the theft of sensitive data.
    *   **Manipulate Data:** Modify or delete data within the connected data sources, potentially causing significant business disruption or financial loss.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Use the compromised credentials to pivot and gain access to other systems and resources connected to the data sources.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Potentially disrupt the availability of the connected data sources.

*   **Evaluation of Existing Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Encryption within Redash:** This is a crucial mitigation. Implementing robust encryption at rest for data source credentials within Redash's storage is essential. The specific encryption algorithms and key management practices need careful consideration.
    *   **Secrets Management Integration in Redash:** Integrating with dedicated secrets management solutions like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager is a highly recommended approach. This offloads the responsibility of secure credential storage and management to specialized tools designed for this purpose.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Redash's Credential Storage:**  Regular audits are vital to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of implemented security measures and to identify any potential weaknesses or misconfigurations.

**Further Considerations and Recommendations:**

*   **Leverage Operating System Level Security:**  Ensure proper file system permissions are in place to restrict access to configuration files and other sensitive data.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes that require access to data source credentials. Avoid storing credentials in locations accessible to a wide range of users or processes.
*   **Secure Key Management:**  For encryption within Redash, implement a robust key management system. Keys should be stored securely, rotated regularly, and access should be strictly controlled. Consider using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for enhanced key protection.
*   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Redash and its dependencies up-to-date to patch any known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to access credentials.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not directly related to storage, ensure that when users input data source credentials, proper validation and sanitization are performed to prevent injection attacks that could potentially lead to credential exposure.
*   **Consider Ephemeral Credentials:** Explore the possibility of using short-lived or dynamically generated credentials where applicable to reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.
*   **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor access to credential storage locations and implement alerts for any suspicious activity.
*   **Educate Developers:** Ensure the development team is well-versed in secure coding practices related to credential management and storage.
