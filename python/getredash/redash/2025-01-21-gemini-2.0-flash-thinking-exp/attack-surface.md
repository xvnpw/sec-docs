# Attack Surface Analysis for getredash/redash

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through User-Defined Queries](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_user-defined_queries.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries executed by Redash against connected databases.
    *   **How Redash Contributes:** Redash allows users to write and execute arbitrary SQL queries against configured data sources. If input sanitization or proper parameterization is lacking *within Redash's query execution engine*, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A user crafts a query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1'; --` within Redash's query editor, which, if not properly handled by Redash, could bypass authentication in the connected database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, unauthorized modification of data within the connected databases.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Enforce Parameterized Queries within Redash:** Ensure Redash's query execution engine always uses parameterized queries or prepared statements.
            *   **Input Validation and Sanitization within Redash:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize user input within the Redash application before incorporating it into SQL queries.
            *   **Regular Security Audits of Redash Code:** Conduct regular code reviews and security testing of Redash itself to identify potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Visualizations and Dashboards](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_visualizations_and_dashboards.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into visualizations or dashboard elements that are then executed in other users' browsers *when viewing Redash*.
    *   **How Redash Contributes:** Redash renders user-provided data and allows for customization of visualizations and dashboards. If proper output encoding is not implemented *within Redash's rendering logic*, malicious scripts can be injected.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects JavaScript code into a visualization title or a text box on a dashboard *within Redash*. When another user views the dashboard *through Redash*, the script executes, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise of Redash users, session hijacking within Redash, defacement of Redash dashboards, redirection to malicious websites *from within the Redash application*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Output Encoding within Redash:** Implement proper output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) for all user-provided data displayed in visualizations and dashboards *by Redash*.
            *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration for Redash:** Implement and enforce a strict CSP *within the Redash application* to control the resources the browser is allowed to load when viewing Redash content.
            *   **Regular Security Audits of Redash Frontend:** Scan for potential XSS vulnerabilities in Redash's frontend codebase.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Data Source Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_data_source_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive credentials for connecting to data sources are stored insecurely *within Redash*.
    *   **How Redash Contributes:** Redash needs to store credentials to connect to various databases and APIs. If these credentials are not properly encrypted or are stored in easily accessible locations *within Redash's data storage*, they become a target.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials stored in plain text in Redash's configuration files or in a weakly encrypted database used by Redash. An attacker gaining access to the Redash server or its database could easily retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of connected data sources, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential further attacks on connected systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Strong Encryption within Redash:** Use robust encryption mechanisms to store data source credentials at rest *within Redash's storage*.
            *   **Secrets Management Integration in Redash:** Integrate Redash with secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to avoid storing credentials directly.
            *   **Regular Security Audits of Redash's Credential Storage:** Review the credential storage mechanisms within Redash and ensure they meet security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Redash's API authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to data or functionality *within Redash*.
    *   **How Redash Contributes:** Redash exposes an API for programmatic interaction. Weaknesses in how *Redash's* API authenticates and authorizes requests can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting a flaw in Redash's API token generation or validation to forge API keys, or bypassing authorization checks to access resources belonging to other users *within Redash*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data *managed by Redash*, modification of Redash configurations, potential for denial of service *of the Redash application*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Strong Authentication Mechanisms for Redash API:** Implement robust authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0) for the Redash API.
            *   **Proper Authorization Checks in Redash API:** Enforce granular authorization checks at the Redash API endpoint level.
            *   **Regular Security Audits of Redash API:** Thoroughly test Redash API endpoints for authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.
            *   **Rate Limiting on Redash API:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on Redash API authentication endpoints.
