# Threat Model Analysis for getredash/redash

## Threat: [Compromised Data Source Credentials](./threats/compromised_data_source_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the stored credentials for connected data sources *within the Redash database or configuration files*. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities *in Redash itself*, gaining access to the underlying server hosting Redash, or through social engineering targeting Redash users or administrators.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can directly access and manipulate data within the connected data sources, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service on the data sources.
*   **Affected Component:** Data Source Manager module, specifically the functions responsible for storing and retrieving data source credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt data source credentials at rest using strong encryption algorithms *within Redash*.
    *   Implement robust access controls to the Redash server and database.
    *   Regularly audit access to sensitive Redash configuration files.
    *   Consider using secrets management solutions integrated with Redash to store and manage credentials.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious access to credential storage *within Redash*.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via User-Defined Queries](./threats/sql_injection_via_user-defined_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SQL query through the Redash query editor, exploiting vulnerabilities *in Redash's query parsing or execution* to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the connected database. This could involve using UNION statements, stacked queries, or other injection techniques.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can bypass Redash's intended access controls and directly interact with the underlying database, potentially reading sensitive data, modifying data, or even executing operating system commands if database permissions allow.
*   **Affected Component:** Query Runner module, specifically the function responsible for executing queries against the database.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements *within Redash's query execution logic* to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for user-provided query parameters *within Redash*.
    *   Adopt a least privilege approach for database user accounts used *by Redash*.
    *   Regularly update Redash to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement security scanning tools to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities *in Redash's codebase*.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Data Source Query Languages](./threats/code_injection_via_data_source_query_languages.md)

*   **Description:** Depending on the connected data source type (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch), an attacker could inject malicious code or commands specific to that query language through the Redash query editor, exploiting vulnerabilities *in Redash's handling of these query languages*.
*   **Impact:** The attacker could execute arbitrary code on the data source server, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service on the data source.
*   **Affected Component:** Query Runner module, specifically the functions responsible for interacting with specific data source types.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for query inputs specific to each data source type *within Redash*.
    *   Adopt a least privilege approach for data source user accounts used *by Redash*.
    *   Regularly update Redash and data source connectors to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using secure coding practices specific to each data source's query language *within Redash's connector implementations*.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via RBAC Vulnerabilities](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_rbac_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities *in Redash's role-based access control (RBAC) system* to gain unauthorized privileges, allowing them to access data or perform actions they are not intended to within the Redash application.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass intended security restrictions and gain access to sensitive data managed by Redash, modify configurations, or perform administrative actions within Redash.
*   **Affected Component:** Permissions module, User Management module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions *within Redash*.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles *within Redash*.
    *   Regularly update Redash to patch known RBAC vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement thorough testing of RBAC configurations *within Redash*.
