### 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat: Code Injection via Data Source Query Languages

#### 4.1 Threat Description Expansion

The core of this threat lies in the potential for an attacker to manipulate the queries executed by Redash against connected data sources. Redash, to provide its functionality, needs to pass user-defined queries (or parts of them) to the underlying data source. If Redash doesn't properly sanitize or validate these inputs, an attacker can inject malicious code or commands that are interpreted and executed by the data source.

The vulnerability resides not necessarily in the data source itself, but in **Redash's handling of the query input before passing it to the data source**. Redash acts as an intermediary, and if this intermediary is flawed, it can become a conduit for attacks.

#### 4.2 Technical Analysis

The Query Runner module in Redash is responsible for taking a query defined by a user, formatting it appropriately for the target data source, and then executing it. This process involves:

1. **Receiving User Input:** The user enters a query through the Redash query editor.
2. **Data Source Identification:** Redash identifies the target data source based on the connection configured for the query.
3. **Query Formatting:** The query might undergo some formatting or transformation to be compatible with the specific data source's query language.
4. **Execution:** The formatted query is sent to the data source for execution.
5. **Result Processing:** Redash receives the results from the data source and presents them to the user.

The vulnerability arises in step 3, **Query Formatting**, and potentially even in step 1, **Receiving User Input**, if Redash doesn't implement robust input validation. If Redash naively concatenates user input into the final query string without proper sanitization, it becomes susceptible to injection attacks.

**Example Scenarios:**

*   **SQL Injection (against a SQL database):** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially bypassing intended logic or executing arbitrary SQL commands. For example, instead of a simple `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user'`, an attacker might inject `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' OR '1'='1'; --`. The `--` comments out the rest of the query, effectively returning all users. More dangerous commands like `DROP TABLE users;` could also be injected if the Redash connection has sufficient privileges.

*   **NoSQL Injection (against MongoDB):**  Similar to SQL injection, attackers can manipulate query operators or inject JavaScript code that gets executed on the MongoDB server. For instance, in a query like `db.collection.find({name: "userInput"})`, an attacker could input `{$gt: ''}` to bypass the intended filter or inject `"; db.dropDatabase();"` to drop the entire database (if permissions allow).

*   **Elasticsearch DSL Injection:**  Attackers could manipulate the JSON structure of the Elasticsearch query DSL to perform unintended actions, such as deleting indices or retrieving sensitive data they shouldn't have access to.

#### 4.3 Attack Vectors

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through various means:

*   **Direct Query Input:**  The most straightforward method is by directly typing malicious code into the Redash query editor.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** If Redash uses parameters in queries, attackers might manipulate these parameters through the UI or API to inject malicious code.
*   **Imported Queries:** If Redash allows importing queries from external sources, these sources could be crafted to contain malicious code.
*   **Compromised User Accounts:** An attacker with a legitimate Redash account could use their access to craft and execute malicious queries.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful code injection attack through Redash can be severe:

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the connected data sources. This could include customer information, financial records, or intellectual property.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the data sources, leading to data corruption, loss of integrity, and potential business disruption.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious queries could be crafted to overload the data source server, causing performance degradation or complete service outage.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the Redash connection to the data source has elevated privileges, attackers could leverage this to perform actions beyond the intended scope, potentially gaining control over the data source server itself.
*   **Lateral Movement:** In some scenarios, successful exploitation could allow attackers to pivot from the data source server to other systems within the network.

The severity of the impact depends heavily on the privileges granted to the Redash connection to the data source. A connection with read-only access would limit the attacker's ability to manipulate data, but could still lead to data breaches.

#### 4.5 Vulnerability Analysis (Redash Weaknesses)

The potential vulnerabilities within Redash that could enable this threat include:

*   **Insufficient Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Lack of proper checks and sanitization of user-provided query inputs before they are incorporated into the final query sent to the data source. This is the most critical vulnerability.
*   **Naive Query Construction:**  Simple string concatenation of user input into the query without using parameterized queries or other secure query building techniques.
*   **Lack of Contextual Encoding:**  Failure to properly encode user input based on the specific syntax requirements of the target data source's query language.
*   **Overly Permissive Data Source Connections:**  Using data source accounts with excessive privileges, allowing attackers to perform more damaging actions if they successfully inject code.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Data Source Connectors:**  While the threat description focuses on Redash's handling, vulnerabilities within the specific data source connector implementations could also contribute to the problem.

#### 4.6 Mitigation Analysis (Effectiveness of Proposed Strategies)

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies:

*   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization for query inputs specific to each data source type *within Redash*.**
    *   **Effectiveness:** This is the **most crucial mitigation**. By validating and sanitizing input, Redash can prevent malicious code from being passed to the data source. This involves techniques like:
        *   **Allowlisting:** Defining allowed characters, keywords, and syntax for each data source type.
        *   **Escaping:**  Properly escaping special characters that have meaning in the query language.
        *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Using parameterized queries where user input is treated as data, not executable code. This is highly effective for SQL databases.
    *   **Considerations:**  Requires careful implementation for each supported data source type, as their query languages have different syntax and potential injection points.

*   **Adopt a least privilege approach for data source user accounts used *by Redash*.**
    *   **Effectiveness:** This significantly reduces the potential impact of a successful injection. If the Redash connection only has read access, the attacker's ability to manipulate or delete data is limited.
    *   **Considerations:**  Requires careful planning of the necessary permissions for Redash to function correctly while minimizing potential damage.

*   **Regularly update Redash and data source connectors to patch known vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Essential for addressing known security flaws in Redash and its connectors. Staying up-to-date ensures that publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are patched.
    *   **Considerations:**  Requires a robust patching process and awareness of security advisories.

*   **Consider using secure coding practices specific to each data source's query language *within Redash's connector implementations*.**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Focuses on building secure connectors from the ground up. This includes using secure libraries and frameworks, avoiding insecure functions, and performing thorough code reviews.
    *   **Considerations:**  Requires expertise in secure coding practices for various query languages and ongoing attention to security best practices during development.

#### 4.7 Potential for Bypassing Mitigations

Even with the proposed mitigations in place, there's always a potential for bypass:

*   **Complex Injection Techniques:** Attackers may discover novel injection techniques that bypass current validation rules.
*   **Logic Errors in Sanitization:**  Flaws in the implementation of input validation and sanitization logic could be exploited.
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  Unknown vulnerabilities in Redash or its dependencies could be exploited before patches are available.
*   **Misconfiguration:** Incorrectly configured data source connections with excessive privileges can negate the benefits of least privilege.

### 5. Recommendations for Enhanced Security

In addition to the proposed mitigations, the following measures can further enhance Redash's security against this threat:

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the risk of client-side injection attacks that could potentially lead to malicious query execution.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in Redash's code and configuration.
*   **Input Validation on the Client-Side (with Server-Side Enforcement):** While server-side validation is crucial, client-side validation can provide an initial layer of defense and improve the user experience by catching simple errors early. However, always enforce validation on the server-side as client-side validation can be bypassed.
*   **Consider a Query Sandbox or Execution Environment:** For highly sensitive environments, consider executing queries in a sandboxed environment with limited access to system resources.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of query execution and data access to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
*   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of code injection and best practices for writing secure queries.

### 6. Conclusion

The "Code Injection via Data Source Query Languages" threat poses a significant risk to Redash and the connected data sources. While the proposed mitigation strategies are essential, a layered security approach is crucial. Implementing robust input validation and sanitization within Redash, coupled with the principle of least privilege for data source connections, are paramount. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and staying up-to-date with security patches are also vital for maintaining a strong security posture against this and other potential threats.
