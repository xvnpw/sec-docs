### 4. Deep Analysis of Threat: Compromised Data Source Credentials

#### 4.1 Threat Overview

The core of this threat lies in the potential for unauthorized access to the credentials used by Redash to connect to external data sources. If an attacker gains these credentials, they essentially inherit the permissions associated with those credentials on the target data sources. This bypasses any access controls implemented within Redash itself and directly exposes the underlying data.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors

Several attack vectors could lead to the compromise of data source credentials:

*   **Exploiting Redash Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** If Redash's data access layer is vulnerable to SQL injection, an attacker could potentially query the database directly to retrieve stored credentials.
    *   **Insecure Deserialization:** If Redash uses deserialization for handling data and it's not properly secured, attackers could inject malicious payloads to execute arbitrary code and access sensitive information, including credentials.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Vulnerabilities in Redash's authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow attackers to gain administrative access and subsequently access credential storage.
    *   **Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI):** If Redash is vulnerable to these, attackers could potentially read configuration files where credentials might be stored (though this is less likely with proper design).
*   **Compromising the Redash Server:**
    *   **Operating System Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system could grant attackers access to the server's file system, allowing them to read configuration files or the Redash database.
    *   **Weak Server Security:**  Poorly configured firewalls, open ports, or weak SSH credentials could provide entry points for attackers.
    *   **Malware Infection:**  Malware installed on the Redash server could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data, including data source credentials.
*   **Social Engineering:**
    *   **Phishing:** Attackers could target Redash administrators or users with access to credential management, tricking them into revealing their Redash login credentials or even the data source credentials themselves.
    *   **Insider Threat:** A malicious or negligent insider with access to the Redash system or database could intentionally or unintentionally expose the credentials.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    *   Compromised dependencies or third-party libraries used by Redash could contain vulnerabilities that allow attackers to access sensitive data.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Less Likely):** While possible, directly brute-forcing encrypted credentials stored in the database is generally less likely to succeed compared to other attack vectors, assuming strong encryption is used.

#### 4.3 Technical Deep Dive (Conceptual)

Based on common practices, Redash likely stores data source credentials in one of the following ways:

*   **Within the Redash Database:** This is the most probable scenario. Credentials could be stored in a dedicated table within the Redash database.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Ideally, these credentials would be encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm. The encryption key management is crucial here. If the key is stored alongside the encrypted data or is easily accessible, the encryption is significantly weakened.
    *   **Hashing (Less Likely for Direct Credentials):** While hashing is common for passwords, it's less likely for direct data source credentials as Redash needs to use the actual credentials to connect. However, a secure vault approach might involve hashing and a separate key management system.
*   **Configuration Files:** Credentials might be stored in configuration files, either in plain text (highly insecure) or encrypted.
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Storing credentials as environment variables is a better practice than plain text in files but still requires careful management of the environment.
*   **Secrets Management Solutions:**  Redash might integrate with external secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to store and retrieve credentials. This is the most secure approach.

The "Data Source Manager module" within Redash would be responsible for:

*   **Storing Credentials:**  Encrypting and persisting the credentials when a new data source is configured.
*   **Retrieving Credentials:** Decrypting the credentials when Redash needs to connect to the data source to execute queries or refresh dashboards.

**Potential Weaknesses:**

*   **Weak Encryption:** Using weak or outdated encryption algorithms.
*   **Poor Key Management:** Storing encryption keys insecurely or using easily guessable keys.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:**  Lack of proper access controls to the Redash database or configuration files, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read sensitive data.
*   **Vulnerabilities in the Data Source Manager:**  Bugs or design flaws in the module responsible for handling credentials could be exploited.
*   **Logging Sensitive Information:**  Accidentally logging credentials or related sensitive information.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment (Detailed)

A successful compromise of data source credentials can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breaches:** The attacker gains direct access to the connected data sources, allowing them to exfiltrate sensitive data. This could include customer data, financial records, intellectual property, and other confidential information, leading to significant financial and reputational damage, regulatory fines, and loss of customer trust.
*   **Data Modification/Manipulation:**  Attackers can not only read data but also modify or delete it. This can lead to data corruption, inaccurate reporting, and potentially disrupt business operations. Imagine an attacker modifying financial data or customer records.
*   **Denial of Service on Data Sources:**  An attacker could use the compromised credentials to overload the data sources with malicious queries, causing performance degradation or complete outages, impacting other applications and services that rely on those data sources.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised data source credentials could potentially be used to gain access to other systems or resources within the organization if the same credentials are reused or if the data sources are interconnected with other systems.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Data breaches resulting from compromised credentials can lead to violations of various data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA), resulting in significant penalties.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  News of a data breach due to compromised credentials can severely damage the organization's reputation, leading to loss of customers and business opportunities.

#### 4.5 Vulnerabilities Exploited

The specific vulnerabilities exploited will depend on the chosen attack vector. Some examples include:

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Redash's data access layer to directly query the database for credential information.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Circumventing Redash's login mechanisms to gain administrative access and access credential management features.
*   **File Inclusion Vulnerabilities:**  Reading configuration files containing credentials (though less likely with good design).
*   **Operating System Vulnerabilities:**  Gaining access to the server's file system to read configuration files or the Redash database.
*   **Weak Access Controls:**  Exploiting misconfigured permissions on the Redash server or database.

#### 4.6 Likelihood and Risk Assessment

The likelihood of this threat occurring depends on several factors:

*   **Security Posture of Redash:** The presence of vulnerabilities in the Redash application itself.
*   **Security of the Hosting Environment:** The security measures implemented on the server hosting Redash.
*   **Security Awareness of Users:** The susceptibility of users to social engineering attacks.
*   **Complexity of Credentials:** The strength and complexity of the data source credentials themselves.

Given the potential impact (Critical) and the various attack vectors, the overall risk associated with compromised data source credentials is **High**.

#### 4.7 Evaluation of Existing Mitigation Strategies

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies:

*   **Encrypt data source credentials at rest using strong encryption algorithms within Redash:** This is a crucial mitigation.
    *   **Strengths:**  Significantly reduces the risk of credentials being exposed if the database or configuration files are accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Weaknesses:** The effectiveness depends entirely on the strength of the encryption algorithm and, more importantly, the secure management of the encryption keys. If the keys are compromised, the encryption is useless. The implementation details within Redash are critical here.
    *   **Recommendations:**  Use industry-standard, well-vetted encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256). Implement robust key management practices, potentially using a dedicated key management system or hardware security modules (HSMs). Regularly rotate encryption keys.
*   **Implement robust access controls to the Redash server and database:** This is essential for preventing unauthorized access.
    *   **Strengths:** Limits the attack surface and reduces the likelihood of attackers gaining access to the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Requires careful configuration and ongoing maintenance. Misconfigurations can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Recommendations:** Implement the principle of least privilege. Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for server and database access. Regularly review and audit access controls. Harden the operating system and database.
*   **Regularly audit access to sensitive Redash configuration files:** This helps detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Strengths:** Provides visibility into who is accessing sensitive files and can help identify potential breaches early on.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Requires setting up proper auditing mechanisms and regularly reviewing the logs. Alerting mechanisms should be in place to notify administrators of suspicious activity.
    *   **Recommendations:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of access to configuration files. Set up alerts for unusual access patterns.
*   **Consider using secrets management solutions integrated with Redash to store and manage credentials:** This is a highly recommended best practice.
    *   **Strengths:**  Provides a centralized and secure way to manage secrets, reducing the risk of them being stored insecurely within Redash itself. Offers features like access control, auditing, and rotation.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Requires integration effort and potentially introduces a dependency on an external system.
    *   **Recommendations:**  Explore integration options with reputable secrets management solutions. This significantly enhances the security posture.
*   **Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious access to credential storage within Redash:** This is crucial for timely detection and response.
    *   **Strengths:** Allows for rapid detection of potential breaches or unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Requires defining what constitutes "suspicious access" and configuring appropriate alerting rules. False positives can be an issue.
    *   **Recommendations:**  Monitor access patterns to the credential storage mechanisms (database tables, configuration files). Alert on unusual access times, locations, or user accounts.

### 5. Conclusion

The threat of compromised data source credentials poses a **critical risk** to our Redash application and the sensitive data it accesses. A successful attack can lead to significant data breaches, data manipulation, and disruption of services.

The proposed mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but their effectiveness hinges on proper implementation and ongoing maintenance. **Prioritizing the encryption of credentials at rest with robust key management and exploring integration with a secrets management solution are paramount.**  Furthermore, strong access controls, regular security audits, and comprehensive monitoring are essential layers of defense.

The development team should prioritize addressing this threat by implementing the recommended mitigations and continuously evaluating the security posture of the Redash application. Regular security assessments and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
