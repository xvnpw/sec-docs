### 4. Deep Analysis of SQL Injection via User-Defined Queries

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Analysis

The core vulnerability lies in the potential for Redash to directly pass user-provided SQL fragments to the underlying database without proper sanitization or parameterization. This can occur at several points within the query execution flow:

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Redash might not adequately validate the structure and content of the SQL query entered by the user. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code disguised as legitimate query components.
*   **Lack of Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** If Redash constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user input, it becomes highly susceptible to SQL injection. Parameterized queries or prepared statements are crucial for separating SQL code from user-provided data.
*   **Weak Query Parsing Logic:** Vulnerabilities in Redash's query parsing logic could allow attackers to bypass intended security checks or manipulate the parsed query structure to inject malicious commands.
*   **Inadequate Escaping of User Input:** Even if some validation is present, insufficient or incorrect escaping of special characters within user input can still lead to successful SQL injection.

The description highlights vulnerabilities "in Redash's query parsing or execution." This suggests potential weaknesses in how Redash interprets the user's input and translates it into a command for the database.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors and Techniques

An attacker can leverage the Redash query editor to inject malicious SQL code using various techniques:

*   **UNION-based SQL Injection:**  The attacker can append `UNION` clauses to legitimate queries to retrieve data from tables they are not authorized to access. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT password FROM sensitive_data;
    ```

*   **Stacked Queries:** Some database systems allow the execution of multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons. An attacker could inject additional malicious queries after a legitimate one:

    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE users;
    ```

*   **Time-based Blind SQL Injection:** If direct data retrieval is not possible, the attacker can use conditional statements that cause delays based on the truthiness of a condition, allowing them to infer information bit by bit. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1 AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE password LIKE 'a%') > 0; -- This might cause a delay if a password starts with 'a'
    ```

*   **Error-based SQL Injection:**  The attacker can craft queries that intentionally cause database errors, revealing information about the database structure or data.

*   **Second-Order SQL Injection:** While less likely directly through the query editor, if Redash stores user-provided queries and later executes them without proper sanitization, a malicious query could be stored and then triggered later, leading to an attack.

The attacker's success depends on the specific database system being used and the permissions of the database user account used by Redash.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment

A successful SQL injection attack through Redash can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach (Confidentiality):** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the connected databases, including user credentials, financial information, and proprietary business data.
*   **Data Manipulation (Integrity):** Attackers can modify or delete data within the databases, leading to data corruption, loss of business intelligence, and potential operational disruptions.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user account used by Redash has elevated privileges, the attacker could potentially gain control over the entire database system.
*   **Denial of Service (Availability):**  Attackers could execute commands that overload the database server, leading to performance degradation or complete service outage.
*   **Operating System Command Execution (Potentially):** In some database configurations with specific permissions and features enabled (e.g., `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server), attackers might be able to execute operating system commands on the database server, potentially compromising the entire server infrastructure.

The "High" risk severity assigned to this threat is justified due to the potential for significant damage across confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

#### 4.4 Redash Specific Considerations

Given Redash's role as a data visualization and business intelligence tool, a successful SQL injection attack can have particularly damaging consequences:

*   **Compromised Business Insights:**  Manipulated data can lead to incorrect reports and flawed business decisions.
*   **Loss of Trust:**  A data breach through Redash can erode trust in the platform and the organization using it.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Exposure of sensitive data can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

The fact that the "Affected Component" is the "Query Runner module" highlights the critical importance of securing this part of the Redash application.

#### 4.5 Detailed Mitigation Analysis

Let's analyze the proposed mitigation strategies:

*   **Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements within Redash's query execution logic:** This is the **most effective** defense against SQL injection. By using parameterized queries, the SQL code and user-provided data are treated separately. The database driver handles the proper escaping and quoting of data, preventing malicious SQL from being interpreted as code. **This should be the highest priority mitigation.**

*   **Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for user-provided query parameters within Redash:** While helpful, input validation and sanitization are **not a foolproof solution** against all forms of SQL injection. Attackers can often find ways to bypass or circumvent these measures. This should be implemented as a **secondary layer of defense** in addition to parameterized queries. Focus should be on identifying and blocking obvious malicious patterns.

*   **Adopt a least privilege approach for database user accounts used by Redash:** This limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict even if SQL injection is successful. If the Redash database user only has read access to specific tables, the attacker's ability to modify or delete data is significantly reduced. **This is a crucial security best practice.**

*   **Regularly update Redash to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities:**  Software updates often include fixes for security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws. Staying up-to-date is essential for maintaining a secure environment. **This is a fundamental security hygiene practice.**

*   **Implement security scanning tools to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in Redash's codebase:** Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools can help identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities during development and runtime. **This is a proactive approach to finding and fixing vulnerabilities.**

#### 4.6 Potential Gaps and Further Recommendations

While the proposed mitigation strategies are sound, there are potential gaps and further recommendations:

*   **Focus on the Query Editor Interface:**  Consider implementing features within the query editor to guide users towards safer query practices and potentially warn against suspicious syntax.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing SQL injection, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of certain types of attacks that might be facilitated by a successful SQL injection (e.g., exfiltration of data through external requests).
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Periodic security audits and penetration testing by independent security experts can help identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by internal teams and automated tools.
*   **Developer Training:** Ensure developers are well-trained on secure coding practices, specifically regarding the prevention of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Consider a Query Whitelisting Approach (with caution):**  In highly controlled environments, consider allowing only a predefined set of queries or query patterns. However, this can be restrictive and difficult to maintain.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring of database queries executed through Redash. This can help detect and respond to suspicious activity.

### 5. Conclusion

The threat of SQL Injection via User-Defined Queries in Redash is a significant concern due to its high potential impact. While the proposed mitigation strategies are a good starting point, the development team should prioritize the implementation of parameterized queries or prepared statements as the primary defense mechanism. A layered security approach, combining input validation, least privilege, regular updates, and security scanning, is crucial for minimizing the risk of successful exploitation. Continuous monitoring and proactive security assessments are also essential for maintaining a strong security posture. By addressing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this critical vulnerability.
