# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Core business process is enabling users to generate images using Stable Diffusion.
  - Availability and functionality of ComfyUI are critical for users who rely on it for creative or research tasks.
  - Integrity of generated images is important for maintaining user trust and avoiding misuse.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - User Prompts: Can contain sensitive or personal information depending on the user and use case. Sensitivity level depends on the context of use.
  - Generated Images: Can be sensitive depending on the content. May contain personal data, copyrighted material, or other sensitive information. Sensitivity level depends on the content and use case.
  - Workflows: Can contain intellectual property or proprietary configurations. Sensitivity level depends on the user and workflow content.
  - Models: Stable Diffusion models themselves are generally publicly available, but custom models or fine-tuned models might be considered sensitive intellectual property. Sensitivity level depends on the model and its origin.
  - Configuration Data: May contain API keys or other credentials if users integrate external services. These are highly sensitive.

  - What are the priorities for security enhancements in the project roadmap?

- Assumptions:
  - ComfyUI is primarily used by individual users or small teams for research, creative work, and experimentation.
  - Security is currently focused on community-driven code review and standard open-source development practices.
  - No formal security audits or penetration testing have been conducted.
  - Deployment is mostly local desktop-based, but cloud deployments are also possible.
  - The project is open-source and relies on community contributions for development and maintenance.
