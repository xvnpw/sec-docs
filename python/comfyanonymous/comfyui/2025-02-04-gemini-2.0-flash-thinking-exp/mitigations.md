## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Node Vetting and Auditing](./mitigation_strategies/custom_node_vetting_and_auditing.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Establish a ComfyUI custom node vetting policy. Define security criteria specific to ComfyUI nodes, such as allowed libraries, network access restrictions, and resource usage limits.
    *   Step 2: Implement mandatory code review for all submitted ComfyUI custom nodes before application integration. Focus review on Python code within nodes, checking for malicious intent, vulnerabilities in image processing libraries, and insecure system calls.
    *   Step 3: Utilize SAST tools configured for Python and image processing libraries to scan ComfyUI custom node code for vulnerabilities like injection flaws, path traversal, and insecure dependencies common in ComfyUI node development.
    *   Step 4: Perform DAST in a sandboxed ComfyUI environment. Execute custom nodes with various inputs relevant to ComfyUI workflows (images, prompts, model paths) to observe behavior and identify runtime vulnerabilities specific to ComfyUI node interactions.
    *   Step 5: Maintain a curated repository of vetted ComfyUI custom nodes. Only allow users to install and use nodes from this repository within the ComfyUI application.
    *   Step 6: Regularly re-audit approved ComfyUI custom nodes, especially after updates or dependency changes, to ensure continued security within the ComfyUI ecosystem.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Node Execution in ComfyUI (High Severity): Execution of arbitrary code within a ComfyUI custom node, leading to data breaches (access to ComfyUI outputs/workflows), system compromise (if ComfyUI environment is not isolated), or denial of service within the ComfyUI application.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via ComfyUI Node Dependencies (Medium Severity): Compromise of a Python dependency used by a ComfyUI custom node, introducing vulnerabilities indirectly into the ComfyUI application environment.
    *   Unintentional Vulnerabilities in ComfyUI Nodes (Medium Severity): Bugs or security flaws in custom node Python code due to developer error, leading to exploitable weaknesses within ComfyUI workflows.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Node Execution in ComfyUI: Significantly reduces risk by preventing the introduction of intentionally malicious code into the ComfyUI workflow environment.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via ComfyUI Node Dependencies: Moderately reduces risk by identifying vulnerable dependencies during vetting, specifically those used in the context of ComfyUI nodes.
    *   Unintentional Vulnerabilities in ComfyUI Nodes: Moderately reduces risk by catching common coding errors and security flaws specific to ComfyUI node development through code review and automated testing.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Informal code review for some frequently used ComfyUI custom nodes exists, but lacks formal process and tooling.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized ComfyUI custom node vetting policy with documented criteria.
    *   Automated SAST and DAST tools integrated into ComfyUI node approval process, specifically tailored for ComfyUI node vulnerabilities.
    *   Centralized, curated repository for vetted ComfyUI nodes.
    *   Regular re-auditing schedule for ComfyUI custom nodes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sandboxing Custom Node Execution within ComfyUI](./mitigation_strategies/sandboxing_custom_node_execution_within_comfyui.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Utilize containerization (e.g., Docker) or virtualization to isolate the ComfyUI process and its custom node execution environment. This limits the impact of a compromised node to the sandbox, not the host system.
    *   Step 2: Configure the sandbox specifically for ComfyUI node execution with minimal permissions. Restrict access to system resources, network (unless node requires controlled network access for specific ComfyUI functionalities), and file system, allowing only necessary ComfyUI directories and temporary storage.
    *   Step 3: Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, GPU if applicable, disk I/O) within the sandbox for ComfyUI node processes. This prevents resource exhaustion attacks from resource-intensive or malicious ComfyUI nodes impacting the entire ComfyUI application or host.
    *   Step 4: Employ security profiles (e.g., AppArmor, SELinux) within the ComfyUI sandbox to further restrict system calls and capabilities available to custom nodes, minimizing potential attack surface within the ComfyUI environment.
    *   Step 5: Monitor the ComfyUI sandbox environment for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized network connections initiated by nodes, or attempts to access restricted resources outside of the intended ComfyUI workflow context.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Node Execution in ComfyUI (High Severity): Limits the impact of malicious code execution within a ComfyUI node by containing it within the sandbox, preventing broader compromise of the ComfyUI application or host system.
    *   Resource Exhaustion via ComfyUI Nodes (Medium Severity): Prevents malicious or buggy ComfyUI nodes from consuming excessive system resources, leading to denial of service within the ComfyUI application and potentially impacting other ComfyUI workflows.
    *   Privilege Escalation from ComfyUI Nodes (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of malicious ComfyUI nodes escalating privileges to gain unauthorized access to the host system or other parts of the ComfyUI application environment outside of their intended scope.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Node Execution in ComfyUI: Significantly reduces impact by containment, limiting damage to the sandbox even if a malicious ComfyUI node is executed.
    *   Resource Exhaustion via ComfyUI Nodes: Significantly reduces risk by enforcing resource limits specifically for ComfyUI node execution, preventing runaway processes within ComfyUI workflows.
    *   Privilege Escalation from ComfyUI Nodes: Moderately reduces risk by limiting capabilities within the ComfyUI sandbox, although sandbox escape vulnerabilities remain a concern requiring ongoing security updates of sandbox technology.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. ComfyUI custom nodes currently run directly within the main ComfyUI process without sandboxing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Containerization or virtualization infrastructure for ComfyUI and custom node execution.
    *   Configuration of ComfyUI-specific sandbox environments with restricted permissions and resource limits.
    *   Integration of security profiles and monitoring within the ComfyUI sandbox.

        *   Usage of blacklisted ComfyUI custom nodes known to be malicious or vulnerable within the workflow.
        *   Unusual ComfyUI node configurations or parameter values that could indicate malicious intent (e.g., excessive image resolutions in image processing nodes, suspicious file paths in file loading/saving nodes within ComfyUI workflows).
        *   Embedded code or scripts within ComfyUI workflow descriptions or parameters (if ComfyUI allows and it's a risk).
    *   Step 3: Implement a risk scoring system for ComfyUI workflows based on scan results. Consider ComfyUI-specific risk factors like usage of unvetted nodes or unusual workflow structures.
    *   Step 4: Define actions based on ComfyUI workflow risk score:
        *   Low Risk: Allow ComfyUI workflow execution without warnings.
        *   Medium Risk: Warn user about potential risks in the ComfyUI workflow and require explicit confirmation.
        *   High Risk: Block ComfyUI workflow execution and alert administrators for review.
