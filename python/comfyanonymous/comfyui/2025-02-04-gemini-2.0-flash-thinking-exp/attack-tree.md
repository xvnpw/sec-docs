## Attack Tree Path: [[1.0] Exploit Workflow Execution Vulnerabilities **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/_1_0__exploit_workflow_execution_vulnerabilities_critical_node.md)

**Description:** This critical node represents the core attack surface of ComfyUI. Workflows are the fundamental unit of operation. Exploiting vulnerabilities during workflow execution can lead to severe consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Maliciously crafted workflows designed to inject code or exploit processing flaws.
* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the workflow engine itself.
* Leveraging vulnerabilities in libraries used during workflow processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1] Malicious Workflow Upload/Injection **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1__malicious_workflow_uploadinjection_critical_node.md)

**Description:** This node highlights the risk of attackers introducing malicious workflows into the application. This is a primary entry point for many attacks against ComfyUI.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Uploading workflows containing malicious code disguised as legitimate workflow logic.
* Injecting malicious workflow components through vulnerable input mechanisms.
* Social engineering to trick users into uploading attacker-controlled workflows.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.1] Code Injection via Workflow Nodes **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_1__code_injection_via_workflow_nodes_critical_node.md)

**Description:** This node focuses on the direct injection of code within workflow nodes. Successful code injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Exploiting custom nodes that execute Python code without proper input sanitization.
* Leveraging command injection vulnerabilities in nodes that interact with the operating system shell.
* Exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities if workflows are processed using insecure serialization methods like `pickle`.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.0] Exploit Custom Node Ecosystem Vulnerabilities **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/_2_0__exploit_custom_node_ecosystem_vulnerabilities_critical_node.md)

**Description:** The custom node ecosystem is a powerful feature of ComfyUI but also a significant security risk. Malicious or vulnerable custom nodes can be easily introduced and widely distributed.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Installation of malicious custom nodes containing backdoors, data-stealing code, or resource-hogging logic.
* Supply chain attacks targeting custom node repositories or dependencies.
* Social engineering to trick users into installing malicious custom nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[4.0] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in ComfyUI Core **CRITICAL NODE** **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/_4_0__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_comfyui_core_critical_node_high-risk_path.md)

**Description:** ComfyUI relies on numerous external Python packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Exploiting known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in outdated Python packages used by ComfyUI.
* Targeting vulnerabilities in the underlying Python interpreter itself.
* Dependency confusion or typosquatting attacks to introduce malicious packages during dependency installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.1.1] Python Code Injection in Custom Nodes **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_1_1__python_code_injection_in_custom_nodes_high-risk_path.md)

**Description:** Directly injecting and executing arbitrary Python code within custom nodes.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **[1.1.1.1.a] Install Malicious Custom Node (Social Engineering/Compromised Registry):** Tricking users into installing malicious custom nodes through social engineering tactics or by compromising custom node registries to distribute malicious nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.1.2] Command Injection via Workflow Nodes **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_1_2__command_injection_via_workflow_nodes_high-risk_path.md)

**Description:** Injecting and executing arbitrary operating system commands through workflow nodes.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **[1.1.1.2.a] Leverage Nodes Executing Shell Commands (e.g., via `os.system`, `subprocess`):** Exploiting workflow nodes that utilize shell commands (e.g., using functions like `os.system` or `subprocess`) without proper input sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2.2] Vulnerabilities in Image Processing Libraries (Used by Workflows) **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_2__vulnerabilities_in_image_processing_libraries__used_by_workflows__high-risk_path.md)

**Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in image processing libraries used by ComfyUI workflows.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **[1.2.2.a] Exploit Known CVEs in Libraries like Pillow, OpenCV, etc. (If ComfyUI uses vulnerable versions):** Targeting known CVEs in popular image processing libraries like Pillow or OpenCV if ComfyUI uses vulnerable versions of these libraries. Exploits for these CVEs may be publicly available, making exploitation easier.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1] Malicious Custom Nodes **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1__malicious_custom_nodes_high-risk_path.md)

**Description:** Utilizing malicious custom nodes to compromise the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **[2.1.1] Backdoor in Custom Node:** Embedding hidden functionality within a custom node to establish a backdoor for remote access and control.
    * **[2.1.1.a] Custom Node Contains Hidden Functionality for Remote Access:** Specifically, creating custom nodes that contain hidden code designed to provide attackers with persistent remote access to the system or application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[4.1] Vulnerable Python Packages **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/_4_1__vulnerable_python_packages_high-risk_path.md)

**Description:** Focusing on exploiting vulnerabilities present in the Python packages that ComfyUI depends on.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **[4.1.1] Outdated Dependencies with Known CVEs:** Specifically targeting outdated dependencies that have known and publicly disclosed CVEs.
    * **[4.1.1.a] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries like `Pillow`, `torch`, `transformers`, etc.:** Providing concrete examples of commonly used libraries (Pillow, torch, transformers) that, if outdated, could contain exploitable vulnerabilities.
