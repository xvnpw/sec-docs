## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit ComfyUI Workflow Execution](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_comfyui_workflow_execution.md)

This is a critical point as successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the ComfyUI environment. This can lead to system compromise, data access, or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Code via Workflow](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_code_via_workflow.md)

This path involves injecting malicious code directly into the workflow definition.
        * **Craft Malicious JSON Workflow Definition**
            * **Inject Python Code for Execution:** Attackers can craft malicious JSON payloads to embed and execute arbitrary Python code when the workflow is processed. This allows for direct control over the server environment.
                * Likelihood: Medium
                * Impact: High
                * Effort: Medium
                * Skill Level: Intermediate
                * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Workflow File](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_workflow_file.md)

This path involves introducing malicious code through a workflow file.
        * **User Uploads Malicious Workflow:** If the application allows users to upload ComfyUI workflows, attackers can upload files containing malicious code that will be executed when the application processes the workflow. This is a relatively straightforward attack if upload functionality is present.
                * Likelihood: Medium (If application allows uploads)
                * Impact: High
                * Effort: Low
                * Skill Level: Novice
                * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires content inspection)

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit ComfyUI Custom Nodes](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_comfyui_custom_nodes.md)

This is a critical node because custom nodes extend ComfyUI's functionality and often have direct access to system resources. Compromising custom nodes provides multiple avenues for high-impact attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Node Code](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_node_code.md)

This path focuses on exploiting security flaws within the code of custom nodes.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unsafe Deserialization:** Custom nodes might use deserialization to process data. If not handled securely, attackers can craft malicious payloads that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a common vulnerability in Python applications.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: High
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * **Path Traversal leading to Arbitrary File Access:** Vulnerable custom nodes might allow attackers to manipulate file paths, enabling them to read sensitive files or potentially write malicious files to arbitrary locations on the server.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: Medium/High (Depending on accessed files)
            * Effort: Low/Medium
            * Skill Level: Novice/Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * **Command Injection vulnerabilities:** If custom nodes interact with the operating system without proper input sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands that will be executed on the server.
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: High
            * Effort: Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Supply Chain Attacks on Custom Nodes](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_supply_chain_attacks_on_custom_nodes.md)

This path involves compromising the supply chain of custom nodes.
        * **Install Malicious Custom Nodes from Untrusted Sources:** If users are allowed to install custom nodes from arbitrary sources, attackers can create and distribute malicious nodes that contain backdoors or other malicious functionality. This is a significant risk if there are no controls on node installation.
            * Likelihood: Medium (If users can install freely)
            * Impact: High
            * Effort: Low
            * Skill Level: Novice
            * Detection Difficulty: Low (If source is known bad)
