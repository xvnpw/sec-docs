# Threat Model Analysis for comfyanonymous/comfyui

## Threat: [Malicious Code Execution in Custom Nodes](./threats/malicious_code_execution_in_custom_nodes.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious custom node containing arbitrary Python code. When a user installs and executes a workflow containing this node, the attacker's code runs within the ComfyUI process. This allows the attacker to execute commands on the server, access sensitive files accessible to the ComfyUI process, establish reverse shells, or exfiltrate data. This is a direct consequence of ComfyUI's design allowing execution of user-provided code.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server hosting ComfyUI, data breaches, loss of control over the application.

**Affected Component:** Custom Node System (specifically the execution engine for custom Python code within `execution.py` and potentially node loading mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust sandboxing or containerization for custom node execution to limit their access and capabilities.
* Develop and enforce a secure coding standard for custom node development.
* Implement a mechanism for verifying the authenticity and integrity of custom nodes (e.g., code signing integrated into ComfyUI).
* Consider implementing static analysis security checks directly within ComfyUI for custom node code before execution.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack through Compromised Custom Node Repository (Impacting ComfyUI)](./threats/supply_chain_attack_through_compromised_custom_node_repository__impacting_comfyui_.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a repository used for distributing ComfyUI custom nodes. They inject malicious code into a seemingly legitimate node. When a user installs this compromised node through ComfyUI's interface or by placing it in the custom nodes directory, the malicious code is integrated into their ComfyUI instance.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of ComfyUI instances using the affected node, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise on a large scale. This directly leverages ComfyUI's mechanism for loading and using external code.

**Affected Component:** Custom Node Installation and Management System within ComfyUI (potentially involving file system operations and module loading).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement checksum verification or other integrity checks within ComfyUI for downloaded or loaded custom nodes.
* Develop a mechanism within ComfyUI to allow users to report and flag suspicious custom nodes.
* Consider integrating with or developing a curated and verified repository of custom nodes directly within ComfyUI.

## Threat: [Workflow Injection Leading to Resource Exhaustion within ComfyUI](./threats/workflow_injection_leading_to_resource_exhaustion_within_comfyui.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious workflow that, when executed by ComfyUI, consumes excessive server resources (CPU, GPU, memory). This could involve creating very large or computationally intensive workflows that exploit inefficiencies in ComfyUI's execution engine, or workflows that create infinite loops within ComfyUI's node processing logic.

**Impact:** Denial of service, making the ComfyUI instance unavailable to legitimate users. Potential impact on other services running on the same server if ComfyUI is not properly isolated.

**Affected Component:** Workflow Execution Engine (`execution.py`, node processing logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement resource quotas and limits for workflow execution within ComfyUI.
* Develop mechanisms within ComfyUI to detect and terminate runaway workflows based on resource consumption or execution time.
* Optimize ComfyUI's workflow execution engine to handle large or complex workflows more efficiently.
* Implement validation of workflow definitions within ComfyUI to prevent excessively large or complex workflows from being loaded or executed.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated/Unauthorized API Access to ComfyUI](./threats/unauthenticatedunauthorized_api_access_to_comfyui.md)

**Description:** If the ComfyUI API is exposed without proper authentication or authorization mechanisms within the ComfyUI codebase itself, an attacker can directly interact with it to execute arbitrary workflows, access output data, or potentially modify the system's configuration. This is a vulnerability in how ComfyUI exposes its functionality.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to ComfyUI functionality and data, potential for system compromise.

**Affected Component:** ComfyUI API endpoints (likely within the server components and routing logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication mechanisms directly within the ComfyUI API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
* Implement authorization controls within ComfyUI to restrict access to specific API endpoints based on user roles or permissions.
* Ensure the API is not publicly accessible by default and requires explicit configuration for external access.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability in ComfyUI's File Handling](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_in_comfyui's_file_handling.md)

**Description:** If ComfyUI's core file handling mechanisms (e.g., for loading images, saving outputs, or accessing models) do not properly sanitize user-provided file paths, an attacker could potentially access or modify files outside of the intended directories by crafting malicious file paths (e.g., using "../"). This is a direct vulnerability within ComfyUI's code.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, potential for data breaches or system compromise.

**Affected Component:** File System Handling within ComfyUI core (likely functions related to file input/output operations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths within ComfyUI's codebase.
* Use secure file access methods within ComfyUI that restrict access to authorized directories.
* Avoid constructing file paths dynamically based on user input without thorough validation within ComfyUI's code.
