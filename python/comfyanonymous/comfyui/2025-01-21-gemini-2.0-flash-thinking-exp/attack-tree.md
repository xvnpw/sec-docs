## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Workflow Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_workflow_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit Workflow Processing Vulnerabilities:**
    *   This category encompasses attacks that leverage weaknesses in how ComfyUI processes user-defined workflows. Attackers can craft malicious workflows to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive resources, or disrupt the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Code via Workflow (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_code_via_workflow__likelihood_medium__impact_high__effort_medium__skill__38244a92.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Code via Workflow:**
    *   ComfyUI allows users to define workflows using nodes. If custom nodes or built-in nodes with code execution capabilities are present, an attacker can craft a workflow that executes arbitrary Python code or OS commands on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise.

*   **Craft Workflow with Python Code Execution Nodes:** ComfyUI might allow the use of custom nodes or have built-in nodes that can execute Python code. Attackers can craft workflows utilizing these nodes to execute malicious Python code.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Inject OS Commands via Workflow (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_os_commands_via_workflow__likelihood_medium__impact_high__effort_medium__skill_df37d095.md)

*   **Inject OS Commands via Workflow:**  Attackers can leverage nodes that interact with the operating system (e.g., for file system operations) to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** [CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Nodes (Likelihood: Medium-High, Impact: High, Effort: Medium-High, Skill Level: Intermediate-Advanced, Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__critical__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_nodes__likelihood_medium-high__impact_hi_0682a2d1.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Nodes:**
    *   ComfyUI's extensibility through custom nodes introduces a significant attack surface. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in publicly available or privately developed custom nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Utilize Known Vulnerabilities in Publicly Available Nodes (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Low)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_utilize_known_vulnerabilities_in_publicly_available_nodes__likelihood_medium__impact__a35bb00a.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Custom Nodes (Likelihood: Low, Impact: High, Effort: High, Skill Level: Advanced, Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_zero-day_vulnerabilities_in_custom_nodes__likelihood_low__impact_high__effort_d00fb02e.md)

*   **Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Custom Nodes:** Attackers can discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-days) in custom nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Supply Chain Attack on Custom Nodes (Likelihood: Low-Medium, Impact: High, Effort: High, Skill Level: Advanced, Detection Difficulty: Low)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_supply_chain_attack_on_custom_nodes__likelihood_low-medium__impact_high__effort_high__b473b460.md)

*   **Supply Chain Attack on Custom Nodes:** Attackers can compromise the source of a custom node (e.g., a repository or developer account) to inject malicious code that will then be used by applications incorporating that node.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit File System Access Vulnerabilities (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_file_system_access_vulnerabilities__likelihood_medium__impact_high__effort_me_7dbdf5d1.md)

*   **Exploit File System Access Vulnerabilities:**
    *   These attacks target weaknesses in how ComfyUI handles file system access, potentially allowing attackers to read or write arbitrary files.

*   **Path Traversal:** If ComfyUI allows users to specify file paths without proper sanitization, attackers can use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../`) to access files outside the intended directories.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** [CRITICAL] Arbitrary File Read (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__critical__arbitrary_file_read__likelihood_medium__impact_high__effort_medium__skill__f080ea27.md)

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful path traversal or other vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary file read, allowing attackers to access sensitive configuration files or application data.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** [CRITICAL] Arbitrary File Write (Likelihood: Low-Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__critical__arbitrary_file_write__likelihood_low-medium__impact_high__effort_medium__s_095f0f48.md)

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Successful path traversal or other vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary file write, enabling attackers to overwrite critical files or inject malicious code into files that are later executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium-High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_network_communication_vulnerabilities__likelihood_medium__impact_medium-high__664a5995.md)

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If ComfyUI workflows can make network requests, attackers can craft workflows to make requests to internal services or external resources that they shouldn't have access to. This can be used to scan internal networks, access internal APIs, or exfiltrate data.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Dependencies and Libraries (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dependencies_and_libraries__likelihood_medium__impact_high__effort_medium__sk_e88eacf7.md)
