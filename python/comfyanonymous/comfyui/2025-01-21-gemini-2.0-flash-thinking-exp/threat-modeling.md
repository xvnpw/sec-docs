# Threat Model Analysis for comfyanonymous/comfyui

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Node Installation](./threats/malicious_custom_node_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Custom Node Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could create a seemingly benign custom node or extension and distribute it through community channels or by tricking users into installing it. Upon installation, the node executes malicious code embedded within it. This could involve accessing sensitive data on the server, establishing a reverse shell, or modifying system configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting ComfyUI, complete system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Custom Node Loading Mechanism, potentially the Python interpreter executing the node's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a system for verifying the authenticity and integrity of custom nodes (e.g., digital signatures).
        *   Encourage users to only install custom nodes from trusted sources.
        *   Perform code reviews of custom nodes before installation, especially those with broad permissions.
        *   Run ComfyUI in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions to mitigate the impact of malicious code.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity after custom node installation.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Custom Node Repository](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_custom_node_repository.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack on Custom Node Repository
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a legitimate custom node repository or developer account and injects malicious code into an existing, trusted custom node update. Users who automatically update their nodes or install the compromised version will unknowingly introduce the malicious code into their ComfyUI instance.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to malicious custom node installation, potentially affecting a larger user base who trusted the original node. Remote code execution, data breach, system compromise.
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Custom Node Update Mechanism, potentially the package manager or file system operations involved in updating nodes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mechanisms for verifying the integrity of custom node updates.
        *   Encourage developers to use strong authentication and security practices for their repositories.
        *   Monitor custom node repositories for unexpected changes or commits.
        *   Provide users with the ability to review changes before updating custom nodes.
        *   Implement rollback mechanisms to revert to previous versions of custom nodes.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Node Code](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_node_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Node Code
    *   **Description:** Custom nodes, being user-contributed code, might contain security vulnerabilities such as path traversal, command injection, or arbitrary code execution flaws. Attackers can craft specific inputs within a ComfyUI workflow that, when processed by the vulnerable custom node, exploit these weaknesses.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading arbitrary files), arbitrary file manipulation, potentially remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Specific custom node(s) containing the vulnerability, the Python interpreter executing the node's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Conduct security audits and penetration testing of commonly used custom nodes.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within the application using ComfyUI to prevent malicious inputs from reaching custom nodes.
        *   Encourage custom node developers to follow secure coding practices and perform their own security testing.
        *   Provide a mechanism for reporting and patching vulnerabilities in custom nodes.

## Threat: [Workflow Injection Leading to Data Exfiltration](./threats/workflow_injection_leading_to_data_exfiltration.md)

*   **Threat:** Workflow Injection Leading to Data Exfiltration
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious ComfyUI workflow that, when executed, attempts to access and transmit sensitive data accessible to the ComfyUI instance. This could involve using custom nodes or core nodes in unintended ways to read files, access environment variables, or make network requests to external servers controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data loss.
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Workflow Execution Engine, potentially custom nodes or core nodes involved in file access or network communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and the principle of least privilege for the ComfyUI process.
        *   Monitor network activity originating from the ComfyUI server for suspicious outbound connections.
        *   Implement output sanitization and validation to prevent sensitive data from being included in workflow outputs.
        *   Restrict ComfyUI's access to sensitive files and directories on the server.

## Threat: [Loading Malicious Models](./threats/loading_malicious_models.md)

*   **Threat:** Loading Malicious Models
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to specify arbitrary model locations or download models directly through ComfyUI, an attacker could provide links to malicious model files. These files could contain embedded code that executes when the model is loaded by ComfyUI.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting ComfyUI, system compromise.
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Model Loading Mechanism within ComfyUI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict model sources to trusted repositories or a curated list of allowed locations.
        *   Implement mechanisms for verifying the integrity of downloaded models (e.g., checksum verification).
        *   Run the model loading process in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions.
        *   Scan downloaded models for known malware or suspicious patterns.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Workflow or Custom Node](./threats/path_traversal_via_workflow_or_custom_node.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Workflow or Custom Node
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft a workflow or leverage a vulnerable custom node to manipulate file paths used by ComfyUI. This could allow them to access files outside of the intended directories, potentially reading sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive files.
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Workflow Execution Engine, File Handling functions within ComfyUI or custom nodes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths used within workflows and custom nodes.
        *   Use secure file handling practices, such as using absolute paths or whitelisting allowed directories.
        *   Avoid constructing file paths based on user-provided input without proper validation.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through Custom Nodes](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__through_custom_nodes.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through Custom Nodes
    *   **Description:** A malicious custom node could be designed to make arbitrary network requests from the ComfyUI server. An attacker could exploit this to scan internal networks, access internal services that are not publicly accessible, or potentially interact with external services in unintended ways.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Custom Node Execution, Network Communication functions within custom nodes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict network access for the ComfyUI process using firewalls or network policies.
        *   Implement allow-lists for outbound network requests from ComfyUI.
        *   Sanitize and validate URLs provided to custom nodes that perform network requests.
        *   Disable or restrict the functionality of custom nodes that are known to perform network requests if not strictly necessary.
