## Attack Surface: [Execution of Arbitrary Python Code via Custom Nodes](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_arbitrary_python_code_via_custom_nodes.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Execution of Arbitrary Python Code via Custom Nodes
    *   **Description:** ComfyUI allows the use of custom nodes, which are essentially user-provided Python scripts. If the application allows the execution of arbitrary custom nodes, it opens a significant avenue for attackers to run malicious code on the server.
    *   **How ComfyUI Contributes:** ComfyUI's architecture is designed to be extensible through custom nodes, making this a core feature and thus a potential attack vector if not carefully managed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious custom node that, when executed as part of a workflow, reads sensitive files from the server, establishes a reverse shell, or installs malware.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the server, data breach, denial of service, and other severe consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review and Auditing:** Thoroughly review the code of all custom nodes before allowing their execution. Implement a process for vetting and approving custom nodes.
        *   **Sandboxing and Isolation:** Execute custom nodes in a sandboxed environment with restricted access to system resources and network. Use technologies like containers or virtual machines.
        *   **Restricted Node Installation:** Limit the ability to install or upload custom nodes to trusted administrators or developers.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Even within custom nodes, implement robust input validation to prevent malicious data from triggering vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the ComfyUI process with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Workflow Execution Leading to Resource Exhaustion or Unintended Actions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_workflow_execution_leading_to_resource_exhaustion_or_unintended_actions.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Workflow Execution Leading to Resource Exhaustion or Unintended Actions
    *   **Description:** Attackers can craft malicious workflows that, when executed, consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to denial of service. They could also design workflows to perform unintended actions, like deleting files or making unauthorized API calls if custom nodes facilitate this.
    *   **How ComfyUI Contributes:** ComfyUI's workflow execution engine processes the instructions defined in the workflow JSON. A poorly designed or malicious workflow can exploit this engine.
    *   **Example:** An attacker submits a workflow with an infinite loop or a large number of computationally intensive nodes, causing the server to become unresponsive. Another example is a workflow using a custom node to delete files based on user-controlled input.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Denial of service, data loss or corruption, potential for further exploitation if unintended actions are possible.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Workflow Validation and Sanitization:** Implement server-side validation of workflow JSON before execution to detect potentially malicious structures or excessive resource usage.
        *   **Resource Limits and Quotas:** Enforce limits on the resources (CPU time, memory, execution time) that can be consumed by a single workflow execution.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity that might indicate a malicious workflow is running.
        *   **Workflow Execution Queues and Prioritization:** Implement a queueing system for workflow execution to prevent a single malicious workflow from monopolizing resources.
        *   **Secure Workflow Storage and Access Control:** Protect stored workflows from unauthorized modification or submission.

## Attack Surface: [Loading Malicious or Backdoored Models](./attack_surfaces/loading_malicious_or_backdoored_models.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Loading Malicious or Backdoored Models
    *   **Description:** ComfyUI relies on loading various models (e.g., Stable Diffusion models, VAEs). If the application allows users to specify arbitrary model URLs or paths, attackers could provide links to compromised models containing malicious code or biases that could be exploited.
    *   **How ComfyUI Contributes:** ComfyUI's core functionality involves loading and utilizing these models, making the model loading process a critical point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a link to a seemingly legitimate model that, when loaded by ComfyUI, executes malicious code on the server or introduces subtle biases into the generated outputs for malicious purposes.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Potential for server compromise if the model contains executable code, or the introduction of biases leading to harmful or misleading outputs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Model Sources:** Only allow loading models from trusted and verified sources. Maintain a whitelist of approved model repositories or local paths.
        *   **Integrity Checks (Hashing):** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of downloaded models using cryptographic hashes. Compare the downloaded model's hash against a known good hash.
        *   **Scanning Models for Malware:** Explore options for scanning model files for known malware signatures before loading them.
        *   **Sandboxing Model Loading:** If feasible, load models in an isolated environment to limit the potential impact of malicious code.
        *   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of loading models from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [API Vulnerabilities (if ComfyUI's API is exposed)](./attack_surfaces/api_vulnerabilities__if_comfyui's_api_is_exposed_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** API Vulnerabilities (if ComfyUI's API is exposed)
    *   **Description:** If the application exposes ComfyUI's API directly or indirectly, vulnerabilities in the API endpoints (e.g., lack of authentication, insufficient authorization, parameter injection) could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary workflows, access sensitive data, or disrupt service.
    *   **How ComfyUI Contributes:** ComfyUI provides an API for interacting with its functionalities, which, if not secured, becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a missing authentication check on an API endpoint to submit a malicious workflow. Another example is exploiting a parameter injection vulnerability to manipulate workflow execution.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized access to ComfyUI functionality, potential for arbitrary code execution via workflows, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) to verify the identity of API clients and authorization to control access to specific API endpoints.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input parameters received by the API to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and resource exhaustion through excessive API requests.
        *   **Secure API Design:** Follow secure API design principles, including using appropriate HTTP methods, returning informative error messages without revealing sensitive information, and avoiding exposing unnecessary endpoints.
        *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments of the API to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in Workflow or Node File Handling](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_workflow_or_node_file_handling.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in Workflow or Node File Handling
    *   **Description:** If workflows or custom nodes handle file paths without proper sanitization, attackers could potentially read or write files outside of the intended directories, leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **How ComfyUI Contributes:** ComfyUI's functionality involves loading and saving files, and custom nodes might interact with the file system.
    *   **Example:** A malicious workflow or custom node uses ".." sequences in a file path to access sensitive files outside of the designated input/output directories.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Access to sensitive files, potential for overwriting critical system files, and server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization of all file paths provided by users or within workflows.
        *   **Use Absolute Paths or Whitelisting:**  Prefer using absolute paths or maintaining a whitelist of allowed directories for file operations.
        *   **Sandboxing and Chroot Jails:** Run ComfyUI or individual workflow executions in sandboxed environments or chroot jails to restrict file system access.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the ComfyUI process and any custom nodes have the minimum necessary file system permissions.
