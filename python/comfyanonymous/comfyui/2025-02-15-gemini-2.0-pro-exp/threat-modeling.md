# Threat Model Analysis for comfyanonymous/comfyui

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Node Execution](./threats/malicious_custom_node_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Custom Node Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker installs or convinces a developer to install a malicious custom node (Python script) disguised as a legitimate extension. The attacker might upload the node to a public repository, use social engineering, or exploit a vulnerability in a node repository. The malicious node could contain code to perform various harmful actions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete system compromise (RCE) on the server running ComfyUI.
        *   Data theft (user inputs, outputs, models, API keys).
        *   Cryptocurrency mining.
        *   Network intrusion and lateral movement.
        *   Persistent backdoor installation.
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Custom Node loading mechanism (`nodes.py`, node execution environment).  Specifically, any function that loads and executes Python code from external sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Node Vetting:** Only install nodes from trusted, reputable sources.  Manually review *all* source code before installation.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Implement strong sandboxing (e.g., Docker containers with minimal privileges, restricted network access).  Consider using seccomp or AppArmor profiles.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:**  Scrutinize all dependencies of custom nodes.  Use tools like `pip-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.  Pin dependency versions.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run ComfyUI as a non-root user with limited file system access.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce CPU, memory, GPU, and network limits on the ComfyUI process.
        *   **Code Signing (Ideal):** Implement a code signing mechanism for custom nodes (though this is not natively supported by ComfyUI and would require significant custom development).

## Threat: [Model Poisoning via Uploaded Checkpoint](./threats/model_poisoning_via_uploaded_checkpoint.md)

*   **Threat:** Model Poisoning via Uploaded Checkpoint

    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted model checkpoint file (e.g., `.ckpt`, `.safetensors`).  This model might be designed to produce biased, harmful, or unexpected outputs when given specific inputs, or to leak information. The attacker might exploit a file upload vulnerability or social engineer a user into loading the poisoned model.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Generation of offensive or harmful content.
        *   Circumvention of content filters.
        *   Data exfiltration through model outputs.
        *   Denial of service (if the model is designed to crash).
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Model loading functions (likely within `nodes.py` or related model-handling modules).  Specifically, any function that deserializes and loads model weights from external files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Model Provenance:** Only allow loading models from trusted sources.  Verify checksums/hashes against known-good values.
        *   **Model Scanning (Limited):** Explore model scanning techniques (research area).  This is not a foolproof solution.
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all inputs to the model, even if the model itself is trusted.
        *   **Output Monitoring:**  Monitor model outputs for anomalies.
        *   **Restrict Model Uploads:**  If possible, disable or severely restrict user model uploads.  Provide a curated set of pre-vetted models.

## Threat: [Prompt Injection in Workflow Definition](./threats/prompt_injection_in_workflow_definition.md)

*   **Threat:** Prompt Injection in Workflow Definition

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious prompt or workflow definition that manipulates the ComfyUI workflow execution.  Instead of just influencing the *output* of a single model, the attacker aims to alter the *flow* of execution, bypassing security checks or executing unintended nodes.  This could involve injecting special characters or code into node parameters or connections.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypassing safety mechanisms.
        *   Executing arbitrary nodes with attacker-controlled parameters.
        *   Data leakage or modification.
        *   Resource exhaustion.
    *   **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Workflow parsing and execution engine (likely within `execution.py` and related modules).  Specifically, any function that interprets and executes user-provided workflow definitions (JSON or similar).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Workflow Validation:**  Validate the entire workflow structure against a whitelist of allowed configurations.  Do *not* allow arbitrary node connections or parameter values.
        *   **Parameter Sanitization:**  Strictly sanitize and validate *all* user-provided parameters for *each* node.  Use type checking and input validation.
        *   **Input Templating:**  Use a secure templating engine to construct workflows, preventing direct concatenation of user input.
        *   **Context-Aware Escaping:** If any user input *must* be included in the workflow definition, use context-aware escaping to prevent injection.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*  **Threat:**  Dependency Vulnerabilities (Supply Chain Attack)

    * **Description:** A vulnerability exists in one of the Python packages that ComfyUI or a custom node depends on. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain control of the system. This is a "supply chain" attack because the vulnerability originates from a third-party component.
    * **Impact:**
        * Similar to malicious custom node execution: RCE, data theft, etc.
    * **Affected ComfyUI Component:** Any component that uses the vulnerable dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Dependency Management:** Use a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file to manage dependencies.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit`, `safety`, or `Dependabot`.
        * **Pinning Versions:** Pin dependency versions to specific, known-good releases to prevent automatic updates to vulnerable versions.
        * **Virtual Environments:** Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies.
