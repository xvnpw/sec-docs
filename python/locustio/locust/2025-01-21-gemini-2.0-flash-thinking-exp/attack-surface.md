# Attack Surface Analysis for locustio/locust

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Locust Web UI Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_locust_web_ui_access.md)

**Description:** The Locust master node exposes a web interface for controlling and monitoring tests. If this interface is accessible without proper authentication and authorization, it becomes a significant entry point for malicious actors.

**How Locust Contributes:** Locust inherently provides this web UI as a core feature for managing tests. By default, it often lacks strong authentication mechanisms.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Locust web UI over the internet without needing credentials. They can then start a large number of virtual users targeting an internal system, causing a denial-of-service.

**Impact:** Complete control over the testing process, potential for denial-of-service attacks against target systems, information disclosure about the testing environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable Authentication and Authorization: Configure Locust to require strong credentials for accessing the web UI. Utilize features like basic authentication or integrate with existing authentication providers.
* Restrict Network Access: Limit access to the Locust web UI to trusted networks or specific IP addresses using firewalls or network segmentation.
* Use HTTPS: Encrypt communication to the web UI using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
* Regularly Update Locust: Keep Locust updated to patch any known security vulnerabilities in the web UI.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Master-Worker Communication](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_master-worker_communication.md)

**Description:** The communication between the Locust master and worker nodes might not be encrypted or authenticated, making it susceptible to interception and manipulation.

**How Locust Contributes:** Locust's default communication setup might not enforce encryption or strong authentication between its components.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network as the Locust master and worker intercepts communication and injects malicious tasks for the workers to execute, potentially targeting unintended systems.

**Impact:** Ability to manipulate the testing process, inject malicious requests, potentially gain access to systems the workers interact with.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Secure Communication Protocols: If Locust offers configuration options for secure communication (e.g., using TLS/SSL for inter-process communication), enable them.
* Network Segmentation: Isolate the master and worker nodes on a private network segment with restricted access.
* Authentication Mechanisms: Explore if Locust provides options for authenticating communication between master and workers.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution via Malicious `locustfile` (Indirect Locust Involvement)](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution_via_malicious__locustfile___indirect_locust_involvement_.md)

**Description:** While the vulnerability lies within the user-defined `locustfile`, Locust's architecture allows for the execution of this user-provided code, making it a relevant attack surface. If this code is not written securely or interacts with external resources unsafely, it can introduce vulnerabilities leading to remote code execution.

**How Locust Contributes:** Locust's design necessitates the execution of user-provided Python code to define test scenarios.

**Example:** A developer writes a `locustfile` that takes user input from an external source without proper sanitization and uses it to construct a system command. An attacker could then inject malicious commands through this input.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the system running the Locust master or worker, depending on where the malicious code is executed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding guidelines when writing `locustfile` code. Avoid executing arbitrary commands based on external input. Sanitize all external input.
* Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the user running Locust processes has only the necessary permissions.
* Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews of `locustfile` code to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
* Dependency Management: Keep all Python dependencies used in the `locustfile` updated to their latest secure versions.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Locust Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_locust_configuration.md)

**Description:** Locust configuration files or environment variables might contain sensitive information like credentials or API keys.

**How Locust Contributes:** Locust requires configuration, and developers might inadvertently store sensitive data directly in configuration files used by Locust.

**Example:** API keys for accessing external services are hardcoded in the Locust configuration file, which is then committed to a public repository.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing unauthorized access to external services or systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid Hardcoding Credentials: Never hardcode sensitive information in configuration files.
* Environment Variables: Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management solutions to store and access sensitive configuration data used by Locust.
* Secure Configuration Management: Implement secure practices for managing and storing Locust configuration files, including access controls and encryption where appropriate.
* Version Control Hygiene: Avoid committing sensitive data to version control systems. Use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms.
