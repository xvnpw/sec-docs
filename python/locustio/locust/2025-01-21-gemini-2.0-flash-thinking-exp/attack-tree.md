## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Locust Web UI Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_locust_web_ui_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting weaknesses in the web interface used to manage and monitor Locust.
    *   This can involve common web application vulnerabilities present in the Locust UI code.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** High-Risk Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) ***](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Injecting malicious JavaScript code into input fields or other areas of the Locust web UI.
    *   This injected script is then executed by other users accessing the UI.
    *   **Gain access to administrator sessions:** By stealing session cookies or other authentication tokens of administrators, attackers can gain full control over the Locust instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** High-Risk Path: Authentication/Authorization Bypass ***](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting flaws in how Locust authenticates users or manages their permissions.
    *   This could involve vulnerabilities in session management, password reset mechanisms, or access control logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] *** High-Risk Path: Manipulate Locust Configuration ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical___high-risk_path_manipulate_locust_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Gaining unauthorized access to the configuration files or the `locustfile.py` script used by Locust.
    *   This could be achieved through compromised credentials, vulnerabilities in the server hosting Locust, or insecure file permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Code in Locustfile ***](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_code_in_locustfile.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Modifying the `locustfile.py` with malicious Python code.
    *   This code is executed by Locust worker nodes during the load testing process.
    *   **Execute arbitrary code on the target application during load tests:** The malicious code can be designed to interact with the target application in harmful ways, exploiting vulnerabilities or executing commands.
    *   **Exfiltrate data from the target application:** The malicious code can be designed to extract sensitive data from the target application and send it to an attacker-controlled server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Abuse Locust's Distributed Nature](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__abuse_locust's_distributed_nature.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Compromising one or more Locust worker nodes.
    *   This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in the worker node's operating system or software, or through compromised credentials.
    *   Once a worker node is compromised, it can be used as a launching point for further attacks against the target application or other internal systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** High-Risk Path: Leverage Locust's Load Generation Capabilities for Malicious Purposes ***](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_leverage_locust's_load_generation_capabilities_for_malicious_purposes.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Using Locust's intended functionality of generating load for malicious purposes.
    *   This requires gaining control over the Locust master node or its configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__distributed_denial_of_service__ddos__attack.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Configuring Locust to send a massive number of requests to the target application.
    *   This overwhelms the application's resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Disrupt application availability:** The goal of this attack is to make the target application unusable.
