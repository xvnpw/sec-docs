# Threat Model Analysis for locustio/locust

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Locust Master Web UI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_locust_master_web_ui.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Locust master's web interface, potentially by exploiting default credentials, weak passwords, or lack of authentication. They might then start, stop, or modify load tests, view sensitive configuration data, or even inject malicious code if the UI has vulnerabilities within the Locust framework itself.
- **Impact:** Disruption of testing activities, exposure of sensitive information about the target application and testing infrastructure managed by Locust, potential for malicious manipulation of tests leading to inaccurate results or even attacks on the target application *orchestrated through Locust*.
- **Affected Component:** Locust Master Web UI
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strong, unique passwords for the Locust master web UI.
    - Enable authentication and authorization mechanisms for the web UI (e.g., using a reverse proxy with authentication).
    - Deploy the master node on a secure network with restricted access.
    - Regularly update Locust to patch any potential vulnerabilities in the web UI.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Locust Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_locust_configuration_files.md)

- **Description:** Locust configuration files (e.g., `locustfile.py`) might inadvertently contain sensitive information like API keys, credentials, internal endpoint details, or other secrets used *within the Locust testing framework*. An attacker gaining access to these files could exploit this information.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to target application resources *if credentials for those resources are stored in Locust files*, potential for data breaches or further attacks using the exposed credentials.
- **Affected Component:** Locustfile, any configuration files used by Locust.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Locust configuration files.
    - Utilize environment variables or secure secret management solutions to handle sensitive data.
    - Implement proper access controls on configuration files to restrict access.
    - Regularly review Locustfiles and configuration for accidental inclusion of sensitive data.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Locustfiles](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_locustfiles.md)

- **Description:** If Locustfiles are dynamically generated or accept external input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious code that gets executed within the Locust worker processes. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the worker nodes *within the Locust environment*.
- **Impact:** Compromise of Locust worker nodes, potential for using compromised workers to attack other systems or exfiltrate data *from the Locust environment or related systems*.
- **Affected Component:** Locust Worker, Locustfile parsing and execution.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid dynamically generating Locustfiles based on untrusted input.
    - If dynamic generation is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization.
    - Run Locust workers in isolated environments with limited privileges.

## Threat: [Accidental or Malicious Denial of Service (DoS) via Locust](./threats/accidental_or_malicious_denial_of_service__dos__via_locust.md)

- **Description:** An attacker with access to the Locust master or a compromised user could configure Locust to generate an overwhelming amount of traffic, intentionally causing a denial of service against the target application or its infrastructure *using Locust's load generation capabilities*. Even unintentional misconfiguration can lead to this.
- **Impact:** Downtime and unavailability of the target application, potential financial losses and reputational damage.
- **Affected Component:** Locust Master, Locust Worker, load generation mechanisms.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict access controls and authorization for the Locust master.
    - Monitor Locust test configurations and resource usage.
    - Implement rate limiting and traffic shaping on the network and target application.
    - Educate users on responsible load testing practices.

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Payloads through Locust Tests](./threats/injection_of_malicious_payloads_through_locust_tests.md)

- **Description:** If Locust tests are designed to send user-provided data to the target application, vulnerabilities in the Locustfile or the test data generation process could allow attackers to inject malicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) into the target application during load testing *through Locust's request mechanisms*.
- **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the target application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other security incidents.
- **Affected Component:** Locustfile, data generation mechanisms, interaction with the target application *via Locust*.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Sanitize and validate all data used in Locust tests before sending it to the target application.
    - Follow secure coding practices when designing Locust tests.
    - Regularly scan the target application for vulnerabilities, including those that might be exposed during load testing.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Locust Itself](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_locust_itself.md)

- **Description:** Like any software, Locust itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the Locust master or worker nodes.
- **Impact:** Complete compromise of the load testing infrastructure, potential for using compromised nodes to attack other systems.
- **Affected Component:** All Locust components (Master, Worker, Web UI, etc.).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep Locust updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Subscribe to security advisories related to Locust.

## Threat: [Malicious Locust Extensions or Plugins](./threats/malicious_locust_extensions_or_plugins.md)

- **Description:** If using third-party Locust extensions or plugins, these could contain malicious code or vulnerabilities that could compromise the testing environment.
- **Impact:** Compromise of the Locust infrastructure, potential for data breaches or attacks on the target application *through the compromised Locust environment*.
- **Affected Component:** Locust Master, Locust Worker (depending on the extension), the extension itself.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully evaluate the security and trustworthiness of third-party Locust extensions before using them.
    - Review the code of extensions if possible.
    - Keep extensions updated to their latest versions.
