# Threat Model Analysis for locustio/locust

## Threat: [Compromised Master Node](./threats/compromised_master_node.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Locust master node by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Locust software itself, its dependencies, or the underlying operating system. Once inside, they could manipulate running tests through Locust's API, access Locust configuration files, or use the master to deploy malicious Locustfiles to worker nodes.

**Impact:**  Complete control over load testing activities, potential access to sensitive configuration data managed by Locust, disruption of testing schedules, and the ability to inject malicious code into the testing process.

**Affected Locust Component:** Locust Master process, Locust API.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Locust installation on the master node up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Secure the underlying operating system and network services of the master node.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the master node's administrative interfaces (if any beyond the web UI).
*   Regularly audit access logs for suspicious activity related to the Locust master process.

## Threat: [Compromised Worker Node](./threats/compromised_worker_node.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Locust worker node by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Locust software running on the worker, its dependencies, or the underlying operating system. A compromised worker can be used to send malicious requests to the target application outside the intended scope of the load test, or to exfiltrate data from the worker node itself.

**Impact:**  Inaccurate load testing results due to manipulated traffic, potential for the worker node to be used for malicious purposes against the target application, exposure of any configuration data present on the worker related to Locust.

**Affected Locust Component:** Locust Worker process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Locust installation on worker nodes up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Secure the underlying operating system of worker nodes.
*   Ensure worker nodes are running in isolated environments with limited access to sensitive resources.
*   Regularly patch the operating system and software on worker nodes.

## Threat: [Malicious Locustfile Injection](./threats/malicious_locustfile_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the system where Locustfiles are stored or deployed modifies an existing Locustfile or introduces a new malicious one. This malicious file leverages Locust's capabilities to perform unintended and harmful actions against the target application, such as sending crafted requests to exploit vulnerabilities or overwhelming the system with excessive load beyond the intended test parameters.

**Impact:**  Data corruption or loss on the target application, denial of service against the target application, potential compromise of worker nodes if the malicious code targets them through Locust's execution environment.

**Affected Locust Component:** Locustfile, Locust Worker process (executing the malicious code).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls on the directories where Locustfiles are stored and managed.
*   Use version control for Locustfiles and implement code review processes for any changes.
*   Automate the deployment of Locustfiles and restrict manual modifications on production systems.
*   Consider using a centralized configuration management system for Locustfiles.

## Threat: [Exposure of Credentials in Locustfiles](./threats/exposure_of_credentials_in_locustfiles.md)

**Description:** Developers mistakenly hardcode sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, etc.) directly within Locustfiles, which are then processed by the Locust worker processes. An attacker gaining access to these files or the running worker processes could extract these credentials.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the target application or related services, potential data breaches, and misuse of the compromised accounts due to credentials present within Locust's configuration.

**Affected Locust Component:** Locustfile, potentially Locust Worker process memory if credentials are used during execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never hardcode credentials directly in Locustfiles.
*   Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management solutions to store and access credentials within Locustfiles.
*   Implement code review processes to identify and prevent the inclusion of hardcoded credentials.
*   Scan code repositories for accidentally committed secrets.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities via Locustfile](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_via_locustfile.md)

**Description:** Locustfiles contain Python code that makes requests to the target application. If user-provided data or external inputs are not properly sanitized or validated within the Locustfile *before* being used in requests made by Locust, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) against the target application. The Locust framework facilitates the execution of these potentially malicious requests.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the target application's data, potential for arbitrary code execution on the target application's server, data manipulation or deletion initiated through Locust's request mechanisms.

**Affected Locust Component:** Locustfile, specifically the code responsible for making requests using Locust's HTTP client or other communication methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when writing Locustfiles.
*   Sanitize and validate all user-provided data or external inputs before incorporating them into requests made by Locust.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases from within Locustfiles.
*   Avoid constructing shell commands directly from user input in Locustfiles.

## Threat: [Accidental Load on Production Systems](./threats/accidental_load_on_production_systems.md)

**Description:** Due to misconfiguration within the Locust setup itself (e.g., incorrect target URL specified in the Locustfile or master configuration) or human error when initiating a load test, Locust tests intended for a staging or testing environment are accidentally run against a production environment. Locust then proceeds to generate load against the live system.

**Impact:**  Overwhelming the production system, leading to performance degradation, service outages, and potential data corruption caused by the unintended load generated by Locust.

**Affected Locust Component:** Configuration of Locust master and workers, Locustfile (target URL definition), Locust execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Clearly define and enforce environment-specific configurations for Locust, especially the target URL.
*   Implement safeguards within the Locust setup or deployment process to prevent accidental execution of load tests against production environments (e.g., confirmation prompts, environment variable checks).
*   Use distinct naming conventions or visual cues to differentiate between configurations for different environments within Locust.
