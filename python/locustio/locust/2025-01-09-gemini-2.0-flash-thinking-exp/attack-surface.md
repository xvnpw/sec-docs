# Attack Surface Analysis for locustio/locust

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Locust Web UI Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_locust_web_ui_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Locust web UI, by default, often lacks strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. This allows anyone with network access to the UI to control and monitor load tests.
    *   **How Locust Contributes:** Locust's primary interface for control and monitoring is the web UI. Without explicit configuration, it often runs with minimal security, prioritizing ease of use over security in default setups.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as the Locust master can access the web UI without credentials, start or stop tests, view test results, and potentially inject malicious JavaScript if the UI has XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access can lead to disruption of testing activities, manipulation of test results, exposure of potentially sensitive data collected during tests, and potentially leveraging the Locust instance for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization on the Locust web UI using tools like `Flask-HTTPAuth` or by placing it behind a reverse proxy with authentication.
        *   Restrict network access to the Locust web UI to authorized personnel or specific IP ranges using firewall rules.
        *   Regularly review and update Locust to patch any identified security vulnerabilities in the web UI.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection through User Scripts](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_through_user_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Locust allows users to write custom Python code to define user behavior and tasks. If not carefully reviewed and sanitized, this code can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Locust Contributes:** Locust's flexibility relies on user-defined scripts. This powerful feature also opens the door to potential security risks if developers introduce malicious or poorly written code.
    *   **Example:** A developer might inadvertently include code in a Locust script that executes arbitrary system commands based on input from the test environment or target application, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Locust instance and potentially the underlying system, data exfiltration, denial of service, and other malicious activities depending on the permissions of the Locust process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous code review processes for all Locust user scripts.
        *   Avoid using dynamic code execution (e.g., `eval`, `exec`) within Locust scripts unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   Sanitize any external input used within Locust scripts to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Run Locust processes with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in User Scripts or Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_user_scripts_or_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently embed sensitive information (API keys, passwords, internal URLs) directly within Locust user scripts or configuration files.
    *   **How Locust Contributes:** Locust relies on user-provided scripts and configuration, which can become repositories for sensitive information if developers are not careful.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes an API key within a Locust task to authenticate with a service being tested. If the Locust scripts are not properly secured, this key could be exposed.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, and potential compromise of other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in Locust scripts or configuration files.
        *   Utilize environment variables or secure secret management solutions to store and access sensitive credentials.
        *   Implement access controls on Locust script and configuration files to restrict access to authorized personnel.
