## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Leverage Default Credentials (if not changed) for a Locust Application

**Context:** We are analyzing the attack tree path "1.1.4. Leverage Default Credentials (if not changed)" within the context of a Locust application. Locust is an open-source load testing tool written in Python. It allows users to define the behavior of their simulated users (locusts) in Python code and then runs these locusts against a target system. The Locust web UI provides real-time monitoring and control of the load test.

**Attack Tree Path:**

* **HIGH-RISK PATH** 1.1.4. Leverage Default Credentials (if not changed)
    * **1.1.4. Leverage Default Credentials:** Failure to change default credentials provides an easy entry point for attackers.

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack path focuses on a fundamental security vulnerability: the continued use of default credentials for accessing sensitive systems or applications. While seemingly straightforward, its prevalence and potential impact make it a high-risk concern. Let's break down its implications for a Locust application:

**Understanding the Vulnerability in the Locust Context:**

* **Locust Web UI:**  The primary target for this attack within a Locust application is the **web UI**. This UI, typically accessible via a web browser, allows users to:
    * Start and stop load tests.
    * Configure the number of simulated users.
    * Monitor real-time performance metrics.
    * View logs and statistics.
    * Potentially access configuration settings.

* **Default Credentials (or Lack Thereof):**  Crucially, **Locust itself does not ship with default credentials for its web UI.** This is a positive security aspect. However, the vulnerability arises if:
    * **Authentication is implemented by the user/developer but uses weak or easily guessable credentials.**  This is the most likely scenario this attack path refers to in the Locust context. Developers might implement basic authentication (e.g., using Flask-HTTPAuth or similar) and set simple default credentials during development or initial setup, forgetting to change them for production.
    * **The deployment environment introduces default credentials that grant access to the Locust instance.**  For example, if Locust is deployed within a container orchestration platform (like Kubernetes) or a cloud environment, the platform itself might have default credentials for accessing deployed applications or managing the infrastructure. While not directly related to Locust's code, this can still lead to unauthorized access to the Locust instance.
    * **Poorly secured reverse proxies or load balancers in front of Locust.** If these components use default credentials, an attacker could potentially bypass any authentication implemented within Locust itself.

**Attack Scenario:**

An attacker could attempt to access the Locust web UI by trying common default username/password combinations like:

* admin/admin
* admin/password
* user/password
* test/test
* guest/guest

They might also try variations or common weak passwords. If authentication is implemented but uses these easily guessable credentials, the attacker gains unauthorized access.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

Gaining access to the Locust web UI via default credentials can have severe consequences:

* **Unauthorized Control of Load Tests:** The attacker can start, stop, or modify load tests. This could be used to:
    * **Disrupt services:** By launching massive, uncontrolled load tests against the target system, causing denial-of-service (DoS).
    * **Mask malicious activity:** By running legitimate-looking load tests while simultaneously carrying out other attacks.
    * **Gather information:** By observing the target system's behavior under specific load conditions.

* **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Depending on how Locust is configured and used, the UI might reveal sensitive information, such as:
    * **Target system details:**  Endpoints, API keys, connection strings used in the load tests.
    * **Test data:**  Potentially containing sensitive information if not properly anonymized.
    * **Infrastructure details:**  Information about the environment where Locust is running.

* **Manipulation of Configuration:**  The attacker might be able to modify Locust's configuration, potentially:
    * **Changing test parameters:** Leading to inaccurate or misleading test results.
    * **Exposing internal network details:**  If Locust is configured to access internal resources.

* **Pivot Point for Further Attacks:**  A compromised Locust instance could be used as a stepping stone to gain access to other systems within the network.

**Likelihood Assessment:**

While Locust itself doesn't have default credentials, the likelihood of this attack path being exploitable depends on the security practices of the development and deployment teams:

* **High Likelihood:** If developers implement basic authentication and forget to change default credentials during development or initial setup.
* **Medium Likelihood:** If the deployment environment or reverse proxies/load balancers have default credentials that grant access to the Locust instance.
* **Low Likelihood:** If robust authentication mechanisms are implemented and enforced, and the deployment environment is properly secured.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk associated with this attack path, the following measures are crucial:

* **Implement Strong Authentication:**
    * **Avoid basic authentication with default credentials.**
    * **Use more robust authentication methods:**
        * **Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).**
        * **OAuth 2.0.**
        * **Integration with existing identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, Okta).**
    * **Enforce strong password policies:** Minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password rotation.

* **Secure Deployment Environment:**
    * **Change default credentials for all infrastructure components:** Operating systems, container registries, cloud provider accounts, etc.
    * **Implement network segmentation and firewalls:** Restrict access to the Locust instance to authorized networks and users.
    * **Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS).**

* **Secure Reverse Proxies and Load Balancers:**
    * **Change default credentials for these components.**
    * **Implement authentication and authorization at the reverse proxy level if appropriate.**

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including weak credentials.**

* **Developer Education and Awareness:**
    * **Train developers on secure coding practices and the importance of avoiding default credentials.**
    * **Establish clear guidelines for implementing authentication and authorization.**

* **Configuration Management:**
    * **Store sensitive credentials securely (e.g., using secrets management tools).**
    * **Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code.**

**Developer Guidance:**

For the development team working with Locust, the following specific guidance is crucial:

* **Treat the Locust Web UI as a security-sensitive component.**  It provides significant control over the testing process and potential access to sensitive information.
* **Never rely on default credentials for any authentication mechanism implemented for the Locust UI.**
* **Prioritize implementing a robust and secure authentication method.**  Consider the security requirements of your application and choose an appropriate solution.
* **Thoroughly test the implemented authentication to ensure it is working as expected and is not vulnerable to bypasses.**
* **Document the authentication method used and any specific configuration required.**
* **Regularly review and update the authentication mechanism as needed.**
* **Educate all team members on the importance of secure authentication practices for the Locust instance.**

**Conclusion:**

While Locust itself doesn't have default credentials, the attack path "Leverage Default Credentials (if not changed)" remains a significant risk if developers implement weak or default credentials for accessing the Locust web UI or if the surrounding infrastructure has insecure default settings. By implementing strong authentication, securing the deployment environment, and fostering a security-conscious development culture, the team can effectively mitigate this high-risk vulnerability and protect the Locust application and the systems it tests. Failing to address this can lead to unauthorized control, data breaches, and potential disruption of critical services.
