## High and Critical Locust-Specific Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the Locust load testing tool.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Locust Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Test Definitions (Code Injection)** | An attacker with write access to the `locustfile.py` modifies the script to include malicious Python code. This code is executed by the Locust master and worker nodes during test execution. | - **Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Locust infrastructure:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the master and worker nodes. - **Data Exfiltration from Locust environment:**  The attacker can access and steal sensitive information stored on the Locust machines (e.g., test configurations, potentially credentials). - **Resource Exhaustion on Locust infrastructure:** The malicious code could consume excessive resources, causing the Locust setup to crash or become unresponsive. - **Lateral Movement:** If the Locust environment has network access to other systems, the attacker could use the compromised nodes to pivot and attack those systems. | `locustfile.py`, Master Node, Worker Nodes | **Critical** | - **Restrict write access to `locustfile.py`:** Implement strict access controls (e.g., using file system permissions, version control systems with access control) to limit who can modify the test definition files. - **Code Review of `locustfile.py`:** Implement a mandatory code review process for any changes to the `locustfile.py` before deployment. - **Static Analysis of `locustfile.py`:** Use static analysis tools to scan the `locustfile.py` for potentially malicious code patterns. - **Sandboxing/Isolation of Locust Environment:** Run Locust in an isolated environment with limited access to sensitive resources and networks. - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Locust processes with the minimum necessary privileges. |
| **Compromised Worker Node Exploitation** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Locust worker node (e.g., through an OS vulnerability, weak credentials, or a supply chain attack). They can then leverage the worker's capabilities within the Locust framework. | - **Amplified Attacks against Target Application:** The attacker can use the compromised worker to send malicious or excessive requests to the target application, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS). - **Data Exfiltration from Target Application (if accessible):** If the worker node has access to the target application's internal network or databases, the attacker could attempt to exfiltrate data. - **Disruption of Load Tests:** The attacker can manipulate the worker to send incorrect or no traffic, skewing test results and providing misleading performance data. | Worker Nodes | **High** | - **Harden Worker Node Infrastructure:** Implement strong security measures on worker nodes, including regular patching, strong passwords, and disabling unnecessary services. - **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Locust infrastructure from other sensitive networks to limit the impact of a compromised worker. - **Monitoring and Intrusion Detection:** Implement monitoring and intrusion detection systems on worker nodes to detect suspicious activity. - **Secure Boot and Integrity Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the worker node's operating system and software. - **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct security assessments of the Locust infrastructure, including worker nodes. |
| **Insecure Communication Channel Exploitation (Master-Worker)** | The communication channel between the Locust master and worker nodes is not properly secured (e.g., using unencrypted protocols). An attacker on the network can intercept and potentially manipulate this communication. | - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker can intercept communication to eavesdrop on test configurations, potentially revealing sensitive information. - **Control Plane Compromise:** The attacker could inject malicious commands into the communication stream, potentially instructing workers to perform unintended actions or disrupting the test. - **Data Injection/Modification:** The attacker could modify test parameters or results being transmitted between the master and workers. | Master Node, Worker Nodes, Network Communication | **High** | - **Use Secure Communication Protocols:** Configure Locust to use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) for communication between the master and worker nodes. Refer to Locust documentation for secure communication options. - **Network Security Controls:** Implement network security controls (e.g., firewalls, VPNs) to restrict access to the communication channels between master and workers. - **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place for communication between master and workers (if available in Locust configuration). |
| **Dependency Vulnerabilities** | Locust relies on various Python libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited, directly impacting the Locust installation. | - **Various security risks depending on the vulnerability:** This could range from remote code execution to information disclosure, directly affecting the Locust master and worker nodes. | All Locust Components (due to shared dependencies) | **High** | - **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep Locust and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches. - **Use Dependency Scanning Tools:** Employ tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to scan for known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. - **Pin Dependency Versions:** Consider pinning dependency versions in your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file to ensure consistent and tested versions are used. - **Review Dependency Licenses:** Be aware of the licenses of the dependencies used and ensure they align with your organization's policies. |
