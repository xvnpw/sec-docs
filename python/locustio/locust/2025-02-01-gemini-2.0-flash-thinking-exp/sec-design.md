# BUSINESS POSTURE

Locust is an open-source load testing tool designed to simulate user traffic to websites, APIs, and other systems. Its primary business goal is to enable developers and operations teams to understand the performance and scalability of their systems under high load.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Identify performance bottlenecks in systems before they impact real users.
- Ensure system stability and responsiveness under expected and peak load conditions.
- Optimize infrastructure resource allocation based on performance testing results.
- Facilitate continuous performance monitoring and regression testing as part of the software development lifecycle.

Business Risks:
- Inaccurate load testing scenarios may lead to a false sense of security or missed performance issues in production.
- Misconfiguration of Locust or the target system during testing could cause unintended outages or performance degradation in production environments.
- Security vulnerabilities in Locust itself could be exploited if deployed in sensitive environments or used to test security-sensitive systems.
- Lack of understanding of test results or improper interpretation of performance data may lead to incorrect decisions about system architecture or infrastructure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open-source project with community review (GitHub).
- security control: Code hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency.
- security control: Use of Python, a relatively secure and widely used programming language.
- security control: Standard software development practices within the open-source community.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to exist in dependencies used by Locust.
- accepted risk: Security of Locust deployment environment is the responsibility of the user.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement regular security vulnerability scanning of Locust codebase and dependencies.
- security control: Follow secure coding practices during any customization or extension of Locust.
- security control: Deploy Locust in a secure and isolated environment, especially when testing production-like systems.
- security control: Implement access controls and monitoring for Locust instances and test results.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Locust itself does not require user authentication for basic operation as a load testing tool.
    - Requirement: If Locust is extended with a web UI or API for management, authentication should be implemented to control access.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization mechanisms should be in place to control who can configure and run load tests, especially in shared environments.
    - Requirement: Access to test results and configuration data should be restricted based on roles and responsibilities.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Locust should validate user-provided input for test configurations, target URLs, and other parameters to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
    - Requirement: When extending Locust with custom logic, ensure proper input validation is implemented in the custom code.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Locust should support secure communication protocols (HTTPS) when testing target systems.
    - Requirement: If Locust stores sensitive data (e.g., API keys in test scripts), consider encryption at rest and in transit.
