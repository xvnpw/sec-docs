# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for locustio/locust

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting in Locust Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_in_locust_scripts.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify critical request types:** Determine which requests in your Locust scripts are most likely to overload the target application if sent in excessive volume.
2.  **Implement rate limiting logic:** Within your Locust task sets, introduce mechanisms to control the frequency of these critical requests using `time.sleep()` or rate limiting libraries.
3.  **Configure rate limits:**  Set appropriate sleep times or rate limit parameters based on the target application's capacity and desired load profile.
4.  **Test rate limiting:** Verify that the rate limiting logic functions correctly in your Locust scripts.
5.  **Document rate limits:** Clearly document the implemented rate limiting strategies within the Locust scripts.
