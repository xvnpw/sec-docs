### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Credential Theft for Web UI Access [HIGH RISK PATH]

#### 4.1. Description of the Attack Path

The "Credential Theft for Web UI Access" path highlights a critical vulnerability stemming from weak or compromised authentication mechanisms protecting the Locust Web UI.  While designed for internal load testing and monitoring, the Web UI provides significant control over the Locust cluster.  Successful credential theft grants an attacker unauthorized access to this interface, enabling them to manipulate load tests, potentially exfiltrate sensitive data displayed in the UI (e.g., test results, configuration details), and potentially pivot to further attacks within the network.

This path is considered **HIGH RISK** because:

*   **Direct Access to Control:**  Gaining access to the Web UI provides direct control over the Locust load testing framework. This control can be abused to disrupt legitimate testing, launch denial-of-service attacks (DoS) against internal or external targets using the Locust infrastructure, or manipulate test results.
*   **Potential for Lateral Movement:** Depending on the network configuration and the privileges of the user account used to run Locust, successful Web UI access could be a stepping stone for lateral movement within the network. An attacker might be able to leverage compromised credentials or information gleaned from the UI to access other systems or resources.
*   **Data Exposure:** The Locust Web UI can display sensitive information related to the application being tested, test configurations, and potentially even performance metrics that could reveal internal system details. Credential theft can lead to unauthorized access and exposure of this data.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors

This high-risk path is primarily facilitated by the following attack vectors:

##### 4.2.1. Default or Weak Credentials

*   **Description:** This is a common and often easily exploitable vulnerability. If the Locust Web UI is deployed with default credentials (if any are pre-configured) or if administrators choose weak, easily guessable passwords, attackers can leverage this weakness to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Default Credentials:**  While Locust itself doesn't enforce default credentials out-of-the-box, misconfigurations or quick deployments might lead to administrators neglecting to set strong passwords or even using common default credentials like "admin/password" if they are setting up basic authentication manually.
    *   **Weak Passwords:**  Users may choose passwords that are short, based on dictionary words, personal information, or common patterns (e.g., "Password123", "locust"). These passwords are highly susceptible to brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can use automated tools to systematically try a large number of password combinations against the Web UI login form.  Without proper rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms, brute-force attacks can be successful, especially against weak passwords.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:**  A specific type of brute-force attack that uses lists of common passwords and dictionary words. These attacks are highly effective against passwords that are not sufficiently complex.
*   **Exploitation Scenario:** An attacker identifies a publicly accessible (or internally accessible from a less secure network segment) Locust Web UI. They attempt to log in using default credentials or initiate a brute-force/dictionary attack using common weak passwords. If successful, they gain full access to the Web UI.

##### 4.2.2. Credential Stuffing

*   **Description:** Credential stuffing exploits the widespread practice of password reuse across multiple online services. If users reuse the same credentials for the Locust Web UI as they use for other, potentially less secure, online accounts that have been compromised in data breaches, attackers can leverage these stolen credentials to gain access.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Password Reuse:**  Users often reuse passwords for convenience, making them vulnerable if one of their accounts is compromised.
    *   **Data Breaches:**  Large-scale data breaches are common, exposing millions of usernames and passwords. These compromised credentials are often traded and used by attackers.
    *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks:** Attackers use lists of compromised username/password pairs obtained from data breaches and attempt to log in to various online services, including the Locust Web UI. Automated tools are used to perform these attacks at scale.
*   **Exploitation Scenario:** An attacker obtains a database of compromised credentials from a data breach. They use these credentials to attempt login to the Locust Web UI. If a user has reused their password from a breached service for the Locust Web UI, the attacker will gain unauthorized access.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Actions and Recommendations

To effectively mitigate the risk of credential theft for the Locust Web UI, the following mitigation actions are crucial:

##### 4.3.1. Enforce Strong and Unique Passwords for all Locust Web UI Users

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Password Complexity Policies:** Implement password complexity requirements, mandating minimum password length, and the use of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    *   **Password Strength Meter:** Integrate a password strength meter into the user interface during password creation and changes to guide users in choosing strong passwords.
    *   **Regular Password Changes:** Encourage or enforce periodic password changes (e.g., every 90 days) to reduce the window of opportunity for compromised credentials.
    *   **Password Managers:** Recommend and encourage users to utilize password managers to generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for all their accounts, including the Locust Web UI.
*   **Rationale:** Strong passwords significantly increase the difficulty of brute-force and dictionary attacks, making it much harder for attackers to guess or crack credentials. Unique passwords prevent credential stuffing attacks from being successful if other accounts are compromised.

##### 4.3.2. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Web UI Access

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Choose MFA Method:** Select an appropriate MFA method, such as Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) using apps like Google Authenticator or Authy, SMS-based OTP (less secure but more accessible), or hardware security keys (most secure).
    *   **Integrate MFA:** Integrate the chosen MFA method into the Locust Web UI authentication flow. This might require custom development or using a reverse proxy/authentication gateway that supports MFA.
    *   **Enforce MFA for all Users:**  Mandate MFA for all users accessing the Locust Web UI, especially those with administrative privileges.
*   **Rationale:** MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords. Even if an attacker compromises a password, they will still need to bypass the second authentication factor (e.g., a code from a mobile app) to gain access. This significantly reduces the risk of successful credential theft.

##### 4.3.3. Implement Account Lockout Policies to Prevent Brute-Force Attacks

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Define Lockout Threshold:** Configure an account lockout policy that automatically locks user accounts after a certain number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 5-10 failed attempts).
    *   **Lockout Duration:** Set a lockout duration (e.g., 15-30 minutes) after which the account is automatically unlocked, or require administrator intervention to unlock the account.
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting:**  In addition to account lockout, implement rate limiting on login attempts from the same IP address to further slow down brute-force attacks and make them less effective.
*   **Rationale:** Account lockout policies and rate limiting effectively mitigate brute-force attacks by making it computationally infeasible for attackers to try a large number of password combinations within a reasonable timeframe.

##### 4.3.4. Regularly Monitor Login Attempts for Suspicious Activity

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Centralized Logging:** Implement centralized logging for all Locust Web UI login attempts, including successful and failed attempts, timestamps, usernames, and source IP addresses.
    *   **Automated Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up automated monitoring and alerting rules to detect suspicious login activity, such as:
        *   Multiple failed login attempts from the same user or IP address within a short period.
        *   Login attempts from unusual geographic locations (if applicable).
        *   Login attempts outside of normal working hours.
        *   Successful logins from previously unknown IP addresses.
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System:**  Consider integrating Locust Web UI logs with a SIEM system for more advanced security monitoring, correlation, and incident response capabilities.
*   **Rationale:** Proactive monitoring and alerting enable early detection of credential theft attempts.  Security teams can investigate suspicious activity, identify potential breaches, and take timely remediation actions to prevent further damage.

##### 4.3.5. Additional Mitigation Recommendations

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within the Locust Web UI. Grant users only the minimum necessary privileges required for their roles. Avoid granting administrative privileges unnecessarily.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Locust Web UI to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including weaknesses in authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Keep Locust and Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Locust and its dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories and promptly apply security updates.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Locust Web UI within a secure internal network segment, limiting access from untrusted networks or the public internet. Use firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to authorized users and systems.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the Locust Web UI to protect against common web attacks, including brute-force attacks, credential stuffing attempts, and other web-based vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Review and harden the Locust Web UI configuration to ensure secure settings are in place. Disable any unnecessary features or functionalities that could increase the attack surface.
*   **Educate Users:**  Educate users about the importance of strong passwords, password security best practices, and the risks of password reuse. Provide training on how to use password managers and recognize phishing attempts.

By implementing these comprehensive mitigation actions, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of credential theft targeting the Locust Web UI and protect their Locust infrastructure and sensitive data.  A layered security approach, combining strong authentication, access controls, monitoring, and proactive security measures, is essential for robust defense.
