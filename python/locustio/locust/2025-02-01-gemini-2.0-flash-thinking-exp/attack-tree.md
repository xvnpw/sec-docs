## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Target Application via Locust [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_target_application_via_locust__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching goal.  Success at any of the sub-nodes contributes to achieving this goal.  It's critical because it represents the ultimate objective of the attacker and encompasses all the identified high-risk attack vectors related to Locust.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Locust Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_locust_functionality__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers leverage the intended functionalities of Locust (load generation, request crafting) for malicious purposes. This is a critical node because it directly exploits the core purpose of Locust to attack the target application.
*   **High-Risk Paths branching from this node:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Excessive Request Volume:** Locust is designed to generate high traffic. Attackers can configure Locust to send overwhelming volumes of requests to the target application, causing service disruption.
            *   **Resource Exhaustion Attacks:**  Attackers can use Locust to target specific resource-intensive endpoints, sending crafted requests that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth), leading to service degradation or failure.
        *   **Mitigation Actions:**
            *   Implement robust rate limiting and traffic shaping mechanisms.
            *   Ensure infrastructure scalability to handle high traffic volumes.
            *   Optimize resource usage and implement resource quotas.
            *   Deploy anomaly detection systems to identify and respond to DoS/DDoS attacks.
    *   **Injection Attacks (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection, etc.) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Parameter Manipulation in Locust Scripts:** Locust scripts allow full control over request parameters. Attackers can craft scripts to inject malicious payloads into parameters, targeting injection vulnerabilities in the target application (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
            *   **Header Manipulation in Locust Scripts:** Locust scripts can modify HTTP headers. Attackers can inject malicious payloads into headers, targeting header-based injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Mitigation Actions:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data (parameters and headers) on the target application.
            *   Adhere to secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
            *   Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block common injection attacks.
            *   Conduct regular security testing, focusing on injection vulnerabilities under load.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Locust Web UI Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_locust_web_ui_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  The Locust Web UI, while intended for internal use, can be a point of vulnerability. Compromising it can provide attackers with control over Locust and potentially access to sensitive information or further attack vectors.
*   **High-Risk Paths branching from this node:**
    *   **Credential Theft for Web UI Access [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Default or Weak Credentials:**  Using default or easily guessable credentials for the Locust Web UI. Attackers can exploit these weak credentials through brute-force attacks or by simply using default login information.
            *   **Credential Stuffing:** If credentials used for the Locust Web UI are reused across other services, attackers might use stolen credentials from other breaches to gain access.
        *   **Mitigation Actions:**
            *   Enforce strong and unique passwords for all Locust Web UI users.
            *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Web UI access.
            *   Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
            *   Regularly monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Locust Infrastructure [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_locust_infrastructure__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Compromising the infrastructure hosting Locust (servers, dependencies) can give attackers significant control and the ability to launch attacks against the target application or other systems. This is a critical node because it represents a broader compromise beyond just Locust itself.
*   **High-Risk Paths branching from this node:**
    *   **Compromise Locust Host System [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **OS Vulnerabilities on Locust Server:** Unpatched operating systems or software on the Locust server can contain known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access.
            *   **Misconfiguration of Locust Server:**  Incorrect or insecure configurations of the Locust server (e.g., exposed ports, weak permissions, insecure services) can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
        *   **Mitigation Actions:**
            *   Keep the Locust server OS and all software up-to-date with security patches.
            *   Harden the Locust server configuration following security best practices (disable unnecessary services, configure firewalls, implement least privilege).
            *   Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans of the Locust server infrastructure.
            *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems on the Locust server.
