# Threat Model Analysis for locustio/locust

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Locust Web UI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_locust_web_ui.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Locust Web UI

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Locust web interface, typically through weak or default credentials, brute-force attacks, or exploiting a vulnerability in the web UI's authentication mechanism. The attacker can then start, stop, modify, or monitor load tests.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized initiation of denial-of-service attacks against the target application.
        *   Manipulation of test parameters to skew results or cause unintended behavior.
        *   Exposure of test data and potentially sensitive information about the target application.
        *   Potential for the attacker to use the compromised Locust instance as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Locust Master Node (Web UI and control logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for the web UI.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for web UI access.
        *   Regularly rotate credentials.
        *   Restrict network access to the Locust master node using firewalls or network segmentation.
        *   Use HTTPS for the web UI to encrypt communication and prevent credential sniffing.
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks.
        *   Regularly update Locust to the latest version to patch any security vulnerabilities in the web UI.

## Threat: [Locustfile Tampering](./threats/locustfile_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Locustfile Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the Locustfile (Python script) to inject malicious code, alter test parameters, or change the target application. This could be done by gaining unauthorized access to the source code repository, compromising a developer's machine, or exploiting a vulnerability in the system where Locustfiles are stored.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary code on the Locust worker nodes.
        *   Unintentional or malicious denial-of-service attacks.
        *   Data exfiltration from the target application or the Locust environment.
        *   Skewed or invalid test results.
        *   Targeting of unintended systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Locustfile (Python script), potentially affecting both Master and Worker Nodes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store Locustfiles in a secure, version-controlled repository (e.g., Git) with strict access controls.
        *   Implement code review and approval processes for all changes to Locustfiles.
        *   Use code signing or checksum verification to ensure the integrity of the Locustfile before execution.
        *   Regularly audit Locustfiles for unauthorized modifications.
        *   Limit the permissions of the user account running Locust to the minimum necessary.
        *   Consider using a dedicated, isolated environment for executing Locust tests.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs/Reports](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logsreports.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs/Reports

    *   **Description:** The Locustfile interacts with sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords, PII) during the test, and this data is inadvertently logged or included in test reports. An attacker with access to these logs or reports could gain access to this sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of user accounts or API keys.
        *   Data breaches and privacy violations.
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Legal and regulatory consequences.
    *   **Affected Component:** Locust Master Node (logging and reporting), Worker Nodes (if logs are stored locally).  Potentially affects `log` module and any custom logging within the Locustfile.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in Locustfiles. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Sanitize logs and reports to remove or redact sensitive information.  Use regular expressions or custom filtering to identify and remove sensitive data patterns.
        *   Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures to monitor and prevent the leakage of sensitive data.
        *   Use parameterized requests and avoid logging raw request/response bodies if they contain sensitive data.  Log only necessary information.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
        *   Implement strict access controls to logs and reports.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Locust Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_locust_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Locust Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Locust itself or one of its dependencies (e.g., a vulnerable Python library) to gain unauthorized access to the master or worker nodes, execute arbitrary code, or escalate privileges.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the Locust environment.
        *   Potential for the attacker to pivot to other systems.
        *   Data exfiltration.
        *   Execution of arbitrary code.
    *   **Affected Component:** Locust Master Node, Worker Nodes, any vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Locust and all its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.  Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.
        *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in the Locust environment.
        *   Run Locust with the least necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root or with administrative privileges.
        *   Use a containerized environment (e.g., Docker) to isolate Locust from the host system and limit the impact of potential exploits.
        *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing of the Locust environment.
