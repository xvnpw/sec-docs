# Attack Surface Analysis for locustio/locust

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Locust Web UI/API](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_locust_web_uiapi.md)

*   **Description:**  Unprotected access to the Locust web interface or its underlying REST API allows attackers to control load tests.
*   **How Locust Contributes:** Locust *provides* the web UI and API for managing tests; this is a core Locust component, and its insecurity is a direct Locust-related risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses `http://locust-master:8089` without credentials and starts a massive load test against a production system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) against the target application.
    *   Unauthorized data access (viewing test results, potentially including sensitive data).
    *   Manipulation of test parameters, leading to inaccurate results.
    *   Disruption of legitimate testing activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication (e.g., basic auth, OAuth, LDAP integration) for both the web UI and API.  Use strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Authorization:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit user privileges within the Locust UI/API.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the Locust master node (where the UI/API runs) using firewalls and network segmentation.  Do not expose it directly to the public internet.
    *   **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication with the Locust UI/API, protecting credentials and data in transit.
    *   **API Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the API to prevent abuse and potential DoS attacks against the Locust master itself.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all API inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Worker Node Compromise](./attack_surfaces/worker_node_compromise.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers gaining control of Locust *worker nodes*, which execute the load test scripts.
*   **How Locust Contributes:** Locust's *distributed architecture* relies on worker nodes; their compromise is a direct consequence of using Locust's distributed model. While the *vulnerability* might be in the OS, the *attack vector* is through Locust's architecture.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system of a worker node and installs malware.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Lateral movement within the network from the compromised worker.
    *   Modification of test scripts to inject malicious code or alter test behavior.
    *   Data exfiltration from the worker node or the target system.
    *   Use of worker resources for malicious purposes (e.g., cryptocurrency mining).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Isolation:** Run worker nodes in isolated environments (containers, VMs) with minimal privileges (least privilege principle).
    *   **Hardening:** Harden the operating system and software on worker nodes.  Apply security patches promptly.
    *   **Secure Communication:** Use secure communication channels (SSH, TLS) between the master and worker nodes.
    *   **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication for accessing worker nodes (e.g., SSH keys).
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor worker node activity for suspicious behavior.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (e.g., cgroups) to prevent a compromised worker from consuming excessive resources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Test Scripts](./attack_surfaces/insecure_test_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the Python *test scripts* themselves (e.g., hardcoded credentials, command injection).
*   **How Locust Contributes:** Locust *executes* these user-provided Python scripts; the vulnerability exists *because* Locust runs this code. This is a direct attack surface of Locust's core functionality.
*   **Example:** A test script contains a hardcoded API key, which is exposed when the script is compromised or leaked.  Or, a script uses `os.system()` with unsanitized user input, leading to command injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive information (credentials, API keys).
    *   Execution of arbitrary code on worker nodes.
    *   Data breaches if the script interacts with sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines for Python.  Avoid hardcoding credentials; use environment variables or secure configuration management.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs and external data used in test scripts.  Validate data types and formats.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of test scripts to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (linters, security scanners) to detect potential security issues in the Python code.
    *   **Avoid `eval()`/`exec()`:** Avoid using `eval()` or `exec()` with untrusted input.
