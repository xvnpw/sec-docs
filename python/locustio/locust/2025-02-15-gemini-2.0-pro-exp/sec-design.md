# BUSINESS POSTURE

Locust is an open-source load testing tool. The business priorities likely revolve around:

*   Providing a reliable and scalable tool for developers and performance engineers.
*   Maintaining an active and engaged open-source community.
*   Ensuring the tool is easy to use and extend.
*   Supporting a wide range of use cases and protocols (though HTTP is the primary focus).
*   Keeping the codebase maintainable and well-documented.

Given that Locust is an open-source project, the business risks are somewhat different from a commercial product. Key risks include:

*   Loss of community interest and contributions.
*   Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited in user environments (since Locust executes user-provided code).
*   Lack of maintainability leading to stagnation.
*   Competition from other open-source or commercial load testing tools.
*   Reputational damage due to security issues or poor performance.
*   Inability to scale to meet the needs of large-scale load tests.

# SECURITY POSTURE

*   security control: The project uses GitHub for code hosting, which provides some inherent security features like access control and audit logs. (Described in GitHub repository)
*   security control: The project appears to use linters (flake8) to enforce code style and potentially catch some basic errors. (Described in .github/workflows/tests.yml)
*   security control: The project has a suite of unit and integration tests. (Described in .github/workflows/tests.yml)
*   security control: The project uses a continuous integration (CI) system (GitHub Actions) to automate testing. (Described in .github/workflows/tests.yml)
*   accepted risk: Locust executes arbitrary Python code provided by the user. This is inherent to its design and is a known, accepted risk. Users are responsible for the security of the code they execute within Locust.
*   accepted risk: Locust, by default, doesn't enforce secure communication (HTTPS) between the master and worker nodes. This is left to the user's configuration and deployment environment.
*   accepted risk: Locust's web UI does not enforce authentication by default.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the web UI to mitigate XSS risks.
*   security control: Provide clear documentation and warnings about the security implications of running user-provided code.
*   security control: Offer options/guidance for securing communication between master and worker nodes (e.g., using TLS).
*   security control: Offer built-in authentication mechanisms for the web UI, or provide clear instructions for integrating with existing authentication systems.
*   security control: Regularly perform static analysis (SAST) and dependency vulnerability scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Consider implementing a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for releases.
*   security control: Develop and publish a security policy outlining vulnerability reporting procedures.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The web UI should offer optional authentication mechanisms to restrict access.
    *   Consider supporting common authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
*   Authorization:
    *   If authentication is implemented, authorization should control access to specific features and data within the web UI.
    *   Consider role-based access control (RBAC).
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user-provided input in the web UI and through configuration files should be validated to prevent injection attacks.
    *   User-provided Locust scripts (Python code) are inherently trusted, but the framework should provide mechanisms to help users write secure code (e.g., input sanitization libraries).
*   Cryptography:
    *   Communication between master and worker nodes should be encrypted using TLS if sensitive data is being transmitted or if the environment is untrusted.
    *   Sensitive data stored by Locust (if any) should be encrypted at rest.
*   Session Management:
    *   If authentication is implemented, secure session management practices should be followed (e.g., using secure, HTTP-only cookies, proper session timeouts).

## DEPLOYMENT

Locust can be deployed in various ways:

1.  **Local Machine:** Running Locust directly on a developer's machine.
2.  **Dedicated Servers:** Deploying Locust master and worker processes on dedicated servers (physical or virtual).
3.  **Docker Containers:** Running Locust master and worker processes within Docker containers.
4.  **Kubernetes:** Deploying Locust as a distributed system within a Kubernetes cluster.

We'll describe the Kubernetes deployment in detail, as it's the most complex and scalable option.

## BUILD

Locust's build process is primarily managed through GitHub Actions, as defined in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Pushes code" --> GitHubRepo["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHubRepo -- "Triggers" --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs linters (flake8)" --> Linting["Linting"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs tests" --> Tests["Tests (pytest)"]
    Linting -- "Reports results" --> BuildResult["Build Result"]
    Tests -- "Reports results" --> BuildResult
    GitHubActions -- "Builds package" --> Package["Package (Wheel/sdist)"]
    Package -- "Published to" --> PyPI["PyPI (Python Package Index)"]
```

*   The build process is triggered by pushes to the repository.
*   GitHub Actions runs linters (flake8) to check code style.
*   GitHub Actions runs tests using pytest.
*   The build process creates Python packages (wheel and sdist).
*   Packages are typically published to PyPI (Python Package Index).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Linting (flake8) helps enforce code style and potentially catch some errors.
*   security control: Automated tests (pytest) help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: GitHub Actions provides a controlled and auditable build environment.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Integrate SAST tools (e.g., Bandit, Snyk) into the GitHub Actions workflow to scan for security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Integrate dependency scanning tools (e.g., pip-audit, Dependabot) to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.
*   security control: Sign releases uploaded to PyPI to ensure their integrity.
*   security control: Implement SBOM generation as part of the build process.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Providing a functional and reliable load testing tool.
    *   Maintaining an active open-source community.
*   Data to Protect:
    *   Locust itself doesn't handle highly sensitive data directly. The primary concern is the *user-provided Locust scripts* and the *target system's data*.
    *   User-provided scripts might contain credentials or other sensitive information for interacting with the target system. (Sensitivity: Potentially High, depending on the user's code)
    *   The target system's data is accessed *by* Locust, but not stored *by* Locust. (Sensitivity: Depends entirely on the target system)
    *   Test results (performance metrics) are generated by Locust, but these are generally not considered highly sensitive. (Sensitivity: Low)
    *   Locust Web UI access credentials (if authentication is enabled). (Sensitivity: Medium)

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) that apply to the use of Locust or the systems being tested?
    *   What is the expected scale of Locust deployments (number of users, requests per second)?
    *   What are the specific security concerns of the users of Locust?
    *   What level of support is provided for securing communication between master and worker nodes?
    *   Is there a formal process for handling security vulnerabilities reported in Locust?

*   Assumptions:
    *   Users are responsible for the security of their Locust scripts and the target systems they test.
    *   The primary threat model involves malicious or poorly written user scripts, and vulnerabilities in the Locust framework itself.
    *   The deployment environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster) is configured securely.
    *   Users are aware of the risks associated with running unauthenticated web UIs and unencrypted communication.
    *   The project prioritizes maintainability and community contributions.
    *   The project has limited resources for implementing complex security features.
