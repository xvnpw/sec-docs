# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for locustio/locust

## Mitigation Strategy: [Gradual Ramp-Up and Monitoring (Locust Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/gradual_ramp-up_and_monitoring__locust_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Locustfile Configuration:** Within your `locustfile.py`, use Locust's features to control the ramp-up behavior:
    *   `wait_time`: Use `wait_time` functions (e.g., `between`, `constant`, `constant_pacing`) to simulate realistic user behavior and avoid overwhelming the system immediately.  Start with longer wait times.
    *   `users`:  Start with a small number of users (e.g., `users = 1`).
    *   `spawn_rate`:  Start with a low spawn rate (e.g., `spawn_rate = 1`).
2.  **Command-Line Arguments:** When running Locust, use command-line arguments to control the test:
    *   `-u` or `--users`:  Specify the initial number of users.
    *   `-r` or `--spawn-rate`: Specify the number of users to spawn per second.
    *   `-t` or `--run-time`:  Set a maximum run time for the test (e.g., `-t 10m` for 10 minutes).  This prevents runaway tests.
3.  **Headless Mode (for Automation):**  Use `--headless` to run Locust without the web UI, especially for automated tests.  This reduces the attack surface.  Combine with `--csv` to output results to CSV files for later analysis.
4.  **Custom Ramp-Up (Advanced):**  For more complex ramp-up scenarios, you can write custom logic within your `locustfile.py` to dynamically adjust the number of users and spawn rate based on time or performance metrics.  This requires using Locust's event hooks (e.g., `init`, `test_start`, `test_stop`).
5. **Stop Test Functionality:** Implement a mechanism within your Locust script or externally to gracefully stop the test if certain conditions are met (e.g., error rate exceeds a threshold). Locust provides `self.environment.runner.quit()` for this purpose within the script.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Accidental Denial of Service (DoS) / DDoS (Severity: High):** Allows controlled scaling of load, preventing sudden spikes that could overwhelm the target system.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS/DDoS:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (in staging/test environment).

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Basic `wait_time` is used.  Command-line arguments are used for `-u`, `-r`, and `-t`.  No custom ramp-up logic.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   More sophisticated use of `wait_time` functions to mimic realistic user behavior.
*   Implementation of custom ramp-up logic based on performance feedback (advanced).
*   Implementation of a stop test mechanism based on error thresholds.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Sensitive Data (Locust Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_sensitive_data__locust_scripts_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Environment Variables:**  *Never* hardcode sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens) directly in your `locustfile.py`.  Instead, store them as environment variables on the machine running Locust.
2.  **Access in Script:**  Access environment variables within your Locust script using `os.environ.get('YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME')`.  For example:
    ```python
    import os
    from locust import HttpUser, task, between

    class MyUser(HttpUser):
        wait_time = between(1, 3)

        def on_start(self):
            self.api_key = os.environ.get("MY_API_KEY")
            if not self.api_key:
                raise Exception("MY_API_KEY environment variable not set!")

        @task
        def my_task(self):
            headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"}
            self.client.get("/my-protected-endpoint", headers=headers)
    ```
3.  **Secrets Management (Integration):**  Integrate with a secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) if higher security is required.  This typically involves:
    *   Installing the appropriate client library for your chosen secrets manager.
    *   Authenticating to the secrets manager within your `locustfile.py` (using environment variables or other secure methods for *its* credentials).
    *   Retrieving secrets from the secrets manager using its API.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data (Severity: High):** Prevents credentials from being exposed in code repositories, logs, or the Locust web UI.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Environment variables are used for *some* credentials, but not consistently. No secrets management integration.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of environment variables for *all* sensitive data.
*   Implementation of secrets management integration (e.g., with HashiCorp Vault).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Locust and Dependency Updates](./mitigation_strategies/locust_and_dependency_updates.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Regular Updates:**  Regularly update Locust itself to the latest version using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade locust
    ```
2.  **Dependency Management:** Use a tool like `pipenv` or `poetry` to manage your project's dependencies, including Locust. This helps ensure consistent versions and simplifies updates.
    *   **Pipenv Example:**
        ```bash
        pipenv update locust  # Update Locust
        pipenv update       # Update all dependencies
        ```
    *   **Poetry Example:**
        ```bash
        poetry update locust # Update Locust
        poetry update      # Update all dependencies
        ```
3. **Virtual Environment:** Use virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Locust Web UI Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium):**  Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in older versions of the Locust web UI.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium to High):** Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Locust.

**Impact:**
*   **Web UI Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from Medium/High to Low.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Locust is updated occasionally, but not on a regular schedule. No consistent dependency management tool.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Establish a regular schedule for checking and updating Locust.
*   Implement a dependency management tool (`pipenv` or `poetry`).
*   Use virtual environment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Locust Web UI (Locust Operation)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_locust_web_ui__locust_operation_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Headless Mode:** For automated tests or CI/CD pipelines, run Locust in headless mode:
    ```bash
    locust -f your_locustfile.py --headless -u 100 -r 10 -t 10m --csv=results
    ```
    This disables the web UI entirely, eliminating a potential attack vector.
2.  **Network Restrictions (External):**  Use network-level access controls (firewalls, security groups) to restrict access to the Locust web UI port (default: 8089) to authorized users and machines *only*. This is crucial if not running in headless mode.
3. **Authentication (via Reverse Proxy):** If you need to expose the web UI more broadly, use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) with authentication configured. Locust itself does *not* provide built-in authentication. This is an external mitigation, but directly impacts Locust's security posture.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Locust Web UI Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium):** Prevents unauthorized access to the web UI, reducing the risk of exploitation.

**Impact:**
*   **Web UI Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Headless mode is *not* consistently used. Network restrictions are in place, but could be stricter. No reverse proxy with authentication.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of headless mode for automated tests.
*   Stricter network access controls.
*   Implementation of a reverse proxy with authentication (if broader web UI access is required).
