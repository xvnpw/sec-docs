### 5. Threats Mitigated (Deep Dive)

*   **Security Vulnerabilities in Locust Dependencies (High Severity):**
    *   **Deep Dive:** Locust relies on various Python packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies (e.g., Flask, gevent, requests) can be exploited to compromise the Locust process or the system it runs on.  High severity because dependency vulnerabilities are common, often easily exploitable, and can have wide-ranging impacts.  Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies are also a growing concern.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** Vulnerability scanning of dependencies using tools like `safety` or `OWASP Dependency-Check` is highly effective in identifying known vulnerabilities. Regular scanning and prompt patching are crucial.
*   **Operating System Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Deep Dive:** The operating system running Locust (Linux, Windows, macOS) can have vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause denial of service. Medium severity because OS vulnerabilities are less directly related to Locust's core functionality but still represent a significant attack surface. Exploitation often requires more system-level access compared to dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** OS vulnerability scanners like OpenVAS or Nessus are effective in identifying OS-level vulnerabilities. Regular patching of the OS is essential.
*   **Container Image Vulnerabilities (if using containers for Locust) (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Deep Dive:** If Locust is containerized (e.g., Docker), vulnerabilities in the base image or packages installed within the container image can be exploited. Medium severity, similar to OS vulnerabilities, as container image vulnerabilities are a layer removed from the core Locust application but still expose a potential attack surface. Container images often contain OS components and dependencies, inheriting their vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** Container image scanners like Trivy or Grype are specifically designed to identify vulnerabilities in container images. Regularly rebuilding container images with updated base images and dependencies is crucial.

### 6. Impact (Risk Reduction)

*   **Security Vulnerabilities in Locust Dependencies: High Risk Reduction:** Addressing dependency vulnerabilities provides a high level of risk reduction because it directly targets a common and often easily exploitable attack vector.
*   **Operating System Vulnerabilities: Medium Risk Reduction:** Mitigating OS vulnerabilities reduces the overall attack surface of the Locust environment, contributing to a more secure system.
*   **Container Image Vulnerabilities (if using containers for Locust): Medium Risk Reduction:** Scanning and securing container images reduces the risk associated with containerized deployments, enhancing the security of the containerized Locust environment.
