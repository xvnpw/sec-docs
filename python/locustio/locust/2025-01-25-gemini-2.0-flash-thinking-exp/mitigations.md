    *   Lack of Script Provenance: Low Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Locust scripts in Git with version control.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalize branching/merging for Locust scripts. Consistent tagging of Locust script releases. Define code ownership more clearly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization for Locust UI/API](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization_for_locust_uiapi.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication for Locust UI/API:** Enable authentication for Locust web UI and API (username/password, API keys, OAuth).
    2.  **Implement Authorization for Locust UI/API:** Implement authorization to control access to Locust UI/API features based on roles.
    3.  **HTTPS for Locust UI/API Communication:** Enforce HTTPS for all Locust UI/API communication.
    4.  **Session Management for Locust UI:** Implement secure session management for Locust web UI.
    5.  **Regularly Review Access Controls for Locust UI/API:** Review authentication/authorization for Locust UI/API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Locust UI/API: High Severity - No auth for Locust UI/API allows unauthorized control.
    *   Data Exposure via UI/API: Medium Severity - Unauthorized Locust UI/API access can lead to data leaks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Locust UI/API: High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Exposure via UI/API: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Basic username/password auth for Locust web UI in staging.

*   **Missing Implementation:** API access for Locust is unauthenticated. HTTPS not consistently enforced for Locust UI/API. Robust authorization (RBAC) needed for Locust.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation for Locust UI/API](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation_for_locust_uiapi.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Segment Locust Network:** Deploy Locust UI/API in a segmented network, isolated from public and production networks.
    2.  **Firewall Rules for Locust UI/API:** Configure firewalls to restrict network access to Locust UI/API.
    3.  **VPN Access (Optional) for Locust UI/API:** Require VPN for external access to Locust UI/API.
    4.  **Network Monitoring for Locust UI/API:** Monitor network traffic to/from Locust UI/API for unauthorized activity.
    5.  **Regularly Review Network Segmentation for Locust:** Review network segmentation and firewall rules for Locust UI/API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Locust UI/API from External Networks: High Severity - Public Locust UI/API is vulnerable.
    *   Lateral Movement from Compromised UI/API: Medium Severity - Network segmentation limits attacker movement from Locust UI/API.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Locust UI/API from External Networks: High Risk Reduction
    *   Lateral Movement from Compromised UI/API: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Locust in logically segmented network, firewalls could be stricter.

*   **Missing Implementation:** More granular firewall rules for Locust UI/API. Enforce VPN for external Locust UI/API access. Network monitoring for Locust UI/API traffic needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deployment of Locust](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deployment_of_locust.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Deployment Pipeline for Locust:** Implement secure pipeline for Locust deployment with security checks.
    2.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Locust Deployment:** Use IaC to manage Locust infrastructure securely and repeatably.
    3.  **Immutable Infrastructure (Optional) for Locust:** Consider immutable infrastructure for Locust deployments.
    4.  **Least Privilege Deployment Accounts for Locust:** Use least privilege accounts to deploy Locust.
    5.  **Security Audits of Locust Deployment Process:** Audit Locust deployment process for security weaknesses.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromise during Deployment: Medium Severity - Insecure Locust deployment can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   Configuration Errors during Deployment: Medium Severity - Error-prone Locust deployment causes misconfigurations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise during Deployment: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Configuration Errors during Deployment: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Basic automated Locust deployment pipeline, limited security checks.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Enhance security checks in Locust deployment pipeline. Fully implement IaC for Locust deployment. Consider immutable infrastructure for Locust. Regular security audits of Locust deployment.
