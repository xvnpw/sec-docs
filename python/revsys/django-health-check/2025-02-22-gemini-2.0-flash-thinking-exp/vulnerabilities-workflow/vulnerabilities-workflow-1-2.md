- **Vulnerability Name:** Public Health Check Endpoint Information Disclosure

  - **Description:**  
    An unauthenticated health check interface is exposed at the `/ht/` endpoint. An external attacker can send a specially crafted GET request (for example, with the query parameter `format=json`) and receive a JSON response that contains detailed status messages from various internal health‐check plugins. These messages are generated by each plugin’s `pretty_status()` method and may include internal error messages (e.g. “Integrity Error”, “Database error”, “ServiceUnavailable” errors, etc.). The report is constructed directly from the plugins without sanitization, which could divulge details about the underlying internal systems, mis-configured storage backends, database issues, or task queue errors.

  - **Impact:**  
    - An attacker can collect in-depth information about internal components of the system.  
    - Sensitive error details or configuration indicators (such as plugin names and specific error texts) may expose weaknesses that can be leveraged in further attacks (for example, targeting the database, cache, or messaging systems).  
    - The disclosure of internal error messages can assist a threat actor in performing reconnaissance to craft more targeted exploits.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The project follows a “fail‑fast” health check design where errors are collected and output in the response.  
    - The endpoints were intentionally left open to support the use case of external monitoring.  
    - There is no mechanism at the code level that restricts access or sanitizes internal error details from the response.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - **Access Control:** No authentication or IP‐whitelisting is applied to the health check endpoints.  
    - **Error Sanitization:** The responses directly relay error messages from each health check plugin without filtering out sensitive internal information.  
    - **Output Filtering:** There is no option to limit the detail level (or to return generic “working”/“failure” indicators) when errors occur.  
    - **Rate Limiting:** Although not directly exploited here, no measures exist to limit repeated requests that might further aid an attacker’s reconnaissance.

  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The `/ht/` (or `/ht/?format=json`) endpoint is publicly accessible (as recommended by the project README for monitoring purposes).  
    - At least one underlying health check plugin has encountered an error or is returning status details (for example, due to a misconfigured database or messaging service).  
    - The system is deployed in a production environment where the default error strings are not replaced by generic messages.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In **`health_check/views.py`** within the `MainView.get` method, the code retrieves the HTTP Accept header (or a format override via a query parameter) and then calls `self.filter_plugins(subset=subset)` to obtain all registered health check plugins.  
    - When a JSON response is demanded, the method calls `render_to_response_json`, which builds a JSON object mapping each plugin’s identifier to the result of its `pretty_status()` method.  
    - The `pretty_status()` method in **`health_check/backends.py`** formats error messages by simply joining error strings with newline characters without sanitization.  
    - Because no processing is done to remove or generalize internal error details, an external GET request (with `Accept: application/json` or `format=json`) will return all plugin status messages verbatim.

  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application (with the health check endpoints enabled as configured in the project README).  
    2. From an external client, send a GET request to the public endpoint—for example:  
       `curl -X GET "http://[target-domain]/ht/?format=json"`  
    3. Observe that the JSON response contains key/value pairs where keys represent the identifier of each registered health check plugin (e.g. `"DatabaseBackend"`, `"Cache backend: default"`, etc.) and values reflect their status (including detailed error messages if any).
    4. Verify that at least one of these error messages includes internal details (such as specific exception types or error phrases) that could reveal sensitive information about the backend systems.
    5. Conclude that an attacker can directly obtain internal system details without any access control or output sanitization in place.
