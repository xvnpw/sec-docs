### Vulnerability List for django-summernote

- Vulnerability Name: Unrestricted File Upload leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Remote Code Execution (RCE)

- Description:
    1. An attacker can access the `/summernote/upload_attachment/` URL, which is intended for uploading attachments for the Summernote editor.
    2. The server-side validation for uploaded files in the `SummernoteUploadAttachment` view relies on Django's `forms.ImageField`.
    3. `forms.ImageField` performs basic image validation, but it can be bypassed by uploading specially crafted files that are valid images or appear to be valid images but contain malicious payloads.
    4. For example, an attacker can create an SVG file with embedded JavaScript and upload it.
    5. If the server is configured to serve media files (attachments) as static files and allows direct access, when a user views content containing the uploaded (malicious) file, the malicious payload (e.g., JavaScript in SVG) can be executed in their browser, leading to XSS.
    6. In a more severe scenario, if the server is misconfigured to execute certain file types in the media directory, uploading server-side executable files could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

- Impact:
    - High: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or information theft.
    - High to Critical (depending on server configuration): Remote Code Execution (RCE) - If the server is misconfigured to execute files in the media directory, an attacker might be able to upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Basic image validation using Django's `forms.ImageField` in `UploadForm`. This offers some protection against uploading non-image files but is not robust against sophisticated attacks.
    - File size limit (`attachment_filesize_limit`) which can limit the impact but not prevent the vulnerability.
    - Option to require user authentication for uploads (`attachment_require_authentication`), which reduces the attack surface to authenticated users but does not eliminate the vulnerability.
    - `test_func_upload_view` setting allows for custom authorization logic, but default configuration might not implement sufficient checks.
    - `bleach` library is used in `SummernoteTextFormField` and `SummernoteTextField` to sanitize editor content, but this does not directly mitigate the file upload vulnerability itself, as it applies to the content of the editor, not the uploaded files.
    - X-Frame-Options header is set to `SAMEORIGIN` for the upload view using `@method_decorator(xframe_options_sameorigin)`, mitigating clickjacking on the upload endpoint itself.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Robust file type validation: Implement more thorough file validation beyond `forms.ImageField`. This could include:
        - Magic number checks to verify file type based on content.
        - Using libraries that deeply inspect file content to ensure they are truly images and do not contain embedded malicious code (e.g., for SVG, check for `<script>` tags or event handlers).
        - Whitelisting allowed file types explicitly instead of relying on potentially bypassable image validation.
    - Input sanitization of uploaded filenames: While `uploaded_filepath` prevents path traversal during storage, sanitizing filenames could prevent issues if filenames are later used in a way that could be vulnerable to path traversal during retrieval or display.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed, which can mitigate the impact of XSS if malicious scripts are uploaded and served.
    - Clear security guidelines and warnings in documentation: Emphasize the security risks of unrestricted file uploads and the importance of secure server configuration for media files. Recommend best practices for validating file uploads and securing media directories.

- Preconditions:
    - `disable_attachment` setting is set to `False` (attachment feature is enabled).
    - Server is configured to serve media files as static files and allows direct access to the media directory (common in development and some production setups if not properly secured).
    - No additional custom file validation is implemented beyond the default `forms.ImageField` in the application using django-summernote.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`django_summernote/views.py` - `SummernoteUploadAttachment.post` method:**
        ```python
        def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            # ...
            if not request.FILES.getlist('files'):
                return JsonResponse({
                    'status': 'false',
                    'message': _('No files were requested'),
                }, status=400)

            for file in request.FILES.getlist('files'):
                form = UploadForm(
                    files={
                        'file': file,
                    }
                )
                if not form.is_valid():
                    # ... error handling ...
        ```
        This code snippet shows that the `UploadForm` is used to validate uploaded files.

    2. **`django_summernote/forms.py` - `UploadForm`:**
        ```python
        from django import forms
        try:
            from PIL import Image  # noqa: F401
            FIELD = forms.ImageField
        except ImportError:
            FIELD = forms.FileField


        class UploadForm(forms.Form):
            file = FIELD(required=True)
        ```
        Here, `UploadForm` uses `forms.ImageField` if PIL (Pillow) is installed, otherwise it falls back to `forms.FileField`. `forms.ImageField` provides basic image validation.

    3. **`django/forms/fields.py` (Django source code) - `ImageField`:**
        `ImageField` in Django uses PIL/Pillow to attempt to open the uploaded file as an image and validate its format. However, this validation is not sufficient to prevent uploading files that are valid image formats but also contain malicious payloads.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare a malicious SVG file:** Create a file named `malicious.svg` with the following content:
        ```xml
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability in django-summernote");</script>
        </svg>
        ```
        Rename this file to `malicious.png` to potentially bypass basic extension-based checks.

    2. **Access the Django application with django-summernote integrated.** You can use the provided `djs_playground` project for testing.

    3. **Navigate to a page where the Summernote editor is used.** For example, in `djs_playground`, you can access the admin panel and edit a `Post` or `Author` model that uses Summernote. Alternatively, use the provided `index` view in `djs_playground`.

    4. **In the Summernote editor toolbar, locate the "Image" upload button and click it.**

    5. **Upload the `malicious.png` file.** The upload should be successful as `forms.ImageField` might consider this a valid (though potentially corrupted or crafted) image.

    6. **Insert the uploaded image into the editor content.**

    7. **Save the content in the Summernote editor.**

    8. **View the saved content in a browser outside of the editor (e.g., on the public-facing frontend or by viewing the saved content in the admin panel).**

    9. **Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability in django-summernote" appears.** If the alert box appears, it confirms that the JavaScript code embedded in the SVG file was executed, demonstrating a successful XSS attack due to the unrestricted file upload vulnerability.

    10. **To further test potential HTML upload:** Create a file named `malicious.html` with the following content:
        ```html
        <html>
        <body>
        <h1>Malicious HTML File</h1>
        <script>alert("HTML Upload Test");</script>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
        Rename it to `malicious_html.png`. Upload this file using the same steps as above. After upload, try to directly access the file via its media URL (you can find the URL in the JSON response after upload or by inspecting the saved attachment in the admin). If accessing this URL in the browser executes the JavaScript alert or renders the HTML, it further confirms the unrestricted file upload risk.
