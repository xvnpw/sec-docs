- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload via Attachment Endpoint Due to Inadequate File Type Validation

  - **Description:**
    An external attacker can exploit the file upload endpoint to store arbitrary files on the server. In a deployment where the Pillow library (used for image validation) is missing, the upload form falls back from an image field (which validates file content) to a plain file field. In addition, the default configuration does not require users to be authenticated for uploading attachments. As a result, an attacker can send a specially crafted POST request to the `/summernote/upload_attachment/` endpoint with a non‐image file (for example, a PHP script or another executable payload). The file will pass validation, be saved in the publicly accessible media directory, and later be accessed (and potentially executed) by the attacker.

  - **Impact:**
    An attacker may use this vulnerability to upload and host arbitrary files on the server. If the webserver is misconfigured (for example, if it allows executing files from the media directory), this can lead to remote code execution, complete compromise of the application, defacement of the website, or even lateral movement within the hosting environment.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - When Pillow is installed, the upload form (`UploadForm` in `django_summernote/forms.py`) uses Django’s `ImageField` to enforce basic image validation.
    - The file upload process enforces a file size limit (controlled by the `attachment_filesize_limit` configuration).
    - The attachment upload feature can be completely disabled via configuration (using `disable_attachment`).

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no backup file type validation or MIME type checking independent of Pillow. In environments where Pillow is not installed, the fallback to `FileField` permits *any* file type.
    - The default configuration (with `attachment_require_authentication` set to False) allows unauthenticated users to upload attachments. A stricter access control or verification (for instance, enforcing authentication and/or server‐side MIME type validation) is missing.
    - Additional verification (using file signature analysis or third‐party libraries for content inspection) is not implemented.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed in an environment where the Pillow library is not installed (causing the fallback in `UploadForm` from `ImageField` to `FileField`).
    - The Summernote attachment feature is enabled (i.e. `disable_attachment` is set to False).
    - The configuration does not require user authentication for uploads (i.e. `attachment_require_authentication` is False by default).
    - The media directory is publicly accessible and the webserver does not apply restrictive execution policies on its content.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In **`django_summernote/forms.py`**:
      - The code first tries to import Pillow by executing
        `from PIL import Image`
        and, if successful, assigns
        `FIELD = forms.ImageField`
        which validates that uploaded files are genuine images.
      - If Pillow is missing (raising an ImportError), the code instead assigns
        `FIELD = forms.FileField`
        which does not perform any image-specific validation.
    - In **`django_summernote/views.py`** (inside the `SummernoteUploadAttachment.post` method):
      - The endpoint collects files from `request.FILES.getlist('files')` and processes each one by instantiating an `UploadForm` with the file data.
      - Without Pillow installed, the form uses `FileField` and therefore does not confirm that the uploaded file is a valid image.
      - The attachment is saved via the Attachment model (which uses Django’s standard file handling) and its URL is constructed based on the file’s storage location.
    - Together, these code paths mean that if Pillow is absent and no additional file validation is implemented, an attacker can bypass file type restrictions.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prepare the Environment:**
       - Set up a test deployment of the application without the Pillow library installed.
       - Confirm that `attachment_require_authentication` is set to False and `disable_attachment` is False in the configuration.
    2. **Craft the Malicious Request:**
       - Create a dummy non‐image file (for example, a PHP script or executable text file with malicious payload).
       - Prepare a POST request targeting `/summernote/upload_attachment/` with the file attached under the parameter name `files`. (An HTTP client such as cURL or Postman can be used for this purpose.)
    3. **Execute the Request:**
       - Send the crafted POST request.
       - Verify that the HTTP response returns a status code of 200 and includes a JSON response containing details of the uploaded file (e.g., its name, URL, and size).
    4. **Verify the Exploit:**
       - Access the returned file URL using a web browser to confirm that the file was successfully stored.
       - Optionally, check if the file content is accessible and whether any execution of the file’s payload is possible.
    5. **Conclusion:**
       - If the non‐image file is accepted and stored without proper validation, the vulnerability is confirmed.
