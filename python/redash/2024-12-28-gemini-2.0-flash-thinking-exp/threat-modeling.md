Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Redash application:

**Threat:** Compromised Data Source Credentials

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the stored credentials for a connected data source within Redash. This could happen through exploiting vulnerabilities in Redash's storage mechanisms, gaining access to the Redash server's file system or database, or through social engineering targeting Redash users or administrators. The attacker could then use these credentials to directly access and manipulate the data source outside of Redash.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the connected data source, potential data breaches, data modification or deletion, and the ability to perform malicious actions on the data source.
*   **Affected Component:** Data Source Connection Management module, specifically the functions responsible for storing and retrieving data source credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt data source credentials at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
    *   Implement robust access controls and the principle of least privilege for data source connections within Redash.
    *   Regularly audit access to data source credentials.
    *   Consider using secrets management solutions to store and manage sensitive credentials instead of relying solely on Redash's internal storage.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing the Redash server and its underlying infrastructure.

**Threat:** SQL/NoSQL Injection via Redash

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL or NoSQL queries through the Redash interface, exploiting insufficient input sanitization or lack of parameterized queries within Redash's query execution logic. This could be done through the query editor, API endpoints that accept query parameters, or even through manipulated visualization configurations that lead to dynamically generated, vulnerable queries. The malicious query is then executed against the connected data source *by Redash*.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches by accessing unauthorized data, data modification or deletion on the connected data source, potential for remote code execution on the database server (depending on database permissions and vulnerabilities), and denial of service on the data source.
*   **Affected Component:** Query Runner module, specifically the functions responsible for executing queries against data sources. API endpoints that accept query parameters. Visualization rendering logic if it dynamically generates queries.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements within Redash's codebase to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided input that is used in query construction within Redash.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the Redash user connecting to the data sources, limiting the actions it can perform.
    *   Regularly review and audit queries created and executed through Redash.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules to detect and block common injection attempts targeting Redash.

**Threat:** Unauthorized Data Source Access due to Permission Model Flaws

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations *within Redash's* permission model allow users to access data sources or execute queries they are not authorized to *within the Redash application*. This could be due to flaws in role-based access control (RBAC) implementation in Redash, bypassable permission checks in Redash's code, or default insecure configurations of Redash's permission system.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data *through Redash*, potential data leaks visible within the Redash interface, and the ability for unauthorized users to execute queries and potentially modify data via Redash.
*   **Affected Component:** User Management and Permissions module within Redash, specifically the functions responsible for assigning and enforcing permissions on data sources and queries.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and configure Redash's permission model to ensure it aligns with the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit user permissions and roles within Redash.
    *   Implement granular permissions for data sources and queries within Redash.
    *   Ensure that default permissions are restrictive and require explicit granting of access within Redash.
    *   Keep Redash updated to patch any known vulnerabilities in its permission model.

**Threat:** Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Queries

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts queries *through the Redash interface* that are intentionally designed to consume excessive resources on the connected data sources, leading to performance degradation or denial of service for legitimate users of both Redash and the underlying data sources. This exploitation relies on Redash allowing the execution of such resource-intensive queries.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service on the connected data sources, performance degradation for Redash users, and potential instability of the Redash instance itself if it becomes overloaded trying to manage the resource-intensive queries.
*   **Affected Component:** Query Runner module within Redash, specifically the functions responsible for executing queries.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query execution timeouts *within Redash* to prevent long-running queries from consuming excessive resources.
    *   Monitor data source performance and identify potentially problematic queries executed through Redash.
    *   Educate users on writing efficient queries *within the context of Redash*.
    *   Consider implementing query cost analysis or resource limits *within Redash* or the connected data sources.
    *   Implement rate limiting on query execution *within Redash*.

**Threat:** Malicious JavaScript in Visualizations

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into visualizations *within Redash*. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in Redash's visualization rendering engine, manipulating visualization configurations stored within Redash, or through compromised user accounts with the ability to create or modify visualizations in Redash. The malicious script could then be executed in the browsers of users viewing the visualization *within the Redash application*.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing the attacker to steal session cookies for the Redash application, redirect users to malicious websites from within Redash, or perform actions on behalf of the user within the Redash application.
*   **Affected Component:** Visualization rendering module within Redash, specifically the components responsible for handling and rendering custom visualizations or allowing user-defined JavaScript.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided content in visualizations *within Redash*.
    *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources when viewing Redash, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   Regularly update Redash to patch any known XSS vulnerabilities in its visualization rendering engine.
    *   Limit the ability to embed arbitrary JavaScript in visualizations within Redash or carefully review and sandbox any such functionality.

**Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Redash API

*   **Description:** Security flaws exist in the Redash API endpoints, allowing attackers to bypass authentication *to the Redash API*, access sensitive data *managed by Redash*, or perform unauthorized actions *on the Redash application itself*. This could include vulnerabilities like insecure direct object references (IDOR), broken authentication to the API, or lack of authorization checks on API endpoints.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to Redash functionality and data, potential for data breaches of information managed by Redash (e.g., user data, query definitions), and the ability to manipulate Redash configurations or user accounts.
*   **Affected Component:** Redash API endpoints and the underlying logic they execute.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and penetration test the Redash API for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing and maintaining the Redash API.
    *   Keep Redash updated to patch any known API vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement rate limiting and input validation on API endpoints to prevent abuse.

**Threat:** Insecure Celery Worker Configuration

*   **Description:** If Redash uses Celery for background tasks, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the Celery setup *within the Redash deployment* could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the Redash server. This exploitation targets the way Redash utilizes Celery.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Redash server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches of data accessible by the Redash server, and the ability to use the server for malicious purposes.
*   **Affected Component:** Celery worker processes and their configuration *within the Redash deployment*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the Celery broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) with strong authentication and access controls.
    *   Enable message signing and encryption for Celery tasks to prevent tampering and eavesdropping.
    *   Keep Celery and its dependencies updated to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for the user running the Celery worker processes.
    *   Restrict access to the Celery broker to authorized Redash components.

**Threat:** Weak Authentication Mechanisms

*   **Description:** Redash relies on weak or outdated authentication methods *for accessing the Redash application itself*, making user accounts vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or other forms of credential compromise targeting Redash user accounts.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Redash user accounts, allowing attackers to view sensitive data within Redash, execute queries, and potentially modify Redash configurations.
*   **Affected Component:** User authentication module within Redash.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for Redash users, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and password rotation.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Redash user accounts.
    *   Use strong and up-to-date password hashing algorithms within Redash.
    *   Implement account lockout policies within Redash to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Consider integrating Redash with a centralized identity provider for authentication.
