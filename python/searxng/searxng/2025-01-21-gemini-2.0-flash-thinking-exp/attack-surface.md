# Attack Surface Analysis for searxng/searxng

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Search Results](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_search_results.md)

- **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into search results returned by external search engines and then rendered in the user's browser within the context of your application.
    - **How SearXNG Contributes:** SearXNG fetches and displays content from various external sources without necessarily sanitizing all potentially malicious scripts embedded within the results.
    - **Example:** A malicious actor compromises a website indexed by a search engine. When a user searches for a related term through your application using SearXNG, the compromised website's listing contains malicious JavaScript that executes in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to phishing sites.
    - **Impact:** User session hijacking, credential theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application interface.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement robust Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        - Sanitize and escape HTML content received from SearXNG before rendering it in the user's browser. Consider using a library specifically designed for this purpose.
        - Isolate the rendering of search results within a secure context, such as an iframe with restricted permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Proxy Functionality](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_proxy_functionality.md)

- **Description:** An attacker can manipulate SearXNG's proxy functionality to make requests to internal resources or external services that the attacker would not normally have access to.
    - **How SearXNG Contributes:** SearXNG can act as a proxy to fetch content from external websites. If not properly restricted, an attacker could control the destination URL.
    - **Example:** An attacker crafts a search query that forces SearXNG to fetch content from an internal network resource (e.g., `http://internal-server/admin`) or an external service with unintended consequences.
    - **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems, denial of service against internal or external services.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Disable the proxy functionality in SearXNG if it's not a required feature for your application.
        - Implement a strict whitelist of allowed destination URLs or IP address ranges for the proxy.
        - Sanitize and validate URLs provided to SearXNG's proxy functionality.
        - Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via SearXNG Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_searxng_configuration.md)

- **Description:** Insecurely configured SearXNG instances can expose sensitive information such as API keys for external search engines or internal network details.
    - **How SearXNG Contributes:** SearXNG requires configuration to interact with external services. If these configuration files are not properly secured, they can become a target.
    - **Example:** SearXNG's `settings.yml` file, containing API keys for accessing search engines, is accidentally exposed through the web server or has overly permissive file permissions.
    - **Impact:** Compromise of API keys, unauthorized access to external services, information disclosure about the application's infrastructure.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Store sensitive configuration data (like API keys) securely, preferably using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
        - Ensure that SearXNG's configuration files are not accessible through the web server and have appropriate file permissions.
        - Regularly review and audit SearXNG's configuration settings.
