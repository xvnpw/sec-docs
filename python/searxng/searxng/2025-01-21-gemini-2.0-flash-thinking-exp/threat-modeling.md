# Threat Model Analysis for searxng/searxng

## Threat: [Malicious Search Engine Responses](./threats/malicious_search_engine_responses.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise a search engine that SearXNG uses or manipulate network traffic to inject malicious content into search results returned *to SearXNG*. This could involve injecting links to phishing sites, malware downloads, or scripts that exploit vulnerabilities in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Users of the application could be redirected to malicious websites, tricked into revealing sensitive information, or have their systems infected with malware.

**Affected Component:** `search_utils.py` (responsible for fetching and processing search results), potentially the frontend if it directly renders unsanitized results *from SearXNG*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize SearXNG's built-in features for blocking or prioritizing specific search engines based on trust and reliability.
*   Consider using a content security policy (CSP) in the application's frontend to mitigate the risk of injected scripts *originating from SearXNG's output*.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** SearXNG relies on various Python libraries and other dependencies. Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the SearXNG instance. This could involve remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server running SearXNG.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the SearXNG instance, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or the ability to manipulate search results.

**Affected Component:** The entire SearXNG installation, particularly the `requirements.txt` file and the environment where SearXNG is running.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update SearXNG and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
*   Implement a vulnerability scanning process for the SearXNG environment and its dependencies.
*   Use virtual environments or containerization (like Docker) to isolate SearXNG and its dependencies.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for SearXNG and its dependencies to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on SearXNG](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_searxng.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the SearXNG project's infrastructure or development process, leading to the distribution of backdoored or malicious versions of SearXNG.

**Impact:**  Widespread compromise of applications using the affected SearXNG version, potentially leading to significant data breaches and system compromise.

**Affected Component:** The entire SearXNG codebase and distribution channels.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Monitor the SearXNG project for any signs of compromise or unusual activity.
*   Verify the integrity of SearXNG releases using checksums or digital signatures.
*   Consider using a reputable and well-maintained fork of SearXNG if concerns arise about the main project's security.
