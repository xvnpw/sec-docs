## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SearXNG Vulnerabilities (High Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_searxng_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Goal:** Directly compromise the SearXNG instance to gain control or access sensitive information.
*   **Why High Risk:** This path represents direct exploitation of weaknesses in SearXNG, often leading to severe consequences. It's a critical node as it's a primary entry point for many severe attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection (High Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection__high_risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Goal:** Execute arbitrary code on the SearXNG server.
*   **Why High Risk:** Successful code injection allows the attacker to gain complete control over the SearXNG server. It's a critical node due to the severity of the impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code into template expressions that are processed by the server-side templating engine. This can be done through crafted search queries or manipulated preferences if they are rendered using templates.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the SearXNG server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Python Code Injection in custom settings or plugins (if enabled) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/python_code_injection_in_custom_settings_or_plugins__if_enabled___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious Python code into custom settings or plugins if such functionality is enabled and lacks proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary Python code on the SearXNG server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Goal:**  Make the SearXNG server send requests to unintended locations, either within the internal network or to external services.
*   **Why High Risk:** Allows attackers to probe internal systems, access internal APIs, and potentially launch attacks on other services, leveraging SearXNG as a proxy.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate SearXNG to access internal network resources](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_searxng_to_access_internal_network_resources.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting URLs or parameters that force SearXNG to make requests to internal IP addresses or hostnames.
*   **Impact:** Scanning internal ports, accessing internal APIs, retrieving sensitive data from internal systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Goal:** Exploit known security flaws in the third-party libraries used by SearXNG.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Common vulnerabilities in dependencies can be easily exploited if not patched. It's a critical node because successful exploitation often leads to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit known vulnerabilities in SearXNG's dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_searxng's_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in SearXNG's dependencies using available exploits.
*   **Impact:** Gaining Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other forms of compromise on the SearXNG server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate SearXNG Functionality (High Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_searxng_functionality__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Goal:** Abuse the intended functionality of SearXNG to compromise the application or its users.
*   **Why High Risk:** This path exploits the trust users place in the search functionality and can directly impact their security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Search Results Injection (High Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_search_results_injection__high_risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Goal:** Inject malicious content into the search results displayed to users.
*   **Why High Risk:** This can directly compromise users interacting with the application through the injected content. It's a critical node because it directly targets application users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious JavaScript into search results (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_into_search_results__cross-site_scripting_-_xss___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the search results returned by SearXNG. This can happen if SearXNG doesn't properly sanitize the content received from upstream search engines.
*   **Impact:** Stealing user credentials for the application (session cookies, etc.), redirecting users to malicious websites, performing actions on behalf of users without their consent.
