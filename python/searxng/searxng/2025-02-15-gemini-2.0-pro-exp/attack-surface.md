# Attack Surface Analysis for searxng/searxng

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Engine Responses](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_engine_responses.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in SearXNG's parsing of responses from external search engines. This is the *primary* attack vector specific to SearXNG.
*SearXNG Contribution:* SearXNG's core function is to aggregate results from numerous, potentially untrusted, search engines. It *must* parse diverse and complex data formats (HTML, JSON, etc.) from these engines, making it inherently vulnerable to malformed or malicious responses.
*Example:* A compromised search engine returns a specially crafted JSON response containing deeply nested objects designed to cause a stack overflow or excessive memory consumption during parsing, leading to a denial-of-service or potentially code execution.
*Impact:* Code execution on the SearXNG server (most severe), data exfiltration, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (if code execution is possible) or **High** (for DoS or information disclosure).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use robust, well-vetted parsing libraries with built-in defenses against common parsing vulnerabilities (e.g., defenses against excessive nesting, buffer overflows, etc.). Prioritize libraries with strong security track records.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* parsing. Reject responses that exceed size limits, contain unexpected characters, or violate expected data structures.  This is *crucial* for mitigating this attack vector.
        *   Employ comprehensive fuzz testing specifically targeting the parsing logic for *each* supported search engine. This is essential to uncover subtle parsing bugs.
        *   Implement resource limits (strict timeouts, maximum response sizes) for *each* individual engine request.  These limits should be configurable and enforced rigorously.
        *   Consider sandboxing or containerizing the engine interaction components (e.g., using separate processes or containers for each engine) to limit the impact of a successful exploit to a single engine. This is a more advanced mitigation.
        *   Regularly update *all* dependencies, especially parsing libraries, to patch known vulnerabilities.  Automate this process if possible.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Use a curated list of trusted search engines.  Avoid adding unknown or untrusted engines, especially those with poor security reputations. This is the *most important* user-level mitigation.
        *   Regularly review the configured search engines and remove any that are no longer needed, trusted, or actively maintained.
        *   Monitor the SearXNG instance for unusual activity (high CPU/memory usage, unexpected network connections, errors in logs) that might indicate an attempted exploit.

## Attack Surface: [2. Engine Configuration Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/2__engine_configuration_manipulation.md)

*Description:* Unauthorized modification of SearXNG's engine configuration to add malicious engines or alter existing engine settings, *specifically leveraging SearXNG's engine management features*.
*SearXNG Contribution:* SearXNG provides a mechanism for users/administrators to configure which search engines are used.  The security of this configuration mechanism is paramount because it directly controls which external services SearXNG interacts with.
*Example:* An attacker gains access to the SearXNG administrative interface (e.g., through a weak password or a separate vulnerability) and adds a new search engine that points to a malicious server under their control. This server then returns malicious search results.
*Impact:* Injection of malicious content into search results, data exfiltration (search queries could be sent to the attacker), potential for further attacks (the malicious engine could be used as a stepping stone).
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the administrative interface. *Require* strong passwords and strongly recommend (or enforce) multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege: only grant users the minimum necessary permissions to manage engine configurations.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* engine configuration parameters (URLs, API keys, etc.). Prevent the addition of engines pointing to localhost or internal network addresses.
        *   Implement comprehensive audit logging of *all* changes to the engine configuration, including the user who made the change, the timestamp, and the specific changes made.
        *   Consider implementing a mechanism to verify the integrity of engine definitions (e.g., checksums or digital signatures) to detect tampering.
        *   Provide a "safe mode" or a default configuration with a pre-vetted list of trusted engines.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for the administrative interface, and enable multi-factor authentication if available.
        *   Regularly review the engine configuration and remove any unauthorized, suspicious, or unnecessary entries.  Be *extremely* cautious about adding new engines.
        *   Enable and monitor audit logs for unauthorized access or configuration changes. Look for any unexpected modifications.
        *   Restrict access to the administrative interface to trusted networks or IP addresses using firewall rules or other network security controls.

## Attack Surface: [3. Plugin-Based Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__plugin-based_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in SearXNG plugins, which extend SearXNG's core functionality.
*SearXNG Contribution:* The plugin system allows for customization and extension, but any added code increases the attack surface. SearXNG's plugin architecture determines how plugins interact with the core and what resources they can access.
*Example:* A malicious or poorly-written plugin is installed that contains a vulnerability allowing it to read arbitrary files from the server or execute system commands.
*Impact:* Code execution, data exfiltration, cross-site scripting (XSS), denial of service. The impact depends heavily on the plugin's capabilities and the nature of the vulnerability.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Provide *very* clear guidelines and security best practices for plugin developers, emphasizing secure coding practices and input validation.
        *   Implement a plugin sandboxing mechanism (if feasible) to limit the impact of a compromised plugin. This could involve running plugins in separate processes with restricted privileges or using containerization.
        *   Consider a plugin review process or a vetting system before allowing plugins to be listed in a public repository or marketplace.
        *   Provide a clear and easy-to-use mechanism for users to report vulnerable plugins.
        *   Regularly audit the core plugin API to ensure it doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities or allow plugins to bypass security restrictions. The API should enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   *Only* install plugins from trusted sources (e.g., official repositories or well-known developers). Avoid installing plugins from unknown or untrusted websites.
        *   Carefully review the permissions requested by a plugin *before* installing it. Be wary of plugins that request excessive permissions.
        *   Regularly update installed plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Remove any plugins that are no longer needed or trusted.
        *   Monitor the SearXNG instance for unusual activity that might indicate a compromised plugin.
