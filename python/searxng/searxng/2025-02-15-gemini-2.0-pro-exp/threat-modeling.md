# Threat Model Analysis for searxng/searxng

## Threat: [Query Manipulation to Leak User Data to Untrusted Engines](./threats/query_manipulation_to_leak_user_data_to_untrusted_engines.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious search queries that exploit a vulnerability in SearXNG's query parsing or engine selection logic.  This causes the query, or parts of it, to be sent to unintended search engines, including those not configured or those known to be malicious/tracking-heavy. The attacker might use specially crafted characters, URL encoding tricks, or exploit known vulnerabilities in specific engine plugins.
*   **Impact:** User search queries, potentially revealing sensitive information, are leaked to untrusted third parties. This compromises user privacy and could lead to tracking, profiling, or even targeted attacks.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `searx.search.search` (core search logic)
    *   `searx.engines` (engine selection and interaction)
    *   Individual engine plugins (e.g., `searx.engines.google`, `searx.engines.duckduckgo`, etc.)
    *   `searx.search.processors` (query pre- and post-processing)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided search queries.  Reject or escape any characters that could be used to manipulate engine selection or query routing.  Use a whitelist approach where possible, allowing only known-safe characters.
    *   **Engine Whitelisting:** Enforce a strict whitelist of allowed search engines in `settings.yml`.  Do not allow dynamic engine selection based on user input.
    *   **Regular Expression Hardening:** If regular expressions are used for query parsing or engine selection, ensure they are carefully crafted to avoid ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities and to prevent unintended matching.
    *   **Engine Plugin Auditing:** Regularly audit the code of all enabled engine plugins for vulnerabilities, especially those related to query handling and external communication.
    *   **Update SearXNG:** Keep SearXNG and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malformed Queries (DoS)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malformed_queries__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of complex or malformed queries designed to consume excessive resources on the SearXNG server. This could involve queries that trigger a large number of requests to external engines, queries that result in very large responses, or queries that exploit vulnerabilities in SearXNG's parsing or processing logic.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service. The SearXNG instance becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.  This could also lead to increased costs if the server is hosted on a metered platform.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `searx.search.search` (core search logic)
    *   `searx.engines` (engine interaction)
    *   `searx.webapp` (web application framework)
    *   System resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement robust rate limiting on incoming requests, both globally and per IP address.  Use a library like `limits` to manage rate limits effectively.
    *   **Query Complexity Limits:** Impose limits on the complexity of search queries, such as the maximum number of terms, the maximum length of the query, and the maximum number of enabled engines.
    *   **Timeout Configuration:** Configure reasonable timeouts for all external requests to search engines in `settings.yml`.  Prevent long-running requests from tying up resources.
    *   **Response Size Limits:** Set limits on the maximum size of responses accepted from external engines in `settings.yml`.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts for unusual activity.
    *   **Caching:** Utilize SearXNG's caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to reduce the number of requests to external engines.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider deploying a WAF in front of SearXNG to help mitigate DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/plugin_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a SearXNG plugin (either a built-in plugin or a third-party plugin). This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or disrupt the service. The vulnerability could be in the plugin's query handling, result parsing, or interaction with external services.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to complete server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Specific vulnerable plugin (e.g., `searx.engines.example_vulnerable_plugin`)
    *   Potentially other components if the vulnerability allows for code execution or privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible), High (otherwise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Source Verification:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (e.g., the official SearXNG repository or well-known community repositories).
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review the code of any third-party plugins before installing them. Look for potential security vulnerabilities, such as insecure input handling, improper use of external libraries, or lack of authentication/authorization.
    *   **Plugin Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions.  Subscribe to security advisories for any plugins you use.
    *   **Plugin Isolation:** If possible, run plugins in a sandboxed environment to limit their access to the rest of the system. (This is not a built-in feature of SearXNG and would require significant custom development.)
    *   **Disable Unused Plugins:** Disable any plugins that are not actively being used. This reduces the attack surface.

## Threat: [Data Exposure via Misconfigured Custom Engines](./threats/data_exposure_via_misconfigured_custom_engines.md)

*   **Description:** If custom engines are used to access internal data sources, a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the engine could expose sensitive data. An attacker might craft queries that bypass access controls or exploit vulnerabilities in the engine's interaction with the data source.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of internal data, potentially including confidential information, user data, or system configuration details.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Custom engine implementation (e.g., a Python script or module)
    *   `searx.engines` (engine interaction)
    *   The internal data source itself
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom engines.  Pay close attention to input validation, output encoding, authentication, and authorization.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the custom engine has only the minimum necessary permissions to access the internal data source.
    *   **Input Validation (Again):** Implement strict input validation within the custom engine to prevent attackers from injecting malicious queries or commands.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the code and configuration of custom engines for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Data Source Security:** Ensure that the internal data source itself is properly secured, with appropriate access controls and authentication mechanisms.
