## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Flood with a large number of concurrent requests, exceeding SearXNG's connection pool limits.](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_flood_with_a_large_number_of_concurrent_requests__exceeding_searxng's_connection_pool_limits.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends a massive number of requests to the SearXNG instance simultaneously.  This overwhelms the server's ability to handle new connections, leading to a denial of service.  SearXNG uses a connection pool to manage connections to backend search engines.  If this pool is exhausted, new requests will be delayed or rejected.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (service outage)
*   **Effort:** Low (if using a botnet), Medium (if using a single source)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (high traffic volume is easily noticeable)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust rate limiting at the network level (e.g., using a firewall or reverse proxy like Nginx).
    *   Configure appropriate connection pool limits in SearXNG's settings.  These limits should be based on the server's resources and expected traffic.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious traffic patterns.
    *   Implement connection queuing and graceful degradation to handle overload situations.
    *   Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and set alerts for unusual activity.
    *   Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute traffic and absorb some of the load.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Enable debug logging that exposes query parameters.](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_enable_debug_logging_that_exposes_query_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**  SearXNG, like many applications, has a debug logging mode.  If this mode is accidentally (or maliciously) enabled in a production environment, sensitive information, including user search queries, may be written to log files.  An attacker who gains access to these logs can then exfiltrate this data.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High (sensitive data exposure)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if logs are accessible)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable debug logging in production environments.** This is the most crucial step.
    *   Regularly review configuration files to ensure that debug logging is not enabled.
    *   Implement strict access controls on log files.  Only authorized personnel should be able to read them.
    *   Use a centralized logging system with proper security controls.
    *   Consider using log redaction techniques to automatically remove sensitive information from log entries.
    *   Monitor log file access for unauthorized attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.3 Weak or default credentials for administrative interfaces.](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_3_weak_or_default_credentials_for_administrative_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:**  If the SearXNG instance has an administrative interface (which it does), and this interface is protected by weak or default credentials, an attacker can easily gain access.  This allows them to change settings, disable security features, exfiltrate data, and manipulate search results.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High (full control of the instance)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if credentials are unchanged)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Change default credentials immediately after installation.** This is a fundamental security practice.
    *   Use strong, unique passwords for all administrative accounts.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access, if possible.
    *   Restrict access to the administrative interface to specific IP addresses or networks.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.
    *   Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity (e.g., multiple failed login attempts).

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1 Use multiple IP addresses (proxy, botnet).](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1_use_multiple_ip_addresses__proxy__botnet_.md)

*   **Description:** Many security measures, such as rate limiting, rely on identifying and blocking individual IP addresses.  An attacker can circumvent these measures by using multiple IP addresses, either through a proxy server, a botnet (a network of compromised computers), or other techniques like IP spoofing (though IP spoofing is less effective against modern defenses).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (allows bypassing rate limits)
*   **Effort:** Low (if using a botnet), Medium (if setting up proxies)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires analyzing IP address patterns)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting that considers factors beyond just the IP address, such as user agents, request patterns, and behavioral analysis.
    *   Use CAPTCHAs to distinguish between human users and bots.
    *   Employ IP reputation services to identify and block known malicious IP addresses.
    *   Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns, such as a large number of requests from geographically dispersed locations within a short period.
    *   Use a WAF to detect and block botnet traffic.
    *   Implement GeoIP blocking to restrict access from specific countries or regions, if appropriate.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.3.1 Brute-force or dictionary attacks against weak passwords.](./attack_tree_paths/4_3_1_brute-force_or_dictionary_attacks_against_weak_passwords.md)

*   **Description:** If SearXNG instance has authentication enabled, and users have chosen weak passwords, an attacker can use automated tools to try many different password combinations until they find the correct one. Dictionary attacks use lists of common passwords, while brute-force attacks try all possible combinations.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (allows unauthorized access)
*   **Effort:** Low (with automated tools)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires monitoring login attempts)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies: require minimum length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and prohibit common passwords.
    *   Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    *   Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Rate limit login attempts.
    *   Monitor login attempts and alert on suspicious activity (e.g., many failed logins from the same IP).
    *   Educate users about the importance of strong passwords.
