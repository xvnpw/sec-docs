Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Query Manipulation to Leak User Data to Untrusted Engines" threat.

## Deep Analysis: Query Manipulation to Leak User Data

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanisms by which an attacker could manipulate search queries in SearXNG to leak user data to untrusted search engines.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and the potential impact of successful exploitation.  The ultimate goal is to refine and strengthen the existing mitigation strategies and propose new ones if necessary.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of SearXNG:

*   **Query Parsing and Processing:**  How SearXNG receives, parses, sanitizes (or fails to sanitize), and transforms user input before sending it to search engines.
*   **Engine Selection Logic:**  The mechanisms by which SearXNG determines which search engines to use for a given query, and how this process can be manipulated.
*   **Engine Plugin Interactions:**  How individual engine plugins handle user queries and interact with external search engine APIs, focusing on potential vulnerabilities within these interactions.
*   **Configuration (settings.yml):** How configuration settings related to engine selection and security can impact the vulnerability.
*   **Relevant Code Components:**  Specifically, the code within `searx.search.search`, `searx.engines`, individual engine plugins (e.g., `searx.engines.google`), and `searx.search.processors`.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the SearXNG source code, focusing on the components identified in the scope.  This will involve searching for potential vulnerabilities related to input validation, sanitization, regular expression usage, and engine selection logic.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Using automated tools (fuzzers) to send a large number of malformed and unexpected inputs to a running SearXNG instance.  This will help identify potential crashes, unexpected behavior, or data leaks that might not be apparent during code review.
3.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Examining the dependencies of SearXNG (libraries and frameworks) for known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to achieve query manipulation.
4.  **Configuration Review:**  Analyzing the default and recommended configurations of SearXNG to identify settings that could increase or decrease the risk of this threat.
5.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development (if feasible):**  Attempting to create a working exploit that demonstrates the vulnerability.  This will provide concrete evidence of the threat and help validate mitigation strategies.
6. **Review of Existing Bug Reports and CVEs:** Searching for any previously reported vulnerabilities or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) related to query manipulation or data leakage in SearXNG or its dependencies.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Attack Vectors and Potential Vulnerabilities:**

Based on the threat description and the SearXNG architecture, the following attack vectors and vulnerabilities are considered:

*   **Engine Parameter Injection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  If SearXNG allows user input to directly influence the parameters passed to engine plugins (e.g., through URL parameters or special characters in the search query), an attacker could inject parameters that force the query to be sent to an unintended engine.
    *   **Example:**  A query like `!g !badengine mysecret` might be misinterpreted, causing `mysecret` to be sent to `badengine` if `!badengine` is not properly handled or if the engine selection logic is flawed.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how engine-specific bangs (`!g`, `!ddg`, etc.) are parsed and how parameters are passed to the `query()` method of engine plugins.
    *   **Fuzzing Target:**  Send queries with various combinations of valid and invalid engine bangs, special characters, and URL-encoded data.

*   **Category Manipulation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** If categories are used to select engines, and user input can influence the selected category, an attacker could force the use of engines associated with a different, potentially malicious, category.
    *   **Example:** A crafted query that manipulates a hidden category parameter or exploits a vulnerability in category selection logic.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Analyze the `searx.search.search.search()` function and how it uses categories to filter engines.
    *   **Fuzzing Target:**  Send queries designed to manipulate category selection, potentially through URL parameters or hidden form fields.

*   **Regular Expression (ReDoS) and Bypass:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Poorly crafted regular expressions used for query parsing or engine selection can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service (ReDoS) or to bypass intended filtering.  An attacker could craft a query that triggers excessive backtracking in the regular expression engine, consuming server resources.  Alternatively, a carefully crafted query might bypass a regular expression intended to prevent engine injection.
    *   **Example:**  A regular expression designed to match valid engine bangs might be vulnerable to a ReDoS attack or might have an edge case that allows an attacker to inject an unintended engine.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Identify all regular expressions used in `searx.search.search`, `searx.engines`, and individual engine plugins.  Analyze them for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities and bypasses using tools like Regex101 and specialized ReDoS checkers.
    *   **Fuzzing Target:**  Send queries with long, complex strings designed to trigger ReDoS vulnerabilities in regular expressions.

*   **Engine Plugin Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Individual engine plugins might contain vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to manipulate the query or leak data.  This could include improper input validation, insecure handling of external API calls, or vulnerabilities in the parsing of search results.
    *   **Example:**  A plugin might not properly escape special characters before sending them to the external search engine, allowing for injection attacks against the search engine itself (which could then leak data back to the attacker).
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Thoroughly audit the code of all enabled engine plugins, paying close attention to how they handle user input and interact with external APIs.
    *   **Fuzzing Target:**  Send queries specifically designed to target the vulnerabilities of individual engine plugins.

*   **URL Encoding and Decoding Issues:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Inconsistent or incorrect handling of URL encoding and decoding can lead to misinterpretation of user input and potential engine injection.
    *   **Example:**  Double-URL-encoded characters might bypass input validation and be decoded later in the process, allowing for injection of malicious parameters.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how URL encoding and decoding are handled throughout the query processing pipeline.
    *   **Fuzzing Target:**  Send queries with various combinations of URL-encoded and double-URL-encoded characters.

*   **Logic Errors in Engine Selection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Even without direct injection, subtle logic errors in the engine selection process could lead to unintended engine usage.  This could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases, unexpected interactions between different parts of the code, or flaws in the implementation of the engine selection algorithm.
    *   **Example:**  A bug in the code that prioritizes engines might cause a lower-priority, untrusted engine to be used instead of a higher-priority, trusted engine.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Carefully analyze the engine selection logic in `searx.search.search` and `searx.engines`, looking for potential logic errors and edge cases.
    *   **Fuzzing Target:**  Send a wide variety of queries, including those with unusual combinations of keywords, bangs, and categories, to try to trigger unexpected engine selection behavior.

**2.2 Impact Analysis:**

The impact of a successful query manipulation attack is significant:

*   **Privacy Violation:**  User search queries, which can contain highly sensitive information (personal data, financial details, medical information, etc.), are leaked to untrusted third parties.
*   **Tracking and Profiling:**  The leaked queries can be used to track user behavior, build detailed profiles, and target them with personalized advertising or even malicious content.
*   **Targeted Attacks:**  The leaked information could be used to launch targeted attacks against the user, such as phishing attacks or social engineering schemes.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  If a SearXNG instance is compromised and used to leak user data, it can damage the reputation of the instance operator and erode user trust.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Depending on the nature of the leaked data and the applicable laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), the instance operator could face legal and financial penalties.

**2.3 Refined Mitigation Strategies:**

In addition to the existing mitigation strategies, the following refinements and additions are recommended:

*   **Enhanced Input Validation:**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Implement a strict whitelist of allowed characters for search queries.  This is the most secure approach, as it only allows known-safe characters and rejects everything else.
    *   **Character Encoding Enforcement:**  Enforce a consistent character encoding (e.g., UTF-8) throughout the entire query processing pipeline to prevent encoding-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Length Limits:**  Impose reasonable length limits on search queries to mitigate ReDoS attacks and prevent excessively large inputs.
    *   **Structured Input:** Consider using a structured input format (e.g., a JSON object with specific fields for keywords, categories, and engines) instead of a free-form text field. This would make it more difficult for attackers to inject malicious parameters.

*   **Strengthened Engine Selection:**
    *   **Static Engine Configuration:**  Completely disallow dynamic engine selection based on user input.  All enabled engines should be explicitly configured in `settings.yml`.
    *   **Engine Sandboxing:**  Explore the possibility of running engine plugins in isolated environments (e.g., containers or sandboxes) to limit their access to the main SearXNG process and the underlying system. This would mitigate the impact of vulnerabilities in individual plugins.
    *   **Engine Selection Audit Logging:**  Implement detailed logging of engine selection decisions, including the query, the selected engines, and the reason for the selection. This would help identify and investigate potential attacks.

*   **Regular Expression Security:**
    *   **ReDoS Prevention:**  Use ReDoS-safe regular expression libraries or techniques (e.g., atomic grouping, possessive quantifiers) to prevent ReDoS attacks.
    *   **Regular Expression Testing:**  Thoroughly test all regular expressions with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and known ReDoS patterns.

*   **Engine Plugin Security:**
    *   **Security Guidelines for Plugin Developers:**  Provide clear security guidelines for developers of engine plugins, emphasizing the importance of input validation, secure API interactions, and vulnerability reporting.
    *   **Mandatory Code Review:**  Require mandatory code review for all new engine plugins and updates to existing plugins, focusing on security aspects.

*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use automated vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) to identify and track known vulnerabilities in SearXNG's dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep all dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Security Hardening:**
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which could be used in conjunction with query manipulation attacks.
    *   **HTTP Security Headers:**  Implement other HTTP security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) to enhance the overall security of the SearXNG instance.

* **Continuous Monitoring:**
    * Implement monitoring to detect unusual query patterns or traffic to unexpected search engines. This could involve analyzing logs, setting up alerts, or using intrusion detection systems.
