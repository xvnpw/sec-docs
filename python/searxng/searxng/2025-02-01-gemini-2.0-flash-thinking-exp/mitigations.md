# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for searxng/searxng

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Anonymization and Redaction](./mitigation_strategies/query_anonymization_and_redaction.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify PII:** Analyze user queries to identify Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, location data, etc.
2.  **Implement Redaction Rules:** Define rules to redact or replace identified PII with generic placeholders (e.g., "[REDACTED NAME]", "[REDACTED LOCATION]").
3.  **Keyword Generalization:**  Consider generalizing specific keywords to broader terms. For example, "restaurants near 123 Main Street" could become "restaurants near [REDACTED LOCATION]" or even just "restaurants nearby".
4.  **Apply Pre-processing:** Implement this anonymization process as a pre-processing step *before* sending the query to the SearXNG instance.
5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update redaction rules to ensure effectiveness and adapt to new types of PII or evolving privacy requirements.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privacy Violation (High Severity):**  Exposure of user PII to SearXNG instance and potentially downstream search engines.
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium Severity):** Accidental logging or storage of sensitive user data in query logs or SearXNG instance logs.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of privacy violations and data leakage by preventing transmission of sensitive user information to external systems.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Backend application logic where user queries are processed before being sent to SearXNG.
