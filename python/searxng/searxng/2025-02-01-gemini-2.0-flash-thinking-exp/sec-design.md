# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, searxng, aims to provide a free, open-source metasearch engine that respects users' privacy. It aggregates results from various search engines while avoiding user tracking and profiling.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a privacy-focused search experience as an alternative to mainstream search engines.
  - Offer a customizable and configurable search platform.
  - Maintain an open-source and community-driven project.
  - Enable users to self-host their own search instances for maximum privacy and control.
  - Promote decentralization and reduce reliance on centralized search providers.

- Business Risks:
  - Reputational damage due to privacy breaches or service outages.
  - Legal challenges related to data privacy or copyright infringement (depending on usage and jurisdiction).
  - Lack of user adoption if the search experience is not competitive with mainstream engines.
  - Community fragmentation or lack of contributions impacting project sustainability.
  - Resource constraints for maintaining and developing the project.
  - Potential misuse of the metasearch engine for malicious purposes (e.g., scraping, DDoS).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Searxng, being a privacy-focused metasearch engine, inherently prioritizes certain security aspects, particularly concerning user data and privacy. However, like any web application, it also faces broader security risks.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: HTTPS enforced for web access (standard practice for web applications).
  - security control: Input sanitization and output encoding to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS (likely implemented within the application code, although specific details would require code review).
  - security control: Regular updates of dependencies to address known vulnerabilities (indicated by active development and community contributions).
  - security control: Configuration options to disable features or search engines that might pose security risks or privacy concerns (user-configurable aspect).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of underlying search engines. Searxng aggregates results but does not control the security of external search providers.
  - accepted risk: Potential for information leakage through server logs or error messages if not properly configured.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party Python libraries used by searxng.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks further.
  - security control: Regularly perform static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and request throttling to protect against abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring with security alerting to detect and respond to security incidents.
  - security control: Securely manage and store any configuration secrets or API keys used by searxng.
  - security control: Implement security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) to enhance browser-side security.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - requirement: For administrative functions (if any), implement strong authentication mechanisms. For typical user search functionality, authentication is generally not required or desired for privacy reasons. If user accounts are introduced for settings persistence, secure password hashing and storage are essential.
  - Authorization:
    - requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for administrative functions to restrict access to sensitive operations. For general search functionality, authorization is not typically applicable.
  - Input Validation:
    - requirement: Thoroughly validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS). This is critical for search queries, configuration settings, and any other user-provided data.
  - Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - requirement: If any sensitive data is stored (e.g., API keys, user settings if implemented), use strong encryption at rest.
    - requirement: Ensure proper handling of cryptographic keys and avoid hardcoding secrets in the codebase.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing search functionality to users.
  - Maintaining the availability and performance of the searxng instance.
  - Protecting user privacy and anonymity.
  - Maintaining the integrity and accuracy of search results (as much as possible given reliance on external engines).
  - Ensuring the sustainability and development of the open-source project.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - User search queries: While searxng aims to minimize logging, search queries are inherently sensitive as they reveal user interests and intentions. Sensitivity: High (privacy-focused project).
  - Server logs: Can contain IP addresses, timestamps, and potentially error messages that could reveal information about users or the system. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on log content and retention).
  - Configuration data: May contain API keys or other sensitive settings. Sensitivity: High.
  - Application code and build artifacts: Integrity and confidentiality are important to prevent supply chain attacks and maintain project trustworthiness. Sensitivity: Medium to High.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any administrative functionalities planned for searxng that would require user authentication and authorization?
  - What is the intended scope of logging? What data is logged, and for how long is it retained?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that searxng needs to adhere to?
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community or identified through security testing?
  - Is there a formal security incident response plan in place?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a privacy-respecting search engine. User privacy is paramount. The project is community-driven and open-source.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is a high priority, especially concerning user privacy and data protection. The project aims to follow secure development practices. Deployment is primarily self-hosted or on user-managed infrastructure.
  - DESIGN: The architecture is relatively simple, consisting of a web server and a Python application. Deployment is likely containerized for ease of use. The build process involves standard CI/CD practices with security checks.
