## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via SearXNG [ROOT GOAL - CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_searxng__root_goal_-_critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means the attacker has compromised the application using SearXNG as an attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SearXNG Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_searxng_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   This path encompasses all attacks that directly exploit weaknesses within the SearXNG project itself. It's a high-risk path because vulnerabilities in SearXNG can directly lead to application compromise.

    *   **Exploit Code Vulnerabilities in SearXNG Core**
        *   This focuses on vulnerabilities within SearXNG's codebase.

        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vectors:**
                *   **Vulnerability in Search Engine Parsing Logic:** Exploiting flaws in how SearXNG processes responses from search engines (e.g., buffer overflows, deserialization issues). A malicious or compromised search engine could inject crafted responses to trigger RCE.
                *   **Vulnerability in Web Interface/API Endpoints:** Injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, code injection) in SearXNG's web interface or API endpoints. Unauthenticated access to administrative functions could also lead to RCE.
            *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, service disruption.
            *   **Mitigations:**
                *   Regular code audits of SearXNG core.
                *   Robust input validation and sanitization, especially for external data.
                *   Keep SearXNG updated to the latest version.
                *   Sandboxing or containerization of SearXNG.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Exposes SearXNG Instance Directly [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/application_exposes_searxng_instance_directly__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Insecure Network Exposure:** Deploying SearXNG directly to the public internet without proper firewalling or network segmentation. This makes all SearXNG vulnerabilities directly accessible from the internet.
        *   **Impact:** Increased attack surface for all SearXNG vulnerabilities, easier exploitation.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Deploy SearXNG behind a firewall.
            *   Implement network segmentation to isolate SearXNG.
            *   Use access control lists to restrict access to SearXNG.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in SearXNG [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_searxng__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Vulnerable Python Packages:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated Python packages used by SearXNG (e.g., `requests`, XML parsing libraries).
        *   **Impact:** RCE, information disclosure, DoS, depending on the vulnerability.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit` or `safety`.
            *   Keep dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
            *   Subscribe to security advisories for SearXNG and its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Search Results Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_search_results_injection__high_risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on attacks that leverage malicious or compromised search engines to inject harmful content into search results displayed by SearXNG.

    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Search Results [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
                *   **Application renders search results without proper sanitization [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the application displaying SearXNG results fails to properly sanitize the output (titles, snippets, URLs), malicious JavaScript injected by a compromised search engine can execute in the user's browser.
            *   **Impact:** XSS, client-side compromise, account hijacking, session theft.
            *   **Mitigations:**
                *   **Strict output sanitization** of all search result content in the application. Use context-aware escaping.
                *   Implement **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to mitigate XSS impact.
                *   Use **Subresource Integrity (SRI)** for external resources.

    *   **Drive-by Download/Malware Distribution via Results [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
                *   **User clicks on malicious link in search results [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Malicious search engines can inject results pointing to compromised websites hosting malware or directly linking to malicious files. If users click these links, they can be infected with malware.
            *   **Impact:** Malware infection, system compromise, data theft.
            *   **Mitigations:**
                *   **User education** about the risks of clicking suspicious links.
                *   Implement **URL reputation checks** in the application (if feasible).
                *   Endpoint security solutions on user devices.

    *   **Phishing/Social Engineering via Results [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
                *   **User trusts and interacts with malicious results [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Malicious search engines can inject results that mimic legitimate services, leading users to phishing sites designed to steal credentials or sensitive information.
            *   **Impact:** Credential theft, account compromise, social engineering attacks.
            *   **Mitigations:**
                *   **User education** to recognize phishing attempts in search results.
                *   Implement **URL reputation checks** (if feasible).
                *   Anti-phishing tools and browser extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure SearXNG Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_searxng_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations of the SearXNG instance.

    *   **Insecure Network Exposure [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
                *   **Insecure Network Exposure (again, as configuration issue):**  Failure to properly configure network security for the SearXNG instance, making it more vulnerable to external attacks. This overlaps with the previous "Application Exposes SearXNG Instance Directly" but emphasizes the configuration aspect.
        *   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, easier exploitation of vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration.
        *   **Mitigations:**
                *   **Secure configuration management** practices.
                *   **Principle of least functionality:** Disable unnecessary features.
                *   **Network security hardening:** Firewalls, access control lists.
                *   **Regular configuration reviews.**
