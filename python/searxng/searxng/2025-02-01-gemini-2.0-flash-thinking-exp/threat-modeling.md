# Threat Model Analysis for searxng/searxng

## Threat: [Malicious Backend Injection / Compromised Search Engines](./threats/malicious_backend_injection__compromised_search_engines.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Backend Injection / Compromised Search Engines
*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a search engine backend used by SearXNG or sets up a malicious backend. SearXNG fetches search results from this malicious source, unknowingly incorporating malicious content into the results displayed to users. This injected content can include phishing links, malware downloads, or scripts designed to compromise user devices or steal credentials. The attacker might compromise a legitimate backend or create a fake one to specifically target SearXNG users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Users are highly likely to be redirected to phishing websites, leading to credential theft, financial loss, or identity theft.
    *   Users are at high risk of downloading and installing malware, compromising their devices and potentially spreading malware further.
    *   The application's reputation is severely damaged due to the distribution of malicious content through search results, leading to loss of user trust.
*   **SearXNG Component Affected:**
    *   `engines` module (backend engine configurations and result parsing logic)
    *   `search` function/module (fetching and processing backend results)
    *   `ui` or templating engine (rendering potentially malicious content in the user interface)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Backend Vetting and Allowlisting:** Implement a rigorous process for vetting and selecting search engine backends. Maintain a strict allowlist of only highly reputable and trusted backends. Regularly review and update this list, removing any backend that becomes questionable.
    *   **Robust Input Sanitization & Validation:** Implement extremely robust input validation and sanitization of all search results received from backends. Sanitize HTML, JavaScript, URLs, and any other potentially executable content to prevent injection of malicious scripts or content into your application's UI. Employ a security-focused library for sanitization.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a very strict Content Security Policy to drastically limit the sources from which the browser can load resources. This significantly reduces the impact of any injected scripts that might bypass sanitization.
    *   **Continuous Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement continuous monitoring of backend response times, error rates, and content patterns. Set up immediate alerts for any anomalies that could indicate a compromised backend or malicious injection attempts.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on backend interactions and result processing to identify and address any weaknesses in your defenses.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SearXNG Codebase](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_searxng_codebase.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in SearXNG Codebase
*   **Description:** SearXNG, being a software application, may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities in its Python code or its dependencies. An attacker who discovers such a vulnerability could exploit it to compromise the SearXNG instance and potentially the underlying server or your application's infrastructure. Exploitation could lead to severe consequences, including remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the system. Vulnerabilities could exist in various parts of the codebase, such as request handling, input parsing, session management, or within third-party libraries used by SearXNG.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server running SearXNG, leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and complete control over the application and server.
    *   **Critical Data Breach:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data processed or stored by SearXNG, including configuration details, cached data, user information if logged, and potentially access to other parts of your infrastructure if SearXNG is poorly segmented.
    *   **Complete Denial of Service:** Vulnerabilities could be exploited to completely crash or disable the SearXNG service, making search functionality unavailable and potentially disrupting other dependent services.
*   **SearXNG Component Affected:** Potentially any component of SearXNG, depending on the specific vulnerability. This could critically affect:
    *   `core` modules (fundamental functionalities)
    *   `engines` modules (backend interaction logic)
    *   `ui` modules (user interface and rendering)
    *   `server` components (handling requests and responses)
    *   Dependencies used by SearXNG (vulnerabilities in libraries)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate and Regular Updates:** Implement a process for immediately applying security updates to SearXNG and all its dependencies as soon as they are released. Automate this process where possible.

    *   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS):** Implement an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) to monitor network traffic and system activity for malicious patterns and potential exploit attempts targeting SearXNG.
    *   **Secure Development Practices (if modifying SearXNG):** If your team is modifying SearXNG's codebase, enforce secure development practices, including code reviews, static analysis, and security testing throughout the development lifecycle.

## Threat: [Exposure of SearXNG Administrative Interface](./threats/exposure_of_searxng_administrative_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of SearXNG Administrative Interface
*   **Description:** If the SearXNG administrative interface is enabled and exposed to the public internet without extremely strong security measures, it presents a critical vulnerability. Attackers can target this interface to gain unauthorized access. Successful exploitation allows attackers to completely control the SearXNG instance, reconfigure settings, add malicious backends, and potentially pivot to compromise the underlying server and your entire application infrastructure. Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in the admin interface itself are all potential attack vectors.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers gain full administrative control over SearXNG, allowing them to manipulate search results, inject malware, steal data, and potentially compromise the entire server and connected systems.
    *   **Critical Data Manipulation and Integrity Loss:** Attackers can manipulate search results to spread misinformation, deface your application's search functionality, or redirect users to malicious sites, severely damaging data integrity and user trust.
    *   **Total Denial of Service and Operational Disruption:** Attackers can completely disable the SearXNG service, disrupt your application's core functionality, and potentially use the compromised server for further malicious activities.
*   **SearXNG Component Affected:**
    *   `admin` interface module (the entire administrative panel)
    *   `authentication` and `authorization` mechanisms (or lack thereof) for the admin interface
    *   `server` component (if the admin interface is exposed via the web server)
    *   `configuration` system (attackers can modify settings via the admin interface)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Admin Interface (Strongly Recommended):** If the administrative interface is not absolutely essential for ongoing operation, disable it entirely. Manage SearXNG configuration through secure configuration files and automation.
    *   **Network Restriction (Mandatory if Admin Interface Enabled):** If the admin interface must be enabled, restrict access exclusively to a highly trusted and isolated network. Use a firewall to completely block access from the public internet. Only allow access from specific, whitelisted IP addresses or networks (e.g., a dedicated management network, VPN).
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Mandatory if Admin Interface Enabled):** Implement strong Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all administrative accounts accessing the SearXNG admin interface. Relying solely on passwords is insufficient.
    *   **Strong Password Policy and Regular Password Rotation:** Enforce a strong password policy for all admin accounts, requiring complex passwords and regular password rotation.
    *   **HTTPS Only (Mandatory if Admin Interface Enabled):** Ensure the admin interface is only accessible over HTTPS to encrypt all communication and protect credentials in transit.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Monitoring (Continuous):** Conduct regular and frequent security audits specifically focused on the admin interface and its access controls. Implement continuous security monitoring and logging of all admin interface access attempts and actions. Set up immediate alerts for any suspicious activity.
    *   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS):** Deploy an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) to monitor network traffic to the admin interface and detect and block brute-force attacks or exploit attempts.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in SearXNG's Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_searxng's_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in SearXNG's Dependencies
*   **Description:** SearXNG relies on a wide range of Python libraries and other dependencies. These dependencies are also software and can contain security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are not promptly identified and patched, attackers can exploit them to compromise SearXNG. Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can be as effective as exploiting vulnerabilities in SearXNG's own code, often providing similar attack vectors and impacts. Outdated or unpatched dependencies are a common and easily exploitable attack surface.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Vulnerabilities in dependencies can frequently lead to Remote Code Execution, allowing attackers to gain complete control of the server running SearXNG.
    *   **Critical Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit dependency vulnerabilities to access sensitive data processed by SearXNG, including configuration, cached data, and potentially user-related information.
    *   **Severe Denial of Service:** Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can allow attackers to crash or disable the SearXNG service, leading to prolonged downtime and disruption of search functionality.
*   **SearXNG Component Affected:**
    *   `dependencies` (all external libraries and packages used by SearXNG) - the vulnerability resides within the dependency itself, but impacts SearXNG.
    *   Potentially any SearXNG component that utilizes a vulnerable dependency becomes indirectly affected and exploitable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability and affected dependency)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Updates and Management (Mandatory):** Implement automated systems for dependency updates and management. Regularly and automatically update SearXNG and *all* its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Vulnerability Monitoring (Continuous):** Integrate dependency scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline and development workflow. These tools should continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in SearXNG's dependencies and provide alerts for immediate patching. Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases specific to Python libraries and SearXNG's dependency stack.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to gain a comprehensive understanding of SearXNG's dependency tree and identify potential vulnerabilities and licensing issues.
    *   **Regular Security Testing and Penetration Testing (Include Dependency Checks):** Ensure that regular security testing and penetration testing include specific checks for dependency vulnerabilities. Verify that your vulnerability scanning tools are effective and up-to-date.
    *   **"Vendoring" with Extreme Caution (Generally Discouraged):** While "vendoring" dependencies might seem like a way to control versions, it is generally discouraged for security reasons unless you have a highly robust and automated process for tracking, patching, and updating vendored dependencies. Vendoring can quickly become a security liability if not managed meticulously. If used, it requires even more rigorous vulnerability monitoring and patching processes.
