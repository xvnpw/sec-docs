# Attack Surface Analysis for searxng/searxng

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Search Results](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_search_results.md)

*   **Description:**  The ability for an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users through SearXNG. These scripts execute in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions.

    *   **SearXNG Contribution:** SearXNG aggregates and displays search results from external engines.  If SearXNG's output sanitization is insufficient, it can render unsanitized content from these external sources, directly introducing XSS vulnerabilities into the user's browsing session within the SearXNG context.  This is a direct consequence of SearXNG's core function of displaying external content.

    *   **Example:** A compromised website, indexed by a search engine used by SearXNG, contains malicious JavaScript. When a user searches via SearXNG and the compromised site appears in results, clicking the link renders the malicious script within SearXNG's interface, executing in the user's browser.

    *   **Impact:** User session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, potential for further attacks against the user's system, defacement of the SearXNG page within the context of search results.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Output Sanitization:** Implement and rigorously maintain strict HTML sanitization of all search results *before* display. Utilize a well-established and actively updated HTML sanitization library. Ensure proper configuration to effectively neutralize JavaScript and malicious HTML.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Enforce a strong Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources. This acts as a defense-in-depth measure, reducing the impact of XSS even if sanitization is bypassed.
        *   **Regular Security Audits & Testing:** Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on XSS vulnerabilities in SearXNG's result rendering and sanitization pipelines.

## Attack Surface: [YAML Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Configuration Parsing](./attack_surfaces/yaml_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_configuration_parsing.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of insecure YAML deserialization within SearXNG's configuration loading process. If a vulnerable YAML parser is used and processes untrusted YAML data, attackers can inject malicious code that executes during deserialization, leading to arbitrary code execution on the SearXNG server.

    *   **SearXNG Contribution:** SearXNG relies on YAML configuration files (e.g., `settings.yml`). If the YAML parsing within SearXNG is vulnerable to deserialization attacks, and if an attacker can manipulate these configuration files (through compromised access or deployment vulnerabilities), they can directly leverage this to execute arbitrary code on the SearXNG server. This is a direct vulnerability in how SearXNG handles its configuration.

    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to `settings.yml` (due to misconfigured permissions or other vulnerabilities). They inject malicious YAML code into this file. When SearXNG starts or reloads configuration, the vulnerable YAML parser deserializes the malicious code, resulting in arbitrary command execution on the server, granting the attacker full control.

    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service, full control over the SearXNG instance and potentially the underlying system.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Safe YAML Loading Practices:**  Ensure SearXNG *exclusively* uses safe YAML loading functions (like `safe_load` in PyYAML) that prevent arbitrary code execution during deserialization.  Avoid using unsafe loading functions like `load` or `unsafe_load`.
        *   **Strict Configuration File Access Control:** Implement and enforce very strict file system permissions on SearXNG's configuration files. Limit read access to the SearXNG process user and administrators, and restrict write access to only administrators.
        *   **Configuration File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms to monitor the integrity of configuration files and detect any unauthorized modifications. Alert administrators to any changes.
        *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep the YAML parsing library and all other Python dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch any known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Core Python Libraries](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_core_python_libraries.md)

*   **Description:**  Security vulnerabilities present in third-party Python libraries that SearXNG directly depends upon for its core functionality. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can compromise SearXNG if dependencies are not promptly updated and patched.

    *   **SearXNG Contribution:** SearXNG is built on Python and relies on essential libraries like Flask, Werkzeug, requests, and others. Vulnerabilities in these *core* dependencies directly impact SearXNG's security posture.  SearXNG's functionality is intrinsically linked to these libraries, making it directly vulnerable to their flaws.

    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in the Flask framework or the `requests` library. If a SearXNG instance is running an outdated version of Flask or `requests`, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability (e.g., through crafted HTTP requests to SearXNG or by targeting services SearXNG interacts with) to compromise the SearXNG server.

    *   **Impact:**  Impact varies widely depending on the specific vulnerability. Can range from denial of service, information disclosure, to remote code execution and full server compromise.  Critical vulnerabilities in core libraries often lead to high or critical impact.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability)

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Proactive Dependency Management & Updates:** Implement a robust dependency management strategy. Use tools like `pip` with `requirements.txt` or `pipenv` to track and manage dependencies.  Establish a process for regularly and promptly updating *all* Python dependencies, especially core libraries, to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies into the development and deployment pipeline. Use tools like `pip-audit` or dedicated vulnerability scanners to continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Pinning & Review:** Consider pinning dependency versions in production for stability, but ensure a process is in place to regularly review and update pinned dependencies for security patches.  Unpinned dependencies should be updated more frequently, with thorough testing before deployment.
