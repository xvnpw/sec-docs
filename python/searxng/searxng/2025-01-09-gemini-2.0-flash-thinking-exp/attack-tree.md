## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Application Server (Attacker Goal) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_application_server__attacker_goal___critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. If successful, the attacker gains complete control over the application server, allowing them to execute any commands, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SearXNG Directly [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_searxng_directly__critical_node_.md)

Compromising the SearXNG instance itself provides a powerful foothold for attackers. From here, they can manipulate search results, access internal data, potentially gain access to the underlying server, and use SearXNG as a platform to attack the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Injection Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/input_injection_exploitation__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the application handles user input before passing it to SearXNG. If not properly sanitized, malicious input can be injected.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Search Results [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_search_results__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application passes raw user input to SearXNG, an attacker can craft a search query containing malicious JavaScript. When SearXNG returns the results and the application renders them without proper encoding, the malicious script executes in the user's browser.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Output Processing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/output_processing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities in how the application processes and renders the search results received from SearXNG.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Insecure Handling of Search Results by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_handling_of_search_results_by_application__high-risk_path_.md)

**Application uses insecure methods to process data from SearXNG (e.g., `eval`) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses insecure functions like `eval` to process data received from SearXNG, an attacker can inject malicious code within the search results that will be executed directly on the application server.
            *   **Potential Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the application server, complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

Gaining unauthorized access to or manipulating SearXNG's configuration can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Exposed API Keys or Secrets (if any) [HIGH-RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_exposed_api_keys_or_secrets__if_any___high-risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If API keys or other secrets used to configure or access SearXNG are exposed (e.g., in code, configuration files, or through other vulnerabilities), attackers can use these credentials to gain administrative access to SearXNG.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Full control over SearXNG, ability to modify settings, inject malicious content, potentially gain access to the underlying server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Software Vulnerabilities in SearXNG [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/software_vulnerabilities_in_searxng__high-risk_path_start_.md)

Like any software, SearXNG may contain security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application is using an outdated version of SearXNG with publicly known vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage readily available exploits to compromise the instance.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution on the SearXNG server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SearXNG Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_searxng_dependencies__high-risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

SearXNG relies on various third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be a significant attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Python Libraries [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_python_libraries__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If any of the Python libraries used by SearXNG have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these flaws to gain control of the SearXNG process or the underlying server.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the SearXNG server, potentially leading to further attacks on the application.
