# Attack Surface Analysis for searxng/searxng

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Search Results](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_search_results.md)

**Description:** Malicious content (e.g., JavaScript) is embedded within search results returned by the upstream search engines, and SearXNG passes this content to your application, where it can be rendered in the user's browser.
* **How SearXNG Contributes:** SearXNG aggregates and presents results from various sources without inherently sanitizing them for XSS. It acts as a conduit, and if your application doesn't handle the output properly, the vulnerability is realized.
* **Example:** A search result contains a website title or snippet with embedded JavaScript that steals cookies or redirects the user to a malicious site when the results are displayed by your application.
* **Impact:** Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of your application's pages, or other client-side attacks.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Contextual Output Encoding:** Encode the search results received from SearXNG before displaying them in your application. Use appropriate encoding methods (e.g., HTML entity encoding) based on the context where the data is being displayed.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
    * **Consider using SearXNG's `strip_html` for results:** Configure SearXNG to strip HTML tags from the search results before they are returned to your application (though this might affect legitimate formatting).

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Proxying Functionality](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_proxying_functionality.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit SearXNG's ability to proxy search requests to use your instance as an open proxy for malicious activities.
* **How SearXNG Contributes:** SearXNG's core functionality involves fetching content from external search engines on behalf of the user. If not properly controlled, this functionality can be abused.
* **Example:** An attacker uses your SearXNG instance to anonymously access blocked websites or launch attacks against other servers, potentially leading to your infrastructure being implicated.
* **Impact:** Your server's IP address could be blacklisted, leading to reputation damage and potential service disruptions.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Restrict Access to SearXNG:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing your SearXNG instance, ensuring only legitimate users can submit search requests.
    * **Monitor Outbound Traffic:** Monitor the outbound network traffic from your SearXNG instance for unusual patterns or connections to suspicious destinations.
    * **Review SearXNG Configuration:** Ensure that any features that might facilitate open proxying are properly configured or disabled if not needed.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in SearXNG Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_searxng_dependencies.md)

**Description:** SearXNG relies on various third-party libraries and packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the SearXNG instance.
* **How SearXNG Contributes:** By incorporating these dependencies, SearXNG inherits any security vulnerabilities present in them.
* **Example:** A known vulnerability in a Python library used by SearXNG allows for remote code execution. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the SearXNG server.
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SearXNG instance, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further attacks on your infrastructure.
* **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regularly Update SearXNG:** Keep your SearXNG instance updated to the latest version, which often includes fixes for known dependency vulnerabilities.
    * **Dependency Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan SearXNG's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and receive alerts when new vulnerabilities are discovered.
    * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories for SearXNG and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of SearXNG Admin Interface (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_searxng_admin_interface__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If SearXNG's administrative interface is enabled and not properly secured, attackers can gain unauthorized access to configure and control the instance.
* **How SearXNG Contributes:** SearXNG provides an administrative interface for managing its settings. If this interface is accessible without proper authentication, it presents a direct attack vector.
* **Example:** An attacker finds the administrative interface accessible without a password or with default credentials and uses it to reconfigure SearXNG for malicious purposes.
* **Impact:** Full control over the SearXNG instance, allowing attackers to modify settings, potentially expose sensitive information, or disrupt service.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure the Admin Interface:** Ensure the administrative interface is protected by strong authentication (e.g., strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
    * **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the administrative interface to authorized users and IP addresses only.
    * **Disable if Not Needed:** If the administrative interface is not actively used, consider disabling it entirely.
