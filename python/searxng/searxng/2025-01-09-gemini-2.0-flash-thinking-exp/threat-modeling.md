# Threat Model Analysis for searxng/searxng

## Threat: [Search Query Injection](./threats/search_query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious search queries that, when processed by SearXNG, exploit vulnerabilities in its query parsing or handling logic. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the SearXNG server or manipulate its internal state.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the SearXNG server, allowing full system compromise. Potential for data exfiltration from the SearXNG server or further attacks on infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** `search` module, specifically the functions responsible for parsing and processing search queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within SearXNG to prevent the execution of unintended commands or code.
        *   Regularly audit and review the search query parsing logic for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Apply principle of least privilege to the SearXNG process.

## Threat: [Denial of Service against SearXNG](./threats/denial_of_service_against_searxng.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of crafted or legitimate-looking requests to the SearXNG instance, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and making it unavailable to legitimate users. This could involve exploiting resource-intensive features or simply flooding the server with requests.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete unavailability of the SearXNG service, disrupting the application's search functionality. This can lead to significant user impact and potential financial losses.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core SearXNG application, including the web server and search processing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling within SearXNG to limit the number of requests from a single source.
        *   Configure resource limits for the SearXNG instance to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   Deploy SearXNG behind a reverse proxy or load balancer with DDoS protection capabilities.
        *   Monitor SearXNG's resource usage and network traffic for anomalies.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of SearXNG](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_searxng.md)

*   **Description:**  Leaving SearXNG with default or weak configurations can create significant security vulnerabilities. This includes using default administrative credentials (if applicable for certain deployment methods), enabling debug modes in production, or having overly permissive access controls.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the SearXNG administrative interface, allowing attackers to reconfigure the system, manipulate search results, or potentially gain complete control of the SearXNG instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** The configuration files and administrative interface of SearXNG.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow SearXNG's security best practices for configuration, ensuring strong and unique credentials for any administrative access.
        *   Disable or restrict access to the administrative interface from public networks.
        *   Regularly review and audit SearXNG's configuration settings.
        *   Disable debug modes and unnecessary features in production environments.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SearXNG Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_searxng_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** SearXNG relies on various third-party libraries and components. Unpatched vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited by attackers to compromise the SearXNG instance.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the SearXNG server, allowing attackers to gain control of the system. Potential for data breaches or further attacks on the infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components that rely on external libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update SearXNG to the latest version to benefit from security patches in its dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for monitoring and addressing security vulnerabilities in SearXNG's dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
