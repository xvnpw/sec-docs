### High and Critical SearXNG Threats

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the SearXNG component:

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Search Results
    *   **Description:** Malicious actors could manipulate websites indexed by search engines to inject malicious scripts into the content. When SearXNG retrieves and displays these results, if SearXNG does not properly sanitize the output, the injected scripts could be executed within the user's browser in the context of the application. The vulnerability lies in SearXNG's rendering of external content.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. They can also redirect users to malicious websites or perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **Affected Component:** Search Results Rendering module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust output encoding and sanitization of all search results before displaying them. This should be done within the application integrating SearXNG, as relying solely on SearXNG's sanitization might not be sufficient depending on the integration context.
        *   Utilize a trusted HTML sanitization library within the integrating application to remove or neutralize potentially malicious scripts.
        *   Set the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header in the integrating application's responses to prevent browsers from trying to interpret responses as different content types than declared.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) in the integrating application to further restrict the execution of scripts.

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering in Transit (if using non-HTTPS SearXNG)
    *   **Description:** If the application communicates with a self-hosted SearXNG instance over HTTP instead of HTTPS, an attacker on the network could intercept the communication between the application and SearXNG. This allows the attacker to tamper with the search queries sent to SearXNG or the results returned by SearXNG before they reach the application. The vulnerability lies in the lack of encryption in the communication channel with SearXNG.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could manipulate search results to mislead users, inject malicious links into the results before they are displayed by the application, or prevent users from finding legitimate information. This compromises the integrity of the application's search functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Communication module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory:** Ensure all communication between the application and the SearXNG instance is conducted over HTTPS. This requires configuring HTTPS on the SearXNG server.
        *   Verify the SSL/TLS certificate of the SearXNG instance to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in SearXNG Instance
    *   **Description:** SearXNG, like any software, may contain security vulnerabilities in its code. If the application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of SearXNG, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities remotely to gain unauthorized access to the SearXNG instance or the server it runs on. This is a direct vulnerability within the SearXNG application itself.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SearXNG instance, potential access to sensitive data stored or processed by SearXNG (if any), and the possibility of using the compromised instance to launch further attacks against the application or other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core SearXNG application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the SearXNG instance to the latest stable version.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for SearXNG to stay informed about known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for promptly patching or mitigating identified vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow security best practices for deploying and running web applications, such as using a non-root user and keeping the operating system updated.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in SearXNG Dependencies
    *   **Description:** SearXNG relies on various Python packages and other dependencies. If these dependencies contain security vulnerabilities, they can indirectly affect the security of the application using SearXNG. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities in the dependencies to compromise the SearXNG instance. The vulnerability lies within the third-party libraries used by SearXNG.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities could lead to various security issues, including remote code execution on the SearXNG server, denial of service, or data breaches affecting the SearXNG instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** SearXNG Dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep SearXNG and its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., pip-audit, safety) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Regularly review and update the project's dependency requirements.
        *   Consider using a virtual environment to isolate SearXNG's dependencies from other system packages.

*   **Threat:** Abuse of SearXNG Proxy Feature
    *   **Description:** If the SearXNG instance is configured to act as a proxy, and this feature is not properly secured, malicious actors could potentially abuse this functionality. They could route malicious traffic through the SearXNG server, masking their origin or bypassing security controls of other systems. The vulnerability lies in the insecure configuration or lack of access control on SearXNG's proxy feature.
    *   **Impact:** The SearXNG server could be used as part of a botnet or to launch attacks against other systems. This could lead to reputational damage for the owner of the SearXNG instance and potentially expose the application's network to attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Proxy Feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure and monitor SearXNG's proxying features.
        *   Restrict access to the proxy functionality to only authorized users or applications. Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Implement logging and monitoring of proxy usage to detect and respond to abuse.
        *   Consider disabling the proxy feature if it is not required for the application's functionality.
