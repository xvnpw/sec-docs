## High and Critical Flask Attack Surfaces

This table lists high and critical attack surfaces that directly involve the Flask framework.

| Description | How Flask Contributes to the Attack Surface | Example | Impact | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Path Traversal via URL Manipulation** | Flask's dynamic routing allows defining routes with variables that can be manipulated by users to access unintended resources. | A route `/files/<path:filepath>` could be exploited with `/files/../../sensitive.txt` to access files outside the intended directory. | Unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories on the server. | **High** | * **Strict Input Validation:** Validate route parameters against a whitelist of allowed characters and paths. * **Avoid Direct File Access:** Do not directly use user input to construct file paths. Use secure methods for retrieving resources based on identifiers. * **Sanitize Input:** If direct file access is unavoidable, sanitize the input to remove potentially malicious sequences like `../`. |
| **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** | Flask's integration with the Jinja2 templating engine allows for the execution of arbitrary code if user-provided data is directly embedded in templates without proper escaping. | A vulnerable template `render_template_string("Hello {{ user_input }}", user_input=request.args.get('name'))` with the request `?name={{ system('whoami') }}` would execute the `whoami` command on the server. | Remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain full control of the server. | **Critical** | * **Never Directly Embed User Input:** Always escape user-provided data when rendering templates. Utilize Jinja2's autoescaping feature. * **Use Safe Filters:** Employ Jinja2's built-in filters for escaping and sanitization. * **Consider a Sandboxed Environment (Advanced):** For highly sensitive applications, explore sandboxed Jinja2 environments with restricted functionality. |
| **HTTP Header Injection** | Flask allows setting custom HTTP headers in responses. If user-provided data is used to construct these headers without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious headers. | Setting a `Location` header based on user input: `redirect(request.args.get('url'))` could be exploited with a malicious URL like `javascript:alert('XSS')` or an external malicious site. | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `Set-Cookie`, Open Redirects to malicious sites, and other header-based attacks. | **High** | * **Strict Input Validation:** Validate all input used to construct HTTP headers against a whitelist of allowed values. * **Header Sanitization:** Sanitize header values to remove or escape potentially harmful characters. * **Use Flask's Response Object:** Utilize Flask's `make_response` and `Response` objects for setting headers, which often provide some level of built-in protection. |
| **Information Disclosure via Debug Mode** | Flask's debug mode, enabled by setting `app.debug = True`, provides detailed error messages and an interactive debugger, exposing sensitive information. | In a production environment with debug mode enabled, an unhandled exception will reveal stack traces, code snippets, and potentially environment variables in the browser. | Exposure of sensitive application internals, code structure, and environment variables, which can be used by attackers to plan further attacks. | **Critical** | * **Disable Debug Mode in Production:** Ensure `app.debug = False` in production deployments. * **Use Separate Configurations:** Maintain separate configuration files for development and production environments. |
| **Insecure Session Management (Weak Secret Key)** | Flask relies on a `SECRET_KEY` for signing session cookies. If this key is weak or publicly known, attackers can forge session cookies. | If the `SECRET_KEY` is a simple or predictable string, an attacker can create valid session cookies for any user, bypassing authentication. | Session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users and perform actions on their behalf. | **Critical** | * **Strong and Secret `SECRET_KEY`:** Generate a strong, random, and unpredictable `SECRET_KEY` and keep it confidential. Store it securely (e.g., environment variables, secure vault). * **Regularly Rotate `SECRET_KEY`:** Consider periodically rotating the `SECRET_KEY`. |
| **Insecure Session Management (Missing Cookie Flags)** | Flask's session cookies, if not configured with the `httponly` and `secure` flags, are vulnerable to client-side attacks. | A missing `httponly` flag allows JavaScript to access the session cookie, potentially leading to session theft via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). A missing `secure` flag allows the cookie to be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections, making it vulnerable to interception. | Session hijacking and session fixation attacks. | **High** | * **Configure Cookie Attributes:** Ensure `httponly` and `secure` flags are set for session cookies. This can be done through Flask's configuration options. * **Enforce HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for all communication to protect cookies transmitted over the network. |

This filtered list focuses on the high and critical attack surfaces directly introduced by Flask's features. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for securing Flask applications.
