# Threat Modeling Analysis for the Fabric Agent Action Project Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview
The Fabric Agent Action is a GitHub Action designed to automate complex workflows using an agent-based approach. It leverages Fabric Patterns and Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently select and execute tasks based on user inputs. The project aims to enhance workflow efficiency and provide seamless integration into existing GitHub workflows.

### Key Components and Features
- **GitHub Action**: Automates workflows triggered by GitHub events (e.g., issues, pull requests).
- **Agent Types**: Supports multiple agent types (`router`, `react`, `react_issue`, `react_pr`) for different use cases.
- **LLM Providers**: Integrates with OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic for executing fabric patterns.
- **Fabric Patterns**: A collection of predefined patterns that the action can execute based on user input.

### Dependencies
- **External APIs**: OpenAI API, OpenRouter API, and Anthropic API for LLM functionalities.
- **GitHub Actions**: Utilizes GitHub's CI/CD capabilities for workflow automation.
- **Python Libraries**: Various dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`, including `langgraph`, `langchain`, and `pydantic`.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

Attacker's Ultimate Objective:
- **Compromise systems using the Fabric Agent Action by exploiting weaknesses in the project, leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or manipulation of workflows.**

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Unauthorized Access to API Keys**
   - Exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive API keys stored in GitHub secrets.

2. **Injection of Malicious Input**
   - Manipulate user inputs (e.g., comments, issues) to execute unintended actions or commands.

3. **Data Leakage through External LLM Providers**
   - Intercept or expose sensitive data sent to or received from untrusted external LLM providers.

4. **Compromise of Fabric Patterns**
   - Alter or manipulate fabric patterns to execute malicious code or incorrect processing of requests.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - Trigger excessive workflow runs to exhaust GitHub Actions resources.

6. **Supply Chain Attack**
   - Introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code through compromised dependencies.
