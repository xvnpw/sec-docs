# THREAT SCENARIOS

- Unauthorized access to API keys through GitHub secrets, leading to misuse of services.
- Injection of malicious input through user comments or issues, manipulating action behavior.
- Data leakage through untrusted external LLM providers, exposing sensitive user data.
- Compromise of fabric patterns, resulting in incorrect processing of requests.
- Exposure of sensitive information in generated output files, risking data privacy.
- Vulnerability in base Docker image leading to container compromise and unauthorized access.
- Unauthorized access to GitHub Actions workflows, allowing malicious modifications.
- Denial of Service (DoS) through excessive workflow runs, exhausting GitHub Actions resources.
- Supply chain attack through compromised dependencies, introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code.
- Unauthorized modifications to the CI/CD pipeline, leading to malicious code execution.
- Vulnerability in Dockerfile leading to insecure image builds, risking container security.
- Container escape leading to host compromise, allowing access to the host system.
- Excessive builds exhausting CI/CD resources, causing service disruption.
- Misconfigured GitHub Actions or Docker images, leading to exploitable vulnerabilities.
- Lack of input validation, allowing injection attacks and unintended consequences.
- Insufficient logging and monitoring, hindering detection of anomalies and abuse.

# THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS

- Identify critical assets and their value to prioritize protection.
- Assess trust boundaries to understand where vulnerabilities may exist.
- Evaluate data flows to pinpoint potential interception or leakage points.
- Use STRIDE model to categorize threats and determine their impact.
- Prioritize threats based on likelihood and potential impact to focus defenses.
- Analyze external dependencies for potential supply chain vulnerabilities.
- Review user input handling to mitigate injection risks.
- Ensure proper configuration of CI/CD pipelines to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Monitor for unusual activity to detect potential breaches early.
- Regularly update and patch dependencies to reduce vulnerabilities.

# RECOMMENDED CONTROLS

- Store API keys securely in GitHub secrets and implement access controls.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit to protect against data leakage.
- Implement logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized access and anomalies.
- Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- Use trusted base images and regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- Implement rate limiting on API calls to prevent abuse and excessive usage.
- Review and update access control measures for GitHub Actions workflows.
- Conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate potential risks.
- Ensure proper configuration of GitHub Actions and Docker images to minimize vulnerabilities.

# NARRATIVE ANALYSIS

The threat scenarios identified for the Fabric Agent Action project highlight a range of potential risks, primarily centered around unauthorized access, data leakage, and injection attacks. Given the reliance on external LLM providers and the handling of sensitive user inputs, it is crucial to implement robust security measures to mitigate these risks. The likelihood of certain threats, such as supply chain attacks or container escapes, may be lower but still warrant attention due to their potentially severe impacts. By focusing on the most likely and impactful threats, the project can prioritize its security efforts effectively, ensuring a balance between usability and protection.

# CONCLUSION

The Fabric Agent Action project faces various threats, necessitating a comprehensive security strategy to protect sensitive assets and maintain operational integrity.

# Notes

Certain scenarios, such as container escape or supply chain attacks, may not have specific controls due to their low likelihood or the complexity of defending against them. However, they should still be monitored as part of a broader security strategy.
