# Attack Surface Analysis for `Fabric Agent Action`

## Attack Surface Identification
The attack surface of the `Fabric Agent Action` includes various digital assets, components, and system entry points that could be targeted by an attacker. The following components have been identified:

- **APIs and External Integrations:**
  - **OpenAI API**: Utilized for executing fabric patterns. The API key is stored in GitHub secrets (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).
  - **OpenRouter API**: Another LLM provider that can be used, with its API key also stored in GitHub secrets (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).
  - **Anthropic API**: A third LLM provider, with its API key stored in GitHub secrets (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

- **Web Applications:**
  - **GitHub Actions**: The action is triggered by GitHub events (e.g., issue comments, pull requests), which are publicly accessible and can be exploited if not properly secured.

- **Configuration Files:**
  - **action.yml**: Defines inputs and outputs for the GitHub Action, including sensitive parameters like API keys and agent types.
  - **Dockerfile**: Contains instructions for building the Docker image, which could expose vulnerabilities if not properly configured.

- **Communication Protocols:**
  - **HTTP/HTTPS**: Used for API calls to external LLM providers. The security of these communications depends on proper implementation of HTTPS.

- **Authentication Mechanisms:**
  - **GitHub Secrets**: Used to store sensitive API keys. If these secrets are leaked or improperly managed, it could lead to unauthorized access to the APIs.

- **Internet-facing Components:**
  - **GitHub Repository**: The repository is public, which means that any vulnerabilities in the code could be discovered and exploited by malicious actors.

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
- **API Key Exposure**: If the GitHub secrets are not properly managed, API keys could be exposed.
- **Insecure API Calls**: If API calls are made without proper validation or error handling, it could lead to information disclosure or unauthorized actions.
- **Improper Input Validation**: If user inputs (e.g., issue comments) are not properly sanitized, it could lead to injection attacks or execution of unintended commands.

### Reference Implementation Details:
- **action.yml**: Defines the action's inputs and outputs, including sensitive configurations.
- **entrypoint.sh**: Handles the execution of the action and manages input/output files.
- **app.py**: Main application logic that processes inputs and interacts with LLMs.

## Threat Enumeration
Using the STRIDE threat model, the following threats have been identified:

1. **Spoofing**:
   - **Threat**: An attacker could impersonate a legitimate user to trigger the action.
   - **Attack Vector**: By creating a pull request or issue comment that mimics the repository owner.
   - **Conditions**: If access control checks are not properly implemented.

2. **Tampering**:
   - **Threat**: An attacker could modify the input files or the action's configuration.
   - **Attack Vector**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the GitHub Actions workflow or repository settings.
   - **Conditions**: If the repository settings allow unauthorized modifications.

3. **Repudiation**:
   - **Threat**: Users could deny having triggered the action or made specific changes.
   - **Attack Vector**: Lack of proper logging and auditing of actions taken.
   - **Conditions**: If the action does not log user actions adequately.

4. **Information Disclosure**:
   - **Threat**: Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, user data) could be exposed.
   - **Attack Vector**: Improper handling of error messages or logs that reveal sensitive data.
   - **Conditions**: If error handling is not implemented correctly.

5. **Denial of Service**:
   - **Threat**: An attacker could flood the action with requests, causing service disruption.
   - **Attack Vector**: Triggering the action repeatedly through comments or pull requests.
   - **Conditions**: If rate limiting is not enforced.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**:
   - **Threat**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to perform actions beyond their permissions.
   - **Attack Vector**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the action's logic or GitHub's permissions model.
   - **Conditions**: If access controls are not properly configured.

## Impact Assessment
The potential impact of each identified threat is assessed as follows:

1. **Spoofing**: 
   - **Impact**: High (could lead to unauthorized actions).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (requires knowledge of the repository).
   - **Mitigation**: Implement strict access controls and validation checks.

2. **Tampering**: 
   - **Impact**: High (could compromise the integrity of the action).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on repository settings).
   - **Mitigation**: Use branch protection rules and code reviews.

3. **Repudiation**: 
   - **Impact**: Medium (could complicate accountability).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on logging practices).
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive logging and auditing.

4. **Information Disclosure**: 
   - **Impact**: High (could expose sensitive data).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on error handling).
   - **Mitigation**: Ensure proper error handling and logging practices.

5. **Denial of Service**: 
   - **Impact**: Medium (could disrupt service).
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on action usage).
   - **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting and monitoring.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**: 
   - **Impact**: High (could lead to unauthorized access).
   - **Likelihood**: Low (requires specific vulnerabilities).
   - **Mitigation**: Regularly review permissions and access controls.

## Threat Ranking
Based on the assessed impact and likelihood, the threats are ranked as follows:

1. **Information Disclosure**: High impact, medium likelihood.
2. **Tampering**: High impact, medium likelihood.
3. **Spoofing**: High impact, medium likelihood.
4. **Elevation of Privilege**: High impact, low likelihood.
5. **Denial of Service**: Medium impact, medium likelihood.
6. **Repudiation**: Medium impact, medium likelihood.

## Mitigation Recommendations
To address the identified threats, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Implement Access Controls**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Spoofing, Elevation of Privilege.
   - **Best Practices**: Use GitHub's branch protection rules and require reviews for pull requests.

2. **Enhance Logging and Auditing**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Repudiation, Information Disclosure.
   - **Best Practices**: Log all actions taken by users and maintain an audit trail.

3. **Secure API Keys**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Information Disclosure.
   - **Best Practices**: Use GitHub secrets to store API keys and ensure they are not exposed in logs.

4. **Implement Rate Limiting**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Denial of Service.
   - **Best Practices**: Use GitHub Actions' built-in features to limit the number of times an action can be triggered.

5. **Conduct Regular Security Reviews**:
   - **Threats Addressed**: Tampering, Elevation of Privilege.
   - **Best Practices**: Regularly review code and configurations for vulnerabilities.
