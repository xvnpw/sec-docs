# Project Design Document for Fabric Agent Action

## BUSINESS POSTURE
The Fabric Agent Action project aims to automate complex workflows in GitHub using an agent-based approach that leverages Fabric Patterns and Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary business goals include:

- **Enhancing Workflow Efficiency**: By automating repetitive tasks and providing intelligent suggestions, the project seeks to improve the productivity of developers and teams.
- **Seamless Integration**: The action is designed to be easily integrated into existing GitHub workflows, minimizing setup time and maximizing usability.
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Offering flexibility in choosing LLM providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic) to cater to different user preferences and availability.

### Business Risks
- **Unauthorized Access**: Potential misuse of the action could lead to unauthorized API usage and increased costs.
- **Dependency on External Services**: Reliance on third-party LLM providers may introduce risks related to service availability and performance.
- **Data Privacy**: Handling sensitive data through LLMs raises concerns about data security and compliance with privacy regulations.

## SECURITY POSTURE
### Existing Security Controls
- **Access Control Patterns**: Implemented conditions to restrict access based on the context of GitHub events (e.g., pull requests, comments).
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive API keys are stored in GitHub secrets to prevent exposure in the codebase.

### Accepted Risks
- **Accepted Risk**: The action may be exposed to public repositories, allowing unauthorized users to trigger workflows, albeit with access control measures in place.

### Recommended Security Controls
- **Security Control**: Implement rate limiting on API calls to prevent abuse.
- **Security Control**: Introduce logging and monitoring to track usage patterns and detect anomalies.
- **Security Control**: Regularly review and update access control conditions to adapt to evolving threats.

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: Use GitHub's built-in authentication mechanisms to verify user identity.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control to restrict actions based on user roles.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.
- **Cryptography**: Use secure methods for storing and transmitting sensitive data, such as API keys.
