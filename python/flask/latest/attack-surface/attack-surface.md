# Attack Surface Analysis for `Fabric Agent Action`

## Attack Surface Identification
The attack surface of the Fabric Agent Action includes various digital assets, components, and system entry points that could be targeted by an attacker. The following components have been identified:

- **APIs**:
  - **OpenAI API**: Used for executing fabric patterns.
  - **OpenRouter API**: Alternative LLM provider.
  - **Anthropic API**: Another LLM provider.
  
- **Web Applications**:
  - **GitHub Actions**: The primary interface for executing the Fabric Agent Action.

- **Configuration Files**:
  - **action.yml**: Defines inputs and outputs for the GitHub Action.
  - **Dockerfile**: Contains instructions for building the Docker image, which may expose vulnerabilities if not properly configured.

- **Open Ports and Communication Protocols**:
  - **GitHub Webhooks**: Used for triggering workflows based on events (e.g., pull requests, comments).

- **External Integrations**:
  - **GitHub Repository**: The repository where the action is defined and executed.
  - **Fabric Patterns**: Patterns used by the Fabric Agent Action to process user requests.

- **Authentication Mechanisms**:
  - **API Keys**: Sensitive keys for OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic stored in GitHub secrets.

- **User Inputs**:
  - Data provided by users through GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments.

### Potential Vulnerabilities
- **API Keys Exposure**: If API keys are not properly secured, they could be exposed through logs or misconfigurations.
- **Injection Attacks**: Malicious inputs could manipulate the action's behavior or lead to unintended consequences.
- **Data Leakage**: Sensitive user data may be exposed if LLM providers mishandle data.
- **Insecure Configuration**: Misconfigured Docker images or GitHub Actions could lead to vulnerabilities.

### Reference Implementation Details
- **action.yml**: Defines the inputs and outputs for the GitHub Action.
- **Dockerfile**: Contains the build instructions for the Docker image.
- **entrypoint.sh**: Script that sets up the environment for the action.
- **/code/fabric_agent_action/app.py**: Main application logic for executing the action.

## Threat Enumeration
Using the STRIDE model, the following threats have been identified:

| Threat ID | Component Name         | Threat Name                                                                 | STRIDE Category | Description                                                                                     |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0001      | API Keys               | Unauthorized access to API keys through GitHub secrets                     | Spoofing        | API keys are critical for accessing LLM services; unauthorized access can lead to misuse.     |
| 0002      | GitHub Actions         | Injection of malicious input through user comments or issues                | Tampering       | Malicious inputs can manipulate the action's behavior or lead to unintended consequences.      |
| 0003      | LLM Providers          | Data leakage through untrusted external LLM providers                       | Information Disclosure | Sensitive user data may be exposed if LLM providers mishandle data.                            |
| 0004      | Fabric Patterns        | Compromise of fabric patterns leading to incorrect processing of requests    | Tampering       | Altered patterns can lead to incorrect outputs or execution of unintended actions.              |
| 0005      | Output Files           | Exposure of sensitive information in generated output files                 | Information Disclosure | Output files may contain sensitive data that should not be publicly accessible.                 |

## Impact Assessment
The potential impact of each identified threat on the system is evaluated as follows:

| Threat ID | Impact on CIA Triad | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|------------|------------|
| 0001      | High (Confidentiality) | High     | Medium     | API keys are stored in GitHub secrets and not exposed in the codebase. Implement rate limiting on API calls and monitor usage patterns. |
| 0002      | High (Integrity)      | High     | Medium     | Input validation is required to ensure that inputs are sanitized before processing. Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks. |
| 0003      | Critical (Confidentiality) | High     | Medium     | Data is sent to LLM providers only after validation; however, the risk remains. Use encryption for data in transit and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. |
| 0004      | High (Integrity)      | Medium   | Low        | Patterns are version-controlled, but unauthorized changes could still occur. Implement access controls and logging for changes to fabric patterns. |
| 0005      | High (Confidentiality) | High     | Medium     | Output files are generated based on user inputs and should be handled carefully. Implement access controls on output files and ensure they are not publicly accessible. |

## Threat Ranking
The identified threats are prioritized based on their assessed impact and likelihood:

1. **Threat ID 0003**: Data leakage through untrusted external LLM providers (Critical impact, Medium likelihood).
2. **Threat ID 0001**: Unauthorized access to API keys (High impact, Medium likelihood).
3. **Threat ID 0002**: Injection of malicious input (High impact, Medium likelihood).
4. **Threat ID 0005**: Exposure of sensitive information in output files (High impact, Medium likelihood).
5. **Threat ID 0004**: Compromise of fabric patterns (Medium impact, Low likelihood).

## Mitigation Recommendations
