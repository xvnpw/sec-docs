# Threat Modeling Analysis for the Fabric Agent Action Project Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

**Project Name:** Fabric Agent Action

**Description:** Fabric Agent Action is a GitHub Action that automates complex workflows using an agent-based approach, leveraging Fabric Patterns and Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows users to execute various fabric patterns based on input instructions, making it useful for tasks like summarization, analysis, and content generation.

### Key Components and Features

- **Agent Types:** Supports multiple agent types (`router`, `react`, `react_issue`, `react_pr`) for different use cases.
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Integrates with various LLM providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic).
- **Configuration Options:** Users can customize agent behavior, input/output files, and pattern management.
- **Security Controls:** Implements access control patterns to prevent unauthorized usage.

### Dependencies

- **Python Libraries:** langchain, langgraph, pydantic, etc.
- **LLM Providers:** OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic.

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective:** Compromise systems using the Fabric Agent Action by exploiting weaknesses in the project, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or manipulation of workflows.

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. **Inject Malicious Code into the Project**
   - Modify the action's code or configuration files to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors.

2. **Exploit Existing Vulnerabilities**
   - Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in dependencies or the action itself.

3. **Compromise Distribution Channels**
   - Manipulate the GitHub repository or CI/CD pipelines to distribute malicious versions of the action.

4. **Leverage Misconfigurations**
   - Exploit common misconfigurations in GitHub Actions or repository settings that could allow unauthorized access.
