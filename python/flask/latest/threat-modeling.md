# APPLICATION THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
1. **API Keys**: Sensitive keys for OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Anthropic that are used to authenticate requests to LLM providers.
2. **User Input Data**: Data provided by users through GitHub issues, comments, and pull requests that may contain sensitive information.
3. **Fabric Patterns**: The patterns used by the Fabric Agent Action to process user requests and generate outputs.
4. **Output Files**: Files generated by the action that may contain processed data or results from LLM interactions.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **GitHub Repository**: The boundary between the trusted environment (repository) and untrusted external users who can create issues or comments.
2. **LLM Providers**: The boundary between the application and external LLM services (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic) that process user data.
3. **Local Environment**: The boundary between the application running in the GitHub Actions environment and the local development environment where patterns are updated.

## DATA FLOWS
1. **User Input to GitHub Action**: Data flows from user comments/issues to the GitHub Action.
2. **GitHub Action to LLM Providers**: Data flows from the GitHub Action to the LLM providers for processing.
3. **LLM Providers to GitHub Action**: Processed data flows back from the LLM providers to the GitHub Action.
4. **GitHub Action to Output Files**: The final output is written to files in the repository.

## APPLICATION THREATS

| THREAT ID | COMPONENT NAME | THREAT NAME | STRIDE CATEGORY | WHY APPLICABLE | HOW MITIGATED | MITIGATION | LIKELIHOOD EXPLANATION | IMPACT EXPLANATION | RISK SEVERITY |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 0001 | GitHub Action | Unauthorized access to API keys | Spoofing | If API keys are exposed, unauthorized users can access LLM services. | API keys are stored in GitHub secrets. | Use environment variables to store sensitive data securely. | Low | Unauthorized access could lead to significant costs and data exposure. | High |
| 0002 | GitHub Action | Injection of malicious input | Tampering | Malicious users could inject harmful data through issues/comments. | Input validation is performed before processing. | Implement strict input validation and sanitization. | Medium | Malicious input could lead to unexpected behavior or data leaks. | High |
| 0003 | LLM Providers | Data leakage from LLM responses | Information Disclosure | Sensitive user data could be unintentionally included in LLM responses. | Responses are logged for debugging but not stored permanently. | Implement strict output filtering to remove sensitive information. | Medium | Data leakage could harm user privacy and trust. | High |
| 0004 | GitHub Action | Denial of Service via excessive requests | Denial of Service | Users could spam the action with requests, leading to resource exhaustion. | Rate limiting is implemented in the action. | Implement additional rate limiting and monitoring. | Medium | Service unavailability could disrupt user workflows. | Medium |
| 0005 | GitHub Action | Unauthorized execution of workflows | Spoofing | Unauthorized users could trigger workflows through PRs or comments. | Access control checks are in place for PRs and comments. | Enhance access control mechanisms to restrict execution. | Low | Unauthorized execution could lead to unexpected costs or data exposure. | High |

# DEPLOYMENT THREAT MODEL

## DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURES
1. **GitHub Actions**: The primary deployment architecture where the Fabric Agent Action runs.
2. **Docker Container**: The action is packaged as a Docker container for execution.

## ASSETS
1. **Docker Image**: The Docker image containing the Fabric Agent Action code and dependencies.
2. **GitHub Repository**: The repository where the action is stored and managed.
3. **Secrets**: API keys and other sensitive information stored in GitHub secrets.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **GitHub Actions Environment**: The boundary between the GitHub Actions environment and external users.
2. **Docker Registry**: The boundary between the Docker registry and the GitHub Actions environment.

|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 0001 | Docker Image | Compromised Docker image | A compromised image could lead to malicious code execution. | Images are built from trusted sources. | Use image signing and verification. | Medium | A compromised image could lead to data breaches or service disruption. | High |
| 0002 | GitHub Actions | Unauthorized access to repository | Unauthorized users could gain access to the repository and modify workflows. | Access control is enforced through GitHub permissions. | Regularly review and update access permissions. | Low | Unauthorized access could lead to malicious changes in workflows. | High |
| 0003 | Docker Registry | Man-in-the-middle attack during image pull | An attacker could intercept the image during the pull process. | Use HTTPS for secure image pulls. | Implement image scanning for vulnerabilities. | Low | A successful attack could lead to the deployment of compromised images. | High |

# BUILD THREAT MODEL

## ASSETS
1. **Source Code**: The codebase of the Fabric Agent Action.
2. **Build Scripts**: Scripts used to build and publish the Docker image.
3. **CI/CD Configuration**: Configuration files for CI/CD pipelines.

## TRUST BOUNDARIES
1. **CI/CD Environment**: The boundary between the CI/CD environment and the source code repository.
2. **External Dependencies**: The boundary between the application and external libraries or services.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
1. What are the specific user roles and permissions in the GitHub repository?
2. Are there any additional security measures in place for the LLM providers?
3. What is the expected volume of user interactions with the Fabric Agent Action?
4. Are there any specific compliance requirements that need to be considered?

### Assumptions
- The GitHub repository is public, allowing anyone to create issues and comments.
- API keys are stored securely in GitHub secrets.
- The application is expected to handle a moderate volume of user interactions without significant performance degradation.
