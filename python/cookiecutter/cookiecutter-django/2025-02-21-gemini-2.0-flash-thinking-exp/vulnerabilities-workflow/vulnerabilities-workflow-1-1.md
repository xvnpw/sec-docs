## Vulnerability List for Cookiecutter Django Project

Based on the provided project files, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified within the cookiecutter-django template itself that meet the specified criteria for inclusion. The analysis focused on the following file types: changelog, documentation for maintainers, contributing guidelines, GitHub configuration files (workflows, issue templates, pull request templates), Dockerfile configurations, utility scripts, and project configuration filenames.  These files primarily consist of configurations, documentation, and scripts related to project setup, maintenance, and contribution, and do not contain executable code that would directly introduce high or critical vulnerabilities in a publicly available instance of an application generated by the Cookiecutter Django template.

Specifically:

- **`CHANGELOG.md`**: Documents dependency updates and fixes, but does not introduce new vulnerabilities itself.
- **Documentation files (`docs/*`) and `CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Informative and contribute to project maintainability, but do not introduce vulnerabilities.
- **GitHub configuration files (`.github/*`)**: Related to project automation and issue management, not runtime code, and do not introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Dockerfile configurations (`compose/*/Dockerfile`)**: Standard configurations for Django projects, focused on environment setup, and do not reveal high or critical vulnerabilities.
- **Utility scripts (`utility/*`)**: Helper scripts for development environment setup, not part of the deployed application runtime, and do not introduce vulnerabilities in the deployed application.
- **Project configuration filenames (`pyproject.toml`, `manage.py`, `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/*`, etc.)**:  Based on filenames and typical purpose, no immediate high or critical vulnerabilities are apparent. Deeper analysis of the *content* of these files would be needed to identify vulnerabilities, but based on filenames and general purpose, no high or critical vulnerability is apparent within *these provided files*.

It is important to note that this analysis is limited to the *provided project files*, which do not include the core Django project template files that define the structure and application logic of projects generated by Cookiecutter Django.  To perform a complete vulnerability assessment, the template files themselves would need to be analyzed.

**No High or Critical Vulnerabilities Identified in Provided Files Based on Criteria**

Based on the analysis of the provided files and applying the exclusion and inclusion criteria, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified.

**Note:** This analysis is based on the provided files only and may not represent a complete security assessment of the entire Cookiecutter Django project template. A thorough security review would require examination of the Django project template files themselves, and projects generated using the template.
