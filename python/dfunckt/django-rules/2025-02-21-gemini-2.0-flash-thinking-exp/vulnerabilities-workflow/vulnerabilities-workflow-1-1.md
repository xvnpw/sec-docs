## Vulnerability list:

**No high-rank vulnerabilities found**

After a thorough review of the project files for `django-rules`, considering the perspective of an external attacker targeting a publicly available instance of an application using this library, and applying the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, no vulnerabilities of high rank were identified within the `django-rules` project itself.

The focus was on potential vulnerabilities within the library's code, excluding issues arising from insecure usage patterns by developers, missing documentation, or denial of service scenarios. The analysis specifically looked for valid, unmitigated vulnerabilities of high or critical rank.

The `django-rules` library is designed for authorization in Django applications. Its codebase is centered around implementing permission and rule logic. The code structure appears robust and does not exhibit common web application vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, cross-site scripting, or CSRF *within the library itself*. The core authorization logic seems sound, and the library provides tools for effective permission integration in Django projects.

It's important to note that while developers using `django-rules` might introduce vulnerabilities through misconfigurations or flawed rule definitions in their *applications*, these are not vulnerabilities *in* the `django-rules` library itself.  Such application-level issues are outside the scope of vulnerabilities within the `django-rules` project as per the given instructions to focus on the library's code and exclude vulnerabilities caused by user's insecure code patterns.

Therefore, based on the project files and the specified constraints, there are no high-rank vulnerabilities to report for the `django-rules` project that meet the given criteria for an external attacker exploiting a publicly available instance and are not due to user-introduced insecure code patterns when using the library.
