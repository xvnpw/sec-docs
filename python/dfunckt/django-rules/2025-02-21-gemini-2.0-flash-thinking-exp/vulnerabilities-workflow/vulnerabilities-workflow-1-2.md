- **Vulnerability Name:** Production DEBUG Mode Enabled  
  - **Description:**  
    An external attacker can force an error (for example, by visiting a non-existent URL or provoking an exception in a view) and cause Django to render a detailed error page. Because the settings file (/code/tests/testapp/settings.py) sets `DEBUG = True`, internal configuration details (including file paths, stack traces, and variable values) are revealed. This step‐by‐step process would involve:  
      1. Deploying the application using the provided test settings.  
      2. Sending a crafted request to trigger an application error.  
      3. Receiving an error page that discloses internal details, allowing the attacker to learn about the application’s internals and identify further exploitable vulnerabilities.
  - **Impact:**  
    Disclosure of sensitive information (such as code structure, configuration details, and possibly database information) greatly assists attackers in conducting targeted follow‐up attacks. This can lead to complete system compromise.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    None. The settings file explicitly sets `DEBUG = True` without any conditional switching.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    Use a production settings file that sets `DEBUG = False` and ensures that sensitive error details are hidden from end users.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The vulnerable configuration is deployed to a production environment (or any publicly accessible instance) without switching off DEBUG mode.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    In the file `/code/tests/testapp/settings.py`, the code contains the line:  
    ```python
    DEBUG = True
    ```  
    This value is never overridden based on environment, so any error page will include detailed Django traceback information.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application using the settings as provided.  
    2. Manually trigger an error (e.g., by accessing a URL that does not exist or by causing an exception in a view).  
    3. Observe whether a detailed error page with debug tracebacks and sensitive configuration information is displayed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Missing CSRF Protection  
  - **Description:**  
    The application’s middleware configuration (in `/code/tests/testapp/settings.py`) does not include the CSRF protection middleware. An attacker from a remote site can craft a malicious HTML page that automatically sends forged requests to state-changing endpoints (for example, URLs associated with changing or deleting a “Book”). By luring an authenticated user to visit this page, the attacker can trigger unauthorized actions without the user’s intent. The attack steps would be:  
      1. Create an HTML page that issues a request (GET or POST) to a sensitive URL such as `/1/change/` using the victim’s browser.  
      2. Host this page on a controlled domain.  
      3. Trick an authenticated user into visiting the page, thereby executing the request without a valid CSRF token.
  - **Impact:**  
    This flaw can allow attackers to perform unauthorized operations on behalf of trusted users—compromising application integrity and data security.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    None. The middleware list in `/code/tests/testapp/settings.py` is:  
    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
      "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
      "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
      "django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware",
    ]
    ```  
    Notice that `"django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware"` is missing.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    Add `"django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware"` to the middleware configuration and ensure that all state‐changing views require a valid CSRF token (and use proper HTTP methods such as POST).
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The application is deployed with the given settings (or similar misconfiguration) which omit CSRF protection, and the affected views are accessible to authenticated users.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    In `/code/tests/testapp/settings.py`, the MIDDLEWARE setting does not list the CSRF middleware. As a result, Django will not check incoming requests for a CSRF token even if the view performs sensitive actions.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application with the settings as provided.  
    2. From an attacker-controlled site, serve an HTML page that automatically submits a request (using the victim’s logged-in browser session) to an endpoint such as `/1/change/` or `/1/delete/`.  
    3. Confirm that the request is accepted and processed even though no CSRF token is present.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Missing ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration  
  - **Description:**  
    The settings file (/code/tests/testapp/settings.py) does not specify an ALLOWED_HOSTS list. In production, Django relies on this setting to validate the Host header of incoming requests. An attacker can exploit this by sending requests with manipulated Host headers, potentially leading to host header injection attacks. The typical exploitation involves:  
      1. Deploying the application with DEBUG turned off (or in production mode) yet without an ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration.  
      2. Crafting HTTP requests using malicious or unexpected Host header values.  
      3. Causing the application to behave unpredictably (e.g., in URL generation, cache poisoning, or even bypassing certain security checks).
  - **Impact:**  
    Without a whitelist of allowed hosts, the application becomes vulnerable to host header attacks. This can lead to misdirected links, improper URL generation, and downstream attacks such as cache poisoning or redirection to malicious sites.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    None. The `/code/tests/testapp/settings.py` file does not define an ALLOWED_HOSTS setting.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    Define ALLOWED_HOSTS with a list of domain names and/or IP addresses that are permitted to serve the application. For example, set:  
    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["yourdomain.com"]
    ```  
    in the production settings.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    The application is deployed in a production-like environment (typically with DEBUG=False) without an ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    Review of `/code/tests/testapp/settings.py` shows no assignment to ALLOWED_HOSTS. In the absence of this setting, Django’s default behavior (an empty list) will not adequately validate incoming Host headers in a production scenario.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application with DEBUG set to False and without setting ALLOWED_HOSTS.  
    2. Send an HTTP request with a Host header that is not among the legitimate domains (for example, using a tool like curl with a custom Host header).  
    3. Observe whether the application accepts the request without proper host validation, confirming the vulnerability.
