## Attack Tree Path: [Generate Malicious/Unintended Content](./attack_tree_paths/generate_maliciousunintended_content.md)

**Critical Node: Prompt Injection/Manipulation**
    *   **Attack Vector: Craft prompts to generate NSFW, offensive, or harmful images**
        *   **Description:** Attackers directly instruct StyleGAN through text prompts to create undesirable content.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Moderate (Reputational damage, user offense, legal issues)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Attack Vector: Bypass content filters through prompt engineering**
        *   **Description:** Attackers use subtle phrasing or encoding tricks in prompts to evade content filters and generate harmful content.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Moderate (Filter bypass, consistent generation of harmful content)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access/Control](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_accesscontrol.md)

**Critical Node: Resource Exhaustion (DoS via StyleGAN)**
    *   **Attack Vector: Send excessive generation requests to overload GPU resources**
        *   **Description:** Attackers flood the application with numerous image generation requests, overwhelming the GPU and causing service denial.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
        *   **Impact:** Significant (Service unavailability, financial loss)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Attack Vector: Craft complex prompts or style vectors that require excessive computation**
        *   **Description:** Attackers design prompts or style vectors that are computationally expensive for StyleGAN to process, leading to resource exhaustion and slowdowns.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Significant (Service slowdown, resource exhaustion)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Critical Node: API Abuse (if API exposed)**
    *   **Attack Vector: Bypass rate limiting to flood the service with requests**
        *   **Description:** If an API is exposed, attackers attempt to circumvent rate limiting mechanisms to send a large volume of requests, leading to DoS.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Significant (Service unavailability, resource exhaustion)
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
