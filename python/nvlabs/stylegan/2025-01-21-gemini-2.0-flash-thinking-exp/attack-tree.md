## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using StyleGAN [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_stylegan__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security through exploitation of the StyleGAN integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model Poisoning [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_poisoning__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to corrupt the StyleGAN model by injecting malicious data into its training process. This leads to the model generating biased, harmful, or predictable outputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Training Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_training_data__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to breach the security of the systems and storage containing the training data used for StyleGAN. This is a prerequisite for model poisoning.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Training Samples [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_training_samples__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  If the application allows external contributions to the training data without proper validation, an attacker can inject crafted malicious samples designed to bias the model's learning.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium
        * **Impact:** Critical
        * **Effort:** Moderate
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Training Data Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_training_data_storage__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the infrastructure storing the training data (e.g., cloud storage, databases) to gain unauthorized access and inject malicious data directly.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium
        * **Impact:** Critical
        * **Effort:** Moderate
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
