## Attack Tree Path: [1. Generate Targeted Deepfakes [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__generate_targeted_deepfakes__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the most significant threat, aiming to create realistic but fake images or videos for malicious purposes (e.g., disinformation, impersonation, fraud).
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.2. Gain Access to Training Data Source [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:*  The attacker needs to access the data used to train the StyleGAN model. This is a prerequisite for data poisoning.
        *   *Methods:*
            *   **1.1.2.1. Compromise Data Storage:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage system (e.g., cloud bucket misconfiguration, server vulnerabilities).
            *   **1.1.2.2. Social Engineering/Phishing:**  Tricking individuals with access to the data into revealing credentials or granting access.
    *   **1.2. Fine-Tune Pre-trained Model with Malicious Data (Post-Deployment) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:*  After the model is deployed, the attacker attempts to modify its behavior by fine-tuning it with a carefully crafted dataset.
        *   *Methods:*
            *   **1.2.1. Gain Access to Model Weights and Fine-tuning Scripts [CRITICAL]**
                *   *Description:*  The attacker needs to obtain the model's parameters and the code used for fine-tuning.
                *   *Methods:*
                    *   **1.2.1.1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application Code:**  Using vulnerabilities like path traversal or remote code execution (RCE) to access files on the server.
                    *   **1.2.1.2. Compromise Server Hosting the Model:**  Gaining full control of the server through various attack vectors (e.g., exploiting unpatched software, weak passwords).
            *   **1.2.2. Craft Malicious Fine-tuning Dataset:**  Creating a dataset that, when used for fine-tuning, will cause the model to generate the desired malicious output.
    *   **1.3. Manipulate Latent Space Input (Post-Deployment) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:*  The attacker attempts to directly control the output of the model by manipulating the input latent vectors.
        *   *Methods:*
            *   **1.3.1. Reverse Engineer Latent Space Mapping:**  Studying the model's behavior to understand how changes in the latent vector affect the output image.
            *   **1.3.2. Craft Specific Latent Vectors to Generate Desired Output:**  Using optimization algorithms or other techniques to find latent vectors that produce the desired malicious images.
            *   **1.3.3. Intercept and Modify Legitimate Latent Vectors:**  Performing a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and alter the latent vectors sent by legitimate users.
    * **1.4. Adversarial Attacks on the Generator [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* Crafting special inputs that, while appearing normal to a human, cause the StyleGAN model to produce a specific, targeted, and malicious output.
        * *Methods:*
            *   **1.4.1.1 Use adversarial example generation techniques:** Applying algorithms designed to find small perturbations to inputs that cause misclassification or other undesired behavior in machine learning models.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Bypass Facial Recognition Systems](./attack_tree_paths/2__bypass_facial_recognition_systems.md)

*   **2.1.2. Adversarial attack on the *recognition* system, using StyleGAN to generate adversarial examples. [HIGH RISK]**
    *   *Description:* Using StyleGAN to generate images that are specifically designed to fool a facial recognition system, either to evade detection or to be misclassified as someone else. This is an attack on the *recognition* system, not StyleGAN itself, but leverages StyleGAN's capabilities.
*   **2.2. Generate Images that Impersonate Others [HIGH RISK]**
    *   *Description:*  Creating images that are recognized as a specific target individual by a facial recognition system.
    *   *Methods:*
        *   **2.2.1. Similar to 1.1 and 1.2 (Poisoning/Fine-tuning):**  Using data poisoning or fine-tuning techniques, but with the specific goal of making the model generate images of the target individual.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/3__cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **3.1.1.1. Exploit Lack of Rate Limiting on API Endpoint [CRITICAL]**
    *   *Description:*  Sending a large number of requests to the StyleGAN inference endpoint, overwhelming the server and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
*   **3.2. Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]**
    *   *Description:*  Causing the server to run out of resources (CPU, memory, GPU) by exploiting vulnerabilities in the StyleGAN implementation or its dependencies.
    *   *Methods:*
        *   **3.2.1.1. Send crafted inputs designed to trigger excessive memory allocation:**  Finding inputs that cause the model to allocate large amounts of memory, potentially leading to a crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Model Stealing/Reproduction](./attack_tree_paths/4__model_stealingreproduction.md)

*   **4.1.1.1. Exploit Lack of Query Limits or Monitoring [CRITICAL]**
    *   *Description:*  Making a large number of requests to the StyleGAN API to collect input-output pairs, which can then be used to train a surrogate model that mimics the original.
* **4.2.1. Similar to 1.2.1 (Gain Access to Model Weights) [CRITICAL]**
    * *Description:* Directly obtaining the model's parameters, allowing the attacker to create an exact copy of the model. This uses the same attack vectors as 1.2.1.
