# Threat Model Analysis for nvlabs/stylegan

## Threat: [Malicious Model Substitution](./threats/malicious_model_substitution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate StyleGAN `.pkl` (or other model format) file with a crafted malicious version.  Access could be gained via compromised server infrastructure, supply chain attacks, or social engineering. The malicious model could generate biased, offensive, privacy-violating outputs, or cause resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Generation of inappropriate/harmful content.
    *   Reputational damage.
    *   Privacy violations (if the malicious model leaks training data).
    *   Denial-of-service (resource exhaustion).
    *   Potential legal liability.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `dnnlib.tflib.Network` (or equivalent for model loading). The function that deserializes the model.
    *   The model file itself (`.pkl` or other).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Cryptographic Hashing:** Calculate a strong hash (SHA-256+) of the legitimate model. Store this hash securely and *separately*. Verify before loading.
    *   **Secure Model Storage:** Restricted access, ACLs, dedicated secure model repository.
    *   **Digital Signatures:** Sign the model file; verify the signature before loading.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Re-verify the hash, review access logs.

## Threat: [Input Manipulation (Latent Vector/Parameter Tampering)](./threats/input_manipulation__latent_vectorparameter_tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates numerical inputs to StyleGAN (latent vectors, `psi`, noise, style mixing) to force undesirable outputs.  They might find "sensitive regions" in the latent space. This is *not* about general adversarial examples, but targeted manipulation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Generation of targeted inappropriate content.
    *   Circumvention of output filters.
    *   Amplification of subtle biases.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `run_generator.py` (or equivalent for input handling).
    *   `Gs.run()` (or equivalent) that takes the latent vector, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Rigorous validation for *all* numerical inputs. Enforce ranges, data types, allowed values.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Remove potentially harmful characters/patterns.
    *   **Latent Space Exploration/Monitoring:** Identify "sensitive regions" and monitor for inputs targeting them.
    *   **Randomization:** Add controlled randomness to inputs.

## Threat: [Training Data Leakage (Model Inversion)](./threats/training_data_leakage__model_inversion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts inputs to elicit outputs revealing information about the training data (model inversion). They might try to reconstruct faces or other sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privacy violations (if training data contains PII).
    *   Exposure of confidential data.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   The trained StyleGAN model (`.pkl` file - learned weights/biases).
    *   `Gs.run()` (or equivalent) - the inference function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Differential Privacy (During Training):** Use DP techniques during training. This is the *most effective* mitigation.
    *   **Careful Training Data Selection:** Avoid PII. Use strong anonymization/pseudonymization if PII is unavoidable.
    *   **Output Filtering:** Detect/block outputs resembling sensitive data/training examples (reactive, less reliable).
    *   **Membership Inference Attack Testing:** Assess vulnerability to revealing training data membership.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker sends many requests or crafts malicious inputs (large latent vectors, unusual parameters) to consume excessive CPU/GPU/memory, causing a DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application unavailability.
    *   Increased costs (cloud resources).
    *   Potential cascading failures.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `run_generator.py` (or equivalent) - inference request entry point.
    *   `Gs.run()` (or equivalent) - inference function.
    *   The entire StyleGAN model and libraries (TensorFlow, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit requests per IP/user.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Limit CPU/GPU time, memory per request.
    *   **Input Validation:** (As in Threat 2) - reject bad inputs.
    *   **Timeouts:** Prevent requests from running indefinitely.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute requests across servers.
    *   **Model Optimization:** Optimize for inference speed/efficiency.

## Threat: [Code Modification (Tampering with StyleGAN Code)](./threats/code_modification__tampering_with_stylegan_code_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to and modifies the StyleGAN source code (original NVIDIA or your modifications) to introduce malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of the StyleGAN component.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   All other impacts (depending on modification).
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   All StyleGAN source code (`.py` files, etc.).
    *   Custom code interacting with StyleGAN.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Source Code Control/Versioning:** Strict access controls, strong authentication.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory reviews for *all* changes.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Scan for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Manage, pin, and audit dependencies.
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Calculate and verify hashes of source files.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Implementation Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in the StyleGAN code (or dependencies like TensorFlow) for unauthorized access/control. Less likely with a well-vetted library, but possible.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   Complete system compromise.
    *   Data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Potentially any part of StyleGAN or dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Software Updated:** Update StyleGAN, TensorFlow, all dependencies.
    *   **Security Audits:** Regular audits, penetration testing.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run inference in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Detect known vulnerabilities.
