- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Settings File Inclusion  
  **Description:**  
  The core function for including settings files (the `include()` function in `split_settings/tools.py`) uses Python’s built‐in `compile()` and `exec()` functions to execute the complete content of every file matching the provided glob pattern. An external attacker who manages to—via a file upload vulnerability or misconfigured file system permissions—place or modify a file in the settings directory can inject arbitrary Python code. In a step‐by‐step scenario, an attacker would:  
  1. Exploit a separate vulnerability (e.g. an insecure file upload endpoint or misconfigured file permissions) to write a new Python file (for example, `malicious.py`) into a directory that is later included by the settings loader.  
  2. Craft the file with arbitrary code (for instance, code that calls `os.system()` to execute system commands or writes sensitive data to an external location).  
  3. Cause the application (or test process) to run its settings loader—by, for example, restarting the server or triggering a settings reload—so that the `include()` function picks up the malicious file via its glob pattern and executes its contents.  
  **Impact:**  
  Successfully triggering this vulnerability would result in remote (or locally escalated) arbitrary code execution. The attacker could compromise the entire system, access sensitive data, or pivot to other network targets.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The library is designed with the assumption that only trusted, version‐controlled settings files will be present, so no explicit runtime checks are performed on file ownership, permissions, or digital signatures.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No validation or integrity checks of the settings files are performed before executing them.  
  - There is no sandboxing or whitelisting mechanism to restrict which files may be executed by the loader.  
  - No secure file–system permissions enforcement or runtime file verification is built into the logic.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to write or modify files in the settings directory. This could occur if file system permissions are misconfigured or if another vulnerability (such as an insecure file upload handler) exists in the broader application.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `split_settings/tools.py`, the `include()` function starts by resolving file paths relative to a trusted base (using `os.path.dirname(scope['__file__'])`).  
  - It then uses `glob.glob()` on each passed file pattern to obtain files to include.  
  - For each resolved file, it opens the file in binary mode (`open(included_file, 'rb')`), compiles its full content with `compile(..., 'exec')`, and immediately executes it via `exec(compiled_code, scope)`.  
  - No checks (e.g. verifying the file’s origin, integrity or permissions) are performed before running the file’s code.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:** In a controlled test environment, simulate the settings directory as used by the application.  
  2. **Insertion:** Create a file (e.g. `malicious.py`) in that directory containing easily verifiable malicious Python code (for example, code that writes a new file named `compromised.txt` containing a known marker string).  
  3. **Trigger:** Force the application to load its settings (for instance, by restarting the Django application so that the settings are re‑merged using the `include()` function).  
  4. **Verify:** Check for the presence and content of `compromised.txt` (or the appropriate artifact)—its existence confirms that the malicious code was executed.  
  5. **Cleanup & Logging:** Ensure that proper logging is in place to capture the event, which should alert security teams to the abnormal file inclusion.

- **Vulnerability Name:** TOCTOU Race Condition in Settings File Inclusion  
  **Description:**  
  In the same `include()` function, there is a potential race condition between the time the file paths are discovered (via `glob.glob()`) and the time each file is opened and executed. An attacker who already has the ability to write to the settings directory may modify the file content in the very short time window between its discovery and its execution. The step‑by-step process would be:  
  1. The `include()` function calls `glob.glob()` and retrieves a list of settings files based on a glob pattern.  
  2. Before the file is opened using `open(included_file, 'rb')`, an attacker (with write permissions) replaces or modifies that file’s content with malicious code.  
  3. The `include()` function then opens and compiles the now–malicious file, executing it with `exec()`.  
  **Impact:**  
  This race condition can lead to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise; even if the settings file originally was benign, changing it in the critical window leads to execution of attacker–supplied code.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - There is no mechanism in the code to ensure atomicity between the file listing and file reading operations.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - The code does not implement any file locking or atomic file-opening strategy to ensure that the content read is the same as was listed.  
  - There is no verification (e.g. using cryptographic hashes or signatures) of the file content prior to executing it.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must have file system write access such that they can modify files in the settings directory during the narrow window between when the file is discovered by `glob.glob()` and when it’s opened and executed.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The function gathers file paths using `files_to_include = glob.glob(pattern)`.  
  - It then iterates over each file and (without any further checks) calls `open(included_file, 'rb')` to read and compile the file contents.  
  - There is no mechanism (like file locking, timestamps comparison, or content verification) ensuring that the file contents have not been altered between these two operations.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:** In a controlled environment with the appropriate file system permissions, prepare a benign settings file (e.g. `settings.py`) in the designated directory.  
  2. **Simulated Race:**  
     - Modify the test harness so that immediately after the file is listed by `glob.glob()`, but before it is opened, a parallel process (or a deliberately inserted delay combined with a trigger) replaces or modifies the file content (for instance, inserting code that creates a file named `race_triggered.txt` with a known marker).  
  3. **Trigger:** Execute the settings loader (`include()` function) in this environment.  
  4. **Verify:** Check whether the modified (malicious) payload was executed by verifying the creation and content of `race_triggered.txt`.  
  5. **Result Analysis:**  
     - A successful test will show that the file modification in the race window was executed, confirming the TOCTOU vulnerability.
