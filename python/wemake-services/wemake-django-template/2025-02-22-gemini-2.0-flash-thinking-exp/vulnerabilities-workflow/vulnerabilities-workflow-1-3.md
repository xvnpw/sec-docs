After reviewing the vulnerability list and applying the exclusion and inclusion criteria, the "Missing Rate Limiting in Caddy Configuration" vulnerability is valid for inclusion.

Here's the updated list in markdown format:

### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Missing Rate Limiting in Caddy Configuration
- Description: The default Caddy configuration for production deployments in `wemake-django-template` does not include rate limiting. This absence allows external attackers to perform brute-force attacks against login forms, API endpoints, or other sensitive application areas without significant impediment. By sending a high volume of requests in a short timeframe, attackers can attempt to guess credentials or exploit vulnerabilities, as there are no mechanisms to block or throttle their access attempts.
- Impact: High. The lack of rate limiting exposes the application to brute-force attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access, account compromise, and data breaches. Successful brute-force attacks can severely impact confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None in the default Caddy configuration provided by the template. While the template's Dockerfile for Caddy includes the rate limiting plugin, it is not activated or configured in the default setup.
- Missing mitigations: Rate limiting should be implemented and enabled by default in the Caddy configuration to protect against brute-force attacks. A basic rate limiting configuration should be included in the `Caddyfile` template.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must be deployed using the production Docker Compose setup as provided by the `wemake-django-template`.
    - The deployed application must be publicly accessible over the internet (e.g., ports 80 and 443 are exposed).
    - The application must have some form of authentication or an endpoint susceptible to brute-force attacks (e.g., a login form, API authentication).
- Source code analysis:
    1. Dockerfile (`{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/docker/caddy/Dockerfile`):
        - The Dockerfile for Caddy is designed to include the `caddy-ratelimit` plugin.
        - ```dockerfile
        FROM caddy:2.8.4-builder AS builder
        # Add rate_limit plugin
        RUN xcaddy build --with github.com/mholt/caddy-ratelimit

        FROM caddy:2.8.4
        # Copy custom Caddy
        COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
        ```
        - This confirms that the capability for rate limiting is built into the custom Caddy image.
    2. Caddy Configuration (`{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/docker/caddy/Caddyfile`):
        - The template *does not* include a default `Caddyfile` within the project files.
        - The `docker-compose.prod.yml` file mounts `./docker/caddy/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`, expecting a configuration file to be present at that location.
        - Without a default `Caddyfile` provided by the template, users must manually create and configure it, including rate limiting.
        - **Visualization:**
        ```
        [User] ---Requests---> [Public Internet] ---Port 80/443---> [Caddy (No Rate Limit Config)] ---Proxy---> [Django Application]
        ```
        - The diagram illustrates the request flow reaching the Django application through Caddy, but without any rate limiting implemented in Caddy in the default template configuration.
    3. Docker Compose Production Configuration (`{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/docker-compose.prod.yml`):
        - The production Docker Compose setup uses the custom Caddy image built with the rate limiting plugin.
        - It mounts a `Caddyfile` from the host to `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` in the container.
        - However, it relies on the user to provide this `Caddyfile` with the necessary rate limiting directives.
- Security test case:
    1. Deploy the generated project in production mode using `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up --build`. Ensure the application is accessible via a public IP or domain.
    2. Identify a publicly accessible endpoint that requires authentication or could be targeted for brute-force attacks. For example, the Django admin login page `/admin/`.
    3. Use a brute-force tool such as `hydra` or `Burp Suite Intruder`. Configure the tool to send a rapid series of login requests with incorrect credentials to the target endpoint (e.g., `/admin/login/`).
    4. Monitor the server's response. Observe that the server processes and responds to each request without blocking or delaying subsequent requests, even when thousands of failed attempts are made in quick succession.
    5. **Expected result:** The server should respond to all brute-force attempts, demonstrating the absence of rate limiting. This confirms the vulnerability as an attacker can continue to make unlimited login attempts.
    6. **To verify mitigation (after implementing rate limiting):** Repeat steps 1-3 after configuring rate limiting in `Caddyfile`.
    7. **Expected mitigated result:** After a certain number of failed attempts from the same IP within a defined time window, Caddy should start to delay or block requests, preventing effective brute-force attacks. For example, requests after exceeding the limit might be rejected with a 429 "Too Many Requests" error, or significantly delayed.
