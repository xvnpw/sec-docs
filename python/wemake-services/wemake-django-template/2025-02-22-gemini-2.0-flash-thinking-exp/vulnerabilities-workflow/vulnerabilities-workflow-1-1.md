Based on the provided project files, and after applying the filtering criteria for external attackers and high-rank vulnerabilities, here's an updated analysis:

## Vulnerability List

**Vulnerability Name:** No high-rank vulnerabilities identified based on the specified criteria.

**Description:** No vulnerabilities ranked "high" or "critical" were found in the project template that are exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance, and are not excluded by the defined criteria. This assessment focuses on vulnerabilities inherent to the template itself and its default configurations, excluding those arising from developer-introduced insecure coding practices, missing documentation-only mitigations, or denial of service issues.

**Impact:** N/A - No vulnerability identified.

**Vulnerability Rank:** N/A - No vulnerability identified.

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** N/A - No vulnerability identified. The project template incorporates various security best practices and tools by default, which effectively mitigate common high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in publicly available instances based on the provided criteria.

**Missing Mitigations:** N/A - No vulnerability identified. Based on the analysis focused on high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in publicly available instances and excluding developer-introduced issues, documentation-only mitigations, and DoS, no further mitigations are deemed necessary within the scope of the project template itself.

**Preconditions:** N/A - No vulnerability identified.

**Source Code Analysis:** N/A - No vulnerability identified. The source code of the project template was reviewed, focusing on identifying potential high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in publicly available instances, excluding those caused by developer-specific code, documentation gaps, or DoS. The analysis indicates a strong security baseline in the template's structure and default configurations.

**Security Test Case:** N/A - No vulnerability identified. Based on the defined scope and filtering criteria, security testing focused on identifying high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in a publicly available instance of an application built using this template. No such vulnerabilities were detected in the template itself. Further application-specific security testing would be necessary for projects built using this template, but is outside the scope of this analysis focused on the template and the defined criteria.
