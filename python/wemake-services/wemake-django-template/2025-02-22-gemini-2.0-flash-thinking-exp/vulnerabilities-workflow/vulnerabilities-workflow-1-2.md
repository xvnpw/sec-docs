- **Vulnerability: Insecure Remote Script Execution in Docker Build Process**
  - **Description**:
    The Dockerfiles for both Django and Caddy (for example, in `/docker/django/Dockerfile`) use commands that pipe remote content directly into an interpreter. In particular, commands such as
    ```
    curl -sSL 'https://install.python-poetry.org' | python -
    ```
    and
    ```
    curl -o /usr/local/bin/tini -sSLO "https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini-${dpkgArch}"
    ```
    download and immediately execute remote scripts and binaries. An attacker with man‐in‐the‐middle capabilities (or one who compromises the remote host) could intercept these HTTPS requests (especially if strict certificate pinning or integrity verification is not applied) and substitute a malicious payload. When the build process runs these commands, the attacker’s code would be executed inside the container, thereby compromising the build and later the production runtime.
    To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to intercept the HTTPS connection during the container build (for example, by controlling a proxy between the CI/CD system and the internet) and serve a malicious version of the installer or binary.
  - **Impact**:
    If exploited, the attacker could run arbitrary code in the build environment. This in turn can lead to compromised container images (or even a full container takeover), which may then be deployed in production—enabling data exfiltration, persistent backdoors, or further lateral movement in the network.
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - The commands use HTTPS (via the `-sSL` flags), which provides basic transport encryption.
    - Builds run in isolated containerized environments.
  - **Missing Mitigations**:
    - No certificate pinning or cryptographic integrity checking is performed on the downloaded scripts/binaries.
    - There is no fallback or verification step (such as comparing an expected checksum or signing) to ensure that the downloaded content is authentic.
  - **Preconditions**:
    - The attacker must be positioned to perform a man‐in‐the-middle attack (for example, by controlling network traffic between the build server and the remote host or by compromising the remote host itself).
    - The build process must run in an environment where interception is possible (CI/CD systems without strict TLS validation on outbound requests).
  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    - In `/docker/django/Dockerfile`:
      - The command
        ```
        curl -sSL 'https://install.python-poetry.org' | python -
        ```
        downloads and immediately executes the installation script for Poetry without verifying its integrity.
      - Similarly, Tini is downloaded using
        ```
        curl -o /usr/local/bin/tini -sSLO "https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini-${dpkgArch}"
        ```
        without any hash or digital signature check.
    - No additional steps are taken (e.g., comparing file hashes or verifying signatures) that would protect against the content being tampered with in transit.
  - **Security Test Case**:
    1. Set up an intercepting proxy (using a tool such as mitmproxy) between the build environment and the internet.
    2. Configure the build environment (or CI/CD system) to route its HTTPS traffic through the proxy.
    3. Using the proxy, intercept requests made by the Docker build during the execution of the curl commands, and provide a modified (but benign and detectable) payload in place of the genuine installer or binary.
    4. Execute a Docker image build using the project’s Dockerfile.
    5. Verify that the altered payload is executed (e.g., by logging a custom message or altering a file in the container) thus proving that manipulation is possible during the build stage.
- **Vulnerability: Incomplete Secret Key Replacement in Environment Configuration**
  - **Description**:
    The project’s post‐generation hook in `hooks/post_gen_project.py` is responsible for “securing” the generated configuration by replacing a placeholder string (`__CHANGEME__`) with a cryptographically secure random secret key. This is performed by the function `_create_secret_key`, which reads the configuration file and executes:
    ```python
    file_contents = config_file.read_text().replace(CHANGEME, secret_key, 1)
    ```
    However, by using a replacement count of “1”, only the first occurrence of the insecure placeholder is replaced. If the source template (typically `config/.env.template`) contains multiple occurrences of `__CHANGEME__`, subsequent occurrences will remain unchanged (and insecure), causing the application to use the default value for critical security functions such as session signing.
    To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker (or an inattentive developer) could supply — intentionally or by oversight — a `.env.template` file that contains more than one instance of `__CHANGEME__`. After project generation, some parts of the configuration would still have the predictable default value.
  - **Impact**:
    If parts of the configuration continue to use an insecure secret key, attackers might be able to forge session cookies or otherwise compromise the integrity of cryptographic signing, leading to session hijacking, data tampering, or broader application compromise.
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - The post‐generation hook does generate a secure random string and replaces one occurrence of the placeholder automatically during project creation.
  - **Missing Mitigations**:
    - The implementation does not check whether the placeholder exists only once. There is no validation to ensure that all occurrences of `__CHANGEME__` have been replaced.
    - No post-processing verification is performed on the generated configuration file to detect if any insecure default values remain.
  - **Preconditions**:
    - The `.env.template` file (or other configuration files) contains more than one instance of `__CHANGEME__`.
    - The post-generation hook is executed without additional verification that all sensitive placeholders are replaced.
  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    - In `hooks/post_gen_project.py`, observe the snippet:
      ```python
      def _create_secret_key(config_path: Path) -> None:
          # Generate a SECRET_KEY that matches the Django standard
          secret_key = _get_random_string()

          with config_path.open(mode='r+', encoding='utf8') as config_file:
              # Replace CHANGEME with SECRET_KEY (only the first occurrence)
              file_contents = config_file.read_text().replace(CHANGEME, secret_key, 1)

              # Write the results to the file:
              config_file.seek(0)
              config_file.write(file_contents)
              config_file.truncate()
      ```
    - The use of `replace(CHANGEME, secret_key, 1)` means that if the template unexpectedly contains two or more instances of `__CHANGEME__`, only the first is secured.
  - **Security Test Case**:
    1. Modify the project’s `.env.template` file to include several instances of `__CHANGEME__` (for example, on separate lines or within multiple settings).
    2. Run the cookiecutter project generation process.
    3. Open and inspect the generated `config/.env` file and verify whether all occurrences of `__CHANGEME__` have been replaced with a random string.
    4. Confirm that one or more instances remain unchanged.
    5. Attempt to use the insecure value in a controlled Django environment (for example, by forging session cookies) to demonstrate that predictable secret keys are still in use; this confirms the potential impact from the vulnerability.
