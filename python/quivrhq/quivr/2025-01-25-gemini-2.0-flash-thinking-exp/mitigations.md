# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for quivrhq/quivr

## Mitigation Strategy: [Vector Database Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/vector_database_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Vector Database with Access Control:** Select a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or ChromaDB with authentication enabled) that offers built-in access control features, ensuring compatibility with Quivr's architecture.
    2.  **Configure Authentication within Quivr:**  Configure Quivr's backend services to authenticate with the vector database using dedicated credentials. This configuration should be managed within Quivr's settings or environment variables, ensuring only Quivr components can access the database.
    3.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Quivr Application Layer (if needed):** If fine-grained access control is required beyond the database level, implement RBAC within Quivr's application logic. This would involve modifying Quivr's backend to enforce permissions based on user roles when interacting with the vector database.
    4.  **Restrict Direct Public Access to Vector Database:** Ensure that the vector database is not directly accessible from the public internet. All access should be routed through Quivr's backend services.
    5.  **Integrate Vector Database Access Logging with Quivr's Monitoring:** Configure the vector database to log access attempts and integrate these logs with Quivr's overall monitoring system for security auditing.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access via Vector Database (High Severity):** Prevents bypassing Quivr's application layer and directly accessing sensitive knowledge base data stored in the vector database. This is a threat directly related to how Quivr manages and stores its data.
        *   **Data Modification/Deletion by Unauthorized Entities (High Severity):** Protects the integrity of Quivr's knowledge base by preventing unauthorized changes to the vector database, which is core to Quivr's functionality.
        *   **Internal Threats Exploiting Direct Database Access (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of malicious internal actors or compromised Quivr components directly manipulating the vector database without proper authorization checks within Quivr.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access via Vector Database:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of direct, unauthorized access to Quivr's core data storage.
        *   **Data Modification/Deletion by Unauthorized Entities:** High - Effectively prevents unauthorized changes to Quivr's knowledge base integrity.
        *   **Internal Threats Exploiting Direct Database Access:** Medium - Reduces risk from internal threats targeting the database directly, enhancing Quivr's internal security posture.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented depending on the chosen vector database and its default authentication settings. Quivr itself might not enforce application-level access control beyond database defaults.
        *   Database level authentication is likely used if a managed vector database service is chosen, but integration with Quivr's application logic for finer control might be missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Fine-grained RBAC within Quivr's application layer to control access to the vector database based on user roles *within Quivr*.
        *   Systematic auditing and monitoring of vector database access logs *integrated into Quivr's security monitoring framework*.
        *   Explicit configuration guidance within Quivr's documentation on setting up secure vector database access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit within Quivr Architecture](./mitigation_strategies/data_encryption_at_rest_and_in_transit_within_quivr_architecture.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Vector Database Encryption at Rest (Quivr Configuration):** Ensure that the chosen vector database's encryption at rest feature is enabled and properly configured. This is a configuration step relevant to Quivr's data storage.
    2.  **Enforce HTTPS for Quivr Component Communication:** Configure Quivr's frontend, backend, and any internal services to communicate exclusively over HTTPS. This involves configuring web servers and application settings within the Quivr deployment.
    3.  **Secure Communication Channels to LLM Providers (Quivr Configuration):** Verify that Quivr is configured to use HTTPS when communicating with external LLM providers' APIs. This is a configuration within Quivr's backend related to external service integration.
    4.  **Consider Application-Level Encryption within Quivr (if needed):** If extremely sensitive data is processed by Quivr, evaluate implementing application-level encryption *within Quivr's data handling logic* before vectorization and storage. This would require code modifications within Quivr.
    5.  **Secure Key Management for Quivr Encryption:** Implement secure key management practices for any encryption keys used *within Quivr or for the vector database*. This involves choosing secure key storage mechanisms accessible to Quivr components.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Breaches from Quivr's Storage Layer (High Severity):** Encryption at rest mitigates data exposure if the underlying storage for Quivr's vector database is compromised. This is directly related to Quivr's data persistence.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Quivr Communication Channels (High Severity):** HTTPS encryption prevents eavesdropping on communication between Quivr's frontend and backend, and between Quivr and external services. This protects Quivr's internal and external communication.
        *   **Data Exposure during Internal Quivr Network Communication (Medium Severity):** HTTPS for internal communication within Quivr's backend infrastructure protects data in transit within the application's network.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Breaches from Quivr's Storage Layer:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of data exposure from compromises of Quivr's data storage.

        *   **Data Exposure during Internal Quivr Network Communication:** Medium - Reduces risk within Quivr's internal network, securing data flow within the application.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   HTTPS for frontend-backend communication is likely implemented or easily configurable in typical Quivr deployments.
        *   Encryption at rest depends on the chosen vector database and might need explicit configuration outside of Quivr itself, but is a relevant configuration for a secure Quivr setup.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Explicit guidance within Quivr's documentation on enabling and verifying encryption at rest for recommended vector databases.
        *   Enforcement of HTTPS for *all* internal communication within Quivr's backend services.
        *   Application-level encryption within Quivr's data processing pipeline is likely not implemented and would require custom modifications to Quivr's code.

        *   **HTML Injection in Quivr UI (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating the appearance or behavior of Quivr's user interface through injected HTML, potentially leading to phishing or defacement.
        *   **SQL Injection in Quivr Metadata Storage (if applicable) (High Severity):** If Quivr stores metadata about ingested data in a relational database, input sanitization protects against SQL injection vulnerabilities in *Quivr's data handling logic*.

    *   **Impact:**

        *   Sanitization might be partially implemented in Quivr, but likely needs review and strengthening specifically for the types of data Quivr handles (web content, documents).
        *   CSP for Quivr's frontend might not be explicitly configured or might be too permissive, requiring configuration specific to Quivr.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization *across all data ingestion points within Quivr's codebase*.
        *   Strong Content Security Policy *specifically configured for Quivr's frontend*.
        *   Regular review and updates of sanitization logic and libraries *within the Quivr project*.
        *   Clear guidelines in Quivr's documentation for developers on secure data ingestion practices.
