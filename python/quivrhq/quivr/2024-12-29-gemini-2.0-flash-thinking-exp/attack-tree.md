## Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using Quivr - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise an application that uses Quivr by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Quivr itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using Quivr **(High-Risk Path)**
    * Gain Unauthorized Access to Data Managed by Quivr ***(Critical Node)***
        * Exploit Quivr API Vulnerabilities ***(Critical Node)***
            * Bypass Authentication/Authorization in Quivr API **(High-Risk Path)**
                * Exploit Weak or Default Credentials (if any) ***(Critical Node)***
    * Modify or Delete Data Managed by Quivr **(High-Risk Path)**
        * Exploit Quivr API Vulnerabilities ***(Critical Node)***
            * Bypass Authentication/Authorization in Quivr API **(High-Risk Path)**
                * Exploit Weak or Default Credentials (if any) ***(Critical Node)***
    * Gain Control of the Quivr Instance Itself **(High-Risk Path)**
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Quivr's Infrastructure (If Self-Hosted) ***(Critical Node)***
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Quivr's Code ***(Critical Node)***
            * Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities **(High-Risk Path)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Gain Unauthorized Access to Data Managed by Quivr (Critical Node):**

* This represents the attacker's goal of accessing data stored and managed by Quivr without proper authorization. This could involve reading sensitive information, intellectual property, or user data.

**Exploit Quivr API Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**

* This involves leveraging weaknesses in the design, implementation, or configuration of Quivr's Application Programming Interface (API). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to interact with Quivr in unintended ways.

**Bypass Authentication/Authorization in Quivr API (High-Risk Path):**

* This attack vector focuses on circumventing the security mechanisms that control access to the Quivr API. Successful bypass allows attackers to perform actions as if they were legitimate users or administrators.

**Exploit Weak or Default Credentials (if any) (Critical Node):**

* If Quivr (or its components) uses default or easily guessable credentials, attackers can use these to gain unauthorized access. This is a common and often easily exploitable vulnerability.

**Modify or Delete Data Managed by Quivr (High-Risk Path):**

* This represents the attacker's goal of altering or removing data stored within Quivr without proper authorization. This can lead to data corruption, loss of information, or disruption of application functionality.

**Gain Control of the Quivr Instance Itself (High-Risk Path):**

* This is a critical attack goal where the attacker aims to gain complete control over the Quivr instance. This allows them to manipulate data, disrupt services, or potentially use the compromised instance as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Quivr's Infrastructure (If Self-Hosted) (Critical Node):**

* If the application self-hosts the Quivr instance, attackers can target vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure (operating system, containerization platform, network configuration). Successful exploitation can grant them access to the server running Quivr.

**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Quivr's Code (Critical Node):**

* This involves identifying and exploiting flaws directly within the codebase of Quivr. These vulnerabilities can range from minor bugs to critical security weaknesses that allow for remote code execution.

**Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**

* This is a highly critical class of vulnerabilities that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running Quivr. Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the Quivr instance and potentially the underlying system. This can be achieved through various means, such as:
    * **Exploit Unsafe Deserialization:** If Quivr deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, it could lead to the execution of malicious code embedded within the data.
    * **Exploit Code Injection Flaws:** While less likely in a vector database context, potential vulnerabilities in how Quivr processes certain inputs could allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious code.
