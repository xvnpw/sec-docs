*   **Metadata Database:**
    *   **Purpose:** To store structured metadata associated with the ingested data, facilitating organization and filtering.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Storing metadata attributes such as the source URL, file name, upload timestamp, associated user ID, and tags.
        *   Enabling efficient filtering, sorting, and querying of ingested data based on metadata.
    *   **Technology:** A traditional relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL document database (e.g., MongoDB) are common choices.

        *   Processing and sanitizing the response received from the LLM.
        *   Returning the processed response to the Backend API for presentation to the user.
    *   **Technology:** Implemented using libraries and SDKs provided by the LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI Python library).
    *   **Security Considerations:** Secure storage and management of API keys are paramount. Measures to mitigate prompt injection attacks are necessary. Careful handling of potentially sensitive information passed to and received from the LLM is crucial. Rate limiting API calls to avoid exceeding usage limits and potential cost overruns.
