# Threat Model Analysis for quivrhq/quivr

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/malicious_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a file containing malicious code through Quivr's data ingestion mechanisms. Quivr's processing of this file, due to vulnerabilities in its parsing libraries or execution logic *within Quivr itself*, allows the attacker's code to be executed on the server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server hosting the application and Quivr, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and further attacks on internal networks.

**Affected Component:** Data Ingestion Module, File Processing Functions *within Quivr*

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just extensions *within the application integrating with Quivr*.
*   Sanitize file contents thoroughly before passing them to Quivr for processing.
*   If possible, process uploaded files in a sandboxed environment *before handing them to Quivr*.
*   Regularly update Quivr and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities *within the Quivr library*.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Insecure URL Handling](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_insecure_url_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a malicious URL to Quivr's data ingestion feature (e.g., fetching content from a URL). Quivr, without proper validation *in its URL fetching logic*, makes a request to this attacker-controlled URL from the server.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data exfiltration from internal systems, and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the server.

**Affected Component:** Data Ingestion Module, URL Fetching Functionality *within Quivr*

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains or IP addresses for URL fetching *before allowing Quivr to fetch them*.
*   Sanitize and validate user-provided URLs thoroughly *before passing them to Quivr*.
*   If possible, use a dedicated service or library for URL fetching *outside of Quivr* and provide the fetched content to Quivr.
*   Configure Quivr to disallow or restrict the ability to fetch URLs from private IP ranges.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data through AI Responses](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_ai_responses.md)

**Description:** The AI model within Quivr, when responding to user queries, inadvertently reveals sensitive information that was present in the ingested data but should not be exposed in that context. This could happen due to insufficient data sanitization or overly broad access permissions *within Quivr's knowledge base management*.

**Impact:** Leakage of confidential or private information, potentially violating privacy regulations and causing reputational harm.

**Affected Component:** AI Model, Query Processing Logic, Knowledge Base Access Control *within Quivr*

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict access controls on the knowledge base *before ingesting data into Quivr*.
*   Sanitize sensitive data before and during the ingestion process into Quivr (e.g., redaction, anonymization).
*   Investigate and configure Quivr's settings for controlling the scope of information accessible to the AI.
*   Monitor AI responses for potential data leaks.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of API Keys or Credentials by Quivr](./threats/insecure_storage_of_api_keys_or_credentials_by_quivr.md)

**Description:** Quivr might store API keys or credentials required to access external services (e.g., for fetching data) in an insecure manner *within its own configuration or data storage*. An attacker gaining access to the Quivr instance could retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** Compromise of external services, potential data breaches on those services, and unauthorized actions performed using the stolen credentials.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Management, Credential Storage *within Quivr*

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure that Quivr uses secure methods for storing sensitive credentials, such as encryption at rest (e.g., using a secrets management system) *if Quivr handles this directly*.
*   If possible, manage API keys and credentials outside of Quivr and provide them securely to Quivr at runtime.
*   Regularly rotate API keys and credentials.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Quivr's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_quivr's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Quivr relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. These dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if not properly managed and updated *within the Quivr library itself*.

**Impact:**  A wide range of potential impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** All Components Relying on Vulnerable Dependencies *within Quivr*

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update Quivr to the latest version, which includes updated dependencies.
*   Monitor security advisories for Quivr to be aware of any reported dependency vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization Vulnerabilities within Quivr](./threats/insecure_deserialization_vulnerabilities_within_quivr.md)

**Description:** If Quivr uses deserialization to process data (e.g., for inter-process communication or data storage), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process *within Quivr's code* could allow an attacker to inject malicious code that is executed when the data is deserialized.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, potentially leading to full server compromise.

**Affected Component:** Data Processing Modules, Communication Interfaces *within Quivr*

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using deserialization of untrusted data *within Quivr's codebase*.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization methods and libraries *within Quivr*.
*   Regularly update Quivr and its dependencies to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
