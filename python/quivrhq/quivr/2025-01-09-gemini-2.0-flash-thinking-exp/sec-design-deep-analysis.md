### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

**2.1. Frontend**

*   **Security Implication:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities could arise if user-provided data (e.g., document names, chat messages) is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the browser. This could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially stealing user credentials or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust output encoding and sanitization techniques within the Frontend framework. Utilize framework-specific features to prevent XSS, and consider Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   **Security Implication:** Insecure handling of authentication tokens or session identifiers could lead to session hijacking. If tokens are stored insecurely (e.g., in local storage without proper protection) or transmitted over non-HTTPS connections, attackers could gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize secure HTTP-only cookies for session management. Avoid storing sensitive authentication information in local storage or session storage. Ensure all communication between the Frontend and Backend API occurs over HTTPS. Consider implementing mechanisms for detecting and invalidating compromised sessions.
*   **Security Implication:**  Vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies (e.g., JavaScript libraries) could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a process for regularly scanning frontend dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like npm audit or Yarn audit. Keep dependencies updated to the latest secure versions. Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track frontend dependencies.

**2.2. Backend API**

*   **Security Implication:** Improper authentication and authorization mechanisms could allow unauthorized access to API endpoints and sensitive data. If authentication is weak or authorization checks are missing or flawed, attackers could bypass access controls.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust authentication (e.g., JWT or OAuth 2.0) for all API endpoints. Enforce authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to. Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access.
*   **Security Implication:**  SQL injection vulnerabilities could occur if user input is directly incorporated into database queries without proper sanitization. This could allow attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches or data corruption.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. Employ an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides built-in protection against SQL injection. Regularly audit database queries for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Implication:**  API rate limiting is crucial to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Without rate limiting, attackers could flood the API with requests, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a specific timeframe. Consider using adaptive rate limiting based on usage patterns.
*   **Security Implication:**  Exposure of sensitive information in API responses (e.g., error messages containing stack traces or internal details) could aid attackers in reconnaissance.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement proper error handling and logging. Avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses. Provide generic error messages to clients while logging detailed error information securely on the server-side.
*   **Security Implication:**  Vulnerabilities in backend dependencies could be exploited.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a process for regularly scanning backend dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools specific to the chosen backend framework (e.g., `pip check` for Python, `npm audit` for Node.js). Keep dependencies updated to the latest secure versions. Utilize dependency management tools to manage and track dependencies.

**2.3. Database**

*   **Security Implication:**  Sensitive user data (credentials, document metadata, potentially document content) stored in the database needs strong protection against unauthorized access.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest using database encryption features. Implement strong access controls and authentication for database access. Regularly audit database access logs. Follow database security best practices for configuration and maintenance.
*   **Security Implication:**  Insufficient access controls at the database level could allow the Backend API to perform unintended actions, potentially leading to data breaches or integrity issues.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement the principle of least privilege for database user accounts used by the Backend API. Grant only the necessary permissions for the API to function. Avoid using overly permissive database user accounts.
*   **Security Implication:**  Database backups need to be secured to prevent unauthorized access to historical data.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Encrypt database backups at rest and in transit. Store backups in a secure location with restricted access. Implement secure backup and recovery procedures.

**2.4. Vector Store**

*   **Security Implication:**  While the Vector Store primarily holds embeddings, unauthorized access could reveal information about the documents users have uploaded and their semantic relationships.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement access controls provided by the chosen Vector Store technology. Ensure only authorized components (primarily the Backend API and Ingestion Service) can access the Vector Store. Consider if the chosen Vector Store offers encryption at rest and in transit, and enable it.
*   **Security Implication:**  If the Vector Store stores any metadata alongside the embeddings (e.g., document IDs), this metadata needs to be protected.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Apply the same access control principles as for the embeddings themselves. Consider encrypting metadata stored within the Vector Store if the technology allows.

**2.5. LLM Integration**

*   **Security Implication:**  Prompt injection attacks are a significant concern. Malicious users could craft prompts that manipulate the LLM to perform unintended actions, bypass security measures, or reveal sensitive information.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement input sanitization and validation before sending prompts to the LLM. Carefully design prompts to minimize the risk of injection. Consider using techniques like prompt engineering and contextual awareness to limit the LLM's scope. Monitor LLM responses for unexpected or malicious outputs.
*   **Security Implication:**  Unauthorized access to the LLM API key could lead to significant financial costs and potential misuse of the LLM service.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely store the LLM API key using a secrets management solution (see section 3.3). Restrict access to the API key to only authorized components. Implement monitoring and alerts for unusual LLM usage patterns.
*   **Security Implication:**  Data sent to the LLM provider might be subject to their privacy policies and security practices.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully review the LLM provider's terms of service and privacy policy. Avoid sending sensitive or confidential user data directly to the LLM if possible. Consider anonymization or pseudonymization techniques for data sent to the LLM.

**2.6. Ingestion Service**

*   **Security Implication:**  The Ingestion Service handles user-uploaded documents, which could contain malicious content. Improper handling could lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust file upload validation to check file types and sizes. Sanitize document content after extraction to remove potentially malicious scripts or code. Consider using sandboxing techniques when processing uploaded documents.
*   **Security Implication:**  If the Ingestion Service is vulnerable, attackers could potentially manipulate the embeddings generated and stored in the Vector Store, leading to incorrect or biased search results.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure the Ingestion Service with proper authentication and authorization. Implement input validation and sanitization for all data processed by the service. Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Implication:**  Temporary storage of uploaded documents during processing needs to be secure.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Store temporary files in a secure location with restricted access. Ensure temporary files are deleted after processing is complete.

### 3. Cross-Component Security Considerations

*   **3.1. Data Flow Security:**
    *   **Security Implication:** Data transmitted between components could be intercepted or tampered with if not properly secured.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication between the Frontend and Backend API. Use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) for internal communication between backend services if applicable.

*   **3.2. Dependency Management:**
    *   **Security Implication:** Using vulnerable third-party libraries can introduce security risks into the application.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all dependencies. Implement automated dependency scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities. Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions.

*   **3.3. Secrets Management:**
    *   **Security Implication:** Storing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys directly in the codebase or configuration files is a major security risk.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and manage secrets. Avoid hardcoding secrets in the application code or configuration files.

*   **3.4. Infrastructure Security:**
    *   **Security Implication:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure (e.g., operating systems, containerization platforms) can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy:** Follow security best practices for configuring and maintaining the infrastructure. Regularly patch and update operating systems and other infrastructure components. Implement firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
