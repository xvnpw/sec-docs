## 5. Data Flow

The following outlines the typical data flow for a user asking a question:

1. The **User** inputs a question through the **Frontend**.
2. The **Frontend** sends the question to the **Backend API**.
3. The **Backend API** receives the question and potentially authenticates the user.
4. The **Backend API** queries the **Vector Store** using a vector representation of the user's question to find semantically similar document chunks.
5. The **Vector Store** returns a ranked list of relevant document chunks and their associated scores.
6. The **Backend API** retrieves the actual content of the top-ranked document chunks (if not already stored in the Vector Store, it may fetch them from the Database).
7. The **Backend API** constructs a prompt for the LLM, including the user's question and the retrieved relevant document context.
8. The **Backend API** sends the prompt to the **LLM Integration**.
9. The **LLM Integration** forwards the prompt to the configured **Large Language Model**.
10. The **Large Language Model** processes the prompt and generates an answer.
11. The **LLM Integration** receives the generated answer from the LLM.
12. The **LLM Integration** sends the answer back to the **Backend API**.
13. The **Backend API** sends the answer back to the **Frontend**.
14. The **Frontend** displays the answer to the **User**.

The data flow for uploading a document is as follows:

1. The **User** uploads a document via the **Frontend**.
2. The **Frontend** sends the document to the **Backend API**.
3. The **Backend API** receives the document and initiates the ingestion process.
4. The **Backend API** sends the document to the **Ingestion Service**.
5. The **Ingestion Service** processes the document: extracts text, splits it into chunks, and generates vector embeddings for each chunk.
6. The **Ingestion Service** stores the generated vector embeddings in the **Vector Store**.
7. The **Ingestion Service** stores document metadata (and potentially the processed chunks) in the **Database**.
8. The **Backend API** updates the **Frontend** to indicate the successful document upload.
