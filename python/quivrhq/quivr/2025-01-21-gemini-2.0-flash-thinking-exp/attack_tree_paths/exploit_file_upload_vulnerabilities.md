### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Upload Malicious Files

**Attack Tree Node:** Upload Malicious Files (e.g., files with embedded scripts, oversized files)

**Attributes:**

* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on file type and execution)
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

**Breakdown:** Attackers upload malicious files to Quivr. These files could contain embedded scripts (e.g., JavaScript in an SVG), or be designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how Quivr processes files. Oversized files can lead to denial-of-service.

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack path leverages the file upload functionality of Quivr, a common feature in web applications. Attackers aim to bypass security measures and upload files that can compromise the application or its users. The "Upload Malicious Files" node encompasses several sub-categories of attacks:

* **Files with Embedded Scripts:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers embed malicious scripts, often JavaScript, within seemingly harmless file types. Common examples include:
        * **SVG files:** Scalable Vector Graphics files can contain `<script>` tags that execute when the file is rendered by the browser.
        * **HTML files:**  Directly uploading HTML files allows for arbitrary script execution.
        * **Image files (less common but possible):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in image processing libraries could potentially lead to script execution.
    * **Impact:** Successful execution of embedded scripts can lead to:
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, defacing the application, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
        * **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive data within the application's context.
        * **Account Takeover:**  Potentially gaining control of user accounts.
    * **Exploitation Scenario:** A user uploads an SVG file containing malicious JavaScript. When another user views this file (or a page displaying it), the script executes in their browser, potentially compromising their session.

* **Files Exploiting Processing Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers upload files specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the libraries or code Quivr uses to process uploaded files. This could involve:
        * **Buffer overflows:**  Uploading files with excessively long metadata or content that overflows allocated memory during processing.
        * **Format string vulnerabilities:**  Crafting filenames or file content that exploits format string bugs in processing functions.
        * **Exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries:** Targeting known vulnerabilities in image processing libraries (e.g., ImageMagick), document parsing libraries (e.g., for PDFs or DOCX), or other file handling components.
    * **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Quivr. This is the most severe outcome.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crashing the application or server by providing malformed input that the processing logic cannot handle.
        * **Information Disclosure:**  Accessing sensitive data stored on the server.
    * **Exploitation Scenario:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the image processing library used by Quivr. This allows them to execute commands on the server.

* **Oversized Files:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers upload extremely large files to consume server resources (CPU, memory, disk space, bandwidth).
    * **Impact:**
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Making the application unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users due to resource exhaustion.
        * **Performance Degradation:**  Slowing down the application for all users.
        * **Storage Exhaustion:** Filling up the server's storage, potentially impacting other services.
    * **Exploitation Scenario:** An attacker repeatedly uploads very large files, overwhelming the server's storage capacity and causing the application to crash.

**Actionable Insights (Expanded and More Specific):**

The provided actionable insights are a good starting point. Let's expand on them with more specific recommendations for the development team:

* **Implement Secure File Upload Mechanisms:**
    * **File Type Validation (Strict Allow-listing):**
        * **Recommendation:**  Instead of blacklisting dangerous file extensions, implement a strict allow-list of permitted file types based on the application's needs. For example, if only images are allowed, only permit extensions like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.gif`.
        * **Implementation:**  Verify file types based on their **magic numbers (file signatures)** in addition to file extensions. Relying solely on extensions is easily bypassed.
    * **File Size Limits:**
        * **Recommendation:** Enforce strict maximum file size limits based on the expected use cases. Avoid arbitrarily large limits.
        * **Implementation:** Implement size limits both on the client-side (for user feedback) and, critically, on the server-side to prevent bypassing.
    * **Secure, Isolated Storage:**
        * **Recommendation:** Store uploaded files in a dedicated location that is **outside the webroot** and not directly accessible by the web server.
        * **Implementation:** Use a separate storage service (e.g., cloud storage) or a dedicated directory with restricted permissions. Serve files through a separate mechanism that prevents direct execution of uploaded content (e.g., using a readfile-like function with appropriate headers).
    * **Rename Uploaded Files:**
        * **Recommendation:**  Rename uploaded files to a unique, non-guessable name upon upload. This prevents path traversal vulnerabilities and makes it harder for attackers to predict file locations.
        * **Implementation:** Use UUIDs or timestamps to generate unique filenames.

* **Scan Uploaded Files for Malware:**
    * **Recommendation:** Integrate with a reputable antivirus or malware scanning engine to scan all uploaded files before they are processed or made accessible.
    * **Implementation:** Consider using open-source tools like ClamAV or commercial solutions. Implement asynchronous scanning to avoid blocking the upload process.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Recommendation:** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks from uploaded files.
    * **Implementation:**  Configure CSP directives to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevent inline script execution.

* **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:**
    * **Recommendation:**  Even if files are stored securely, ensure that any metadata or content derived from uploaded files (e.g., filenames displayed to users) is properly sanitized and encoded before being displayed to prevent XSS.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Recommendation:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on file upload functionalities, to identify potential vulnerabilities.

* **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:**
    * **Recommendation:** Regularly update all libraries and frameworks used by Quivr, especially those involved in file processing, to patch known vulnerabilities.

* **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:**
    * **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting on file upload endpoints to prevent attackers from overwhelming the server with numerous large file uploads.

* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive logging of file upload activities, including user, filename, size, and upload time. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity, such as uploads of unexpected file types or unusually large files.

**Conclusion:**

The "Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities -> Upload Malicious Files" attack path presents a significant risk to Quivr. The relatively low effort and skill level required for this attack, coupled with the potentially high impact (ranging from XSS to RCE and DoS), make it a critical area of focus for security hardening. By implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack vector, enhancing the overall security posture of the Quivr application. Continuous vigilance, regular security assessments, and staying informed about emerging threats are crucial for maintaining a secure file upload functionality.
