### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Content During Ingestion

#### 4.1 Exploit API Ingestion Weaknesses (Critical Node)

This critical node represents a significant vulnerability where attackers can leverage weaknesses in Quivr's API ingestion process to inject malicious content.

##### 4.1.1 Send Crafted Data via API (e.g., malicious markdown, code snippets) (High-Risk Path)

* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Breakdown:** Attackers can send specially crafted data through Quivr's API endpoints. This data could include:
    * **Malicious Markdown:**  Markdown syntax designed to execute JavaScript when rendered on the client-side (leading to XSS). For example, embedding `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` or using malicious links.
    * **Malicious Code Snippets:**  Code snippets in languages supported by Quivr that, if not properly sandboxed or sanitized, could lead to unintended execution or information disclosure. This is particularly relevant if Quivr processes or displays code directly.
    * **Payloads for Server-Side Vulnerabilities:**  Crafted data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the backend processing logic, such as command injection or SQL injection (though less directly related to content injection, it's a potential consequence of insecure data handling).

* **Technical Details:**
    * **XSS via Markdown:**  If Quivr renders user-provided markdown without proper sanitization, malicious scripts embedded within the markdown can execute in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Insecure Code Processing:** If Quivr attempts to execute or interpret user-provided code snippets without proper sandboxing or validation, attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server or access sensitive information.
    * **Bypassing Input Validation:** Attackers might try to bypass basic input validation by using encoding techniques or exploiting logical flaws in the validation rules.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Compromising user accounts, stealing sensitive information, defacing the application, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
    * **Information Disclosure:**  Accessing sensitive data stored within Quivr or on the server.
    * **Account Takeover:**  Stealing user credentials or session tokens.
    * **Server-Side Vulnerabilities (Indirect):**  While the focus is content injection, poorly handled input could potentially lead to server-side vulnerabilities if the injected content is used in backend operations.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all data received through API endpoints. Define clear rules for acceptable input formats, lengths, and characters. Use allow-lists rather than deny-lists where possible.
    * **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape all user-provided data before rendering it in the user interface. This prevents malicious scripts from being interpreted by the browser. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript strings).
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to control the resources that the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.
    * **Markdown Sanitization Libraries:** Utilize well-established and regularly updated markdown sanitization libraries (e.g., Bleach in Python) to remove potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.
    * **Code Snippet Sandboxing:** If Quivr needs to process or display code snippets, implement strict sandboxing techniques to isolate the execution environment and prevent malicious code from affecting the system. Consider using secure code execution environments or virtual machines.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent attackers from rapidly sending numerous malicious requests.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

* **Detection Strategies:**
    * **API Monitoring:** Monitor API traffic for suspicious patterns, such as unusual characters or code snippets in input fields.
    * **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block common injection attacks.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Collect and analyze logs from the application and infrastructure to identify potential attack attempts.
    * **Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems to detect unusual data being ingested through the API.

#### 4.2 Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)

This critical node highlights the risks associated with allowing users to upload files to Quivr.

##### 4.2.1 Upload Malicious Files (e.g., files with embedded scripts, oversized files) (High-Risk Path)

* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on file type and execution)
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Breakdown:** Attackers can upload various types of malicious files to Quivr, potentially leading to different types of attacks:
    * **Files with Embedded Scripts:**  Uploading files like SVG images or HTML files containing malicious JavaScript that can be executed when the file is viewed or processed.
    * **Exploiting File Processing Vulnerabilities:**  Uploading files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the libraries or processes Quivr uses to handle uploaded files (e.g., image processing libraries with known vulnerabilities).
    * **Oversized Files:**  Uploading extremely large files to cause denial-of-service (DoS) by consuming excessive storage space or processing resources.
    * **Malware Upload:** Uploading files containing viruses, trojans, or other malware that could compromise the server or other users' systems if executed or shared.

* **Technical Details:**
    * **XSS via File Upload:**  Uploading SVG files with embedded `<script>` tags or HTML files containing malicious JavaScript. When these files are accessed or rendered by other users, the scripts can execute.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in file processing libraries (e.g., image decoders) to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Flooding the server with large file uploads, exhausting disk space or processing power.

* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Similar to API injection, leading to user account compromise, data theft, and application defacement.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Gaining complete control over the server, allowing attackers to install malware, steal data, or disrupt operations.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    * **Malware Distribution:**  Using Quivr as a platform to distribute malware to other users.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure File Upload Mechanisms:** Implement robust security measures for file uploads:
        * **File Type Validation (Allow-list):**  Strictly validate the file type based on its content (magic numbers) and not just the file extension. Only allow explicitly permitted file types.
        * **File Size Limits:** Enforce reasonable file size limits to prevent oversized file uploads.
        * **Content Scanning:** Integrate with antivirus or malware scanning engines to scan uploaded files for malicious content.
        * **Secure Storage:** Store uploaded files in a secure, isolated location, preferably outside the webroot and on a separate domain or using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with appropriate security configurations.
        * **Rename Uploaded Files:**  Rename uploaded files to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities and to avoid predictable filenames.
        * **Content-Disposition Header:**  When serving uploaded files, set the `Content-Disposition` header to `attachment` to force a download rather than rendering potentially malicious content in the browser.
        * **Input Sanitization (Filename):** Sanitize filenames to remove potentially harmful characters or sequences.

* **Detection Strategies:**
    * **File Integrity Monitoring:** Monitor the file system for unauthorized changes or additions.
    * **Anomaly Detection:**  Detect unusual file upload patterns, such as a sudden increase in uploads or uploads of unexpected file types.
    * **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**  Monitor server endpoints for suspicious activity related to file processing.
    * **Log Analysis:**  Analyze file upload logs for errors or suspicious activity.
