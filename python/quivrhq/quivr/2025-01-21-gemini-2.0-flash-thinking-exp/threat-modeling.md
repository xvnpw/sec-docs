# Threat Model Analysis for quivrhq/quivr

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Vector Embeddings](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_vector_embeddings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Quivr's access control mechanisms or gain unauthorized access through compromised credentials *within Quivr*. They might then exfiltrate the vector embeddings to reverse-engineer sensitive information or use them for malicious purposes.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential exposure of underlying data patterns and sensitive information represented by the embeddings.
    *   **Affected Component:** Vector Database Storage, Access Control Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms *for accessing Quivr*.
        *   Utilize network segmentation to restrict access to the Quivr instance.
        *   Regularly audit access logs and user permissions *within Quivr*.
        *   Encrypt data at rest within the Quivr database.

## Threat: [Data Injection into Vector Database](./threats/data_injection_into_vector_database.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could bypass input validation or exploit vulnerabilities in Quivr's data ingestion process to inject malicious or misleading vector embeddings *directly into Quivr*. This could skew search results, manipulate application behavior, or potentially lead to denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity compromise, potential manipulation of application functionality, possible denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Ingestion Module, Vector Indexing Functionality
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on data *before it is processed by Quivr* for embedding generation and storage.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when Quivr interacts with the underlying database.
        *   Consider using write-only access for the embedding generation process and read-only access for retrieval *within Quivr's access control*.

## Threat: [Data Corruption or Deletion in Vector Database](./threats/data_corruption_or_deletion_in_vector_database.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges *within Quivr* or by exploiting vulnerabilities could corrupt or delete vector embeddings within Quivr, leading to data loss and application malfunction.
    *   **Impact:** Availability and integrity compromise, loss of critical data, application failure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Vector Database Storage, Data Management Functions
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust access control mechanisms *within Quivr* to restrict data modification and deletion.
        *   Regularly back up the Quivr database and implement a recovery plan.
        *   Utilize database features like write-ahead logs for data integrity.

## Threat: [Exposure of LLM API Keys (if handled by Quivr)](./threats/exposure_of_llm_api_keys__if_handled_by_quivr_.md)

*   **Description:** If Quivr directly handles or stores LLM API keys, vulnerabilities in Quivr's configuration or code could expose these sensitive credentials, allowing an attacker to access and abuse the linked LLM service.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, financial loss due to unauthorized LLM usage, potential data breaches through the LLM service.
    *   **Affected Component:** LLM Integration Module, Configuration Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing LLM API keys directly within Quivr if possible.
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and access these secrets programmatically *outside of Quivr's direct management*.
        *   Ensure secure communication channels between Quivr and the LLM API.

## Threat: [Malicious File Uploads (if Quivr handles them)](./threats/malicious_file_uploads__if_quivr_handles_them_.md)

*   **Description:** If Quivr allows direct file uploads for data ingestion, an attacker could upload malicious files that could exploit vulnerabilities in Quivr's processing logic or the underlying operating system *of the Quivr instance*.
    *   **Impact:** Availability and integrity compromise, potential remote code execution on the Quivr server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Ingestion Module, File Handling Functions
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation and sanitization *within Quivr's upload handling*.
        *   Scan uploaded files for malware *before processing by Quivr*.
        *   Process uploaded files in a sandboxed environment.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities during Data Processing (within Quivr)](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_during_data_processing__within_quivr_.md)

*   **Description:** If Quivr processes data using insecure methods, it could be vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., command injection if executing external commands *from within Quivr*, or potential NoSQL injection depending on Quivr's internal data handling).
    *   **Impact:** Availability, integrity, and confidentiality compromise, potential remote code execution *on the Quivr server*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Processing Pipeline, any module interacting with external systems or databases *from within Quivr*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices within Quivr's data processing logic.
        *   Avoid executing external commands based on user-provided input *within Quivr's code*.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when Quivr interacts with databases.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Quivr's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_quivr's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Quivr relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise Quivr and, consequently, our application.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could lead to confidentiality, integrity, or availability compromise *of the Quivr instance*.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components relying on vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Quivr and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Implement a process for monitoring and addressing security vulnerabilities in Quivr's dependencies (e.g., using dependency scanning tools).

## Threat: [Exposed Management Interfaces](./threats/exposed_management_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:** If Quivr exposes management interfaces without proper authentication or over insecure channels, attackers could gain control over the Quivr instance.
    *   **Impact:** Critical compromise, full control over the Quivr instance and potentially the data it manages.
    *   **Affected Component:** Management Interface, API Endpoints
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to Quivr's management interfaces.
        *   Use strong authentication and encryption (HTTPS).
        *   Restrict access to these interfaces to authorized personnel only.
        *   Disable or restrict access to management interfaces from public networks.
