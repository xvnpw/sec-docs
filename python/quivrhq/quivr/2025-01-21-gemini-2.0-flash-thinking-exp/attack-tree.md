## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Ingestion Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_ingestion_vulnerabilities.md)

This is a critical entry point where attackers can introduce malicious data into Quivr.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content During Ingestion](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_during_ingestion.md)

* **Exploit API Ingestion Weaknesses (Critical Node):**
    * **Send Crafted Data via API (e.g., malicious markdown, code snippets) (High-Risk Path):**
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Medium
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * **Breakdown:** Attackers send specially crafted data through Quivr's API endpoints. This could involve injecting malicious markdown that, if not properly sanitized when displayed, leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It could also involve injecting code snippets that might be processed insecurely.
        * **Actionable Insights:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data received through the API. Use established libraries to prevent common injection attacks.
* **Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    * **Upload Malicious Files (e.g., files with embedded scripts, oversized files) (High-Risk Path):**
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Medium to High (depending on file type and execution)
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low to Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * **Breakdown:** Attackers upload malicious files to Quivr. These files could contain embedded scripts (e.g., JavaScript in an SVG), or be designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how Quivr processes files. Oversized files can lead to denial-of-service.
        * **Actionable Insights:** Implement secure file upload mechanisms, including file type validation (using allow-lists), size limits, and storing uploaded files in a secure, isolated location. Scan uploaded files for malware.
