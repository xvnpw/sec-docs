# Attack Surface Analysis for quivrhq/quivr

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection to Quivr Server](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_to_quivr_server.md)

**Description:** Communication between the application and the Quivr server is not encrypted, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on the data being transmitted.
*   **How Quivr contributes to the attack surface:** The Quivr client library is responsible for establishing and managing the connection to the Quivr server. If configured incorrectly or if the underlying transport is not secured, it exposes this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the Quivr server and captures API keys or sensitive query data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, potential compromise of the Quivr database.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use TLS (HTTPS) for the gRPC connection to the Quivr server. Ensure the Quivr client library is configured to enforce TLS.
    *   Verify the TLS certificate of the Quivr server to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The Quivr client library should provide options for certificate validation.
    *   Avoid connecting to the Quivr server over untrusted networks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Quivr API Keys/Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_quivr_api_keyscredentials.md)

**Description:** API keys or other authentication credentials required to access the Quivr server are stored insecurely within the application.
*   **How Quivr contributes to the attack surface:** The Quivr client library requires credentials to authenticate with the Quivr server. How these credentials are managed and stored within the application using the library is a key factor.
*   **Example:** API keys are hardcoded in the application's source code or stored in plain text in configuration files, making them easily accessible to attackers.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Quivr database, potential data breaches, ability to manipulate or delete data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never hardcode API keys in the application code.
    *   Use secure storage mechanisms for credentials, such as environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or operating system keychains.
    *   Implement proper access controls to restrict who can access the stored credentials.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities through Query Construction](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_through_query_construction.md)

**Description:** The application constructs Quivr queries dynamically based on user input without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into the query.
*   **How Quivr contributes to the attack surface:** The Quivr client library provides methods for constructing and executing queries. If these methods are used to directly embed unsanitized user input, it creates an injection point.
*   **Example:** An attacker manipulates user input that is directly incorporated into a vector search query, potentially retrieving unauthorized data or causing errors.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, potential data modification or deletion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and validate user input before incorporating it into Quivr queries.
    *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the Quivr client library (if available) to prevent injection.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when constructing queries, only requesting the necessary data.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The Quivr client library relies on other third-party libraries that may contain known security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Quivr contributes to the attack surface:** By including the Quivr client library, the application also inherits the dependencies of that library, potentially introducing vulnerable code.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a networking library used by the Quivr client could be exploited to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the Quivr client library to the latest version, which often includes updates to its dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the Quivr client's dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the Quivr library and its dependencies.
