**Description:** This path targets weaknesses in how Quivr interacts with the Language Model (LLM).  It is high-risk because LLMs are inherently complex and prone to manipulation, and successful exploitation can lead to significant control over the application's behavior and data.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **2.1. Prompt Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Crafting malicious prompts to manipulate the LLM's behavior and bypass intended security measures. This is a critical node because it directly targets the core functionality of Quivr and LLMs.
