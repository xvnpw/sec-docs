# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Quivr, aims to create a personal AI-powered knowledge base. The primary business priority for such a project, whether for an individual or a company, is to enhance knowledge management and accessibility, leading to improved decision-making, efficiency, and potentially innovation.

For a startup or a company adopting Quivr, the business goals could include:

*   Improved employee onboarding and training by providing a centralized knowledge repository.
*   Faster access to critical information for employees, reducing time spent searching for data.
*   Enhanced research and development capabilities by leveraging collective knowledge.
*   Better customer support through quick access to product documentation and solutions.
*   Competitive advantage by leveraging internal knowledge more effectively.

The most important business risks associated with these priorities and goals are:

*   Data Loss: Loss of valuable knowledge base data due to system failures, security breaches, or accidental deletion. This can severely impact the ability to access and utilize critical information.
*   Data Breach and Confidentiality: Unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the knowledge base. This is especially critical if the knowledge base contains proprietary information, trade secrets, or personal data. A breach can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.
*   System Unavailability: Inability to access the knowledge base when needed due to system downtime, infrastructure failures, or cyberattacks. This can disrupt business operations and reduce productivity.
*   Data Integrity: Corruption or modification of data within the knowledge base, leading to inaccurate or unreliable information. This can result in poor decision-making and operational errors.
*   Compliance and Regulatory Risks: Failure to comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) if the knowledge base stores personal data. This can lead to significant fines and legal repercussions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the provided GitHub repository and typical open-source projects, the existing security controls are likely minimal, especially concerning a project in active development.  It's crucial to establish a robust security posture as the project evolves and potentially handles more sensitive data or wider user access.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code hosted on GitHub - provides version control and some level of access control through GitHub permissions. Implemented: GitHub repository settings.
*   security control: Open Source project - community review can potentially identify vulnerabilities over time. Implemented: Publicly available code.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited formal security testing - as an open-source project, dedicated security testing might be ad-hoc or community-driven, leading to potential vulnerabilities being missed.
*   accepted risk: Dependency vulnerabilities - reliance on open-source libraries and packages introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in those dependencies.
*   accepted risk: Lack of dedicated security team - security is likely handled by the core development team, who may not have specialized security expertise.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline (SAST, DAST, Dependency scanning).
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
*   security control: Implement robust input validation and sanitization across all application layers.
*   security control: Implement secure configuration management for all components (servers, databases, applications).
*   security control: Implement access control lists and principle of least privilege for all resources.
*   security control: Implement data encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data.
*   security control: Establish incident response plan for security incidents.
*   security control: Conduct security awareness training for developers and users.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Requirement: Secure user authentication mechanism to verify user identity.
    *   Requirement: Support for strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered for enhanced security.
    *   Requirement: Session management to securely manage user sessions and prevent unauthorized access.
*   Authorization:
    *   Requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to different features and data within the knowledge base.
    *   Requirement: Principle of least privilege should be enforced, granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    *   Requirement: Secure API authorization to protect backend APIs from unauthorized access.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
    *   Requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to neutralize potentially malicious inputs.
    *   Requirement: Validation should be performed on both client-side and server-side.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Requirement: Encryption of sensitive data at rest (e.g., database encryption, file system encryption).
    *   Requirement: Encryption of data in transit using HTTPS for all communication channels.
    *   Requirement: Secure storage and management of cryptographic keys.
    *   Requirement: Use of strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Knowledge Retrieval: The ability for users to effectively search and retrieve information from the knowledge base. Disruption of this process directly impacts user productivity and the core value proposition of Quivr.
*   Data Ingestion and Processing: The process of adding new knowledge to the system, including data extraction, embedding generation, and indexing. Failure in this process prevents the knowledge base from being updated and remaining relevant.
*   System Availability: Ensuring the Quivr application is accessible and operational when users need it. Downtime can disrupt workflows and hinder access to critical information.
*   User Authentication and Authorization: Securely verifying user identities and controlling access to the knowledge base and its features. Failure in this area can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Knowledge Base Content: This is the most critical data asset. Sensitivity depends on the nature of the knowledge stored. It could range from public information to highly confidential business data, trade secrets, or personal information. Sensitivity level needs to be determined based on the intended use case.
*   User Data: User accounts, profiles, settings, and potentially usage data. Sensitivity level is typically considered personal data and requires protection according to privacy regulations.
*   API Keys and Credentials: API keys for LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI) and database credentials. Highly sensitive data that must be protected to prevent unauthorized access to external services and the database.
*   Application Logs: Logs containing application activity, errors, and security events. Can contain sensitive information if not properly managed and secured. Sensitivity level depends on the content of the logs.
