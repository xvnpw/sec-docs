## Deep Security Analysis of Quivr

**1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology**

**Objective:**  This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the security posture of the Quivr application, focusing on its key components, data flows, and interactions with external services.  The goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and provide actionable mitigation strategies to enhance the overall security of the system.  We will pay particular attention to the self-hosted Docker deployment scenario, as this places the greatest security responsibility on the user.

**Scope:**

*   **Codebase Analysis:**  Review of the Python (FastAPI) backend and any available frontend code (inferred to be JavaScript-based).
*   **Configuration Files:**  Analysis of `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env` files, and any other relevant configuration files.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Examination of `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, and any frontend package management files (e.g., `package.json`, `yarn.lock`).
*   **External Service Integrations:**  Assessment of the security implications of using Supabase, OpenAI, BrainOS, and Stripe.
*   **Deployment Model:**  Focus on the self-hosted Docker deployment scenario, with consideration for other potential deployment options.
*   **Data Flow:**  Mapping the flow of sensitive data throughout the application and its interactions with external services.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Architecture Inference:**  Based on the provided documentation and codebase structure, we will infer the application's architecture, components, and data flow.
2.  **Component Breakdown:**  We will analyze each key component identified in the security design review, focusing on its security implications.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  For each component and data flow, we will identify potential threats using a combination of STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) and known attack vectors.
4.  **Vulnerability Assessment:**  We will assess the likelihood and impact of each identified threat, considering existing security controls and accepted risks.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  We will provide specific, actionable, and tailored mitigation strategies to address the identified vulnerabilities.  These recommendations will be prioritized based on their impact and feasibility.
6.  **Documentation Review:** We will analyze provided documentation.

**2. Security Implications of Key Components**

Let's break down the security implications of each key component, building upon the C4 diagrams and deployment model:

**2.1. User (Person)**

*   **Threats:** Account takeover (credential stuffing, phishing), weak passwords, session hijacking.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce minimum length, complexity, and disallow common passwords.  Integrate with a password strength checker (e.g., zxcvbn).
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  *Strongly recommend* offering MFA via Supabase (if supported) or integrating with a third-party MFA provider.  This is a critical defense against account takeover.
    *   **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks.  Ensure a secure account recovery mechanism.
    *   **Session Management:** Use secure, HTTP-only, and SameSite cookies.  Implement session expiration and proper session invalidation on logout.
    *   **User Education:** Provide guidance to users on creating strong passwords and recognizing phishing attempts.

**2.2. Quivr (Software System)**

*   **Threats:**  XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, denial of service, unauthorized access to data, data breaches.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Input Validation (Server-Side):**  *Crucially*, all user input *must* be validated on the backend (FastAPI).  Use a whitelist approach whenever possible.  Sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks.  Leverage FastAPI's built-in validation capabilities (Pydantic models).
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode all output to prevent XSS.  Use appropriate encoding for the context (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
    *   **CSRF Protection:**  Implement CSRF protection using a library like `fastapi-csrf-protect` or by manually generating and validating CSRF tokens.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP) to prevent common vulnerabilities.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.  Use a library like `slowapi` or integrate with a service like Cloudflare.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:**  Establish a clear policy for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate XSS attacks. This should be configured in the web server (e.g., Nginx within the Docker container) or as a middleware in FastAPI.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `dependabot` (GitHub) or `renovate` to automate this process.
    *   **Secrets Management:**  *Never* store secrets (API keys, database credentials) directly in the codebase or configuration files.  Use environment variables, and for self-hosted deployments, strongly recommend a dedicated secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.  Provide clear instructions for users on how to securely configure these secrets.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.  Implement proper error logging and monitoring.

**2.3. Web Application (Frontend)**

*   **Threats:**  XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, data leakage.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Framework Security Features:**  Leverage the security features of the chosen frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.) to prevent XSS and other client-side attacks.
    *   **Input Validation (Client-Side):**  Implement client-side input validation as a first line of defense, but *always* validate on the server.
    *   **Secure Communication:**  Ensure all communication with the backend API is over HTTPS.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Reinforce the backend-defined CSP.
    *   **X-Frame-Options:**  Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to prevent clickjacking attacks.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Use SRI to ensure that external scripts and stylesheets haven't been tampered with.

**2.4. Backend API (FastAPI)**

*   **Threats:**  All threats listed under "Quivr (Software System)" apply here.  This is the *most critical* component for security.
*   **Mitigation:**  All mitigations listed under "Quivr (Software System)" apply here.  In addition:
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Verify that Supabase authentication is correctly integrated and that authorization checks are performed on *every* API endpoint that accesses or modifies user data.  Implement RBAC or ABAC to control access to resources.
    *   **API Documentation:**  Use FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI documentation to clearly define API endpoints and their security requirements.
    *   **Logging and Monitoring:**  Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.  Log all authentication and authorization events, as well as any errors or suspicious activity.

**2.5. Database (Postgres) & Vector Database (Supabase/pgvector)**

*   **Threats:**  SQL injection, unauthorized access, data breaches, data loss.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  *Always* use parameterized queries or an ORM (like SQLAlchemy) to prevent SQL injection.  *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating user input.
    *   **Database User Permissions:**  Use the principle of least privilege.  Create separate database users with limited permissions for the application.  Do *not* use the database superuser for the application.
    *   **Network Security:**  Restrict database access to only the backend API container.  Do not expose the database port to the public internet.  Configure the `docker-compose.yml` file to use internal networking.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:**  If using a self-hosted deployment, enable encryption at rest for the database volume.  Supabase may offer this as a feature; verify.
    *   **Regular Backups:**  Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy.  Test backups regularly.  Store backups securely, preferably in a separate location.
    *   **Auditing:** Enable database auditing (if supported by Supabase or your self-hosted PostgreSQL setup) to track database activity.

**2.6. File Storage (Supabase Storage/S3)**

*   **Threats:**  Unauthorized access, data breaches, data loss, malicious file uploads.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Access Control:**  Use Supabase Storage's access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access files.  Generate pre-signed URLs for temporary access to files.
    *   **File Type Validation:**  *Strictly* validate the type and content of uploaded files.  Do *not* rely solely on file extensions.  Use a library like `python-magic` to determine the actual file type.
    *   **File Size Limits:**  Enforce reasonable file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Malware Scanning:**  Integrate with a malware scanning service (e.g., ClamAV) to scan uploaded files for viruses and other malware.  This is *especially important* for a self-hosted deployment.  Consider using a Dockerized ClamAV instance within the `docker-compose.yml` setup.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:**  Ensure that files are encrypted at rest (likely provided by Supabase Storage or S3).
    *   **Regular Backups:**  Implement a backup strategy for file storage.

**2.7. External Services (Supabase Auth, OpenAI API, BrainOS API, Stripe API)**

*   **Threats:**  API key compromise, data breaches, service unavailability, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Secure API Key Management:**  Store API keys securely using environment variables and a secrets management solution (as mentioned above).  Rotate API keys regularly.
    *   **HTTPS:**  Ensure all communication with external services is over HTTPS.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Be aware of rate limits imposed by external services and implement appropriate handling in the application.
    *   **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):**  Understand the SLAs of external services and their implications for application availability.
    *   **Data Privacy:**  Review the privacy policies of external services and ensure they align with Quivr's privacy requirements.  Minimize the amount of data sent to external services.
    *   **Input Validation (for External APIs):** Even when interacting with external APIs, validate and sanitize any data *before* sending it. This protects against potential vulnerabilities in the external service or unexpected responses.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor interactions with external services for errors and performance issues.

**3. Deployment (Self-Hosted Docker)**

*   **Threats:**  Docker misconfiguration, container escape, host compromise, outdated images, exposed ports.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Docker Security Best Practices:**  Follow Docker security best practices:
        *   Use the latest stable version of Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
        *   Run containers as non-root users.
        *   Use read-only file systems where possible.
        *   Limit container capabilities.
        *   Use a minimal base image.
        *   Regularly update base images and application images.
        *   Use a private container registry if possible.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Use Docker networks to isolate containers from each other and from the host network.  Only expose necessary ports.
    *   **Host Security:**  Harden the host operating system:
        *   Apply security updates regularly.
        *   Configure a firewall.
        *   Use a strong password or SSH keys for host access.
        *   Monitor host logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Consider using a security-focused Linux distribution (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor).
    *   **Docker Compose Configuration:**  Review the `docker-compose.yml` file carefully:
        *   Ensure that secrets are not hardcoded.
        *   Use appropriate volume mounts.
        *   Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for containers.
        *   Avoid exposing unnecessary ports.
    *   **Image Scanning:**  Use a container image scanning tool (e.g., Trivy, Clair, Anchore) to scan images for vulnerabilities *before* deployment.  Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Traefik) in front of the frontend container to handle HTTPS termination, SSL certificate management, and potentially add additional security headers (like HSTS, CSP, etc.). This is *highly recommended* for self-hosted deployments.

**4. Build Process**

* **Threats:** Vulnerable dependencies, compromised build tools, insecure build environment.
* **Mitigations:**
    * **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities during the build process. Examples include SonarQube, Bandit (for Python), and ESLint (for JavaScript).
    * **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** Use SCA tools to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Examples include OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, and Dependabot.
    * **Build Environment Security:** Ensure the build environment is secure and isolated. Use dedicated build servers or containers.
    * **Signed Commits:** Encourage or require developers to sign their Git commits to ensure code integrity.
    * **Reproducible Builds:** Aim for reproducible builds to ensure that the same source code always produces the same build artifacts.
