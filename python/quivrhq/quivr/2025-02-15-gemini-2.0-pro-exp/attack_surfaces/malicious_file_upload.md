# Deep Analysis: Malicious File Upload in Quivr

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Malicious File Upload" attack surface within the Quivr application.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their potential impact, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies that the Quivr development team can implement directly within the Quivr codebase and its dependency management.  This analysis focuses on *Quivr's* responsibility in handling file uploads and processing, not on external factors like infrastructure security.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis covers the following areas within the Quivr application:

*   **File Upload Handling:**  The code responsible for receiving, storing (temporarily or permanently), and validating uploaded files. This includes any frontend components involved in the upload process and backend API endpoints.
*   **File Processing Logic:**  The code that processes the content of uploaded files. This includes any functions that parse, extract data from, or otherwise interact with the file's contents.  This is the *core* of the vulnerability.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Identification and analysis of third-party libraries used by Quivr for file handling and processing (e.g., PDF parsing, image processing, document conversion).  We will focus on libraries directly used by Quivr's code.
*   **Filename Handling:** How Quivr handles and sanitizes filenames to prevent path traversal and other filename-related attacks.
* **Configuration:** How Quivr is configured to handle file uploads, including any relevant settings related to file size limits, allowed file types, and storage locations.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   Attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system, web server, or database, *unless* those vulnerabilities are directly triggered by Quivr's handling of malicious files.
*   Attacks that rely on social engineering or phishing to trick users into uploading malicious files.  We assume the attacker has the ability to upload a file directly.
*   Attacks on external services that Quivr might integrate with, *unless* Quivr's interaction with those services is the source of the vulnerability.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the Quivr codebase (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities in file upload and processing logic.  This will involve searching for:
    *   Insufficient file type validation.
    *   Lack of file size limits.
    *   Use of vulnerable library functions.
    *   Improper filename sanitization.
    *   Absence of sandboxing or other containment mechanisms.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Examination of Quivr's `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or similar dependency management files to identify libraries used for file handling and processing.  We will research known vulnerabilities in these libraries using vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories).
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  While we won't perform live penetration testing, we will conceptually outline how dynamic analysis (e.g., fuzzing) could be used to identify vulnerabilities.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling techniques to identify potential attack scenarios and assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploits.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  For each identified vulnerability, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies that can be implemented within the Quivr codebase or its configuration.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1 File Upload Handling

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient File Type Validation:**  If Quivr relies solely on file extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`) to determine file type, attackers can bypass this check by simply renaming a malicious file.  This is a *critical* vulnerability.
*   **Missing or Inadequate File Size Limits:**  Large files can be used to cause denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by exhausting server resources (memory, disk space, CPU).
*   **Lack of Input Validation (Filename):**  Attackers may use specially crafted filenames (e.g., containing `../` or null bytes) to perform path traversal attacks, potentially overwriting critical system files or accessing unauthorized directories.
* **Missing Rate Limiting:** An attacker could upload many files in a short period, potentially overwhelming the server.

**Code Review Focus:**

*   Identify the API endpoints responsible for handling file uploads (e.g., look for routes like `/upload`, `/api/files`).
*   Examine the code that handles the uploaded file data (e.g., `request.files` in Flask, `req.file` in Express.js).
*   Check for file type validation logic.  Look for uses of `filename.endswith()` or similar extension-based checks.  These are *red flags*.
*   Check for file size limit enforcement.  Look for code that checks the size of the uploaded file before processing it.
*   Examine how filenames are handled.  Look for uses of `os.path.join()` and sanitization functions (e.g., removing special characters).
* Check for any rate limiting implementation.

**Mitigation Strategies (Specific to Quivr):**

*   **Implement Content-Based File Type Validation:** Use libraries like `python-magic` (for magic number detection) or `filetype` to determine the file type based on its content, *not* its extension.  This should be done *before* any other processing.
    ```python
    import magic
    import filetype

    def validate_file_type(file_content, allowed_types):
        # Using python-magic
        mime_type = magic.from_buffer(file_content, mime=True)
        if mime_type not in allowed_types:
            return False

        # Using filetype (as an alternative or in addition)
        kind = filetype.guess(file_content)
        if kind is None or kind.mime not in allowed_types:
            return False

        return True
    ```
*   **Enforce Strict File Size Limits:**  Set a reasonable maximum file size limit (e.g., 10MB, 20MB) based on the expected use cases of Quivr.  This limit should be enforced *early* in the upload process.
    ```python
    # Example in Flask
    from flask import request, Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 20 * 1024 * 1024  # 20MB

    @app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
    def upload_file():
        if 'file' not in request.files:
            return 'No file part', 400
        file = request.files['file']
        # ... further processing ...
    ```
*   **Sanitize Filenames:**  Use a robust filename sanitization function to remove any potentially dangerous characters.  Avoid simply replacing characters; consider generating a unique, safe filename.
    ```python
    import os
    import uuid

    def sanitize_filename(filename):
        # Generate a unique, safe filename
        name, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
        return str(uuid.uuid4()) + ext
    ```
* **Implement Rate Limiting:** Use a library like `flask-limiter` to limit the number of uploads per user or IP address within a given time window.

### 2.2 File Processing Logic

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:**  The most significant risk comes from vulnerabilities in the libraries Quivr uses to process file content (e.g., PDF parsing libraries, image processing libraries, document conversion libraries).  These libraries may have known or unknown vulnerabilities that can be exploited by specially crafted files.
*   **Improper Handling of Extracted Data:**  Even if the libraries themselves are secure, Quivr's code might mishandle the data extracted from the files, leading to vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection (if the extracted data is used in database queries).

**Code Review Focus:**

*   Identify all libraries used for file processing.  This includes libraries for:
    *   PDF parsing (e.g., `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer.six`)
    *   Image processing (e.g., `Pillow`, `OpenCV`)
    *   Document conversion (e.g., `python-docx`, `unoconv`)
    *   Other file formats supported by Quivr.
*   For each library, research known vulnerabilities using vulnerability databases (CVE, Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories).
*   Examine how Quivr uses these libraries.  Look for:
    *   Calls to potentially vulnerable functions.
    *   Lack of input validation before passing data to library functions.
    *   Improper handling of data returned by library functions.

**Mitigation Strategies (Specific to Quivr):**

*   **Keep Libraries Up-to-Date:**  This is *crucial*.  Regularly update all file processing libraries to the latest versions.  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `pip`, `poetry`) to track and update dependencies.  Automate this process as much as possible.
*   **Sandboxing:**  Run file processing code within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container with limited privileges) to contain any exploits.  This is a *highly recommended* mitigation.
    *   Use a container orchestration tool like Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage the sandboxed environment.
    *   Restrict the container's access to the network, file system, and other resources.
    *   Consider using a minimal base image (e.g., Alpine Linux) to reduce the attack surface of the container itself.
*   **Input Validation (Before Library Calls):**  Before passing data to library functions, validate the input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and constraints.  This can help prevent some exploits that rely on malformed input.
*   **Output Sanitization (After Library Calls):**  After extracting data from files, sanitize the output before using it in other parts of the application (e.g., displaying it in a web page, storing it in a database).  This can prevent vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.
* **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing tools to automatically generate a large number of malformed files and test how Quivr's file processing logic handles them. This can help identify unknown vulnerabilities.

### 2.3 Dependency Analysis

**Actionable Steps:**

1.  **Generate a Dependency List:**  Create a comprehensive list of all libraries used by Quivr, including their versions.  This can be done using tools like `pip freeze` (for Python) or by examining the project's dependency management files.
2.  **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use a vulnerability scanning tool (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check) to automatically scan the dependency list for known vulnerabilities.  These tools typically provide information about the severity of the vulnerabilities and suggest remediation steps (e.g., upgrading to a patched version).
3.  **Manual Research:**  For any libraries that are not covered by automated scanning tools, manually research known vulnerabilities using vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD) and security advisories.

### 2.4 Filename Handling

This was covered in section 2.1. The key is to sanitize filenames and, ideally, generate unique, safe filenames to prevent path traversal attacks.

### 2.5 Configuration

**Actionable Steps:**

*   **Review Configuration Files:** Examine Quivr's configuration files (e.g., `config.py`, `.env`) for any settings related to file uploads.
*   **Ensure Secure Defaults:**  Ensure that default configuration values are secure.  For example, the default file size limit should be reasonably low, and the default file type whitelist should be restrictive.
*   **Documentation:**  Clearly document all configuration options related to file uploads, including their purpose, default values, and security implications.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Malicious File Upload" attack surface is a critical area of concern for the Quivr application.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, the Quivr development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks.  The most important mitigations are:

1.  **Strict, content-based file type validation.**
2.  **Enforcing reasonable file size limits.**
3.  **Keeping all file processing libraries up-to-date.**
4.  **Sandboxing file processing code.**
