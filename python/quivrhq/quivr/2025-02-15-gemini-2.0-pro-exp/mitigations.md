# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for quivrhq/quivr

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation (Document Level)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation__document_level_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Rigorous input validation and sanitization *before* document parsing within Quivr's code.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **File Type Verification (Beyond Extension):**  Within Quivr's document upload handling code, use a library like `python-magic` (or a similar robust solution) to determine the *actual* file type based on its content (magic numbers), not just the extension.
    2.  **Structure Whitelisting:**  Within Quivr, define strict schemas or rules for the *expected* structure of each supported file type.  Reject any file that deviates. This should be implemented in the code that handles document uploads and passes them to parsing libraries.
    3.  **Content Inspection:**  In Quivr's code, after extracting text (or during processing), scan for suspicious patterns:
        *   Embedded scripts (JavaScript in PDFs, macros in DOCX).
        *   Unusual binary data or control characters.
        *   Excessively long strings.
    4.  **Library-Specific Hardening:**  Within Quivr's configuration and usage of libraries like `unstructured`, explore their security options. Disable unnecessary features. Limit resource usage.
    5. **Integrate Sandboxed Processing Call:** Modify Quivr's code to call an external, sandboxed document processing service (this service itself is *not* part of Quivr, but the *call* to it is). This involves adding code to send the document to the service and handle the response.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Documents (Severity: Critical):** Exploits in parsing libraries used by Quivr.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Documents (Severity: High):** Malformed documents crashing Quivr's parsing process.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Embedded Content (Severity: High):** If Quivr displays extracted content without sanitization.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced within Quivr (though the external service is crucial).
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced within Quivr.
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced within Quivr (if combined with CSP in the frontend, which is technically outside Quivr).

*   **Currently Implemented (Educated Guess):**
    *   Basic file type checks likely exist in Quivr.
    *   Dependency on `unstructured` is clear, but hardening is uncertain.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Structure Whitelisting:**  Almost certainly missing within Quivr.
    *   **Content Inspection (Beyond Basic Checks):**  Deep inspection is likely missing.
    *   **Integration with Sandboxed Processing Service:** The *call* to an external service needs to be added to Quivr's code.
    *   **Library Hardening:** Needs thorough review and configuration within Quivr.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prompt Templating and Sanitization (Within Quivr)](./mitigation_strategies/prompt_templating_and_sanitization__within_quivr_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Strict prompt templating and sanitization of data used in LLM prompts *within Quivr's code*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Template Engine:**  Within Quivr's code that interacts with the LLM, use a robust template engine (e.g., Jinja2) to *strictly* separate system instructions from user data and document data.
    2.  **Input Sanitization:**  Before inserting *any* data into the template (within Quivr's code), sanitize it:
        *   Escape special characters.
        *   Remove harmful characters.
        *   Enforce length limits.
    3.  **Contextual Escaping:** Ensure the template engine handles contextual escaping.
    4.  **Prompt Injection Pattern Detection:**  Implement checks (within Quivr's code) for common prompt injection patterns.
    5.  **Output Validation:** Validate the LLM's response *within Quivr* before storing or displaying it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Prompt Injection (Severity: High):** Attackers manipulating the LLM's output through Quivr.
    *   **Data Leakage to LLM (Severity: Medium):** Reduces accidental inclusion of sensitive data in prompts sent from Quivr.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prompt Injection:** Risk significantly reduced within Quivr.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk moderately reduced within Quivr.

*   **Currently Implemented (Educated Guess):**
    *   Some form of prompt construction exists, but rigorous templating and sanitization are uncertain.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Template Engine:**  Likely needs a more robust and explicitly defined template engine *within Quivr's code*.
    *   **Comprehensive Sanitization:**  Sanitization is likely incomplete within Quivr.
    *   **Output Validation:**  Robust output validation is likely missing within Quivr.
    *   **Prompt Injection Pattern Detection:** Specific checks are likely absent within Quivr.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database Security (Parameterized Queries within Quivr)](./mitigation_strategies/database_security__parameterized_queries_within_quivr_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Consistent use of parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions *within Quivr's code*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **ORM Usage:** If Quivr uses an ORM (likely with Supabase), ensure it's configured to *always* use parameterized queries. Review the generated SQL (if possible) within Quivr's context.
    2.  **Direct SQL (Avoid):** If Quivr has any direct SQL, *never* concatenate strings. Use the database driver's parameterized query mechanism. This needs to be verified and corrected *within Quivr's codebase*.
    3.  **Input Validation (Pre-Database):** Even with parameterized queries, validate input *within Quivr's code* before it reaches the database layer.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Attackers injecting malicious SQL code through Quivr.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk almost entirely eliminated within Quivr (if implemented correctly).

*   **Currently Implemented (Educated Guess):**
    *   Supabase and its client libraries *should* encourage this, but it needs verification *within Quivr's code*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Code Review:** A thorough code review of Quivr is needed to ensure *consistent* use of parameterized queries. Any string concatenation for SQL must be corrected *within Quivr*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [LLM Output Filtering and Moderation (Within Quivr)](./mitigation_strategies/llm_output_filtering_and_moderation__within_quivr_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a system to filter and moderate the LLM's output *within Quivr's code*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Content Moderation API Call:**  Within Quivr's code that handles LLM responses, add a call to a content moderation API (e.g., OpenAI's Moderation API).
    2.  **Custom Filters:** Develop and implement custom filtering rules *within Quivr's code* to detect and block specific unwanted content.
    3.  **Regular Expression Checks:** Use regular expressions *within Quivr* to identify and potentially redact patterns in the output.
    4. **Integrate Feedback Mechanism Call:** Add code to Quivr to handle user feedback reports (the reporting UI itself might be outside Quivr, but the handling of the report data should be within).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Harmful/Offensive Output (Severity: Medium):** LLM generating inappropriate content through Quivr.
    *   **Misinformation (Severity: Medium):** LLM generating incorrect information through Quivr.
    *   **Data Leakage (Severity: Medium):** LLM revealing sensitive information through Quivr.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Harmful/Offensive Output:** Risk significantly reduced within Quivr.
    *   **Misinformation:** Risk moderately reduced within Quivr.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk moderately reduced within Quivr.

*   **Currently Implemented (Educated Guess):**
    *   Likely minimal or no output filtering is currently implemented within Quivr.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Content Moderation API Integration:**  This needs to be added to Quivr's code.
    *   **Custom Filtering Rules:**  These need to be developed and implemented within Quivr.
    *   **Integration with Feedback Mechanism:** Code to handle feedback reports needs to be added to Quivr.
