Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Prompt Templating and Sanitization" mitigation strategy for Quivr, following the requested structure:

# Deep Analysis: Prompt Templating and Sanitization in Quivr

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and completeness of the proposed "Prompt Templating and Sanitization" mitigation strategy within the Quivr application.  This includes identifying potential weaknesses, gaps in implementation, and recommending concrete improvements to enhance Quivr's resilience against prompt injection and data leakage vulnerabilities.  The focus is exclusively on the implementation *within Quivr's codebase*.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses solely on the "Prompt Templating and Sanitization" strategy as described.  It encompasses:

*   **Code-Level Analysis (Hypothetical):**  Since we don't have direct access to Quivr's internal codebase, we'll analyze based on the provided description and common secure coding practices.  We'll assume a Python environment, given the use of Jinja2 as an example.
*   **Threat Model:**  We'll consider the specific threats of prompt injection and data leakage to the LLM, originating from within Quivr's interactions with the LLM.
*   **Components:**  We'll examine the proposed components: template engine, input sanitization, contextual escaping, prompt injection pattern detection, and output validation.
*   **Exclusions:** This analysis *does not* cover:
    *   External factors influencing prompt security (e.g., user input before it reaches Quivr).
    *   Other mitigation strategies.
    *   LLM provider-specific security features.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will proceed as follows:

1.  **Component Breakdown:**  Each component of the mitigation strategy will be analyzed individually.
2.  **Threat Analysis:**  For each component, we'll assess how it addresses the identified threats.
3.  **Implementation Review (Hypothetical):**  We'll discuss how each component *should* be implemented in a secure manner, contrasting this with the "Currently Implemented (Educated Guess)" and "Missing Implementation" sections.
4.  **Gap Analysis:**  We'll identify specific gaps and weaknesses in the proposed strategy.
5.  **Recommendations:**  We'll provide concrete, actionable recommendations to improve the strategy.
6.  **Code Examples (Illustrative):** We'll provide Python code snippets to illustrate secure implementation principles.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy

### 2.1 Template Engine (Jinja2)

*   **Threat Addressed:** Prompt Injection (High), Data Leakage (Medium)
*   **How it Works:**  A template engine like Jinja2 enforces a strict separation between the *structure* of the prompt (the system instructions) and the *data* that fills in the blanks (user input, document content).  This prevents user-provided data from being interpreted as instructions by the LLM.
*   **Hypothetical Implementation Review:**
    *   **Good Practice:**
        ```python
        from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader, StrictUndefined

        # Load the template from a file (best practice)
        env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('templates'), undefined=StrictUndefined)
        template = env.get_template('prompt_template.txt')

        # Sanitize the user input and document data (see sanitization section)
        sanitized_user_input = sanitize_input(user_input)
        sanitized_document_data = sanitize_input(document_data)

        # Render the template with the sanitized data
        prompt = template.render(user_input=sanitized_user_input, document_data=sanitized_document_data)

        # Send the 'prompt' to the LLM
        ```
        `prompt_template.txt` (example):
        ```
        You are a helpful assistant that summarizes documents.
        Here is the document:
        {{ document_data }}

        The user wants to know:
        {{ user_input }}

        Provide a concise summary.
        ```
    *   **Currently Implemented (Guess):**  Likely uses string concatenation or basic string formatting, which is vulnerable.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal adoption of Jinja2 (or a similar robust engine) with `StrictUndefined` (to prevent accidental variable usage) and loading templates from files (for better maintainability and security).

### 2.2 Input Sanitization

*   **Threat Addressed:** Prompt Injection (High), Data Leakage (Medium)
*   **How it Works:**  Sanitization cleans the input data *before* it's placed into the template.  This involves escaping special characters that could be misinterpreted by the LLM or the template engine, removing potentially harmful characters, and enforcing length limits to prevent overly long inputs that might exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Hypothetical Implementation Review:**
    *   **Good Practice:**
        ```python
        import html
        import re

        def sanitize_input(input_string, max_length=500):
            """Sanitizes input for use in LLM prompts."""

            # 1. Escape HTML entities (crucial for Jinja2 and general safety)
            escaped_string = html.escape(input_string)

            # 2. Remove or replace potentially harmful characters (example)
            #    This needs to be carefully tailored to the specific use case.
            #    Be VERY cautious about removing characters; it's often better to escape.
            escaped_string = re.sub(r"['\"`]", "", escaped_string)  # Remove quotes (example)

            # 3. Enforce length limit
            truncated_string = escaped_string[:max_length]

            return truncated_string
        ```
    *   **Currently Implemented (Guess):**  May have some basic escaping, but likely lacks comprehensive character filtering and length limits.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A dedicated sanitization function with HTML escaping, context-aware character handling, and length enforcement.  The specific characters to remove/replace need careful consideration based on Quivr's functionality.

### 2.3 Contextual Escaping

*   **Threat Addressed:** Prompt Injection (High)
*   **How it Works:**  Jinja2 (and other good template engines) automatically handle contextual escaping.  This means that if a variable is used within an HTML context, it will be HTML-escaped; if it's used in a JavaScript context, it will be JavaScript-escaped, and so on.  This prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and helps prevent prompt injection.
*   **Hypothetical Implementation Review:**
    *   **Good Practice:**  Rely on Jinja2's built-in auto-escaping.  Ensure it's enabled (it usually is by default).  Avoid manually escaping within the template itself.
    *   **Currently Implemented (Guess):**  If a template engine isn't used, contextual escaping is likely absent.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Using a template engine that provides automatic contextual escaping.

### 2.4 Prompt Injection Pattern Detection

*   **Threat Addressed:** Prompt Injection (High)
*   **How it Works:**  This involves implementing checks *within Quivr's code* to detect common patterns used in prompt injection attacks.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.
*   **Hypothetical Implementation Review:**
    *   **Good Practice:**
        ```python
        def detect_prompt_injection(prompt):
            """Checks for common prompt injection patterns (basic example)."""

            # Example patterns (these need to be expanded and refined)
            patterns = [
                r"ignore previous instructions",
                r"forget the above",
                r"you are now",  # Trying to redefine the assistant's role
                r"\[system\]", # Attempting to inject system-level commands
                # Add more patterns based on known attacks and Quivr's specific context
            ]

            for pattern in patterns:
                if re.search(pattern, prompt, re.IGNORECASE):
                    return True  # Potential injection detected

            return False
        ```
        This function would be called *after* the prompt is rendered but *before* it's sent to the LLM.  If an injection is detected, the request should be rejected.
    *   **Currently Implemented (Guess):**  Likely absent.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A dedicated function to check for common injection patterns, with a regularly updated list of patterns.

### 2.5 Output Validation

*   **Threat Addressed:** Prompt Injection (High), Data Leakage (Medium)
*   **How it Works:**  Validates the LLM's response *before* it's stored or displayed to the user.  This helps prevent successful prompt injections from having an impact.
*   **Hypothetical Implementation Review:**
    *   **Good Practice:**
        ```python
        def validate_output(output, max_length=2000):
            """Validates the LLM's output (basic example)."""

            # 1. Length check
            if len(output) > max_length:
                return False, "Output too long"

            # 2. Check for unexpected content (example)
            if "I am an AI language model" in output: #LLM disclaimer
                return False, "Output contains generic LLM disclaimer"
            
            # 3. Check for leaked sensitive data (requires defining what's sensitive)
            #    This is highly application-specific.

            # 4.  Check for hallucinated URLs or commands.

            return True, ""  # Output is valid
        ```
        This function would be called *after* receiving the response from the LLM.
    *   **Currently Implemented (Guess):**  Likely absent or very basic.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A dedicated function to validate the LLM's output, checking for length, unexpected content, and potentially leaked sensitive information.

## 3. Gap Analysis

The primary gaps in the proposed strategy, based on the "Missing Implementation" sections, are:

*   **Lack of a Formal Template Engine:**  The absence of a robust template engine like Jinja2 is a major vulnerability.
*   **Incomplete Sanitization:**  Sanitization is likely insufficient, lacking comprehensive HTML escaping, context-aware character handling, and length limits.
*   **Absence of Prompt Injection Pattern Detection:**  No proactive checks for known injection patterns are in place.
*   **Missing Output Validation:**  The LLM's output is not rigorously validated before being used.

## 4. Recommendations

1.  **Adopt Jinja2 (or Similar):**  Implement Jinja2 as the template engine, loading templates from files and using `StrictUndefined`.
2.  **Implement Comprehensive Sanitization:**  Create a dedicated `sanitize_input` function that performs HTML escaping, context-aware character filtering (carefully considered), and length enforcement.
3.  **Develop Prompt Injection Detection:**  Create a `detect_prompt_injection` function with a regularly updated list of patterns to check for.
4.  **Implement Robust Output Validation:**  Create a `validate_output` function that checks for length, unexpected content, and potentially leaked sensitive information.  This should be tailored to Quivr's specific data and functionality.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the prompt handling code to identify and address new vulnerabilities.
6.  **Stay Updated:** Keep the template engine and any other related libraries up to date to benefit from security patches.
7. **Log all the steps:** Implement logging for prompt generation, sanitization, injection detection, and output validation. This will help in debugging and identifying potential attacks.

## 5. Conclusion

The proposed "Prompt Templating and Sanitization" strategy is a crucial step towards securing Quivr against prompt injection and data leakage. However, the analysis reveals significant gaps in the likely implementation. By implementing the recommendations outlined above, the development team can significantly enhance Quivr's security posture and protect against these threats. The key is to move from ad-hoc string manipulation to a structured, defense-in-depth approach using a template engine, robust sanitization, pattern detection, and output validation.
