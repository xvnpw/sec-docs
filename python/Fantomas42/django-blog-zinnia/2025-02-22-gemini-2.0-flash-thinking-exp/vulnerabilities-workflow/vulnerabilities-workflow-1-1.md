### Vulnerability Report for Zinnia Blog Application

* Vulnerability 1
    * Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery in Pingback
    * Description:
        1. An attacker crafts a blog entry and includes a hyperlink pointing to an internal resource (e.g., `http://localhost:22`, `http://internal.example.com`).
        2. After the blog entry is saved and published, the Zinnia application's pingback functionality (`zinnia.ping.ExternalUrlsPinger`) is triggered.
        3. The `ExternalUrlsPinger.find_pingback_urls` function parses the HTML content of the entry to extract URLs.
        4. For each extracted URL, the application attempts to open and fetch content using `urllib.request.urlopen` to discover pingback server URLs.
        5. Due to the lack of validation of the target URL, if an attacker includes a URL pointing to an internal service, the Zinnia server will initiate an HTTP request to this internal resource.
        6. This SSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to probe internal network resources, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or triggering unintended actions within the internal network.
    * Impact:
        - Information Disclosure: Attackers can scan and identify open ports and services on the internal network, which are not intended to be publicly accessible.
        - Lateral Movement: In certain scenarios, if the internal services are vulnerable or misconfigured, SSRF can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to these internal systems, facilitating further attacks.
    * Vulnerability Rank: High
    * Currently implemented mitigations:
        - None. The code does not implement any URL validation or sanitization before making outbound requests for pingback discovery.
    * Missing mitigations:
        - Implement robust URL validation in `zinnia.ping.ExternalUrlsPinger.find_pingback_urls` to prevent requests to internal IPs, private networks, and disallowed hosts.
        - Consider using a denylist of disallowed IP ranges and hostnames or, preferably, an allowlist of permitted external domains for pingback targets.
    * Preconditions:
        - The Zinnia blog application must have the pingback feature enabled.
        - An attacker must be able to create and publish blog entries. User authentication for creating entries is assumed but depends on the Zinnia application's configuration.
    * Source code analysis:
        - File: `/code/zinnia/ping.py`
        - Function: `ExternalUrlsPinger.find_pingback_urls(self, urls)`
        ```python
        def find_pingback_urls(self, urls):
            """
            Find the pingback URL for each URLs.
            """
            pingback_urls = {}

            for url in urls: # [POINT 1] URLs are extracted from the entry content, directly influenced by the attacker.
                try:
                    page = urlopen(url) # [POINT 2] urlopen is used to fetch the URL without any validation. SSRF occurs here.
                    headers = page.info()

                    server_url = headers.get('X-Pingback')

                    if not server_url:
                        content_type = headers.get('Content-Type', '').split(
                            ';')[0].strip().lower()
                        if content_type in ['text/html', 'application/xhtml+xml']:
                            server_url = self.find_pingback_href(
                                page.read(5 * 1024))

                    if server_url:
                        server_url_splitted = urlsplit(server_url)
                        if not server_url_splitted.netloc:
                            url_splitted = urlsplit(url)
                            server_url = '%s://%s%s' % (url_splitted.scheme,
                                                        url_splitted.netloc,
                                                        server_url)
                        pingback_urls[url] = server_url # [POINT 3] The discovered pingback URL is stored for later use in pingback requests.
                except IOError:
                    pass
            return pingback_urls
        ```
        - The vulnerability lies in the `urlopen(url)` call at [POINT 2]. The `url` variable, derived from user-supplied content ([POINT 1]), is directly passed to `urlopen` without any validation to ensure it's a safe, external URL. This allows the attacker to specify an internal URL, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery.
    * Security test case:
        1. Log in to the Zinnia application with an account that has permission to create blog entries.
        2. Create a new blog entry.
        3. In the content of the blog entry, insert the following HTML code: `<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/">Internal Admin Panel</a>`. Replace `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` with an actual internal service URL if known, or a non-routable IP address to observe connection attempts (e.g., `http://192.168.1.1/`). Alternatively, use a service like `requestbin.com` to observe external requests.
        4. Publish the blog entry.
        5. Monitor the network traffic from the Zinnia application server. Observe if there are any outbound HTTP requests originating from the server to the specified internal IP address or hostname (`127.0.0.1:8000` in this example). If using `requestbin.com`, check if a request is received.
        6. If the Zinnia server attempts to access the internal resource, it confirms the SSRF vulnerability. The response from the internal service (if any) might also be visible in network logs or application logs, further confirming the vulnerability and potential information exposure.

* Vulnerability 2
    * Vulnerability Name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Markup Processing
    * Description:
        1. An attacker authors a blog entry using a markup language (like Markdown, Textile, or reStructuredText) that includes malicious JavaScript code embedded within the markup. For example, in Markdown, an attacker might use `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` or similar XSS payloads.
        2. When a user requests to view this blog entry, the Zinnia application processes the entry's content using the markup processor specified in the application's settings (`zinnia.settings.MARKUP_LANGUAGE`).
        3. If the configured markup processor or its settings are not properly configured to sanitize and escape HTML entities in the processed output, the malicious JavaScript code injected by the attacker will be rendered directly in the user's browser.
        4. This results in an XSS vulnerability, where the attacker's JavaScript code executes within the context of the user's session when they view the blog post.
    * Impact:
        - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users viewing the compromised blog entry. This can lead to a range of attacks, including:
            - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
            - Defacement: Altering the visual appearance of the webpage as seen by the user.
            - Redirection: Redirecting users to attacker-controlled malicious websites.
            - Information theft: Accessing sensitive information from the user's browser, such as keystrokes or form data.
    * Vulnerability Rank: High
    * Currently implemented mitigations:
        - Django's template auto-escaping is generally enabled and provides a base level of protection. However, the effectiveness depends on the specific markup processor and any extensions used, which might bypass default escaping mechanisms if not carefully managed.
    * Missing mitigations:
        - Ensure that the chosen markup processor (Markdown, Textile, reStructuredText) is correctly configured with settings that enforce strict HTML sanitization and output escaping to prevent XSS.
        - Review and harden the `MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS` and `RESTRUCTUREDTEXT_SETTINGS` in `zinnia.settings.py`. Disable any extensions that are not essential and could potentially introduce XSS vulnerabilities due to unsafe HTML generation.
        - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of XSS by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
    * Preconditions:
        - The Zinnia application must be configured to use a markup language other than 'html' for blog entry content (e.g., 'markdown', 'textile', 'restructuredtext' set in `zinnia.settings.MARKUP_LANGUAGE`).
        - An attacker must be able to create and publish blog entries. User authentication for creating entries is assumed but depends on the Zinnia application's configuration.
    * Source code analysis:
        - File: `/code/zinnia/markups.py`
        - Function: `markdown(value, extensions=MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS)` (and similar for `textile` and `restructuredtext`)
        ```python
        def markdown(value, extensions=MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS):
            """
            Markdown processing with optionally using various extensions
            that python-markdown supports.
            ...
            """
            try:
                import markdown
            except ImportError:
                ...
                return value

            return markdown.markdown(force_str(value), extensions=extensions) # [POINT 1] Markdown content is processed here.
        ```
        - The `markdown.markdown(force_str(value), extensions=extensions)` call at [POINT 1] is where the Markdown content is processed and converted to HTML. If the `extensions` configured via `MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS` (in `zinnia.settings.py`) include extensions that are not XSS-safe, or if `python-markdown` itself has parsing vulnerabilities, it could lead to the injection of unsanitized HTML, resulting in XSS. The same applies to `textile` and `restructuredtext` processors.
    * Security test case:
        1. Modify the Zinnia settings to set `MARKUP_LANGUAGE = 'markdown'`.
        2. Log in to the Zinnia application with an account that can create blog entries.
        3. Create a new blog entry.
        4. In the content of the blog entry, insert a known XSS payload in Markdown format. For example:
           ```markdown
           **Test XSS** <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')">
           ```
           or using a link:
           ```markdown
           [Click me](javascript:alert('XSS'))
           ```
        5. Publish the blog entry.
        6. Access the published blog entry as a regular user (or while logged out).
        7. Observe if an alert box pops up in your browser, or if the JavaScript code executes. If the JavaScript executes, it confirms the XSS vulnerability in Markdown processing.
        8. Repeat the test by changing `MARKUP_LANGUAGE` to `'textile'` and `'restructuredtext'` and adjusting the XSS payloads to be appropriate for each markup language to test for XSS vulnerabilities across all supported markup formats. For Textile: `"`<script>alert('XSS')</script>"`:http://example.com  ` and for reStructuredText ``.. raw:: html\n\n   <script>alert("XSS")</script>``.
