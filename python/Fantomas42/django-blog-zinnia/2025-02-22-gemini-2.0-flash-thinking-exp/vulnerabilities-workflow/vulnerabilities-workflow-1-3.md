### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Markdown rendering
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a blog post using Markdown syntax.
    2. Within the Markdown content, the attacker injects malicious JavaScript code disguised as legitimate Markdown. For example, using an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` attribute or a `<script>` tag.
    3. When a user views the blog post, the Zinnia application renders the Markdown content into HTML.
    4. Due to insufficient sanitization of the Markdown input, the injected malicious JavaScript code is included in the rendered HTML output.
    5. The user's browser executes the malicious JavaScript code, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other harmful actions in the context of the user's session.
* Impact:
    - Account Takeover: If an administrator views the malicious post, the attacker could potentially steal their session cookies and gain administrative access to the Zinnia blog.
    - Data Theft: An attacker could steal sensitive information from users who view the compromised blog post.
    - Website Defacement: The attacker could modify the content of the blog page as seen by users.
    - Redirection to Malicious Sites: Users could be redirected to attacker-controlled websites, potentially leading to further exploitation.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project uses `django.utils.html.linebreaks` for HTML formatting when `MARKUP_LANGUAGE` is not set to 'markdown', 'textile', or 'restructuredtext'. `linebreaks` function escapes HTML but it is not applied when markdown is used.
    - The project uses `django.utils.html.strip_tags` in `zinnia/comparison.py` to remove HTML tags, but this is only used in the content comparison feature, not during general content rendering for blog posts.
    - There is no explicit HTML sanitization applied to user-provided Markdown content before rendering it in blog posts.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement HTML sanitization for Markdown, Textile, and ReStructuredText rendered content. Use a library like Bleach or similar to sanitize the HTML output generated by the markdown rendering process before displaying it to users. This would remove or neutralize any potentially malicious HTML tags or JavaScript.
* Preconditions:
    - The `MARKUP_LANGUAGE` setting in Zinnia is set to `markdown`. This is the default configuration as seen in `zinnia/settings.py`.
    - An attacker has the ability to create or edit blog posts, which is typically available to authenticated authors or administrators.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `zinnia/markups.py`**:
        ```python
        def html_format(value):
            """
            Returns the value formatted in HTML,
            depends on MARKUP_LANGUAGE setting.
            """
            if not value:
                return ''
            elif MARKUP_LANGUAGE == 'markdown':
                return markdown(value) # Potentially vulnerable markdown function
            elif MARKUP_LANGUAGE == 'textile':
                return textile(value)
            elif MARKUP_LANGUAGE == 'restructuredtext':
                return restructuredtext(value)
            elif '</p>' not in value:
                return linebreaks(value) # HTML escaping with linebreaks for non-markup
            return value
        ```
        - The `html_format` function determines how content is rendered based on the `MARKUP_LANGUAGE` setting.
        - When `MARKUP_LANGUAGE` is 'markdown', it calls the `markdown(value)` function.
        - **File: `zinnia/markups.py`**:
        ```python
        def markdown(value, extensions=MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS):
            """
            Markdown processing with optionally using various extensions
            that python-markdown supports.
            ...
            """
            try:
                import markdown
            except ImportError:
                ...
                return value

            return markdown.markdown(force_str(value), extensions=extensions) # Rendering markdown
        ```
        - The `markdown` function uses the `markdown.markdown` function from the `markdown` library to convert Markdown text to HTML.
        - **Vulnerability Point:**  The output of `markdown.markdown` is directly returned without any HTML sanitization. If the Markdown input contains malicious HTML or JavaScript, it will be rendered and executed in the user's browser.
    2. **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Input (Markdown with XSS) --> html_format() --> markdown() --> markdown.markdown() --> HTML Output (with XSS) --> Browser renders and executes XSS
        ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Login to the Zinnia admin panel as an author or administrator.
    2. Create a new blog entry.
    3. In the content editor, switch to Markdown mode if necessary.
    4. In the content field, insert the following Markdown code which contains a JavaScript payload:
        ```markdown
        # Test XSS in Markdown

        This is a test post to check for XSS vulnerability in Markdown rendering.

        <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected: Markdown Image Tag')" />

        Or alternatively, try a script tag:

        <script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected: Markdown Script Tag')</script>

        [Link with javascript](javascript:alert('XSS Vulnerability Detected: Link with Javascript'))
        ```
    5. Save and publish the blog entry.
    6. View the published blog entry on the public website.
    7. **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** An alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability Detected: Markdown Image Tag" or "XSS Vulnerability Detected: Markdown Script Tag" should appear when the page loads, or clicking on the link should execute javascript. This indicates that the JavaScript code injected through Markdown was executed by the browser, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
    8. **Expected Result (Mitigated):** No alert box should appear. The malicious code should be neutralized or removed by HTML sanitization, indicating that the vulnerability is mitigated.
