Based on the provided security review and the instructions, here's the updated list of vulnerabilities:

- **Vulnerability Name:** No High Severity Vulnerabilities Detected
  - **Description:**  
    A comprehensive review of all project files—including workflow configurations, build‐tools, Django field and widget implementations, serializers, template tags, admin filters, GraphQL types, and test cases—reveals that the code is designed to handle country data in a controlled and secure manner. All external inputs (whether passed as form data or used in serializers/lookups) are validated against a fixed set of trusted country codes and names. Critical functions that output HTML (for example, in the country select widget) utilize Django’s built‑in escaping functions (such as `escape` and controlled use of `mark_safe` with static layout strings) so that there is no opportunity for an external attacker to inject malicious content.  
    In summary, when the library is used as intended (with default Django settings and without insecure developer overrides), there is no pathway for an external threat actor to compromise the system.
    
  - **Impact:**  
    Since no vulnerabilities of high or critical severity were found, there is no exploitable impact on the publicly available instance of an application using this library. The integrity of both rendered content and data validation is maintained.
    
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**  
    N/A (None Detected)
    
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The widget rendering code (in particular, the `CountrySelectWidget.render` method) uses a default layout that incorporates proper escaping of dynamic parts (for example, using `escape` on IDs and deferring to Django’s safe string formatting).
    - The serializers and field conversion methods (in `serializer_fields.py` and `fields.py`) validate and constrain inputs to a fixed trusted list of country codes/names.
    - The package relies on Django’s internationalization, autoescaping, and error‐handling mechanisms, which further protect against injections and cross‑site scripting.
    
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    No additional mitigations are required. All functions and lookups (including those that use regex when explicitly requested) operate only on a trusted, static data set and are used in contexts where Django’s best practices (such as automatic output escaping) are in effect.
    
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The application is deployed with standard, secure Django settings.
    - Developers do not override key configuration parameters (for example, the layout for the country widget or the static country data via settings like `COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE`) in insecure ways.
    
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In **`django_countries/widgets.py`**, the default layout is defined as a constant string and inserted via Python’s `.format()` method. The only dynamic values are:
      - The country flag URL generated via the property `Country.flag`—this value is built using a format string defined in settings and is passed through a helper (`maybe_escape`) that calls Django’s `escape_html` when appropriate.
      - The widget’s rendered output (from the superclass) and the flag element’s id (which is escaped using Django’s `escape` function).  
      This controlled combination of static layout and properly escaped dynamic content ensures no injection (e.g. XSS) is possible via the widget.
      
    - In **`django_countries/fields.py`** and **`serializer_fields.py`**, incoming values (whether country codes or names) are run through conversion methods (such as `alpha2` and `by_name`) that compare against a hard-coded mapping of ISO 3166‑1 country data. This validation prevents manipulation by untrusted input.
      
    - All lookups and custom search functions (including those that use regex when explicitly requested via parameters) act only upon a limited, static set of country names and codes; thus, even if an attacker were able to supply a payload intended for a regex lookup, the default behavior (with `regex=False` unless intentionally specified) avoids exposure.
    
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    Although no high-severity vulnerabilities were found, a representative test to affirm the security posture could be as follows:
    1. **Form Input Check:**  
       – Submit a form that uses the country field by providing unexpected input (for example, an invalid country name such as “<script>alert(1)</script>”) in place of an expected country code.  
       – Verify that the serializer or form’s validation rejects the input and does not include the raw input in any error messages rendered in HTML.
    2. **Widget Output Verification:**  
       – Render a form containing the country widget and inspect its HTML output.  
       – Confirm that the output for the flag image and other dynamic attributes does not include any unsanitized input (for example, that IDs and URLs appear properly escaped).
    3. **API and GraphQL Endpoints:**  
       – If the package is used within a REST or GraphQL API, submit payloads with malicious country values and verify that error responses (if any) automatically escape user-supplied data.
       
    In all cases, the expected behavior is that invalid or unexpected input is properly sanitized or rejected, ensuring that no malicious content is ever rendered.
