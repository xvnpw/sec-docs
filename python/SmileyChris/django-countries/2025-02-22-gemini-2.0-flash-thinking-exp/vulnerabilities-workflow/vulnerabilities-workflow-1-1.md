### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via COUNTRY_CHANGE_HANDLER in CountrySelectWidget

* Description:
    1. An attacker can potentially influence the `COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL` setting in the Django project's settings.py file (though direct external manipulation is unlikely, misconfiguration or insecure application logic might allow this).
    2. The `CountrySelectWidget` in `django_countries/widgets.py` uses this `COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL` setting to dynamically construct JavaScript code in the `COUNTRY_CHANGE_HANDLER`.
    3. This JavaScript code is embedded directly into the HTML `onchange` attribute of the select widget.
    4. If `COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL` is set to a malicious URL containing JavaScript code (e.g., `'javascript:alert(1)'`), this malicious JavaScript will be executed when a user interacts with the CountrySelectWidget in the rendered form by changing the selected country.
    5. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.

* Impact:
    - High
    - Successful XSS can allow an attacker to:
        - Steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
        - Redirect users to malicious websites.
        - Deface the web page.
        - Perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
        - Inject malicious scripts to further compromise the user's system.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No direct mitigation in the `django-countries` project for this specific scenario. The code uses `escape(flag_id)` when formatting the layout, but this escapes the `flag_id` not the `COUNTRY_CHANGE_HANDLER` or the `src` url.
    - Django's template auto-escaping generally protects against XSS in templates, but here the Javascript is constructed directly in Python and inserted into the HTML attribute, bypassing standard template escaping mechanisms for attribute values.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for `COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL` setting. The application should ensure that this setting only contains a valid URL path and does not contain any JavaScript code or other potentially harmful content.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) could mitigate the impact of XSS by restricting the sources from which scripts can be executed, but it won't prevent the injection itself.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to find a way to influence or control the `COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL` setting. This is generally through application misconfiguration or insecure practices in the Django project using `django-countries`.  While direct external attacker control over Django settings is not standard, scenarios like insecure configuration management, or in very specific scenarios, if settings are derived from a database and that database is compromised, could potentially lead to this vulnerability.

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    File: /code/django_countries/widgets.py
    Content:
    ...
    COUNTRY_CHANGE_HANDLER = (
        "var e=document.getElementById('flag_' + this.id); "
        "if (e) e.src = '%s'"
        ".replace('{code}', this.value.toLowerCase() || '__')"
        ".replace('{code_upper}', this.value.toUpperCase() || '__');"
    )

    class CountrySelectWidget(LazySelect):
        ...
        def render(self, name, value, attrs=None, renderer=None):
            ...
            if widget_id:
                flag_id = f"flag_{widget_id}"
                attrs["onchange"] = COUNTRY_CHANGE_HANDLER % urlparse.urljoin(
                    settings.STATIC_URL, settings.COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL
                )
            else:
                flag_id = ""
            ...
    ```
    - The `COUNTRY_CHANGE_HANDLER` is a string containing JavaScript code.
    - In the `render` method of `CountrySelectWidget`, if a `widget_id` exists, the `onchange` attribute is set to the `COUNTRY_CHANGE_HANDLER` formatted with `urlparse.urljoin(settings.STATIC_URL, settings.COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL)`.
    - If `settings.COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL` is set to `javascript:alert(1)`, the rendered HTML will include `onchange="var e=document.getElementById('flag_' + this.id); if (e) e.src = 'javascript:alert(1)'...`.
    - When the select element's value is changed, this `onchange` handler will execute the JavaScript code injected via `COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL`, resulting in XSS.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Assume you have a Django application using `django-countries` and a form with `CountrySelectWidget`. For testing purposes, you need to be able to modify Django settings, which in a real-world scenario would represent a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the application using `django-countries`.
    2. **Modify settings:** In your Django project's `settings.py`, set `COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL = 'javascript:alert("XSS")'`.
    3. **Access the form:** Access the web page containing the form with the `CountrySelectWidget` in your browser.
    4. **Interact with the widget:** Change the selected country in the `CountrySelectWidget`.
    5. **Verify XSS:** An alert box with the message "XSS" should appear in your browser, demonstrating the execution of JavaScript code from the `COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL` setting via the `onchange` handler.
    6. **Inspect HTML source:** Inspect the HTML source code of the page. You should find the `select` element with an `onchange` attribute that contains the injected JavaScript code within the `COUNTRY_CHANGE_HANDLER`. For example:
    ```html
    <select onchange="var e=document.getElementById('flag_' + this.id); if (e) e.src = 'javascript:alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)'.replace('{code}', this.value.toLowerCase() || '__').replace('{code_upper}', this.value.toUpperCase() || '__');" id="id_country" name="country">
    ...
    </select>
    ```
    This confirms that the `COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL` setting can be abused to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
