- **Vulnerability: Unvalidated Attribute Injection Leading to Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - **Description:**  
    The widget‐tweaks template filters (such as `set_attr` and `append_attr`) and the `{% render_field %}` tag accept strings that specify HTML attribute names and values. In the function `_process_field_attributes` the attribute string is split with a regular expression (using a negative-lookbehind/lookahead to allow “::” as an escape) and then the resulting attribute name and value are used directly on the widget’s attributes in the wrapped `as_widget` method. No sanitization or strict validation is performed on either the attribute name or its value.  
    An attacker who can somehow influence the string passed as a parameter (for example, if unsanitized user input flows into these parameters via template context or dynamic template content) can inject malicious attribute names (such as event handlers like `onmouseover`) and/or attribute values (for example, JavaScript code such as `alert(1)`). When the widget is rendered, the malicious code would appear in the HTML output without being cleaned by the library.
  - **Impact:**  
    If an attacker’s injected attribute is rendered in a victim’s browser, it could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution (i.e. XSS). This may allow session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or even complete control over the victim’s interactions with the page.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    • The library relies on Django’s standard template rendering and auto-escaping for parts of its output.  
    • The use of Django’s `compile_filter` does enforce the template expression syntax—but it does not restrict what valid expressions may evaluate to.  
    However, no specific validation is performed on HTML attribute names or on the resulting values.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • Input validation or sanitization for attribute names and values should be introduced.  
    • A whitelist (or strict regex) restricting attribute names to known safe tokens should be used before inserting them into the widget’s attribute dictionary.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    • The attacker must be able to control or influence the string that is passed as a parameter to one of these widget-tweaks filters. (For instance, if a view uses unsanitized user data inside a template that uses `{% render_field %}`, then the malicious content will be injected.)  
    • The application must render the affected field for untrusted users.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    • In `_process_field_attributes(field, attr, process)` the attribute string is split with:  
      `params = re.split(r"(?<!:):(?!:)", attr, 1)`  
      This permits both unescaped (`:`) and escaped (`::`) colons but does not enforce a safe character set.  
    • The attribute (after a simple replacement of `::` with `:`) is then passed—with the value (or default boolean value)—to a local function that wraps `field.as_widget` by assigning a new method (without any sanitization).  
    • In filters such as `set_attr` and `append_attr`, the resolved value from the template filter is directly inserted into the widget’s attribute dictionary as `attrs[attribute] = value` (or appended).  
    • This chain of operations means that any malicious input that bypasses Django’s own escaping (or is injected into a developer-configured dynamic context) will be rendered as-is in the final HTML output.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Create a simple Django view that renders a form using a template that utilizes the `{% render_field %}` tag (or the `set_attr`/`append_attr` filters).  
    2. Modify the template context so that one of the parameters passed to widget-tweaks comes directly from a query parameter (or another user-controllable source).  
    3. Supply an attribute string such as:  
       `onmouseover:"alert('XSS')"`.  
    4. Load the affected page in a browser and inspect the rendered HTML to verify that an attribute like `onmouseover="alert('XSS')"` is present on the form field’s HTML element.  
    5. Verify that a mouseover event on the field triggers the JavaScript alert.

- **Vulnerability: Race Condition in Monkey‑Patching of Form Field Rendering Methods**
  - **Description:**  
    In order to modify form field attributes on the fly, widget‑tweaks (in `_process_field_attributes`) temporarily monkey‑patches the field’s `as_widget` method. Specifically, the code copies the current method (`old_as_widget = field.as_widget`), defines a new wrapper `as_widget` that modifies the passed attributes and then calls the old method, and finally reassigns `field.as_widget` to this new method. Immediately after rendering, the code resets `field.as_widget` back to `old_as_widget` on the *same* field instance.  
    This in-place modification is not thread-safe. In a multi-threaded deployment, if a form field instance happens to be shared between requests (for example, if a developer caches or reuses a form instance across sessions), then concurrent requests may interfere with each other. One thread’s override of `as_widget` might be unexpectedly clobbered or interact with another’s temporary state.
  - **Impact:**  
    • Inconsistent or corrupted rendering of form fields—attributes meant for one request may “leak” into another’s output.  
    • Potential exposure of sensitive field configuration or user-specific attributes.  
    • In extreme cases, it may allow an attacker to manipulate the presentation or behavior of form fields (if the attacker can drive concurrent requests against shared field objects).
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    • The code “resets” the monkey‑patched `as_widget` method to its original value after a render call.  
    However, this fix is implemented without any thread‑safety guarantees and assumes that each form and its fields are used in a strictly per-request context.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • A thread‑safe design for modifying the widget’s rendering behavior is missing—for example, by operating on a deep copy of the field or by using thread‑local storage.  
    • Clear documentation (and possibly defensive coding) advising that form instances must not be shared across threads.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    • The application must be deployed in a multi‑threaded environment (such as one using a threaded WSGI server).  
    • A form field instance must be shared concurrently across requests—this can occur if a developer caches form instances or widgets in global variables.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    • In `_process_field_attributes`, the following steps occur:  
      - The original `as_widget` method of a field is stored in `old_as_widget`.  
      - A new method `as_widget` is defined (which processes additional attributes and even changes widget properties like `input_type` if needed).  
      - The field’s `as_widget` method is replaced via:  
        `field.as_widget = types.MethodType(as_widget, field)`  
      - After the call to the old method (via `html = old_as_widget(...)`), the method is reset:  
        `self.as_widget = old_as_widget`  
    • Because this modification happens on the shared field instance (and without any locking/synchronization), two concurrent renderings could observe an inconsistent state or override each other’s temporary modifications.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. In a controlled test environment, create a Django application that (improperly) caches a form instance globally so that the same field object is used concurrently by different requests.  
    2. Simulate concurrent requests (for example, using a load-testing tool or threading in a test script) that use widget‑tweaks to render the same form field with slightly different attribute modifications.  
    3. Collect the rendered HTML from each request and examine whether attributes from one request “leak” into the output of another or whether rendering inconsistencies occur.  
    4. Observe that sometimes the field’s HTML contains an unexpected combination of attributes, confirming a race condition in the monkey‑patching mechanism.
