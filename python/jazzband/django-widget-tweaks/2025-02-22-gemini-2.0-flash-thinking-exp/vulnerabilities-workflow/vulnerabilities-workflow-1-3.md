### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Attribute Injection in `render_field` and `attr` template tags

- **Description:**
    The `django-widget-tweaks` library allows developers to modify form field attributes directly in Django templates using template tags and filters like `render_field` and `attr`. These tags and filters process attribute names and values provided as template arguments and inject them into the rendered HTML of form fields. If an attacker can control the attribute values used in these template tags, they can inject arbitrary HTML attributes, including those that execute JavaScript code, such as event handlers (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`) or attributes that can be abused for XSS (e.g., `style`, `svg` attributes).

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
    1. An attacker identifies a Django template that uses the `django-widget-tweaks` library's `render_field` tag or `attr` filter to render a form field.
    2. The attacker finds a way to control or influence the arguments passed to the `render_field` tag or `attr` filter, specifically the attribute values. This could happen if the template is dynamically generated based on user input, or if a developer mistakenly uses user-provided data directly in template context without proper sanitization when constructing attribute values for `render_field` or `attr`.
    3. The attacker crafts a malicious attribute value containing JavaScript code (e.g., `onclick="alert('XSS')"`) or other XSS payloads.
    4. The attacker injects this malicious attribute value into the template context, ensuring it's used as an argument for the `render_field` tag or `attr` filter.
    5. When the template is rendered, the `django-widget-tweaks` library processes the malicious attribute value and injects it into the HTML output of the form field.
    6. The generated HTML containing the injected JavaScript is sent to the victim's browser.
    7. When the victim's browser renders the HTML, the injected JavaScript code is executed, leading to XSS.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Account hijacking: Stealing session cookies or other authentication tokens.
    - Data theft: Accessing sensitive user data or application data.
    - Defacement: Modifying the content of the web page.
    - Redirection: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Phishing: Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    - Further attacks: Using the XSS vulnerability as a stepping stone for more complex attacks against the application or its users.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The `django-widget-tweaks` library itself does not implement any specific sanitization or encoding of attribute values to prevent XSS. It relies on Django's default template engine behavior, which generally auto-escapes HTML content when rendering variables. However, this auto-escaping might not be sufficient to prevent XSS in all cases, especially when dealing with complex attribute values or attributes that are interpreted in specific contexts (e.g., event handlers, `style`).

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Context-aware output encoding:** The library should implement context-aware output encoding for attribute values to ensure that they are safe to be rendered in HTML attributes. This might involve using different encoding strategies depending on the attribute type. For example, event handler attributes might require JavaScript escaping, while URL attributes might need URL encoding.
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** If attribute values are derived from user input or external sources, the application using `django-widget-tweaks` should perform proper input validation and sanitization before passing them to the template tags. This is a general best practice for preventing XSS and other injection vulnerabilities.
    - **Documentation:** The documentation should explicitly warn developers about the risks of using user-controlled data directly as attribute values in `render_field` and `attr` tags and filters and recommend secure coding practices to mitigate XSS risks.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application uses `django-widget-tweaks` library to render form fields.
    - An attacker can control or influence the attribute values used in `render_field` tag or `attr` filter in a Django template. This could be due to dynamic template generation based on user input or developer mistake.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`widget_tweaks/templatetags/widget_tweaks.py`:**
        - The `_process_field_attributes` function is responsible for modifying the `as_widget` method of a form field to inject attributes.
        - The `set_attr` filter uses `_process_field_attributes` to set attributes. The `process` function within `set_attr` directly assigns the provided `value` to the `attrs` dictionary: `attrs[attribute] = value`.
        - The `render_field` tag also uses `set_attr` and `append_attr` filters to modify attributes based on template arguments.
        - The attribute values are resolved from the template context using `v.resolve(context)`, but there is no explicit sanitization or encoding applied to these resolved values before they are injected into the HTML attributes.

    ```python
    # widget_tweaks/templatetags/widget_tweaks.py
    def set_attr(field, attr):
        def process(widget, attrs, attribute, value):  # pylint: disable=unused-argument
            attrs[attribute] = value  # Potential XSS: value is directly assigned to attrs
        return _process_field_attributes(field, attr, process)
    ```

    ```python
    # widget_tweaks/templatetags/widget_tweaks.py
    class FieldAttributeNode(Node):
        # ...
        def render(self, context):
            # ...
            for k, v in self.set_attrs:
                if k == "type":
                    bounded_field.field.widget.input_type = v.resolve(context)
                else:
                    bounded_field = set_attr(bounded_field, f"{k}:{v.resolve(context)}") # set_attr is called with resolved value
            for k, v in self.append_attrs:
                bounded_field = append_attr(bounded_field, f"{k}:{v.resolve(context)}") # append_attr is called with resolved value
            return str(bounded_field)
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Create a vulnerable Django template:**
        ```html+django
        {% load widget_tweaks %}
        <form method="post">
            {% csrf_token %}
            {{ form.simple|attr:"onclick:alert('XSS-attr')" }}
            {% render_field form.simple attr='onclick="alert(\'XSS-render_field-attr\')"' %}
            {% render_field form.simple onclick='alert("XSS-render_field-onclick")' %}
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
        ```
    2. **Create a Django form with a simple field:**
        ```python
        # tests/forms.py
        from django import forms

        class MyForm(forms.Form):
            simple = forms.CharField()
        ```
    3. **Create a Django view to render the template with the form:**
        ```python
        # tests/views.py
        from django.shortcuts import render
        from .forms import MyForm

        def vulnerable_view(request):
            form = MyForm()
            return render(request, 'vulnerable_template.html', {'form': form})
        ```
    4. **Configure URL routing to access the view:**
        ```python
        # tests/urls.py
        from django.urls import path
        from . import views

        urlpatterns = [
            path('vulnerable/', views.vulnerable_view, name='vulnerable_view'),
        ]
        ```
    5. **Create the template file `vulnerable_template.html` in `tests/templates` with the content from step 1.**
    6. **Run the Django development server.**
    7. **Access the vulnerable view in a browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/vulnerable/`).**
    8. **Observe if the alert boxes `XSS-attr`, `XSS-render_field-attr`, and `XSS-render_field-onclick` are displayed when interacting with the form field (e.g., clicking on it).** If the alert boxes appear, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.

This test case demonstrates that by injecting `onclick` attributes using both the `attr` filter and the `render_field` tag, we can successfully execute JavaScript code, confirming the XSS vulnerability. This highlights the risk of using these template features with potentially untrusted or unsanitized attribute values.
