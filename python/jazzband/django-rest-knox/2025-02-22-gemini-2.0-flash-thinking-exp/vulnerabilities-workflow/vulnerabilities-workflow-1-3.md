### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Predictable Token Key leading to potential Brute-Force Attack

- Description:
    1. An attacker attempts to log in or use a Knox token to access a protected resource.
    2. The `TokenAuthentication` class in `knox/auth.py` is used to authenticate the request.
    3. The authentication process retrieves tokens from the database using the first 15 characters of the provided token (`token_key`) for efficiency.
    4. While the full token is hashed, the initial 15 characters (`token_key`) are used for direct lookup in the database.
    5. Due to the relatively short length of the `token_key` (15 hexadecimal characters), the search space for brute-forcing the `token_key` is reduced.
    6. If an attacker can successfully guess a valid `token_key` for a user, they can then attempt to brute-force the remaining part of the token or try to exploit other weaknesses.
    7. Although guessing the full token is still computationally expensive due to hashing, knowing a valid `token_key` significantly reduces the search space and increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack, especially if combined with other attack strategies or lack of rate limiting.

- Impact:
    - Account Takeover: If an attacker successfully brute-forces a valid `token_key` and potentially the full token or exploits other weaknesses, they could gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Data Breach: With unauthorized access, attackers can potentially access sensitive user data and application data.
    - Reputation Damage: Successful attacks can damage the reputation of the application and the organization using it.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Hashing of the full token: The complete token is hashed using a strong algorithm (SHA512 by default) before being stored in the database. This prevents direct token theft from database breaches and makes full token brute-force computationally expensive.
    - `compare_digest` for hash comparison:  The `compare_digest` function is used to compare hashes, mitigating timing attacks during token verification.
    - Token expiry: Tokens have a configurable expiration time (`TOKEN_TTL`), reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to use compromised tokens.
    - Optional token limit per user: The `TOKEN_LIMIT_PER_USER` setting allows administrators to limit the number of active tokens per user, which can reduce the impact of token compromise.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Rate limiting on login attempts and token verification: There is no explicit rate limiting mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks on the login endpoint or token verification process. Implementing rate limiting would significantly increase the difficulty of brute-force attacks.
    - Increasing `TOKEN_KEY_LENGTH`: Increasing the length of `TOKEN_KEY_LENGTH` from the current 15 characters would exponentially increase the search space for brute-force attacks on the token key. While this might have a slight performance impact on token lookup, it would significantly improve security.

- Preconditions:
    - Publicly accessible login endpoint or API endpoint protected by Knox Token Authentication.
    - No rate limiting mechanism in place for login attempts or token verification.
    - Attacker has knowledge of a valid username in the system.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/knox/auth.py`
    - Function: `authenticate_credentials(self, token)`
    ```python
    def authenticate_credentials(self, token):
        '''
        Due to the random nature of hashing a value, this must inspect
        each auth_token individually to find the correct one.

        Tokens that have expired will be deleted and skipped
        '''
        msg = _('Invalid token.')
        token = token.decode("utf-8")
        for auth_token in get_token_model().objects.filter(
                token_key=token[:CONSTANTS.TOKEN_KEY_LENGTH]): # Vulnerable code: Using short token_key for lookup
            if self._cleanup_token(auth_token):
                continue

            try:
                digest = hash_token(token)
            except (TypeError, binascii.Error):
                raise exceptions.AuthenticationFailed(msg)
            if compare_digest(digest, auth_token.digest):
                if knox_settings.AUTO_REFRESH and auth_token.expiry:
                    self.renew_token(auth_token)
                return self.validate_user(auth_token)
        raise exceptions.AuthenticationFailed(msg)

                                                                        V

                                                                        V
        TokenAuthentication.authenticate_credentials() -> For each AuthToken:
                                                                            Hash provided token
                                                                            Compare hash with stored digest using compare_digest()
                                                                            If match, Authenticate user
        ```
    - The code efficiently uses `token_key` for database lookup, but the short length of `token_key` (defined by `CONSTANTS.TOKEN_KEY_LENGTH = 15` in `/code/knox/settings.py`) reduces the search space for brute-force attacks.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Create a user account in the Django application.
        - Ensure Knox authentication is enabled and protecting an API endpoint.
        - Disable any rate limiting mechanisms if present to clearly demonstrate the vulnerability.
    2. Procedure:
        - Obtain a valid username for the target application.
        - Write a script to brute-force the `token_key` (first 15 characters of the Knox token). This script would iterate through possible hexadecimal combinations of length 15.
        - For each generated `token_key`, construct a full token by appending random hexadecimal characters to reach the expected token length (64 characters as per default `AUTH_TOKEN_CHARACTER_LENGTH`).
        - For each generated full token, send an authenticated request to the protected API endpoint using the "Token <full_token>" authorization header.
        - Monitor the API responses. A successful authentication (HTTP 200 OK or similar) would indicate a successful brute-force of a valid token.
    3. Expected Result:
        - By iterating through a significant portion of the `token_key` space, the attacker should be able to find a valid `token_key` and subsequently a valid token that authenticates successfully against the API endpoint, demonstrating the vulnerability.
        - The time taken to find a valid token should be significantly less than a full brute-force of a 64-character hexadecimal token, highlighting the reduced security due to the short `token_key`.
