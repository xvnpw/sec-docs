## Combined Vulnerability List

Based on the analysis of the provided project files, the following vulnerability has been identified:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deployment Configuration: Debug Mode Enabled with Hardcoded Secret Key
  - **Description:**
    The project’s sample production settings (in `/code/sample_taggit/settings.py`) are configured for development rather than production. The file sets `DEBUG = True` and hardcodes an insecure value for `SECRET_KEY`. An external attacker can trigger error conditions (for example, by visiting a nonexistent or malformed URL) that will force the application to display detailed debug pages. These pages expose sensitive information such as the complete stack trace, internal configuration details, environment variables, and even the secret key itself.
    **Triggering steps:**
    1. The attacker accesses a URL that does not exist (for example, `<application-url>/nonexistent-url/`).
    2. With `DEBUG = True`, the application generates a detailed error page.
    3. The error page reveals internal configuration details, including the hardcoded secret key.

  - **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** Detailed debug output may reveal file paths, internal URLs, database queries, and other sensitive configuration data.
    - **Secret Exposure:** The hardcoded secret key can be used to forge session cookies or cryptographic tokens, potentially leading to session hijacking and subsequent system compromise.
    - **Expanded Attack Surface:** Exposure of detailed internal information can aid an attacker in devising further targeted attacks.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No production-level mitigations are implemented. The settings file (`/code/sample_taggit/settings.py`) is configured with defaults intended solely for development use (with `DEBUG = True` and a hardcoded `SECRET_KEY`).

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Disable Debug Mode in Production:** Set `DEBUG = False` for production deployments so that error details are not exposed externally.
    - **Secure Secret Management:** Do not hardcode `SECRET_KEY` in code; instead, load it from a secure external source (e.g., environment variables or a secrets management system).
    - **Proper Production Settings:** Implement additional production-safe settings such as specifying `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, configuring secure logging, and ensuring that error handlers do not reveal sensitive internal state.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed using the provided sample configuration from `/code/sample_taggit/settings.py`.
    - The instance remains publicly accessible with `DEBUG` enabled and the insecure, hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` in use.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/sample_taggit/settings.py`, the following lines are found:
      - `DEBUG = True`
      - `SECRET_KEY = "django-insecure-1$#3+wir_0n0&d#_f$35%b-fb_!f(8vzh8*a2x%ih*+j6*gih_"`
    - These settings are clearly meant for development. In a production environment, triggering an error (by accessing an invalid URL, for example) will render a full debug traceback that discloses internal configuration—including the secret key.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Deploy the application using the configuration found in `/code/sample_taggit/settings.py` on a publicly accessible server.
    2. **Trigger the Vulnerability:** From an external network (simulating an attacker), send an HTTP GET request to a non-existent URL (e.g., `<application-url>/nonexistent-url/`).
    3. **Observe the Result:**
       - Confirm that the response is a detailed debug page containing the full traceback along with internal configuration details.
       - Verify that sensitive data (such as the hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` and environment settings) is included in the output.
    4. **Document:** Record that the application is exposing full debug information and the secret key.
    5. **Remediation Check:** Modify the configuration to set `DEBUG = False` and load the secret key from a secure source, then repeat the test to ensure that detailed error information is no longer displayed.
