### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Unintended Feature Flag Control via URL Parameter when `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` is enabled

* Description:
    1. The application uses django-waffle for feature flagging.
    2. The `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` setting in django-waffle is set to `True`.
    3. When `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` is `True`, the `is_active` method of a Flag model checks for URL parameters matching the flag name.
    4. An attacker can craft a URL with a parameter like `flag_name=1` to activate the flag or `flag_name=0` to deactivate it for their session.
    5. By manipulating these URL parameters, an attacker can bypass the intended feature flag logic and potentially access features that should be disabled for them or disable features that should be enabled.

* Impact:
    - Unauthorized access to features: Attackers can enable flags intended for specific user groups (e.g., staff, superusers) or future features not yet meant for public access.
    - Unauthorized disabling of features: Attackers can disable flags that are essential for normal application functionality for their session.
    - Security bypass: Depending on the features controlled by flags, this could lead to significant security bypasses, such as accessing admin functionalities, bypassing payment checks, or viewing sensitive data.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project provides the `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` setting but relies on developers to disable it in production environments.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Strongly discourage and document against enabling `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` in production.** The documentation should clearly state that this setting is for development/testing only and must be disabled in production to prevent unauthorized feature access control.
    - **Consider removing or significantly restricting the `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` functionality.**  If this feature is only intended for development, it might be better to remove it entirely from production code paths or restrict its usage to authenticated superusers only, even when enabled.
    - **Implement a security check or warning if `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` is enabled in production.** The application could check the `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` setting at startup and log a warning or even refuse to start if it's enabled in a non-development environment (determined by environment variables or settings).

* Preconditions:
    - The `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` setting in `settings.py` is set to `True`.
    - The application is deployed in a publicly accessible environment.
    - At least one Flag is defined in the waffle system.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `waffle/models.py`**
    2. **Class: `AbstractBaseFlag`**
    3. **Method: `is_active(self, request: HttpRequest, read_only: bool = False) -> bool | None`**
    ```python
    def is_active(self, request: HttpRequest, read_only: bool = False) -> bool | None:
        # ... other checks ...

        if get_setting('OVERRIDE'): # [POINT OF VULNERABILITY]
            if self.name in request.GET:
                return request.GET[self.name] == '1'
        # ... rest of the logic ...
    ```
    - The `is_active` method checks if the `OVERRIDE` setting is enabled using `get_setting('OVERRIDE')`.
    - If `OVERRIDE` is `True`, it directly checks if the flag's name exists as a key in `request.GET`.
    - If the flag name is in `request.GET`, it returns `True` if the value is `'1'` and `False` otherwise.
    - This logic allows controlling the flag's active state directly through URL parameters if `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` is enabled.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-setup:**
        - Ensure `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE = True` is set in `test_settings.py` or a similar settings file used for testing the vulnerability.
        - Start the Django development server or deploy the application to a test instance.
        - Create a Flag named `test_flag` in the Django admin panel, with default settings (e.g., Everyone: Unknown).
    2. **Test Steps:**
        - Access the URL `/flag-on` in a browser. This view is decorated with `@waffle_flag('test_flag')`, so it should return 404 if the flag is not active by default. Observe a 404 response.
        - Modify the URL to `/flag-on?test_flag=1`. This appends the URL parameter `test_flag=1`.
        - Access the modified URL in the browser.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The application should now return a 200 OK response with the content "foo" (as defined in `flagged_view` in `test_app/views.py`). This indicates that the `test_flag` has been activated by the URL parameter, bypassing the default flag logic.
    4. **Cleanup:**
        - Revert `WAFFLE_OVERRIDE` setting to `False` after testing.
