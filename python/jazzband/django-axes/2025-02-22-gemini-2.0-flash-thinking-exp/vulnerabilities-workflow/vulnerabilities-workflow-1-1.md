## Vulnerability List for django-axes project

Based on the analysis of the django-axes project, no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified that meet the specified criteria for inclusion in this list.

**Analysis Summary:**

After a detailed review of the django-axes project, including its source code, tests, and security-related configurations, no vulnerabilities were found that:

*   Are triggerable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance.
*   Are not caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns in user projects (but originate from `django-axes` itself).
*   Are not solely due to missing documentation.
*   Are not denial of service vulnerabilities.
*   Are not already mitigated in the project.
*   Have a vulnerability rank of at least "high".

The project demonstrates good security practices, including:

*   **Input Sanitization:** The code appears to handle user inputs (like IP addresses and usernames) with care, minimizing the risk of injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Robust Authentication Logic:** The core functionality revolves around authentication monitoring and lockout, which is implemented with clear logic and configurable parameters.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The presence of a test suite suggests that security aspects are considered during development and that potential vulnerabilities are likely to be caught early.
*   **Automated Security Checks:** The CI/CD configuration includes steps for code quality and dependency checks, indicating a proactive approach to security.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the current analysis and the specified criteria, there are no high-rank vulnerabilities to list for the django-axes project. This assessment is based on the assumption that the provided project files represent the latest version of the django-axes project and that a reasonable level of security review has been conducted. Further in-depth security audits and penetration testing could be performed for a more exhaustive evaluation.
