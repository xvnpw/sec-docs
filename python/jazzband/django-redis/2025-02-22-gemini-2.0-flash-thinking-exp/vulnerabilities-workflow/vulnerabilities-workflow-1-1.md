### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Redis Configuration in Docker Compose
  - Description:
    1. The `docker-compose.yml` file configures a Redis service.
    2. The command used to start the Redis server includes `--enable-debug-command yes` and `--protected-mode no`.
    3. `--enable-debug-command yes` activates debug commands in Redis, which are generally not intended for production use and can expose internal server details or allow for server manipulation.
    4. `--protected-mode no` disables protected mode, which is a security feature in Redis that limits access from remote clients when no explicit bind or requirepass configuration is set. Disabling it without proper access control measures can expose the Redis instance to unauthorized access if the port is publicly accessible.
    5. If a publicly accessible instance of the application is deployed using this `docker-compose.yml`, and the Redis port (6379) is exposed, an external attacker can connect directly to the Redis instance.
    6. The attacker can then use debug commands and potentially other Redis commands to gain sensitive information about the Redis server or manipulate data if no further authentication is configured.

  - Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: Attackers can use debug commands to retrieve sensitive information about the Redis server's internal state, configuration, and potentially cached data.
    - Unauthorized Access: With `--protected-mode no`, and if no other authentication is in place, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the Redis instance and execute arbitrary Redis commands, potentially leading to data manipulation or further system compromise.

  - Vulnerability Rank: High

  - Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. This vulnerability is due to an insecure default configuration in the provided `docker-compose.yml` file, not within the django-redis Python code itself.

  - Missing mitigations:
    - Secure default configuration in `docker-compose.yml`:
      - Remove `--enable-debug-command yes` from the `redis-server` command. Debug commands should only be enabled in development environments and explicitly disabled in production.
      - Enable `--protected-mode yes` or configure proper access control using `bind` and `requirepass` options in a `redis.conf` file mounted into the container if public access is necessary and secured authentication is desired. If public access is not needed, restrict network access to the Redis port.

  - Preconditions:
    - A publicly accessible instance of the application is deployed using the provided `docker-compose.yml`.
    - The Redis port (6379) is exposed to the public internet or an attacker's network.

  - Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability is not within the Python source code of the `django-redis` library.
    - The insecure configuration is introduced directly in the `docker/docker-compose.yml` file:
      ```yaml
      File: /code/docker/docker-compose.yml
      Content:
      services:

        redis:
          image: redis:latest
          container_name: redis-primary
          command: redis-server --enable-debug-command yes --protected-mode no
          ports:
            - 6379:6379
          # ...
      ```
    - The `command: redis-server --enable-debug-command yes --protected-mode no` line is the source of the vulnerability.

  - Security test case:
    1. Deploy the application using the provided `docker-compose.yml`. Ensure that port 6379 on the host machine is publicly accessible or accessible from your testing environment.
    2. Install `redis-cli` if you don't have it already.
    3. Open a terminal and use `redis-cli -h <YOUR_PUBLIC_IP> -p 6379` to connect to the Redis instance. Replace `<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>` with the public IP address or hostname where the application is deployed.
    4. If the connection is successful (you get `127.0.0.1:6379>`), execute the command `INFO`.
    5. If the `INFO` command returns server information, it confirms that `--protected-mode no` is active and the Redis instance is accessible without authentication.
    6. Further, execute a debug command such as `DEBUG DIGEST`. If this command returns a digest, it confirms that `--enable-debug-command yes` is active.
    7. Successful execution of `INFO` and `DEBUG DIGEST` commands demonstrates the insecure configuration vulnerability.
