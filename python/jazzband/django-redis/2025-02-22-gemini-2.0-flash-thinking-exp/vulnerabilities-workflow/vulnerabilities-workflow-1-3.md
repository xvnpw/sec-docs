### Vulnerability List

*   #### Insecure Default Redis Configuration in Docker Compose

    *   **Description:**
        The provided `docker-compose.yml` file configures a Redis instance with insecure settings:
        1.  Protected mode is disabled (`protected-mode no`).
        2.  Debug commands are enabled (`--enable-debug-command yes`).
        3.  Redis port `6379` and Sentinel port `26379` are exposed to the host (`ports: - "6379:6379"` and `ports: - "26379:26379"`).

        These configurations are intended for a development environment. However, if a developer mistakenly deploys this docker-compose setup to a publicly accessible server, or if the exposed ports are accessible from the internet, it can lead to a security vulnerability. An external attacker could connect to the Redis instance without authentication and execute arbitrary Redis commands, including debug commands.

        **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1.  Deploy the application using the provided `docker-compose.yml` to a publicly accessible server.
        2.  Ensure that ports `6379` and/or `26379` are reachable from the attacker's network.
        3.  Use `redis-cli` or any Redis client to connect to the exposed Redis port (e.g., `redis-cli -h <public_server_ip> -p 6379`). No authentication is required.
        4.  Execute `INFO` command to verify access and confirm `protected_mode:no` and `debug_mode:yes` in the output.
        5.  Execute potentially harmful commands like `DEBUG OBJECT <key>`, `FLUSHDB`, `CONFIG GET *`, `CONFIG SET dir /tmp/`, `CONFIG SET dbfilename shell.php`, `SET shell "<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>"`, `SAVE`, and then access the web server to execute arbitrary commands if webserver user has write access to `/tmp/shell.php`.

    *   **Impact:**
        Critical. Unauthorized access to the Redis instance allows an attacker to:
        1.  Read all data stored in the cache.
        2.  Modify or delete data, leading to data corruption or application malfunction.
        3.  Execute arbitrary Redis commands, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if Redis server is misconfigured and attacker can leverage `CONFIG SET` and `SAVE` commands to write malicious files to the server's filesystem.
        4.  Gain internal system information via debug commands.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

    *   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
        None in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration itself. This configuration is intended for development, and assumes a trusted environment.

    *   **Missing mitigations:**
        For production-like deployments using Docker Compose, the following mitigations are missing:
        1.  **Enable protected mode:** Remove `--protected-mode no` from the `redis-server` command in `docker-compose.yml` or set `protected-mode yes` in a separate redis.conf.
        2.  **Disable debug commands:** Remove `--enable-debug-command yes` from the `redis-server` command.
        3.  **Implement authentication:** Configure Redis to require authentication using the `requirepass` directive in a redis.conf file and mount it to the container.
        4.  **Restrict network exposure:** Avoid exposing Redis ports directly to the public internet. If external access is needed, use a firewall or network segmentation to limit access to authorized IPs only. For development, consider binding to localhost only.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        1.  The application is deployed using the provided `docker-compose.yml`.
        2.  The server where docker-compose is deployed is publicly accessible, or ports `6379` and/or `26379` are reachable from the attacker's network.

    *   **Source code analysis:**
        The vulnerability is not in the Python code, but in the `docker/docker-compose.yml` file:

        ```yaml
        File: /code/docker/docker-compose.yml
        Content:
        services:

          redis:
            image: redis:latest
            container_name: redis-primary
            command: redis-server --enable-debug-command yes --protected-mode no
            ports:
              - 6379:6379
            healthcheck:
              test: redis-cli ping
              interval: 5s
              timeout: 5s
              retries: 5

          sentinel:
            image: redis:latest
            container_name: redis-sentinel
            depends_on:
              redis:
                condition: service_healthy
            entrypoint: "redis-sentinel /redis.conf --port 26379"
            ports:
              - 26379:26379
            volumes:
              - "./sentinel.conf:/redis.conf"
            healthcheck:
              test: redis-cli -p 26379 ping
              interval: 5s
              timeout: 5s
              retries: 5
        ```

        The line `command: redis-server --enable-debug-command yes --protected-mode no` in the `redis` service definition disables security features of Redis. The `ports: - "6379:6379"` line exposes Redis port to the host, making it potentially accessible from outside.

    *   **Security test case:**
        1.  Start the docker containers using `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d`.
        2.  Find the IP address of the host where docker-compose is running (let's say it's `<public_server_ip>`).
        3.  From an attacker machine, use `redis-cli` to connect to the exposed Redis instance: `redis-cli -h <public_server_ip> -p 6379`.
        4.  If the connection is successful without asking for password, the vulnerability exists.
        5.  Execute `INFO` command in `redis-cli`. Verify that `protected_mode:no` is present in the output.
        6.  Execute `CONFIG GET debug-output-options`. Verify that debug commands are enabled.
        7.  Attempt to set a key: `SET testkey testvalue`.
        8.  Attempt to get the key: `GET testkey`. Verify that you can read the value.
        9.  Attempt to execute a debug command: `DEBUG OBJECT testkey`. Verify that debug information is returned.
