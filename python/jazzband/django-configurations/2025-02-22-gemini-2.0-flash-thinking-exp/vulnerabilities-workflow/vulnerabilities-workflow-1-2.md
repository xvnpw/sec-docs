- **Vulnerability Name:** Hardcoded Django SECRET_KEY with DEBUG Mode Enabled
  **Description:**
  An attacker may trigger an error page on a publicly deployed instance when the application’s settings (taken directly from the sample test project) are used in production. In this configuration, the SECRET_KEY is hardcoded to a known value and DEBUG is enabled by default. An attacker who forces an error (for example, by accessing a URL that raises an exception) could cause Django to render a detailed debug traceback that exposes internal configuration data—including the secret key. With the SECRET_KEY in hand, the attacker could forge session cookies or tamper with any data that relies on cryptographic signatures.
  **Impact:**
  - Session hijacking and impersonation of users.
  - Forging security-critical tokens (such as password reset tokens or cookies).
  - General compromise of application integrity due to the attacker’s ability to craft data using the known secret.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The project does provide mechanisms for overriding settings through environment variables (for example, using values.BooleanValue with environ=True); however, in the default test configuration, no override is enforced and the hardcoded value is used.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - No enforcement of retrieving SECRET_KEY from a secure, external source (such as an environment variable) in production.
  - Lack of a dedicated production configuration that sets DEBUG to False and replaces the hardcoded SECRET_KEY.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application is deployed using the default test_project settings in which DEBUG remains enabled and SECRET_KEY is hardcoded.
  - The deployment environment does not override these defaults using secure environment variables.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `/code/test_project/test_project/settings.py`, the line
    `SECRET_KEY = '-9i$j8kcp48(y-v0hiwgycp5jb*_)sy4(swd@#m(j1m*4vfn4w'`
    shows a hardcoded secret key.
  - The setting for DEBUG is defined as:
    `DEBUG = values.BooleanValue(True, environ=True)`
    meaning that unless an environment variable override is provided, DEBUG remains True.
  - With DEBUG enabled, Django’s detailed error pages are shown when an exception occurs, leaking this information.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Deploy the application using the default test_project settings without setting an environment override for SECRET_KEY or DEBUG.
  2. Identify or create a URL/view that produces an unhandled exception (for example, by requesting a non-existent resource or triggering an error in a view).
  3. Observe the generated error/debug page and verify that it displays detailed traceback information that includes internal settings (look especially for the hardcoded SECRET_KEY or other sensitive variables).
  4. Using the exposed SECRET_KEY, attempt to craft or forge session cookies (or other signed information) and use these to gain unauthorized access to parts of the application (if the application’s session handling accepts these cookies).
  5. Confirm that the attack leads to privilege escalation or unauthorized data disclosure.

- **Vulnerability Name:** DEBUG Mode Enabled in Production
  **Description:**
  The test_project settings default to DEBUG mode being enabled. When DEBUG is True, any unhandled exception causes Django to return a detailed error page that includes stack traces, settings values, and other sensitive details. An external attacker can force an error (for example, by supplying a malformed request or intentionally triggering an exception) to obtain internal configuration details and possibly sensitive file paths or credentials.
  **Impact:**
  - Sensitive information disclosure through detailed error pages.
  - Information that can be pieced together to facilitate further attacks (e.g., learning about the structure of the settings, installed apps, and file locations).
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Although the configuration code allows for environment variable overrides (using the `values.BooleanValue` with `environ=True` for DEBUG), the default value in the test settings remains True. There is no explicit safeguard to force DEBUG to False in a production deployment.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - A production-ready configuration that explicitly sets DEBUG to False.
  - Automated checks or deployment procedures that prevent production deployment with DEBUG enabled.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application is deployed using the default configuration where DEBUG is not overridden and remains set to True.
  - The deployed instance is accessible by external users.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `/code/test_project/test_project/settings.py`, the DEBUG setting is configured as:
    `DEBUG = values.BooleanValue(True, environ=True)`
    which defaults to True if no environment override is provided.
  - With DEBUG enabled, Django displays verbose error pages when an exception occurs, thereby disclosing internal configuration details and any environment-specific values that are computed at runtime.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Deploy the application with the default test_project configuration and without setting an override for DEBUG.
  2. Access a URL or perform an action that is known to trigger an unhandled exception (for example, by navigating to a URL that does not exist or deliberately provoking an error in a view).
  3. Confirm that the error page shows a full traceback and internal configuration data.
  4. Document the sensitive information (such as file paths, environment variable values, and any other internal settings) that appear in the error details.
  5. Use the information gathered to outline further potential attack vectors that would be feasible if an attacker had this inside knowledge.
