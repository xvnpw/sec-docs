- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SQL query display
  - Description: An attacker can craft a malicious SQL query that, when displayed in the Silk UI, executes arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This is possible because the SQL query content is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the SQL detail view. An administrator viewing the Silk UI could be compromised if a malicious SQL query is logged.
    Steps to trigger:
    1. An attacker needs to trigger the logging of a malicious SQL query.
    2. The malicious SQL query string should contain JavaScript code disguised within the query.
    3. An administrator logs into the Silk UI and navigates to the SQL detail view for the request that triggered the malicious query.
    4. When the SQL detail page renders, the unsanitized malicious SQL query is displayed, and the JavaScript code embedded within it is executed in the administrator's browser.
  - Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). If an administrator views the malicious SQL query, arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed in their browser within the context of the Silk UI. This could lead to session hijacking, account takeover, or other malicious actions performed on behalf of the administrator.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: None
  - Missing Mitigations: Implement output sanitization/escaping in the template `silk/templates/silk/sql_detail.html` for `sql_query.formatted_query`.
  - Preconditions: Django-silk is installed and enabled in a Django project. An attacker can somehow cause a malicious SQL query to be logged by django-silk. An administrator with access to the Silk UI views the SQL detail page containing the malicious query.
  - Source Code Analysis: Template `silk/templates/silk/sql_detail.html` renders `sql_query.formatted_query` without any sanitization. `sql_query.formatted_query` is obtained from `sqlparse.format(self.query, reindent=True, keyword_case='upper')` in `silk/models.py`, which does not sanitize HTML characters.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Craft a malicious SQL query string containing JavaScript code: `SELECT '<img src=x onerror=alert(\'XSS\')>' AS malicious_query;`
    2. Execute this malicious SQL query in the monitored Django application to ensure it gets logged by django-silk.
    3. Log in to the Silk UI as an administrator.
    4. Navigate to the "Requests" view in the Silk UI.
    5. Find the request that corresponds to the execution of the malicious SQL query.
    6. Click on the request to view its details and then go to the "SQL" tab.
    7. Click on the SQL query to view its details.
    8. Observe that an alert box appears in your browser, confirming the XSS vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in raw request/response body display
  - Description: An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code within the raw request or response body of an HTTP request handled by the monitored application. If an administrator views the raw body in the Silk UI, this JavaScript code could be executed in their browser due to insufficient sanitization of the raw body content before rendering in the `silk/raw.html` template.
    Steps to trigger:
    1. An attacker needs to send a request to the monitored application with a malicious JavaScript payload embedded in the request body or trigger a response with a malicious payload.
    2. The malicious JavaScript code should be embedded within the raw body.
    3. An administrator logs into the Silk UI and navigates to the request detail view.
    4. The administrator views the raw request or response body by navigating to the "Raw" tab.
    5. When the raw body is rendered in `silk/raw.html`, and if it's unsanitized, the JavaScript code is executed.
  - Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). If an administrator views the raw request or response body containing malicious JavaScript, arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed in their browser within the context of the Silk UI, potentially leading to session hijacking, account takeover.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations: Unknown. Assumed none.
  - Missing Mitigations: Implement output sanitization/escaping in `silk/templates/silk/raw.html` for the `body` variable.
  - Preconditions: Django-silk is installed and enabled. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the raw request or response body. An administrator with access to the Silk UI views the raw body.
  - Source Code Analysis: The `Raw` view in `silk/views/raw.py` passes the `body` variable to `silk/raw.html` without sanitization. Assuming `silk/raw.html` renders `body` directly without sanitization.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Craft a malicious JS payload in the response body, e.g., a JSON response: `{"data": "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_RAW_BODY')>"}`.
    2. Trigger a request to an endpoint in the monitored application that returns this malicious response.
    3. Log in to the Silk UI as an administrator.
    4. Navigate to the "Requests" view.
    5. Find the request corresponding to the endpoint returning the malicious response.
    6. Click on the request to view details and go to the "Raw" tab.
    7. Select 'response' and 'raw' in the dropdowns.
    8. Observe if an alert box appears, confirming XSS in raw body display.
