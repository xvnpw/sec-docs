- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated Access to Profiling and Inspection Interface
  **Description:**
  An external attacker can directly navigate to any Silk UI endpoint (by default mounted under “/silk/”) without any authentication. An attacker can view detailed profiling data including intercepted HTTP requests and responses, database queries (with timings and even the raw SQL), request headers (which may include sensitive cookies or API tokens) and even sampled stack traces.
  **Impact:**
  Attackers may learn internal data about application logic, database structure and query performance, helping them refine further attacks such as targeted injections or remote code execution exploits.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Optional configuration settings (e.g. `SILKY_AUTHENTICATION` and `SILKY_AUTHORISATION`) exist in the Silk config.
  - Authentication/authorisation decorators (e.g. `login_possibly_required`) are present in the codebase but are no‑ops when the corresponding flags are disabled.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - By default, both authentication and authorisation for the Silk UI are disabled.
  - No built‑in CSRF protection or enforced access control exists unless developers explicitly enable these settings.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application is deployed in a publicly accessible environment with the default Silk settings (debug/profiling enabled and no authentication).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The README and configuration documents state that “by default anybody can access the Silk user interface by heading to `/silk/`.”
  - In `silk/middleware.py` and various view modules (e.g. `silk/views/summary.py`), the authentication decorators are implemented as pass‑through functions unless the settings flags are turned on.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Using an external HTTP client (such as cURL or a web browser), send a GET request to an endpoint under `/silk/` (for example, `http://<target_host>/silk/`).
  2. Verify that the response returns the Silk summary page or other sensitive profiling details (headers, SQL timings, etc.) without any authentication prompt.
  3. Repeat for endpoints like `/silk/request/<uuid>/` and `/silk/cleardb/` to confirm that no access control is enforced.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthenticated Access to Administrative Data Deletion Endpoint
  **Description:**
  The Silk project provides a “clear DB” view (mounted at “/silk/cleardb/”) which allows an administrator to purge all logged requests and profiling data. By default this endpoint is unprotected, and an attacker who discovers it may submit a POST request to delete critical diagnostic and forensic data.
  **Impact:**
  An attacker could sabotage system diagnostics and security investigations by wiping out historical logs, making it harder to detect and analyze more severe attacks later.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The view uses optional authentication/authorisation wrappers (via decorators like `login_possibly_required`) that only enforce checks when configuration flags are enabled.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - With the default configuration (`SILKY_AUTHENTICATION` and `SILKY_AUTHORISATION` off), no authentication check is performed.
  - No additional confirmation prompt or audit logging exists to help prevent inadvertent or malicious deletion of log data.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application is deployed with the default Silk settings in a production or publicly accessible environment, leaving the “/silk/cleardb/” endpoint fully open.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `silk/views/clear_db.py`, the GET handler displays a confirmation page and the POST handler checks for a simple form field (e.g. `clear_all=on`), then deletes data from multiple models without verifying the user’s identity.
  - The authentication decorators are no‑ops when the related settings are not enabled.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Using an HTTP client, send a POST request to `http://<target_host>/silk/cleardb/` with the form parameter `clear_all=on`.
  2. Confirm that the response indicates the Silk logging data has been deleted.
  3. Optionally, verify via the Silk UI or the database that the log records have been cleared.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Debug Mode Enabled in Production
  **Description:**
  The Django application’s settings (in `/code/project/project/settings.py`) specify `DEBUG = True` and `DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS = True`. When deployed in production, these settings cause detailed error pages—including stack traces and sensitive configuration data—to be shown when errors occur. An external attacker can deliberately trigger errors (for example, by accessing non-existent URLs) to obtain internal system details.
  **Impact:**
  Detailed disclosure of internal application state, configuration settings, and potentially sensitive data (such as database credentials and the secret key) can facilitate targeted attacks including session forgery, remote code execution, and privilege escalation.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - None; the default settings hardcode `DEBUG = True` for development purposes.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - In production, `DEBUG` should be set to `False` and `DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS` adjusted accordingly.
  - Use environment variables or dedicated configuration management to ensure production settings do not expose sensitive information.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application is deployed using the project’s default settings, leaving it in development mode in a publicly accessible environment.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `/code/project/project/settings.py`, the values `DEBUG = True` and `DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS = True` are explicitly set.
  - This configuration ensures that any unhandled exception will render a detailed debug page with stack traces and internal data.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Deploy the application with the default settings.
  2. Use a web browser or HTTP client (like cURL) to deliberately trigger an error (e.g., request a non-existent URL such as `http://<target_host>/nonexistent`).
  3. Examine the returned error page and verify that it contains detailed debug information including stack traces, configuration variables, and possibly the SECRET_KEY.
  4. Confirm that this sensitive information is exposed to the attacker.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Hard-Coded Secret Key in Application Settings
  **Description:**
  The application’s settings file (`/code/project/project/settings.py`) defines a fixed `SECRET_KEY` that is embedded directly in the source code. If this key is ever exposed—especially via debug error pages when `DEBUG = True`—an attacker could use it to forge session cookies, tamper with cryptographic signatures, and bypass security controls.
  **Impact:**
  Exposure of the hard-coded secret key can allow an attacker to impersonate users (by forging cookies or tokens) and compromise session integrity, which might lead to unauthorized actions or access escalation.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - There are no runtime safeguards to protect the embedded secret key; it is stored in the settings file and committed to source control.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The secret key should not be hard-coded. Instead, it should be injected via secure external sources such as environment variables or a secrets management service.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application must be deployed using the default settings, and debug mode (or similar functionality) must allow internal configuration details (including the SECRET_KEY) to be revealed during error conditions.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `/code/project/project/settings.py`, the `SECRET_KEY` is defined as:
    `SECRET_KEY = 'ey5!m&h-uj6c7dzp@(o1%96okkq4!&bjja%oi*v3r=2t(!$7os'`
    This hard-coded key is permanently stored in the source code with no alternative configuration mechanism.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Deploy the application with the provided settings.
  2. Trigger an application error (for example, by accessing a non-existent URL) that causes the debug error page to be displayed.
  3. Inspect the error page to verify whether the `SECRET_KEY` is visible in the configuration details.
  4. Optionally, attempt to use the disclosed key to craft forged session cookies and determine if the application accepts them as valid.
