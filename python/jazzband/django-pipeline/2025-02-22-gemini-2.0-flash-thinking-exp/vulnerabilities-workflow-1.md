## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Command Injection in SubProcessCompressor via Django Settings

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in SubProcessCompressor via Django Settings
* Description: An attacker with administrative privileges can modify Django settings such as `CSSTIDY_BINARY`, `CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS`, `YUI_BINARY`, `YUI_JS_ARGUMENTS`, `YUI_CSS_ARGUMENTS`, `TERSER_BINARY`, `TERSER_ARGUMENTS`, `UGLIFYJS_BINARY`, `UGLIFYJS_ARGUMENTS`, `CLOSURE_BINARY`, `CLOSURE_ARGUMENTS`. By injecting malicious commands into these settings, they can achieve arbitrary command execution on the server when the corresponding compressor is used. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs administrative access to the Django application settings.
* Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the server, potentially leading to full server compromise, data breach, and other malicious activities.
* Vulnerability Rank: critical
* Currently implemented mitigations: None in the project code itself. Mitigation relies on secure Django settings management and restricting administrative access in Django applications that use django-pipeline.
* Missing mitigations: Input validation and sanitization for settings used in `SubProcessCompressor.execute_command`. While it might be argued that sanitizing Django settings within `django-pipeline` is outside the library's scope, clear documentation highlighting the security implications of directly using user-provided data in compressor settings is crucial.  Specifically, the documentation should strongly advise against allowing user-controlled values to populate these settings and recommend secure configuration practices. Implement strict validation and sanitization for all settings related to compressor binaries and arguments. Ensure that binary paths are absolute and point to trusted executables. Sanitize arguments to prevent injection of malicious commands. Consider using `shlex.quote` to properly escape arguments passed to subprocess.
* Preconditions:
    - Administrative access to the Django application to modify settings.
    - The application uses a compressor that extends `SubProcessCompressor` (like `CSSTidyCompressor`, `YUICompressor`, `TerserCompressor`, `UglifyJSCompressor`, `ClosureCompressor`).
    - CSS or Javascript compression is triggered, which uses the configured compressor. An attacker needs to achieve a state where they can manipulate Django settings related to compressor configurations (e.g., `CSSTIDY_BINARY`, `CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS`, etc.). This is typically not directly possible from the outside unless there is another vulnerability enabling settings injection or configuration compromise. One of the compressors that use `SubProcessCompressor` must be configured and used in the Django application.
* Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/pipeline/compressors/__init__.py`
        ```python
        class SubProcessCompressor(CompressorBase):
            def execute_command(self, command, content):
                argument_list = []
                for flattening_arg in command:
                    if isinstance(flattening_arg, (str,)):
                        argument_list.append(flattening_arg)
                    else:
                        argument_list.extend(flattening_arg)

                pipe = subprocess.Popen(
                    argument_list,
                    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
                )
                # ...
        ```
        The `SubProcessCompressor.execute_command` method uses `subprocess.Popen` to execute external commands. The `command` argument is constructed in the compressor classes that inherit from `SubProcessCompressor`.
    - File: `/code/pipeline/compressors/csstidy.py` (Example Compressor)
        ```python
        class CSSTidyCompressor(SubProcessCompressor):
            def compress_css(self, css):
                output_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".pipeline")

                command = (
                    settings.CSSTIDY_BINARY,
                    "-",
                    settings.CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS,
                    output_file.name,
                )
                self.execute_command(command, css)
                # ...
        ```
        In `CSSTidyCompressor`, the `command` is constructed using `settings.CSSTIDY_BINARY` and `settings.CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS`. Similar patterns exist in other compressors like `YUICompressor`, `TerserCompressor`, `UglifyJSCompressor`, and `ClosureCompressor`, using their respective settings. If an attacker can modify these settings to inject malicious commands, `subprocess.Popen` will execute them, leading to command injection. The `SubProcessCompressor.execute_command` method directly executes commands using `subprocess.Popen` based on the `command` argument. The `command` is constructed in subclasses like `CSSTidyCompressor`, `YUICompressor`, etc., using settings. `CSSTidyCompressor` and other compressors construct the `command` tuple using settings like `settings.CSSTIDY_BINARY` and `settings.CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS`. If these settings are compromised, command injection is possible.
* Security test case:
    1. Set up a Django project and install `django-pipeline`. Configure `pipeline` to use `CSSTidyCompressor` for CSS compression.
    2. Gain administrative access to the Django admin panel of the test project (or use any method to modify Django settings, e.g., directly editing `settings.py` if accessible).
    3. Modify the `PIPELINE_CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS` setting in Django settings to include a malicious command, for example: `--optimise=2 & touch /tmp/pwned &`. The complete setting might look like:
        ```python
        PIPELINE = {
            'CSS_COMPRESSOR': 'pipeline.compressors.csstidy.CSSTidyCompressor',
            'CSSTIDY_BINARY': '/usr/bin/csstidy', # Replace with actual path if needed
            'CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS': '--optimise=2 & touch /tmp/pwned &',
            # ... other pipeline settings
        }
        ```
    4. Trigger CSS compression. This can be done by:
        - Running `python manage.py collectstatic`. Pipeline compression is typically triggered during `collectstatic` if configured.
        - Accessing a page in the Django application that uses pipeline compressed CSS.
    5. After triggering compression, log into the server where the Django application is running and check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.
    6. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it indicates successful command injection through the `PIPELINE_CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS` setting. Setup: Configure a Django project using `django-pipeline` and enable CSS compression using `CSSTidyCompressor`. Vulnerable Configuration: Modify the Django settings to include a malicious command in `settings.CSSTIDY_BINARY` or `settings.CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS`. For example, set `PIPELINE['CSSTIDY_BINARY'] = "sh"`, and `PIPELINE['CSSTIDY_ARGUMENTS'] = ("-c", "touch /tmp/pwned")`. Trigger Compression: Access any webpage that utilizes CSS compression via pipeline (e.g., using `{% stylesheet %}`). This will trigger the CSS compression process, including the execution of the configured CSSTidy compressor. Observe Command Execution: Check if the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` is executed on the server. Verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created. Successful creation of this file confirms command injection. Verify Command Injection: If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created after triggering the pipeline, it confirms the command injection vulnerability. This demonstrates that by manipulating compressor settings, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server.

### 2. Sensitive Information Disclosure via Inline Compilation Error Details

* Vulnerability Name: Sensitive Information Disclosure via Inline Compilation Error Details
* Description: When asset compilation (for CSS or JavaScript) fails in django‐pipeline, the error is caught and rendered inline via the pipeline templatetag code. In particular, the method `render_error` (in `pipeline/templatetags/pipeline.py`) passes the full compiler error—including the command line that was executed and its error output—to the template “pipeline/compile_error.html” with only minimal filtering (removing ANSI escape sequences). An external attacker who is able to trigger a compiler error (for example, by requesting a package that is built from a malformed static asset) may force the application to reveal sensitive internal details. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to: 1. Identify a static asset that is processed by django-pipeline. 2. Manipulate or request an asset in a way that causes the compilation process to fail (e.g., by requesting a non-existent or malformed source file if possible, or by exploiting other application vulnerabilities to corrupt source files). 3. Access a page that includes the pipeline templatetag referencing the problematic asset when `DEBUG=True` or `SHOW_ERRORS_INLINE=True`.
* Impact: Sensitive details such as absolute filesystem paths, command‐line arguments, and environment details may be disclosed in the HTTP response. This information can aid an attacker in further reconnaissance and exploitation of the host system.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations: The library uses the Django setting `SHOW_ERRORS_INLINE` (which by default is tied to the value of Django’s `DEBUG`) so that in a properly configured production environment (with `DEBUG=False`), inline error details will not be rendered.
* Missing mitigations:
    - No explicit enforcement exists within django‐pipeline to disable inline error detail output in production regardless of `DEBUG` or `SHOW_ERRORS_INLINE` settings.
    - There is no additional sanitization (beyond stripping certain ANSI sequences) of the error output before it is inserted into HTML.
* Preconditions:
    - The application must be deployed with `DEBUG=True` (or with `SHOW_ERRORS_INLINE` inadvertently enabled) in production.
    - An attacker must be able to trigger a compiler error (for example, by referencing a static asset that fails to compile).
* Source code analysis:
    - File: `pipeline/templatetags/pipeline.py`
        ```python
        def render_error(self, e, template_name="pipeline/compile_error.html"):
            error_message = re.sub(r'\x1b[^m]*m', '', force_str(e))
            command_line = subprocess.list2cmdline(e.command)
            return mark_safe(render_to_string(template_name, {
                'error': error_message,
                'command': command_line,
                'verbose': settings.DEBUG,
            }))
        ```
        In `pipeline/templatetags/pipeline.py` the `render_error` method receives a `CompilerError` instance and applies a regex substitution to remove ANSI escape sequences. It then calls `render_to_string("pipeline/compile_error.html", …)` passing along the error message and the invoked command (via `subprocess.list2cmdline(e.command)`). No further sanitization is performed. This means that if an attacker can force a compiler error, the HTTP response will include potentially sensitive internal data.
    - File: `pipeline/compile_error.html`
        ```html+django
        {% if verbose %}
            <div class="pipeline-error">
                <pre>
                    Command: {{ command }}
                    Error: {{ error }}
                </pre>
            </div>
        {% endif %}
        ```
        The template `pipeline/compile_error.html` then displays this information.
* Security test case:
    1. Configure a Django installation with django‐pipeline and set `DEBUG=True` (or explicitly enable `SHOW_ERRORS_INLINE`).
    2. Configure a pipeline asset (for example, a stylesheet) whose source file is replaced or malformed so that the underlying compiler (e.g. a SASS or CoffeeScript compiler) fails. For example, you can modify a source file of a CSS asset to contain invalid syntax.
    3. Load a page that uses a `{% stylesheet ... %}` or `{% javascript ... %}` tag referencing this asset in a browser.
    4. Inspect the rendered HTML source code in the browser.
    5. Verify that the rendered HTML contains an error block (within a `div` with class `pipeline-error`) that includes detailed information—such as absolute paths in the `command` and error details in the `error` section.
    6. Confirm that such details are no longer rendered when `DEBUG=False` (and hence when `SHOW_ERRORS_INLINE` is disabled).

### 3. Potential Path Traversal in Static File Serving When DEBUG Is Enabled in Production

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Path Traversal in Static File Serving When DEBUG Is Enabled in Production
* Description: The view function `serve_static` (in `pipeline/views.py`) is intended for development use only. It first calls `default_collector.collect(request, files=[path])` on the requested file and then passes the request along to Django’s built‑in static file server. Although Django’s static file view uses a safe join to combine the document root with the requested path, no additional validation is performed in `serve_static` to reject path–traversal patterns (e.g. using “../”). An attacker can exploit this if `DEBUG=True` is enabled in production. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to: 1. Ensure the Django application is running with `DEBUG=True` or the `--insecure` flag enabled in production. 2. Craft a URL to the `/static/pipeline/` endpoint that includes path traversal elements (e.g., `..`). For example, `/static/pipeline/..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd`. 3. Access this crafted URL through a web browser.
* Impact: If the application is misconfigured and deployed with `DEBUG=True` (or run with the insecure option), an attacker may be able to craft URLs with path traversal elements that could allow reading files outside the intended static directory. This could lead to exposure of sensitive files on the filesystem.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations: The function immediately raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception when Django’s `DEBUG` is False (unless the `--insecure` flag is explicitly used), thereby discouraging its use in production. Also, Django’s own static file serving view uses `safe_join` to limit file access within Django's `STATIC_ROOT`.
* Missing mitigations:
    - There is no explicit check within `serve_static` to sanitize or normalize the incoming `path` parameter beyond relying on Django’s static file serving logic.
    - The library depends entirely on developers ensuring that `DEBUG` is disabled in production for security.
* Preconditions:
    - The application is deployed with `DEBUG=True` (or with the `--insecure` flag) in production.
    - An attacker can craft a URL with path traversal sequences in the `path` parameter.
* Source code analysis:
    - File: `pipeline/views.py`
        ```python
        def serve_static(request, path, insecure=False, **kwargs):
            if not settings.DEBUG and not insecure:
                raise ImproperlyConfigured(
                    "The staticfiles serve view can only be used in debug mode or "
                    "with the --insecure option.")
            normalized_path = safe_join(settings.STATIC_ROOT, path)
            if normalized_path is None:
                raise Http404("'%s' could not be located in STATIC_ROOT" % path)

            default_collector.collect(request, files=[path]) # Potential issue: path is not sanitized
            return static.serve(request, path, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT, **kwargs) # Django's serve uses safe_join
        ```
        In `pipeline/views.py`, the function `serve_static` accepts a `path` parameter from the request URL and passes it to `default_collector.collect` (which uses the raw file name in its logic) and then to Django’s static file server. Although Django’s implementation of `serve()` uses `safe_join` to combine `STATIC_ROOT` and `path`, the lack of additional validation (or explicit rejection) in django‐pipeline before calling `default_collector.collect(request, files=[path])` means that an attacker exploiting a misconfigured environment might attempt traversal. The `default_collector.collect` might operate on the path without proper sanitization before Django's `static.serve` handles the actual file serving.
* Security test case:
    1. In a test Django installation with django‐pipeline, deliberately set `DEBUG=True` in `settings.py` to simulate a production misconfiguration.
    2. Ensure you have some static files deployed and `STATIC_ROOT` is configured to a directory containing these files.
    3. Craft a URL to the static serve view using a path that includes “../” (for example, if your static URL prefix is `/static/`, try `/static/pipeline/..%2Fmanage.py`). You may need to URL-encode the path traversal characters (e.g., `%2F` for `/`).
    4. Send a GET request to this crafted URL using a browser or `curl`.
    5. Observe whether the response reveals any file contents that lie outside the intended static directory (e.g., the content of `manage.py` or other sensitive files depending on your server's filesystem structure relative to `STATIC_ROOT`).
    6. Verify that if `DEBUG` is later set to `False`, accessing the same URL will result in an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception.

### 4. Potential Command Execution via Malicious File Names in SubProcessCompiler

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Execution via Malicious File Names in SubProcessCompiler
* Description: In several compiler classes (which inherit from `SubProcessCompiler` in modules such as `sass.py`, `less.py`, `coffee.py`, etc.), the command to be executed is built by “flattening” a tuple from settings (for example, settings like `SASS_BINARY`, `LESS_BINARY`, or `COFFEE_SCRIPT_BINARY`). The flattening process does little or no validation of the individual components. If an attacker can somehow cause a static asset file name—or a related setting value—to include unexpected characters (such as spaces or shell metacharacters), the resulting command–line argument list may be altered. Even though subprocess execution is done with `shell=False` (thus largely preventing shell injection), malformed or malicious file names or configuration values could theoretically cause unexpected behavior or, in conjunction with another vulnerability (for example, an insecure file–upload facility), lead to arbitrary command execution. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to: 1. Find a way to introduce a malicious filename into the static asset processing pipeline. This could be through an independent file upload vulnerability, or if the application dynamically generates filenames based on user input without proper sanitization, or if an attacker can somehow modify files in the static files storage. 2. Craft a malicious filename containing shell- Metacharacters or unexpected spaces that, when processed by a compiler, could alter the intended command execution. For example, a filename like `test; touch /tmp/pwned.coffee`. 3. Trigger the compilation process for the asset with the malicious filename. This might involve requesting a page that uses the asset, or by manually triggering asset compilation tasks if such functionality is exposed.
* Impact: If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker for whom file names are controllable to influence the command arguments passed to external compilers. This might enable the execution of unintended commands, potentially leading to full system compromise.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The command is executed via `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=False` so that the arguments are passed as a list rather than a concatenated string, which mitigates many shell‐injection risks.
    - Under normal operation, asset file names come from a static files system that is not under attacker control.
* Missing mitigations:
    - There is no explicit sanitization or validation of file names or settings values when constructing the command argument list within `SubProcessCompiler.execute_command`.
    - The design assumes that the static asset file names (and related settings values) are trusted. An additional layer of input validation would reduce potential risk, especially in environments where file uploads or dynamic file naming is possible.
* Preconditions:
    - An attacker must have an independent means (such as an insecure file upload vulnerability or a way to manipulate static file storage) to upload or modify static asset file names so that they contain malicious content.
    - The affected compiler must be triggered during asset processing so that the file name is included in the flattened command argument list.
* Source code analysis:
    - File: `pipeline/compilers/__init__.py`
        ```python
        class SubProcessCompiler(Compiler):
            # ...
            def execute_command(self, command, cwd=None, display_stdout=False,
                                display_stderr=False, content=None, filename=None,
                                **kwargs):
                if filename:
                    command = tuple(command) + (filename,) # Filename appended without sanitization

                command = list(self.flatten_command(command)) # Flattening happens here
                command = list(filter(None, command))

                if not command:
                    return '', ''
                # ...
                process = Popen(
                    command, cwd=cwd, env=env,
                    stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, stdin=PIPE, shell=False) # shell=False is good, but filename is unsanitized
                # ...
        ```
        The `SubProcessCompiler.execute_command` method appends the filename to the command without sanitization. The `flatten_command` method handles lists and tuples within the command definition. Each element of the command tuple is checked: if it is a string it is added directly, and if not (list or tuple), it is iterated over and flattened recursively. The final list of arguments is then filtered with a simple `filter(None, ...)` and passed directly to `subprocess.Popen`. No escaping or sanitization is applied to arbitrary file name inputs before being appended to the command. Although using a list of arguments (with `shell=False`) avoids classic shell injection, an attacker’s control over the file name could cause unexpected behavior in the called compiler because the filename is passed as a command-line argument without proper quoting or sanitization.
    - File: `pipeline/compilers/__init__.py`
        ```python
        def flatten_command(self, command):
            for arg in command:
                if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
                    for sub_arg in self.flatten_command(arg): # Recursive flattening
                        yield sub_arg
                else:
                    yield arg
        ```
        The `flatten_command` method handles lists and tuples within the command definition.
* Security test case:
    1. Set up a test environment with django-pipeline and a compiler enabled (e.g., CoffeeScript).
    2. Create or simulate a scenario where a static asset filename can be controlled or influenced by an attacker. For a simplified test, you might manually create a file with a malicious name directly in your static files directory. Let's assume you create a file named `test;touch /tmp/pwned.coffee` (or similar, adapted to your OS).
    3. Configure a pipeline asset to process this malicious file. For example, if you are using CoffeeScript, create a pipeline configuration that includes `test;touch /tmp/pwned.coffee`.
    4. Trigger asset compilation. This could be done by running `python manage.py collectstatic` or by accessing a page that uses the relevant static asset if the compilation happens on-demand.
    5. Monitor the command executed by the compiler. You can achieve this by:
        - Replacing the actual compiler binary (e.g., `coffee`) with a simple script that logs the command-line arguments it receives and then exits.
        - Using system monitoring tools to observe the processes spawned by Python and their arguments.
    6. Verify whether the executed command includes the malicious filename directly and unsanitized, e.g., you might see something like `coffee test;touch /tmp/pwned.coffee`.
    7. Check if the side effect of the malicious command is executed. In the example `test;touch /tmp/pwned.coffee`, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created. If it was, it confirms that command injection is possible through malicious filenames.
    8. (Mitigation Test) Implement filename sanitization in `SubProcessCompiler.execute_command` to only allow safe characters in filenames before appending them to the command. Retest with the same malicious filename and verify that the vulnerability is no longer exploitable. For example, you could sanitize the filename to remove or escape shell-sensitive characters before command execution.

### 5. Path Traversal via Glob Pattern in Package Sources

* Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal via Glob Pattern in Package Sources
* Description: The `pipeline.glob.glob` function is utilized to locate source files for CSS and JavaScript packages based on patterns specified in Django settings under `PIPELINE['STYLESHEETS']` and `PIPELINE['JAVASCRIPT']`. The `Package.sources` property, defined in `pipeline/packager.py`, employs `glob.glob` to resolve the `source_filenames` configured for each package. If these `source_filenames` patterns are not properly validated, and an attacker gains control or influence over them, a malicious pattern could be crafted to traverse directories beyond the intended static file locations. By exploiting this, an attacker could potentially include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem into the pipeline's processing flow. This could lead to information disclosure or other vulnerabilities, contingent on how these included files are subsequently processed. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to achieve a state where they can manipulate the `source_filenames` patterns within the Django settings for `PIPELINE['STYLESHEETS']` or `PIPELINE['JAVASCRIPT']`.
* Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files from the server, potentially exposing source code, configuration files, or confidential data.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations: No direct mitigations are implemented within the project code to sanitize glob patterns in package configurations. The project assumes that developers will provide secure patterns in their settings.
* Missing mitigations: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for glob patterns defined in `PIPELINE['STYLESHEETS']` and `PIPELINE['JAVASCRIPT']` settings. Restrict patterns to only allow paths within designated static file directories, explicitly preventing directory traversal sequences such as `..`.
* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to achieve a state where they can manipulate the `source_filenames` patterns within the Django settings for `PIPELINE['STYLESHEETS']` or `PIPELINE['JAVASCRIPT']`. In typical Django deployments, direct external manipulation of settings is not feasible unless a separate configuration vulnerability exists or there is an indirect mechanism for settings injection.
    - The `pipeline` module must be actively enabled and in use within the Django application.
* Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/pipeline/packager.py`
        ```python
        class Package:
            # ...
            @property
            def sources(self):
                if not self._sources:
                    paths = []
                    for pattern in self.config.get("source_filenames", []): # Pattern from config
                        for path in glob(pattern): # glob.glob is called here
                            if path not in paths and find(path):
                                paths.append(str(path))
                    self._sources = paths
                return self._sources
        ```
        The `Package.sources` property retrieves `source_filenames` patterns from the package configuration and passes them to the `glob(pattern)` function. These patterns originate from the Django settings files (`css_packages`, `js_packages`).
    - File: `/code/pipeline/glob.py`
        ```python

        def iglob(pathname):
            """Return an iterator which yields the paths matching a pathname pattern."""
            if not has_magic(pathname):
                yield pathname

        `glob.glob` and `glob.iglob` utilize standard Python library functions `os.path` and `fnmatch`, which are inherently vulnerable to path traversal attacks if the input patterns are not properly sanitized.
* Security test case:
    1. **Setup:** Configure a Django project using `django-pipeline`.
    2. **Vulnerable Configuration:** Modify the Django settings to include a malicious path traversal pattern in `PIPELINE['STYLESHEETS']` or `PIPELINE['JAVASCRIPT']`. For example, alter `PIPELINE['STYLESHEETS']['screen']['source_filenames']` to `("../../../../../../../etc/passwd",)`.
    3. **Trigger Pipeline:** Access any webpage that utilizes the `{% stylesheet "screen" %}` template tag (or the package you modified). This action will initiate the pipeline to process the "screen" CSS package.
    4. **Observe Attempted File Access:** Monitor the application's behavior and logs. Observe if the pipeline attempts to access or process the `/etc/passwd` file. In a real-world scenario, this might manifest as errors in the application logs related to file access, or potentially, depending on error handling, the contents of `/etc/passwd` could be inadvertently included in the processed output.
    5. **Verify Path Traversal:** If the pipeline attempts to access `/etc/passwd` (or a similar sensitive file outside the static file directory), it confirms the path traversal vulnerability. This indicates that `glob.glob` processes the malicious pattern, and a setting compromise could lead to unauthorized file access.

    **Note:** This test case is designed to demonstrate the vulnerability assuming a hypothetical scenario where settings can be modified. In a standard deployment, direct external manipulation of Django settings is not typically possible. However, the analysis reveals that `django-pipeline` lacks sanitization of glob patterns, making it potentially vulnerable if a method to compromise settings exists, or if user-provided data is unsafely incorporated into these patterns.
