- **Improper Cookie Parsing in Silent Login Validator**  
  - **Description:**  
    The custom OAuth2 validator’s method for silent login (in `/code/tests/app/idp/idp/oauth.py`) extracts the session cookie directly from the raw `HTTP_COOKIE` header by doing a simple split on “; ” and then splitting again on “=”. Instead of using Django’s trusted cookie parser (e.g. `request.COOKIES`), it uses a naïve “startswith” check that will match cookie names with accidental or malicious prefixes. An attacker who can control the raw HTTP headers can send a cookie with a name that begins with the expected session cookie name (for example, “sessionid_malicious=attackervalue”), causing the parsing loop to break early and use the attacker‑supplied value. When the application calls Django’s `SessionStore` using that manipulated value, it may load an attacker‑controlled session, thereby bypassing authentication.  
    _Step‑by-step trigger:_  
    1. Deploy the IDP application using test settings so that the custom OAuth2 validator’s `validate_silent_login` is active.  
    2. Craft an HTTP request to a protected OAuth endpoint and set the `HTTP_COOKIE` header to include a cookie named with a prefix matching (but not equal to) the legitimate session cookie (for example, `sessionid_malicious=attackervalue`).  
    3. Because the validator checks cookie names with a “startswith” routine instead of an exact match, it selects the malicious cookie value.  
    4. Django’s session middleware loads the session based on the attacker‑supplied session ID, and the authentication check is bypassed.  
  - **Impact:**  
    An attacker can perform session fixation or session hijacking, misleading the application into treating the supplied session as valid and granting access to session‑protected functionality.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The logic is implemented “as‑is” in the test configuration and uses a naïve string split without any further runtime checks or use of the secure Django cookie parser.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • Use Django’s built‑in cookie parser (via `request.COOKIES`) rather than manually parsing `HTTP_COOKIE`.  
    • Verify that the cookie name exactly equals the configured session cookie name rather than checking with “startswith”.  
    • Gracefully handle missing or malformatted cookies.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    • The IDP application is deployed using test/development settings with the custom OAuth2 validator active.  
    • The attacker can send arbitrary HTTP headers (and therefore control the cookie header).  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    • In `/code/tests/app/idp/idp/oauth.py`, the method `validate_silent_login` retrieves the raw string from `request.headers.get("HTTP_COOKIE")`.  
    • The code splits the cookie string using `split("; ")` and iterates over the resulting tokens.  
    • For each token, it performs a `cookie.split("=")` and then checks if the token starts with the session cookie name (using a “startswith” check).  
    • Because the check uses “startswith”, a cookie named, for example, `sessionid_malicious` will be accepted.  
    • Finally, the code calls `SessionStore` with the attacker‑supplied cookie value, resulting in a bypass of authentication controls.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the IDP instance with the test configuration (ensuring the silent login validator is active).  
    2. Use a tool (such as curl or Postman) to send an HTTP request to a protected OAuth endpoint with a header, for example:  
       ```
       HTTP_COOKIE: sessionid_malicious=attackercontrolledvalue; othercookie=foo
       ```  
    3. Verify that the application accepts the malicious cookie value and that the response indicates an authenticated session (for example, by accessing protected content).  
    4. A successful bypass confirms the vulnerability.

- **Insecure Use of OAuthLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT Setting**  
  - **Description:**  
    In the IDP settings file (`/code/tests/app/idp/idp/settings.py`), the environment variable `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` is assigned a default value of `"1"`, which is interpreted as truthy. This forces OAuthlib to allow non‑HTTPS (insecure HTTP) connections even when the application is deployed publicly. An attacker on the same network can intercept OAuth flows and view or tamper with transmitted tokens and credentials.  
    _Step‑by-step trigger:_  
    1. Deploy the IDP application with test settings still in place (keeping `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` enabled).  
    2. Initiate an OAuth flow (e.g. request an authorization code or access token) using HTTP instead of HTTPS.  
    3. Use a network interception tool (like Wireshark or mitmproxy) to capture the network traffic.  
    4. Extract sensitive OAuth tokens or credentials from the cleartext HTTP communications.  
  - **Impact:**  
    Allowing OAuth flows over HTTP makes the communications vulnerable to man‑in‑the‑middle attacks. An attacker intercepting the traffic could capture tokens and client credentials to impersonate legitimate users or clients.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The insecure transport setting is documented as test‑only and is enabled by default in the test configuration. However, there is no runtime safeguard preventing its use in a publicly accessible deployment.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • Production deployments should override this setting (or remove it altogether) so that OAuthlib enforces HTTPS.  
    • Restrict network access to OAuth endpoints so that they are only reachable over TLS‑protected channels.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    • The IDP application is publicly deployed using a test configuration in which `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` is set to `"1"`.  
    • HTTP (rather than HTTPS) is used to communicate with the OAuth endpoints.  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    • In `/code/tests/app/idp/idp/settings.py`, the setting is established as:  
      ```python
      OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT = (bool, "1")
      ```  
    • Later in the settings, the code assigns:  
      ```python
      os.environ["OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT"] = env("OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT")
      ```  
    • This ensures that OAuthlib’s HTTPS requirement is effectively disabled.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the IDP instance with the test configuration (with `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` left at its default value of `"1"`).  
    2. Initiate an OAuth flow using HTTP (not HTTPS).  
    3. On the same network, run a packet‑sniffing tool (such as Wireshark) to capture the OAuth-related HTTP traffic.  
    4. Verify that OAuth tokens and client credentials are transmitted in cleartext.  
    5. Successful interception of sensitive data confirms the vulnerability.

- **Insecure Error Handling in OIDC Mixins under DEBUG Mode**  
  - **Description:**  
    The mixins used for OpenID Connect endpoints—the `OIDCOnlyMixin` and the `OIDCLogoutOnlyMixin` (in `/code/oauth2_provider/views/mixins.py`)—are designed to restrict access when OIDC or OIDC RP‑Initiated Logout is disabled. In both mixins, if the corresponding OIDC setting is not enabled and Django’s `DEBUG` setting is True, the mixin raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception with a detailed error message. This behavior is intended for development only. However, if test or development settings (with `DEBUG=True`) are mistakenly deployed to production, an external attacker can trigger these endpoints to receive verbose exception details outlining internal configuration and operational logic.  
    _Step‑by-step trigger:_  
    1. Deploy the application in a public environment using a configuration where `DEBUG=True` and OIDC (or OIDC RP‑Initiated Logout) is disabled (i.e. `oauth2_settings.OIDC_ENABLED` or `oauth2_settings.OIDC_RP_INITIATED_LOGOUT_ENABLED` is False).  
    2. Send an HTTP request (such as a GET request) to an endpoint that utilizes either `OIDCOnlyMixin` or `OIDCLogoutOnlyMixin`.  
    3. The mixin’s `dispatch` method checks the corresponding OIDC setting. When it finds that OIDC is not enabled, it then examines the value of `settings.DEBUG`.  
    4. Since `DEBUG` is True, the mixin raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception that contains a detailed error message (and possibly a stack trace) highlighting configuration details.  
  - **Impact:**  
    The detailed error messages and stack traces disclosed in the response allow an attacker to gather internal configuration details, including which OIDC features are (or are not) enabled. This information may aid in mapping out the internal workings of the application and facilitate further attacks.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    The code itself attempts to avoid misdirection by defaulting to a generic 404 response when `DEBUG` is False. However, when `DEBUG` is True—a setting meant only for development—the detailed exception is raised without any further sanitization.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    • Ensure that production deployments never use `DEBUG=True`.  
    • Even when in development mode, consider providing a generic error message (or logging detailed errors server‑side only) rather than returning detailed exception information in responses.  
    • Add a safeguard (or use middleware) that prevents detailed configuration errors from being sent in HTTP responses regardless of the DEBUG setting.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    • The application is publicly deployed using a test or development configuration where `DEBUG=True`.  
    • The OIDC (or OIDC RP‑Initiated Logout) setting is disabled, causing the mixins to trigger the error-handling code path.  
    • An attacker is able to access endpoints that use the affected mixins.  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    • In `OIDCOnlyMixin.dispatch`, the code checks if `oauth2_settings.OIDC_ENABLED` is False.  
    • If it is not enabled and `settings.DEBUG` is True, the method raises:  
      ```python
      raise ImproperlyConfigured(self.debug_error_message)
      ```  
    • Similarly, `OIDCLogoutOnlyMixin.dispatch` checks `oauth2_settings.OIDC_RP_INITIATED_LOGOUT_ENABLED` and raises an exception with a detailed debug message when the setting is not enabled and DEBUG is True.  
    • These exceptions may reveal internal configuration details and hints about the system’s architecture.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Deploy the application with a configuration that (mistakenly) sets `DEBUG=True` and disables OIDC (or OIDC RP‑Initiated Logout).  
    2. Identify an endpoint that incorporates either `OIDCOnlyMixin` or `OIDCLogoutOnlyMixin`.  
    3. Use a tool like curl or a web browser to issue an HTTP request to that endpoint.  
    4. Observe that the response is not a generic HTTP 404 but a detailed error message (and possibly a stack trace) that includes internal configuration details.  
    5. The presence of detailed error messages confirms that the vulnerability is present.
