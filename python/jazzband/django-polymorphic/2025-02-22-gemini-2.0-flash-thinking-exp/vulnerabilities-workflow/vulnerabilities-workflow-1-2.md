- **Vulnerability: Hardcoded Secret Key and Debug Mode Enabled in Production Settings**
  **Description:**  
  The example project’s production settings file (located at `/code/example/example/settings.py`) is configured with a hardcoded secret key and has `DEBUG = True`. An external attacker who discovers these settings (for example, when this open–source example is deployed as is) can leverage the known secret to forge session cookies, tamper with password reset tokens, or manipulate other security–sensitive data. In addition, with debug mode enabled, any unhandled error could reveal full stack traces and internal configuration details—greatly aiding an attacker in further exploiting the system.  
  **Impact:**  
  *Critical.*  
  If deployed unchanged in production, an attacker may gain:  
  - The ability to forge or abuse cryptographically signed cookies,  
  - Access to internal error messages that disclose file paths, database configurations, and portions of the source code,  
  - Opportunities to escalate privileges or tailor further attacks using the exposed internal details.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:**  
  Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - A testing settings file (`/code/polymorphic_test_settings.py`) sets `DEBUG = False` and uses a simplified secret; however, this is only intended for tests.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - The secret key must be sourced from an environment variable or a secure configuration management system, not hardcoded in the source.  
  - `DEBUG` must be set to `False` in any production deployment.  
  - Additional production hardening (e.g. secure cookies, HSTS, proper logging, etc.) should be applied.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The application is deployed using the settings file at `/code/example/example/settings.py` without modification in a publicly accessible production environment.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/example/example/settings.py`, the file begins with:  
    ```python
    DEBUG = True
    …
    SECRET_KEY = "5$f%)&a4tc*bg(79+ku!7o$kri-duw99@hq_)va^_kaw9*l)!7"
    ```  
    Since these values are not overridden based on production criteria, any instance built with this file carries the risk.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Deploy the example application using the current production settings (with `DEBUG = True` and the hardcoded `SECRET_KEY`).  
  2. Cause an error (for example, by visiting a non-existent URL) and observe that Django renders a detailed debug page exposing internal configuration and stack trace information.  
  3. Using the known `SECRET_KEY`, attempt to craft a forged session cookie or password reset token, then submit it to the application to determine if cryptographic verification is bypassed.  
  4. Verify that modifying the settings to read the `SECRET_KEY` from a secure environment and setting `DEBUG = False` prevents these exploits.

- **Vulnerability: Missing ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration Leading to Host Header Attacks**  
  **Description:**  
  In the production settings file (`/code/example/example/settings.py`), there is no explicit `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting defined. When the application is deployed without imposing an allowed list of domain names—even if `DEBUG` is later set to `False`—Django may not correctly validate the Host header of incoming requests. An attacker might supply a malicious Host header and, in certain circumstances, exploit the misconfiguration to enable host header injection attacks (which can lead to issues such as cache poisoning, spoofed password reset URLs, or phishing).  
  **Impact:**  
  *High.*  
  A missing or improperly configured `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting can allow an attacker to control which host headers are accepted by Django. This misconfiguration may result in compromised session security and allow an attacker to misdirect user trust.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:**  
  High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - There is no mitigation implemented in the production configuration; `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is not defined in `/code/example/example/settings.py`.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - An explicit list of allowed domain names (or IP addresses) must be enforced via the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting when deploying with `DEBUG = False`.  
  - Where possible, filtering or normalization of Host headers should be reinforced by middleware or a reverse proxy.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The application is deployed in production with `DEBUG` turned off while lacking an appropriate `ALLOWED_HOSTS` configuration.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/example/example/settings.py`, there is no definition such as:  
    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com']
    ```  
    Without an explicit list, Django’s host header validation may be bypassed or misconfigured when DEBUG is disabled.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Deploy the application with the current settings, then set `DEBUG = False` but leave `ALLOWED_HOSTS` undefined.  
  2. Send an HTTP request with an arbitrary Host header (e.g., `evil.com`).  
  3. Confirm that Django does not reject the request as it would if a proper `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list were configured.  
  4. Verify that forged host values in generated links (such as those in password reset emails) use the malicious host.  
  5. After securing the configuration with a valid `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list, check that requests with invalid Host headers are correctly rejected.

- **Vulnerability: Unpinned Dependency Versions in Build System**  
  **Description:**  
  The project dependency configuration file (`/code/pyproject.toml`) specifies a requirement for Django using an open-ended version constraint (`django>=3.2`) without an upper bound. This unpinned dependency version range means that any future release of Django that meets the minimum version requirement could be installed—even if it later contains breaking changes or has been compromised. An attacker who manages to subvert the package supply chain could potentially publish a malicious Django version that still satisfies the version constraint, thereby introducing harmful code into the production environment.  
  **Impact:**  
  *High.*  
  If a malicious or vulnerable release of Django is installed due to the unpinned version constraint, the attacker may be able to:  
  - Execute malicious code in the context of the application,  
  - Bypass or weaken established security controls,  
  - Compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:**  
  High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The `/code/pyproject.toml` file lists the dependency as:  
    ```toml
    requires = [
        "setuptools",
        "django>=3.2",  # for makemessages
    ]
    ```  
    There is no upper bound or explicit version pinning specified.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - The dependency on Django should be pinned to a narrowly defined version range (for example, `django>=3.2,<3.3`) or a specific version should be used.  
  - The project should employ a dependency lock file or include hash verification to ensure only validated package versions are installed.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The application is built and deployed in an environment where dependency resolution is based solely on the open-ended version specification in `/code/pyproject.toml`, without additional mechanisms (such as a lock file) to enforce a specific Django version.  
  - An attacker is able to compromise the package supply chain or repository hosting Django such that a malicious version within the allowed range is published.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the `/code/pyproject.toml` file under the `[build-system]` section, Django is required as follows:  
    ```toml
    requires = [
        "setuptools",
        "django>=3.2",  # for makemessages
    ]
    ```  
    The absence of an upper bound means that any Django version above 3.2 is acceptable. This creates a window of opportunity for an attacker to introduce a malicious release that meets this constraint.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a controlled testing environment that simulates dependency resolution based on `/code/pyproject.toml`, configure the package manager to resolve dependencies from a custom repository.  
  2. Publish a mock Django release that satisfies the version constraint (`>=3.2`) but includes a deliberate malicious payload.  
  3. Install the application dependencies and verify that the malicious Django package is retrieved and its code is executed at runtime.  
  4. Observe any deviations in application behavior (such as unauthorized actions or altered processing logic).  
  5. Reconfigure the dependency requirement to pin the Django version (or use a lock file) and confirm that the malicious package is no longer installed.
