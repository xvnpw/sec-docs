- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Path Injection in Backup File Naming
  **Description:**
  The mechanism to generate backup file names relies on configurable templates (the settings `FILENAME_TEMPLATE` and `MEDIA_FILENAME_TEMPLATE`). These templates are formatted with parameters such as database name, server name, and datetime. Although the project’s check functions (in `dbbackup/checks.py`) issue warnings if the template contains path separators ("/"), they do not enforce the removal of such characters. An attacker who is able to influence configuration—either via a misconfigured admin interface or via manipulation of environment variables—could set a template value similar to:
  ```
  "../malicious-{datetime}.bak"
  ```
  When a backup is created, the generated filename would include directory traversal components, possibly writing the backup file outside the designated storage area. Later, when cleanup routines (which use the same filename) run, they may delete files in unintended directories.

  **Impact:**
  By writing backup files outside the controlled directory, an attacker might overwrite or delete critical system files or sensitive application data. This could lead to data loss, denial of service, or even privilege escalation if key files are altered or removed.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The project implements warning checks in `dbbackup/checks.py` (warnings _W007_ and _W008_) that notify the administrator if the filename templates contain slashes. However, these warnings do not block the use of unsafe templates.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Enforce strict validation of filename templates (reject templates containing “/”, “\”, or relative path components such as "..").
  - Sanitize or canonicalize the generated file paths to ensure they always reside within a designated safe backup directory.
  - Add configuration validation that prevents unsafe backup path definitions at startup.

  **Preconditions:**
  - The backup filename templates are misconfigured or can be influenced by an attacker (for example, via an exposed administrative interface or unprotected environment variables).

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `dbbackup/utils.py`, the function `filename_generate` retrieves the template from settings and uses it without further sanitization.
  - ```python
    def filename_generate(
        short_name,
        timestamp=None,
        servername=None,
        extension=None,
        template=FILENAME_TEMPLATE, # FILENAME_TEMPLATE is taken from settings
        **kwargs
    ):
        if not timestamp:
            timestamp = timezone.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S")
        if not servername:
            servername = socket.gethostname()
        if not extension:
            extension = 'bak'

        filename = template.format( # template is used directly without sanitization
            short_name=short_name,
            timestamp=timestamp,
            servername=servername,
            extension=extension,
            datetime=timestamp, # datetime is also timestamp
            **kwargs
        )
        return filename
    ```
  - Although the helper `_check_filename_template` (called in `dbbackup/checks.py`) flags templates that contain a forward slash, it “only” issues a warning.
  - The resulting filename is later passed directly to file write and delete methods in `dbbackup/storage.py` without additional path validation.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Set the application configuration so that `FILENAME_TEMPLATE` is set to a value such as `"../malicious-{datetime}.bak"`.  This can be done by setting environment variable or through Django admin if it's exposed and attacker can access it.
  2. Run the backup command (e.g. using `python manage.py dbbackup`).
  3. Verify on the file system that a backup file has been created outside the intended backup directory (for example, by checking parent directories for a file whose name starts with “malicious-”).
  4. Optionally, trigger a cleanup command and verify that it deletes files in the unintended location.
  5. Confirm that an attacker could leverage this behavior to overwrite or erase critical files on the server.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Backup File Storage Exposure
  **Description:**
  By default the project uses a Django storage backend for saving backup files. If the settings `DBBACKUP_STORAGE` and `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS` are not explicitly configured to point to a secured, nonpublic location, the fallback is to use the default `django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage`. In many deployments the default storage location may be web‑accessible. An attacker who visits a known URL (or is able to probe for backup files) might be able to download backup files containing sensitive information such as database dumps and media files.

  **Impact:**
  Sensitive data—including potentially confidential user or application information stored in database backups—can be exposed publicly. This leakage can lead to data breaches, legal repercussions, and reputation damage.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The project allows administrators to configure both the storage backend and its options via settings. In tests (see `dbbackup/tests/settings.py`), backups are directed to temporary, nonpublic directories. However, the default behavior in production environments may simply fall back to the standard file system storage with no additional access restrictions.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Enforce that backup files are stored by default in a secure, non‑public directory that is inaccessible from the web.
  - Validate storage configuration during application startup, ensuring that file permissions and access controls are correctly set.
  - Consider adding explicit access checks for backup file endpoints if the storage backend is served somehow over HTTP.

  **Preconditions:**
  - The deployment does not override default storage settings (i.e. `DBBACKUP_STORAGE` and `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS`) to point to a secure location, leaving backups stored in a web‑accessible location.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `dbbackup/settings.py`, the code sets the backup `STORAGE` to the value of `DBBACKUP_STORAGE` or falls back to `django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage`.
  - ```python
    from django.conf import settings as django_settings
    from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage

    STORAGE = getattr(django_settings, 'DBBACKUP_STORAGE', 'dbbackup.storage.FileSystemStorage') # default is FileSystemStorage
    STORAGE_OPTIONS = getattr(django_settings, 'DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS', {})
    ```
  - The `Storage` class in `dbbackup/storage.py` merely instantiates the given storage class and uses it for file operations without adding additional security measures.
  - ```python
    def get_storage(self):
        storage_cls = import_string(settings.STORAGE) # STORAGE from dbbackup.settings
        return storage_cls(**settings.STORAGE_OPTIONS) # STORAGE_OPTIONS from dbbackup.settings
    ```
  - No further restrictions (such as permissions or authentication checks) are applied to the backup file access.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Deploy the application with default settings (i.e. without overriding `DBBACKUP_STORAGE` and `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS`).
  2. Run a backup command (for example, `python manage.py dbbackup`) to create a backup file.
  3. Identify the physical location or the URL where the backup file is stored. For `FileSystemStorage` default location is `MEDIA_ROOT`. If `MEDIA_ROOT` is within webserver document root, then files are accessible.
  4. Using a web browser or HTTP client, attempt to access and download the backup file without any credentials. For example, if `MEDIA_URL` is `/media/` and backup file is stored in `MEDIA_ROOT/backups/`, then attacker can try to access `/media/backups/<backup_filename>`.
  5. Confirm that the backup file is accessible and review its contents for sensitive data.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Subprocess Command Injection in Database Backup Commands
  **Description:**
  The connectors for various databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) build shell command strings by concatenating configuration parameters such as database names, hostnames, port numbers, user names, and table names. Although some parameters (e.g. passwords) are run through escaping routines like `utils.get_escaped_command_arg`, many other fields are inserted directly into command strings using f‑strings. If an attacker can tamper with any of these configuration values—through misconfiguration, tainted environment variables, or insecure admin interfaces—they may inject malicious shell commands into the string. For example, if the database name were set to:
  ```
  dbname; rm -rf /
  ```
  the constructed command might include an extra command that executes destructive actions.

  **Impact:**
  If successful, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the host. The impact ranges from data exfiltration to complete system compromise, resulting in data destruction or full takeover of the server.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The code uses `shlex.split` to break the constructed command string into a list before passing it to `subprocess.Popen`, and helper functions (like `get_escaped_command_arg`) are used for certain parameters (e.g. passwords).
  - However, many other parameters (such as the database name, host, port, and table names extracted from `self.exclude`) are concatenated directly without thorough sanitization.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Rigorously validate and sanitize all configuration parameters that are inserted into shell commands.
  - Avoid the use of unsanitized f‑string concatenation for command construction. Prefer to build the command as a list of arguments or use safer subprocess interfaces that do not require shell parsing.
  - Ensure that the application’s configuration cannot be tampered with by external users (for example, by restricting environment variable access or protecting admin interfaces).

  **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker must be able to influence one or more database configuration parameters (even if indirectly through an insecurely managed admin interface or misconfigured environment).
  - The vulnerable command construction logic (in connectors such as those in `dbbackup/db/mysql.py` and `dbbackup/db/postgresql.py`) is executed as part of a backup or restore operation.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `dbbackup/db/mysql.py`, the `_create_dump` method builds a command string using various settings:
  - ```python
    def _create_dump(self):
        args = [self.dump_cmd] # e.g. ['mysql']
        if self.settings.get('HOST'):
            args += ['-h', self.settings['HOST']] # HOST setting is added without sanitization
        if self.settings.get('PORT'):
            args += ['-P', str(self.settings['PORT'])] # PORT setting is added without sanitization
        if self.settings.get('USER'):
            args += ['-u', self.settings['USER']] # USER setting is added without sanitization
        if self.settings.get('PASSWORD'):
            password = get_escaped_command_arg(self.settings['PASSWORD']) # PASSWORD setting is escaped
            args += ['-p{}'.format(password)]
        args += [self.settings['NAME']] # NAME setting (database name) is added without sanitization
        if self.exclude:
            args += ['--ignore-table={}'.format(self.settings['NAME'] + '.' + table) for table in self.exclude] # table names from exclude are added without sanitization
        if self.include_tables:
            args += self.include_tables

        cmd = args
        process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, env=env, **self.popen_kwargs) # cmd is passed as list to subprocess.Popen
        process.wait()
    ```
    - The database name (`self.settings['NAME']`), HOST, PORT, USER, and table names from `self.exclude` are concatenated directly without thorough sanitization.
    - While the password is escaped using `get_escaped_command_arg`, other parameters are not sanitized.
    - Similar patterns appear in the PostgreSQL and MongoDB connector implementations.
    - Ultimately, the command is passed as a list to `subprocess.Popen` without using a shell, yet unsanitized input in arguments can still lead to unintended command execution depending on how `mysql` or other database tools parse arguments.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a controlled test environment, adjust one configuration parameter—for example, set the database name to a value like:
     ```
     dbname; echo HACKED
     ```
     (ensure this test is done on a disposable system). This can be achieved via environment variables or Django admin if accessible. For example, setting environment variable `DBBACKUP_DATABASE_NAME="dbname; echo HACKED"` might influence database name.
  2. Run the backup command that uses this configuration (e.g., `python manage.py dbbackup`).
  3. Monitor the executed command output or the system logs to detect whether the additional command fragment (e.g. “HACKED”) was executed outside the intended backup command context. Redirecting standard output and standard error of the backup command to files can help in monitoring.
  4. Repeat with other parameters (such as elements in the exclusion list, HOST, PORT, USER) to confirm that unsanitized input can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands. Check if injecting options like `-v` or `--help` still works and if it's possible to inject more dangerous options or commands.
