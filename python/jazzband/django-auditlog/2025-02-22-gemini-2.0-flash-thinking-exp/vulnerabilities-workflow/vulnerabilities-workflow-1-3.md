Okay, I understand the instructions.

Based on your input that "no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified that meet the specified criteria" for django-auditlog based on the provided project files, and considering the filtering criteria you've outlined, the updated vulnerability list remains empty for high and critical vulnerabilities that fit the specified requirements.

Therefore, the updated list, reflecting that no such vulnerabilities were found according to the given constraints, is as follows:

```markdown
## Vulnerability List for django-auditlog

Based on the provided project files and applying the specified filtering criteria, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified that affect a publicly available instance of the application and are not excluded by the given conditions.

It's important to reiterate that this analysis is based on a limited set of project files. A complete security audit would necessitate a more comprehensive review of the entire codebase to ensure no vulnerabilities exist in areas not covered by the initially provided files.

Further investigation with a broader scope of project files is recommended to achieve a definitive vulnerability assessment.
