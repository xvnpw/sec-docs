### Combined Vulnerability List:

#### 1. XML Injection in WNS Notifications

* **Description:**
    * The `dict_to_xml_schema` function in `/code/push_notifications/wns.py` is responsible for converting a Python dictionary into an XML payload for Windows Push Notifications (WNS).
    * This function iterates through the input dictionary and directly uses the dictionary keys and values to construct XML elements and attributes using `xml.etree.ElementTree`.
    * A malicious actor can craft a dictionary with specially crafted keys or values that, when converted to XML, can lead to XML injection.
    * Specifically, by injecting XML markup within the `children` values of the dictionary, an attacker can manipulate the structure of the generated XML payload. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the WNS service or on the receiving device.
    * When sending WNS (Windows Notification Service) notifications, the function `dict_to_xml_schema` converts a user‐provided dictionary into an XML tree by using the dictionary’s keys directly as XML tag names and the “attrs” and “children” values to build sub–elements. There is no sanitization or whitelist of allowed tags. If an attacker controls the “xml_data” parameter (for example, via an API call or admin tool that triggers a WNS message), they can craft input with malicious tag names or attributes to inject arbitrary XML.

* **Impact:**
    * By injecting arbitrary XML, an attacker can potentially disrupt the intended structure of the WNS notification.
    * This could lead to malformed notifications being sent to users, causing the notifications to be displayed incorrectly or not at all on Windows devices.
    * While direct severe impacts like remote code execution are unlikely in this specific context of WNS notifications, manipulating the XML structure can still lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities if the WNS service or the client-side processing of notifications has further XML parsing vulnerabilities.
    * The attacker may be able to manipulate the XML payload in unexpected ways. Downstream, the WNS service (or any intermediary XML processor) may misinterpret the data—leading to:
        * Bypassing validation checks or altering notification content.
        * Triggering errors that reveal internal system details.
    * In worst‐case scenarios, if processed by vulnerable XML parsers, the injected content may be used for further attacks (although Python’s built–in ElementTree is generally safe against external entity injection).
    * The impact is considered high because it allows an attacker to manipulate the intended notification format and potentially disrupt the notification delivery system.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    * None. The code directly translates dictionary structures to XML without any input sanitization or validation to prevent XML injection.
    * The implementation simply uses ElementTree methods without any sanitization. No built–in whitelist or strict schema enforcement is provided.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    * **Input Sanitization:** The `dict_to_xml_schema` function should sanitize the input dictionary values, especially the `children` values, to remove or escape any XML markup before embedding them into the XML structure.
    * **Schema Validation:**  Ideally, the generated XML should be validated against a predefined schema to ensure it conforms to the expected WNS notification format and prevent structural manipulation through injection.
    * **Use of Safe XML Construction Methods:** Consider using methods in `xml.etree.ElementTree` that are less prone to injection, although in this case, the core issue is lack of input sanitization.
    * Input validation and sanitization should be implemented to restrict dictionary keys (and thus XML tag names) to a known safe set.
    * Alternatively, use an XML builder or schema validator that enforces the expected WNS format and rejects unexpected or dangerous tag names.

* **Preconditions:**
    * An attacker needs to be able to control the `xml_data` parameter passed to the `wns_send_message` function, either directly or indirectly through other application functionalities that use this library to send WNS notifications. In a typical Django application using this library, this could happen if the application allows users to customize or provide input that is then used to construct WNS notifications (e.g., through an admin interface, API endpoint, or other user-facing features).
    * The attacker must be able to invoke the WNS notification functionality and supply an “xml_data” payload.
    * The endpoint that uses `wns_send_message` (or its bulk variant) must be accessible for such manipulation.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```python
    File: /code/push_notifications/wns.py

    def dict_to_xml_schema(data):
        """
        ...
        :return: ElementTree.Element
        """
        for key, value in data.items():
            root = _add_element_attrs(ET.Element(key), value.get("attrs", {}))
            children = value.get("children", None)
            if isinstance(children, dict):
                _add_sub_elements_from_dict(root, children) # Recursive call for nested children
            return root


    def _add_sub_elements_from_dict(parent, sub_dict):
        """
        Add SubElements to the parent element.
        ...
        """
        for key, value in sub_dict.items():
            if isinstance(value, list):
                for repeated_element in value:
                    sub_element = ET.SubElement(parent, key)
                    _add_element_attrs(sub_element, repeated_element.get("attrs", {}))
                    children = repeated_element.get("children", None)
                    if isinstance(children, dict):
                        _add_sub_elements_from_dict(sub_element, children) # Recursive call
                    elif isinstance(children, str):
                        sub_element.text = children # POTENTIAL XML INJECTION POINT
            else:
                sub_element = ET.SubElement(parent, key)
                _add_element_attrs(sub_element, value.get("attrs", {}))
                children = repeated_element.get("children", None)
                if isinstance(children, dict):
                    _add_sub_elements_from_dict(sub_element, children) # Recursive call
                elif isinstance(children, str):
                    sub_element.text = children # POTENTIAL XML INJECTION POINT

    ```
    * The code recursively traverses the input dictionary `data`.
    * In the `_add_sub_elements_from_dict` function, when a `children` value is a string (`elif isinstance(children, str):`), it is directly assigned to `sub_element.text`.
    * This direct assignment is the XML injection vulnerability. If the `children` string contains XML markup, it will be interpreted as XML structure instead of plain text.
    * In **/code/push_notifications/wns.py**, the function `dict_to_xml_schema` loops over the input dictionary and for each key calls `ET.Element(key)`. There is no check that the key is a valid or expected tag name.
    * The unsanitized XML is then converted to bytes using `ET.tostring(xml)` and passed along as the notification payload.

* **Security Test Case:**

    1. **Setup:** Assume you have a Django application using `django-push-notifications` library and you can control the `xml_data` parameter in `wns_send_message`. For example, you might have an admin panel or an API endpoint that allows sending custom WNS notifications and takes `xml_data` as input.
    2. **Craft Malicious Payload:** Create a dictionary payload for `xml_data` that includes XML injection in the `children` value. For example, to inject a new XML element `<malicious>`:

        ```python
        malicious_xml_data = {
            "toast": {
                "children": {
                    "visual": {
                        "children": {
                            "binding": {
                                "attrs": {"template": "ToastText01"},
                                "children": {
                                    "text": {
                                        "attrs": {"id": "1"},
                                        "children": "Hello <malicious>Injected XML</malicious> World"
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    3. **Send Malicious Notification:** Use the application's functionality to send a WNS notification using `wns_send_message` and provide `malicious_xml_data` as the `xml_data` parameter. For example, using the admin panel's "Send test message" action if it allows custom XML input, or through a custom view that uses `wns_send_message`.
    4. **Observe the Resulting XML:** Inspect the XML generated by `dict_to_xml_schema` for the above payload. You can do this by modifying the `wns_send_message` function temporarily to print or log the output of `ET.tostring(prepared_data)` before it's sent. The generated XML will contain the injected `<malicious>` element within the `<text>` element:

        ```xml
        <toast>
            <visual>
                <binding template="ToastText01">
                    <text id="1">Hello &lt;malicious&gt;Injected XML&lt;/malicious&gt; World</text>
                </binding>
            </visual>
        </toast>
        ```
        *Note: In this specific example, `xml.etree.ElementTree.tostring` might automatically escape the injected XML tags like `<malicious>` to `&lt;malicious&gt;` for safety.  If this is the case, the injection might not be directly exploitable in terms of altering the XML structure as intended in WNS processing, but it still demonstrates the lack of sanitization and potential for unexpected behavior if the injected content was designed to break XML parsing in a different way or if the WNS service or client-side notification processing is more vulnerable to such injection.*

        *To further test, you could try injecting attributes or different XML structures and examine if they are correctly escaped or if they lead to XML parsing errors or unexpected notification behavior on a real Windows device.*

    5. **Expected Outcome:** The test should demonstrate that the generated XML includes the injected XML markup, confirming the XML injection vulnerability. Even if the immediate impact is not critical in this scenario, the lack of input sanitization is a security concern that should be addressed.

    1. Craft a JSON payload for the WNS notification API that uses the “xml_data” parameter. For example, pass:
        ```json
        {
            "xml_data": {
            "<script>alert('XSS')</script>": {
                "children": "Injected content"
            }
            }
        }
        ```
    2. Submit the payload via the API endpoint (or via an admin tool that triggers `wns_send_message`).
    3. Observe (via logging or by capturing the outgoing HTTP request) that the generated XML payload contains the unsanitized tag name.
    4. Verify that the WNS service responds with an error or unexpected behavior that confirms the payload was not sanitized.


#### 2. Broken Access Control in Push Notification Device API Endpoints

* **Description:**
    * The REST API viewsets for device registrations (for APNS, GCM, WNS, and WebPush) are implemented as plain ModelViewSets (via the DeviceViewSetMixin) without built‐in authentication or per–user filtering.
    * Although separate “Authorized” viewsets exist (by mixing in an AuthorizedMixin that filters the queryset to devices belonging only to the current user), the default endpoints do not enforce any such restrictions.
    * An external attacker who discovers these endpoints on a publicly accessible instance might register new devices, update existing records, or enumerate and delete other users’ device tokens.

* **Impact:**
    * An attacker may modify (or view) device registration records belonging to arbitrary users. This can lead to:
        * Sending unauthorized or malicious notifications.
        * Tampering with push notification settings and privacy breaches.
        * Disruption of the notification functionality for legitimate users.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    * The project does provide “Authorized” viewset variants (for example, APNSDeviceAuthorizedViewSet, GCMDeviceAuthorizedViewSet) that use an AuthorizedMixin to restrict querysets to the current user.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    * The default API endpoints (e.g. APNSDeviceViewSet, GCMDeviceViewSet, etc.) do not enforce any authentication or access control by default.
    * No whitelist or default permission settings are applied to limit access, forcing integrators to manually use the “Authorized” variants.

* **Preconditions:**
    * The push notifications API endpoints are exposed to the public (or accessible without required authentication).
    * An attacker can send HTTP requests (POST, PATCH, GET, DELETE) against the device endpoints.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    * In **/code/push_notifications/api/rest_framework.py** the base viewsets (e.g. APNSDeviceViewSet, GCMDeviceViewSet, etc.) simply set `queryset = …objects.all()` and inherit from ModelViewSet without enforcing authentication.
    * Only by explicitly using the AuthorizedMixin (as in APNSDeviceAuthorizedViewSet, etc.) is the queryset filtered by `user=self.request.user`.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Using an HTTP client (e.g. curl or Postman), send a POST request to the (for example) `/api/apnsdevices/` endpoint with JSON data containing arbitrary device details (e.g. “registration_id”, “application_id”, “name”) without providing any credentials.
    2. Confirm that the new device record is created.
    3. Send a GET request to the same endpoint and verify that the attacker can retrieve the complete list of registered devices—even those belonging to other users.
    4. Attempt a PATCH or DELETE on an existing device record (possibly one registered to another user) and verify that the operation succeeds.


#### 3. SSRF via Malicious WNS Notification URIs

* **Description:**
    * The function `_wns_send` is used to send notifications to WNS devices. It accepts a “uri” parameter that is provided (directly from the WNSDevice’s registration_id field) without strict validation.
    * Although a simple check is made in some parts of the code (for example, testing whether the URI begins with “https://”), an attacker who can register or update a WNS device may supply an arbitrary URI (for example, an internal URL).
    * When a notification is sent using such a record, the server will perform an outbound HTTP request (via `urlopen`) to that URI.

* **Impact:**
    * An attacker may abuse this lack of validation to cause the server to send HTTP requests to internal network addresses or services that are not otherwise accessible from outside, resulting in a Server–Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This could lead to:
        * Scanning or interacting with internal resources (potential pivot point for further attacks).
        * Data leakage from internal services.
        * Abuse of the server as a proxy to attack other networks.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    * A very basic check is made in parts of the WNS logic (for example, in `get_subscription_info` for webpush, a scheme check is performed). However, no strict whitelist or validation is done for WNS URIs.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    * Strict validation of the “uri” parameter in functions such as `_wns_send` should be added. For a WNS notification, the registration_id should be checked against an expected pattern (for example, it must start with “https://” and belong to a trusted domain such as “notify.windows.com”).

* **Preconditions:**
    * The attacker must be able to register (or update) a WNSDevice record with a custom “registration_id” value.
    * The push notification send function is later triggered so that the value in registration_id is used as the target URI for an outbound HTTP request.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    * In **/code/push_notifications/wns.py** the function `_wns_send` builds an HTTP Request by directly passing the “uri” parameter received from upstream. No sanitization or validation is performed on this URI.
    * The higher–level function `wns_send_message` simply passes its “uri” argument (usually the device’s registration_id) to `_wns_send` without further verification.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Register a new WNS device via the (or via the REST API endpoint or admin interface) by supplying a registration_id value such as `http://127.0.0.1:80/internal/admin` instead of a valid WNS URI.
    2. Trigger a WNS notification send (for example, using the provided API or admin action).
    3. On the server side, monitor outbound HTTP requests (or use network logging) to confirm that a request is made to `http://127.0.0.1:80/internal/admin`.
    4. Confirm that the request reaches an internal endpoint—demonstrating that SSRF is possible.


#### 4. XML External Entity Injection (XXE) in WNS XML data processing

* **Description:**
    * The `dict_to_xml_schema` function in `push_notifications/wns.py` uses `xml.etree.ElementTree` to parse and process XML data provided by users. This function is used to prepare XML payloads for Windows Notification Service (WNS) notifications.
    * If a malicious user can control the input to `dict_to_xml_schema`, they could inject external entities into the XML data.
    * When the XML is processed, the parser might attempt to resolve these external entities, potentially leading to information disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or denial of service.
    * Although `ElementTree` is primarily for XML creation, the generated XML is sent to WNS, and if WNS or any intermediary system processes XML with external entity resolution enabled, a vulnerability exists.

* **Impact:**
    * High: Information Disclosure - An attacker could potentially read local files on the server if the server has access to them and the application or WNS processing infrastructure is vulnerable to XXE.
    * Medium: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - An attacker could make the server send requests to internal or external resources, potentially accessing internal services or external websites.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    * None. The code uses `xml.etree.ElementTree` directly without any explicit measures to disable external entity processing.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    * Disable external entity resolution when processing XML data. For `xml.etree.ElementTree`, this can be done by using a custom `XMLParser` with `resolve_entities=False`. Alternatively, using a safer XML processing library like `defusedxml` would prevent XXE vulnerabilities by default.

* **Preconditions:**
    * The application must allow users to influence or provide input to the `xml_data` parameter of the `wns_send_message` function. This could happen if the application provides a feature to customize WNS notifications based on user input, which is then converted into XML using `dict_to_xml_schema`.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```python
    File: /code/push_notifications/wns.py

    def dict_to_xml_schema(data):
        # ...
        for key, value in data.items():
            root = _add_element_attrs(ET.Element(key), value.get("attrs", {}))
            children = value.get("children", None)
            if isinstance(children, dict):
                _add_sub_elements_from_dict(root, children)
            return root
    ```
    * Vulnerability Point: The `dict_to_xml_schema` function utilizes `xml.etree.ElementTree` to construct XML from a Python dictionary. While the provided code does not directly *parse* XML from external sources, it generates XML that is then sent to the Windows Notification Service. If WNS or any intermediary system handling these notifications is vulnerable to XXE (i.e., processes XML with external entity resolution enabled), then this code becomes a point of vulnerability. The lack of explicit measures to disable external entity processing in `xml.etree.ElementTree`, especially when dealing with user-influenced data that is transformed into XML, indicates a potential XXE risk.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Precondition: The application has a feature that allows sending WNS notifications where the user can control the `xml_data` payload.
    2. Steps:
       a. Register a WNS device to obtain a device URI.
       b. Craft a malicious XML payload as a Python dictionary. This payload will define and use an external entity to attempt to read a local file, for example, `/etc/passwd`.
          ```python
          malicious_xml_data = {
              "toast": {
                  "children": {
                      "visual": {
                          "children": {
                              "binding": {
                                  "attrs": {"template": "ToastText01"},
                                  "children": {
                                      "text": [
                                          {
                                              "attrs": {"id": "1"},
                                              "children": "&xxe;"
                                          }
                                      ],
                                      "xml": [
                                          {
                                              "children": '<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>'
                                          }
                                      ]
                                  }
                              }
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
          ```
       c. Using the application's interface, send a WNS notification to the registered device URI. Provide `malicious_xml_data` as the `xml_data` parameter.
       d. Analyze server logs and network traffic for signs of attempted access to `/etc/passwd` or other file system resources. Successful XXE might not always result in direct data exfiltration in the notification response but could be logged or observable through server-side behavior.
       e. If the test is successful, it will indicate that the XML processing might be vulnerable to XXE, potentially allowing an attacker to read server files or perform SSRF if the WNS processing infrastructure is vulnerable.
