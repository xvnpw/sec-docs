## Vulnerability List

### 1. SQL Injection in History Search Functionality
**Description:** An external attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the history search functionality of the application. This occurs when user-provided input, intended for filtering history records, is not properly sanitized and is directly incorporated into SQL queries executed by `django-simple-history`. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can bypass intended query logic, extract sensitive data, modify data, or potentially even gain control over the database server.

**Impact:** Critical. Successful SQL injection can lead to complete compromise of the application's data, including reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive information. In some cases, it can also lead to remote code execution on the database server.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently implemented mitigations:** None identified in the context of a hypothetical vulnerable search feature in `django-simple-history`. Django ORM generally protects against basic SQL injection if used correctly, but complex queries or manual SQL can still be vulnerable.

**Missing mitigations:**
- Input sanitization and validation for all user-provided input used in database queries.
- Use of parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
- Security code review of any custom SQL queries in `django-simple-history`.
- Automated security testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Preconditions:**
- The application must use `django-simple-history` and expose a publicly accessible feature that allows searching or filtering historical data based on user input.
- This feature must be implemented in a way that is vulnerable to SQL injection, likely involving direct concatenation of user input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Source code analysis:**
Imagine a view function in the application that uses `django-simple-history` to search history based on a user-provided `search_term`.  The code might look something like this (insecure example):

```python
from django.db import connection

def history_search_view(request):
    search_term = request.GET.get('search', '')
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = f"SELECT * FROM historical_table WHERE history_change_reason LIKE '%{search_term}%'"  # INSECURE!
    cursor.execute(query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    # ... process and display results ...
```

In this example, the `search_term` from the GET request is directly embedded into the SQL query using an f-string.  If `search_term` contains malicious SQL code, it will be executed by the database.

**Security test case:**
1. Access the publicly available application.
2. Identify the history search feature. This might be a search bar or a URL endpoint that accepts search parameters.
3. In the search input field (or URL parameter), enter a malicious SQL injection payload such as `%' OR '1'='1 --`.
4. Observe the application's response. If you receive database errors, unexpected data results (like all records instead of filtered), or if you can extract database schema information, it indicates a successful SQL injection vulnerability. For example, try to retrieve database version using payload like `%' UNION SELECT version() --`.

### 2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in History Data Display

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into historical data fields. When this historical data is viewed by other users or administrators, the malicious script is executed in their browsers. This can occur if `django-simple-history` or the application displaying historical data does not properly sanitize and escape user-provided data before rendering it in HTML.

**Impact:** High. XSS can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's browser. This can be used to steal session cookies, hijack user accounts, deface websites, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions. If an administrator account is compromised, it can lead to full application compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently implemented mitigations:** Django's template engine provides auto-escaping by default, which mitigates many XSS vulnerabilities. However, if `django-simple-history` or the application uses `mark_safe` or manually constructs HTML without proper escaping, XSS vulnerabilities can arise.

**Missing mitigations:**
- Ensure all historical data displayed to users is properly escaped using Django's template auto-escaping or manual escaping functions like `escape()`.
- Avoid using `mark_safe` on user-provided historical data unless absolutely necessary and after rigorous sanitization.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
- Security code review of template rendering logic related to historical data.
- Automated security testing for XSS vulnerabilities.

**Preconditions:**
- The application must use `django-simple-history` and display historical data to users or administrators.
- Historical data must include fields that can be modified by users (e.g., change reasons, model fields being tracked).
- The application must render this historical data in HTML without proper escaping, allowing JavaScript injection.

**Source code analysis:**
Imagine a Django template that displays historical changes:

```html+django
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Old Value</th><th>New Value</th><th>Change Reason</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  {% for history in historical_data %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ history.field_name }}</td>
      <td>{{ history.old_value }}</td>
      <td>{{ history.new_value }}</td>
      <td>{{ history.history_change_reason|safe }}  {# INSECURE! #}</td>
    </tr>
  {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

In this example, if `history.history_change_reason` contains user-provided data that is not properly sanitized *before* being saved to history, and the template uses `|safe` filter, then any malicious JavaScript injected into `history_change_reason` will be executed when this template is rendered.  The `|safe` filter bypasses Django's auto-escaping and renders the content as raw HTML.

**Security test case:**
1. Access the publicly available application.
2. Identify a feature that displays historical data tracked by `django-simple-history`. This might be an admin interface or a dedicated history view.
3. Find a way to modify data that is tracked by `django-simple-history` and displayed in the history view. For example, if the application tracks changes to blog posts, edit a blog post and set the "change reason" to a malicious XSS payload like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
4. View the historical data in the application, specifically the history entry you just created/modified. If the XSS payload is executed (e.g., an alert box pops up), then the application is vulnerable to stored XSS.
5. For more impactful XSS testing, try payloads that steal cookies or redirect to external sites, for example by using Javascript to send cookie data to attacker controlled server.
