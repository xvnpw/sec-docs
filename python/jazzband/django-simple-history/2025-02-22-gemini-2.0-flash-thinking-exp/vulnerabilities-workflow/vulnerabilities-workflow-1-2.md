Based on the provided instructions, here is the updated list of vulnerabilities, excluding those that do not meet the specified criteria for external attacker and production context:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unprotected CRUD Endpoints in Test/View Modules
  - **Description:**
    - Several test modules (e.g. `/code/simple_history/tests/view.py`) define generic Django class–based views for create, update, and delete operations without any authentication or authorization checks.
    - An external attacker, if the test/demo endpoints are accidentally deployed, can craft HTTP requests directly against these endpoints to perform unintended CRUD operations on the underlying models.
    - **Trigger Steps:**
      1. Locate the publicly accessible endpoints (for example, `/poll/add/`, `/poll/bulk-update/`, or `/poll/<pk>/delete/`).
      2. Craft and submit HTTP requests (POST, GET, etc.) with valid or malicious payloads.
      3. Observe that the endpoints process the requests without verifying the requester’s identity.
  - **Impact:**
    - The attacker can modify, create, or delete data, leading to data integrity loss – which in turn may result in unauthorized data manipulation or even complete control over the application’s persistent state.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No access control is enforced in the view classes; they leverage Django’s generic views without the addition of authentication–mixins or permission checks.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Endpoints must enforce authentication (for example, using Django’s `LoginRequiredMixin` or custom permission checks) so that only authorized users can invoke CRUD operations.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The test/demo endpoints are deployed on a publicly accessible instance and are not shielded by additional network or routing restrictions.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/simple_history/tests/view.py`, the class–based views (e.g. `PollCreate`, `PollUpdate`, etc.) are implemented without any authentication/authorization logic. Their reliance on generic views leaves them fully exposed to any HTTP client.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy (or simulate) the application with the test endpoints enabled.
    2. Using an external HTTP client (e.g. curl or Postman), send an HTTP POST request to `/poll/add/` with valid poll data.
    3. Verify that a new poll record is created without an authentication challenge.
    4. Similarly, attempt to update and delete entries, confirming that these operations succeed unchecked.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Data Leakage via Global HistoricalRecords Context
  - **Description:**
    - The Simple History library uses a global context object (i.e. `HistoricalRecords.context`) to temporarily store the active HTTP request in order to record the acting user.
    - Under normal conditions, middleware (such as `HistoryRequestMiddleware`) sets and then cleans up this context. However, if an exception or an unusual asynchronous execution bypasses this cleanup, residual sensitive data (like user credentials or session details) may remain available in the global context.
    - **Trigger Steps:**
      1. An attacker triggers a request that sets the HTTP request object into `HistoricalRecords.context.request`.
      2. Due to an edge–case (or misconfigured middleware/async execution), the cleanup does not occur.
      3. In a subsequent request – or via an internal debugging endpoint – the attacker accesses the stale context to retrieve sensitive information.
  - **Impact:**
    - Exposure of sensitive request data (such as user identifiers or session tokens) can lead to session hijacking, impersonation, or further leakage of confidential information.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project’s middleware (as verified in `/code/simple_history/tests/tests/test_middleware.py`) is designed to delete the `request` attribute from the global context after each request, even in the event of an exception.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Additional safeguards should be implemented to account for asynchronous or non–standard execution flows – for example, by using thread–local storage rather than a global context.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The Simple History middleware is enabled and a misconfiguration or unusual asynchronous execution flow prevents the cleanup of `HistoricalRecords.context.request`.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The test case `test_request_attr_is_deleted_after_each_response` (in `/code/simple_history/tests/tests/test_middleware.py`) shows that under normal circumstances the request object is cleaned up. However, this solution presently relies solely on middleware execution; any bypass (such as from an unhandled async exception) could leave the sensitive request object accessible afterward.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application with the Simple History middleware in a staging environment.
    2. Simulate a failure in a view (or misconfigure the middleware) so that the cleanup of `HistoricalRecords.context.request` is skipped.
    3. Issue a subsequent request that attempts (via a debugging endpoint or custom hook) to read the value of `HistoricalRecords.context.request`.
    4. Verify that sensitive information from the stale request (such as user identifiers or session tokens) is exposed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Audit Log Forgery via Insecure Historical User ID Field
  - **Description:**
    - In `/code/simple_history/tests/external/models.py`, the model `ExternalModelWithCustomUserIdField` is defined with its history tracking configured using a custom field for the user ID:
      ```python
      history = HistoricalRecords(history_user_id_field=models.IntegerField(null=True))
      ```
    - Because the custom `history_user_id_field` is a plain IntegerField (and not a ForeignKey), there is no enforced referential integrity to validate that the provided user ID corresponds to a real, authorized user.
    - **Trigger Steps:**
      1. An attacker locates an unprotected (test/demo) CRUD endpoint for `ExternalModelWithCustomUserIdField`.
      2. The attacker crafts a request to create or update an instance and manually sets the `_history_user` attribute (or equivalent) to an arbitrary integer (for example, one corresponding to a privileged user).
      3. The historical record is created with the attacker–supplied user ID, thereby falsifying the audit trail.
  - **Impact:**
    - With the ability to forge audit logs, an attacker can conceal malicious actions or erroneously attribute changes to other users. This undermines the integrity and forensic validity of the historical records.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There are no mechanisms in place to validate or constrain the value passed to the custom `history_user_id_field` in this test model.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The implementation should use a proper ForeignKey to the user model for the history user field so that Django’s integrity checks prevent unauthorized user values.
    - Additionally, ensure that any endpoints which allow setting historical attributes are secured by robust authentication and authorization checks.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The test/demo endpoints for `ExternalModelWithCustomUserIdField` are deployed on a publicly accessible instance.
    - The endpoint allows manipulation of model attributes (including the override of historical user information).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/simple_history/tests/external/models.py`, observe the definition:
      ```python
      class ExternalModelWithCustomUserIdField(models.Model):
          name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
          history = HistoricalRecords(history_user_id_field=models.IntegerField(null=True))
      ```
    - Since the history user field is implemented as a plain IntegerField, there is no automatic validation to ensure the value belongs to an existing user. If an attacker can supply an arbitrary number (such as “999”), the resulting historical record will reflect that forged value.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application with the test/demo endpoints enabled (ensuring that the endpoints for `ExternalModelWithCustomUserIdField` are reachable).
    2. Using an external HTTP client, submit an HTTP POST request to the endpoint that creates a new instance of `ExternalModelWithCustomUserIdField` with the following payload:
       - `name`: `"malicious entry"`
       - An additional parameter (via the model’s instance override mechanism) for `_history_user` set to an arbitrary value (e.g. `999`).
    3. Submit the unauthenticated request and confirm that the record is created.
    4. Retrieve the historical record for the created instance and verify that the stored `history_user` (or corresponding field) is set to the attacker–provided value (e.g. `999`).
    5. This confirms that the audit trail can be forged.
