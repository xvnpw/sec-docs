Okay, I will review the provided information.

The user has stated that based on their analysis of `django-constance`, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified that meet the specified criteria. The criteria are designed to filter out vulnerabilities that are not directly within the scope of `django-constance` project itself as a library and focus on externally exploitable high/critical issues in a publicly deployed application.

Given this assessment and the provided constraints, the correct output is indeed an empty vulnerability list with a justification that aligns with the instructions.

Here is the markdown output confirming the empty list and explaining why, based on the provided instructions:

## Vulnerability List for django-constance Project

Based on the analysis following the provided instructions and constraints, no high or critical vulnerabilities introduced by the `django-constance` project were identified that are applicable to an external attacker against a publicly available instance.

The analysis specifically excluded:

- Vulnerabilities caused by developers' insecure usage of `django-constance` in their own projects, rather than vulnerabilities within the `django-constance` library itself.
- Vulnerabilities related to missing documentation for mitigation.
- Denial of service vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, the analysis focused on:

- Valid and not already mitigated vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerabilities ranked as high or critical.
- Vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker on a publicly accessible application.

Considering these constraints and focusing on vulnerabilities inherent to the `django-constance` library itself that are of high or critical severity and externally exploitable in a public deployment (and not related to insecure usage, documentation gaps, or DoS), no such vulnerabilities were found in this assessment.

Therefore, the vulnerability list remains empty as no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria were identified within the `django-constance` project.
