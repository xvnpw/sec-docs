## Vulnerability List for django-model-utils

### No High or Critical Vulnerabilities Found (according to specified criteria)

**Vulnerability Name:** No High or Critical Vulnerabilities Found (according to specified criteria)

**Description:** Based on the analysis of `django-model-utils`, specifically considering the perspective of an external attacker targeting a publicly available instance and filtering for high or critical vulnerabilities that are not due to insecure usage, missing documentation, or Denial of Service, no such vulnerabilities were identified. This assessment focused on vulnerabilities within the library itself, excluding issues arising from insecure implementation in user projects or general web application security best practices that are not directly related to the library's code.

**Impact:** N/A (No vulnerability found)

**Vulnerability Rank:** N/A (No vulnerability found)

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** N/A (No vulnerability found) - Implicitly, the library design and code do not introduce high or critical vulnerabilities under the specified conditions. The library relies on Django's built-in security features and safe coding practices.

**Missing Mitigations:** N/A (No vulnerability found) - No mitigations are needed within the library itself for non-existent vulnerabilities under the defined criteria.  Security best practices for Django applications in general should still be followed when using this library.

**Preconditions:** N/A (No vulnerability found) - No preconditions for a non-existent vulnerability. Standard deployment and usage of a Django application using `django-model-utils` are assumed.

**Source Code Analysis:**
Analysis of the provided code, including `managers.py` and `tracker.py`, and methods like `JoinQueryset.join` and `InheritanceQuerySet.instance_of` which utilize raw SQL, did not reveal any high or critical vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance, when considering only vulnerabilities that are not caused by insecure usage, missing documentation, or Denial of Service.

Specifically:
1. **`managers.py` and `tracker.py` review:** Code was examined for common vulnerability patterns like SQL injection, insecure deserialization, or remote code execution. No direct evidence of such vulnerabilities was found that could be triggered by an external attacker interacting with a publicly available application.
2. **`JoinQueryset.join` and `InheritanceQuerySet.instance_of`:** While these methods use raw SQL, the components used in the SQL query construction (table names, column names, field names) are derived from Django's model metadata and are not directly user-controlled inputs. This significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection. The library code carefully constructs these queries using internal Django APIs and does not directly incorporate user-provided data into the raw SQL in a way that would be vulnerable to injection in a standard usage scenario.

**Security Test Case:**
Attempting to devise security test cases for common web application vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Cross-Site Request Forgery, etc.) against a publicly available instance using `django-model-utils` library features in a standard way did not reveal any high or critical vulnerabilities originating from the library itself, under the specified criteria.

For example, attempts to:
1. **Inject malicious SQL through model fields or query parameters** when using features provided by `django-model-utils` (like `JoinQuerySet`, `InheritanceQuerySet`, or `FieldTracker`) were unsuccessful because the library relies on Django's ORM and safe query construction practices.
2. **Exploit any exposed user-facing interfaces** directly provided by `django-model-utils` to trigger vulnerabilities also failed, as the library primarily provides backend utility functions and does not directly expose public interfaces that could be targeted by external attackers in a typical web application deployment.

Standard usage of the library within a Django project, following Django's security best practices, does not introduce high or critical vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers from `django-model-utils` itself, when considering only vulnerabilities that are not caused by insecure usage, missing documentation, or Denial of Service attacks.
