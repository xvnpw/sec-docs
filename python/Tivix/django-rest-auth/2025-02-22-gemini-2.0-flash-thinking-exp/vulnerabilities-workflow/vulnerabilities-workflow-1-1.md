### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Password Reset Functionality without Rate Limiting
- Description: The password reset functionality in `django-rest-auth` does not implement rate limiting. This allows an attacker to repeatedly request password reset emails for a given email address. By sending numerous password reset requests in a short period, an attacker can flood a user's inbox with password reset emails, causing user annoyance and potentially making legitimate password reset requests harder to find.
- Impact:
    - User annoyance due to inbox flooding with password reset emails.
    - Reduced usability of the password reset functionality as legitimate emails might be buried under a flood of malicious requests.
    - Potential for targeted harassment by repeatedly triggering password resets for a specific user.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The code does not implement any rate limiting on password reset requests.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement rate limiting on the password reset endpoint to restrict the number of password reset requests from a single IP address or for a single email address within a specific time frame.
- Preconditions:
    - The application must have the password reset functionality enabled and exposed to external users.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/rest_auth/views.py`
    - Class: `PasswordResetView`
    - The `PasswordResetView` handles POST requests to initiate the password reset process.
    - It uses `PasswordResetSerializer` to validate the email.
    - It calls `serializer.save()` which internally uses Django's `PasswordResetForm` to send the password reset email.
    - There is no explicit rate limiting mechanism implemented in `PasswordResetView` or within the `PasswordResetSerializer` or Django's `PasswordResetForm` as used here.
    ```python
    class PasswordResetView(GenericAPIView):
        """
        Calls Django Auth PasswordResetForm save method.

        Accepts the following POST parameters: email
        Returns the success/fail message.
        """
        serializer_class = PasswordResetSerializer
        permission_classes = (AllowAny,)

        def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
            # Create a serializer with request.data
            serializer = self.get_serializer(data=request.data)
            serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)

            serializer.save()
            # Return the success message with OK HTTP status
            return Response(
                {"detail": _("Password reset e-mail has been sent.")},
                status=status.HTTP_200_OK
            )
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    - Step 1: Identify the password reset endpoint. In the provided `demo/demo/urls.py`, it is `/rest-auth/password/reset/`.
    - Step 2: Open a script or tool capable of sending HTTP POST requests (like `curl`, `Postman`, or a simple Python script).
    - Step 3: Prepare a list of target email addresses for testing.
    - Step 4: Write a loop in the script to repeatedly send POST requests to the password reset endpoint with one of the target email addresses in the request body (`{'email': 'target@example.com'}`).
    - Step 5: Execute the script to send a large number of password reset requests (e.g., 100 requests) in a short period (e.g., within a minute) for the same email address.
    - Step 6: Check the inbox of the target email address.
    - Step 7: Verify that multiple password reset emails (ideally close to the number of requests sent) have been received in the inbox within a short timeframe.
    - Step 8: If multiple password reset emails are received, it confirms that the password reset functionality is vulnerable to rate limiting issues.
