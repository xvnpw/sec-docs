### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Default Admin Credentials
- Description: The project README.md file explicitly documents default credentials for the Django admin panel: username "admin" and password "admin". If these credentials are not changed upon deployment, an attacker can use them to gain administrative access to the application. This allows the attacker to bypass authentication and perform actions intended only for administrators.
    - Step 1: Attacker accesses the publicly available instance of the application.
    - Step 2: Attacker navigates to the Django admin login page, typically `/admin/`.
    - Step 3: Attacker enters "admin" as the username and "admin" as the password, as documented in the project's README.md.
    - Step 4: If the administrator has not changed the default credentials, the attacker successfully logs in to the Django admin panel.
- Impact: Full administrative access to the Django application. An attacker could:
    - Modify or delete wiki content.
    - Manage users and permissions, potentially granting themselves more privileges.
    - Potentially gain further access to the server and underlying infrastructure, depending on server configuration and Django admin capabilities, which could lead to complete compromise of the server.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The project documentation in `README.md` explicitly provides the default credentials.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Remove the default admin credentials from the README.md file to prevent easy discovery.
    - Implement a post-installation script or Django system check that warns administrators about the use of default credentials and strongly encourages them to change them immediately upon deployment.
    - Include a security checklist in the documentation that explicitly highlights the critical importance of changing default credentials as a mandatory post-deployment step.
- Preconditions:
    - The application is deployed in a publicly accessible environment.
    - The administrator has not changed the default Django admin credentials after deployment.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/testproject/README.md`
    - Content:
        ```markdown
        Login
        -----

        Django admin:

        Username: admin
        Password: admin
        ```
    - The README.md file, intended for public access, directly exposes highly sensitive default administrative credentials. An external attacker can simply read this file (if publicly accessible via repository or deployment documentation) or be aware of common Django default credentials and attempt to use them.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Deploy the django-wiki project to a publicly accessible server using the provided `manage.py runserver` or a similar deployment method, without making any changes to the default admin user.
    - Step 2: As an external attacker, access the Django admin login page of the deployed instance by navigating to `https://<deployed-instance-url>/admin/` in a web browser.
    - Step 3: In the login form, enter "admin" as the username and "admin" as the password.
    - Step 4: Click the login button.
    - Step 5: If login is successful, the attacker will be redirected to the Django admin dashboard, confirming successful exploitation of default credentials and gaining administrative access. The attacker can further verify administrative privileges by attempting to access administrative functionalities within the Django admin panel.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential XSS in PyMdown HTML Block Attribute Injection
- Description: The PyMdown plugin, if enabled, allows embedding raw HTML blocks within wiki articles using the `/// html | div[attributes]` syntax. While the HTML content within these blocks is likely sanitized, the attributes specified in the `[attributes]` section might not be sufficiently sanitized. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML attributes, such as event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`), leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user views the wiki page.
    - Step 1: An attacker with write access to a wiki article crafts a malicious payload using the PyMdown `html` block syntax.
    - Step 2: The attacker injects this payload into a wiki article. The payload includes a raw HTML block where attributes are set to execute JavaScript code, for example: `/// html | div[onload='alert("XSS")']`.
    - Step 3: The attacker saves the modified wiki article.
    - Step 4: When a user (including the attacker or other users) views the wiki article, the PyMdown plugin processes the markdown content and renders the HTML block.
    - Step 5: If the attribute `onload` (and other similar event handler attributes) are not properly sanitized, the browser executes the JavaScript code within the `onload` attribute when rendering the HTML `div` element, resulting in XSS.
- Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
    - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the affected wiki page.
    - Steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, which can lead to account hijacking.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying wiki content, creating new administrative accounts, or performing other privileged actions if the victim user has sufficient permissions.
    - Deface the wiki page, redirect users to malicious websites, or conduct further attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: The project includes tests using the `bleach` library, specifically `test_pymdown_in_wiki_renders_block_html_wrap_test_bleach`, which suggests an attempt to sanitize certain attributes like `style`. However, it is unclear whether all potentially dangerous attributes, especially event handlers, are consistently and effectively sanitized across all scenarios involving `html_wrap` blocks in the PyMdown plugin. The current tests primarily focus on style attributes and do not comprehensively cover event handler sanitization.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust and comprehensive sanitization of all HTML attributes provided within the `html_wrap` block of the PyMdown plugin. This sanitization should be performed using a well-vetted HTML sanitization library (like Bleach or similar) and must explicitly target and remove or escape potentially malicious attributes, especially all JavaScript event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`, `onfocus`, etc.) and attributes that could be abused for script execution (e.g., `href`, `src` in certain contexts).
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. While not a direct mitigation for the vulnerability itself, CSP can significantly reduce the impact of XSS by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, and by preventing inline JavaScript execution, adding a layer of defense in depth.
- Preconditions:
    - The PyMdown plugin is enabled in the Django-wiki instance. This plugin might not be enabled by default and may require explicit activation in the application settings.
    - An attacker has write access to wiki articles. This typically means the wiki is configured to allow user registrations and editing by registered users, or if there are vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized write access.
    - A user views a wiki page containing the malicious `html_wrap` block. The victim user can be any user accessing the wiki page, including administrators or other users with sensitive permissions.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/tests/plugins/pymdown/test_pymdown.py`
    - Content:
        ```python
        def test_pymdown_renders_block_html_wrap(self):
            text = (
                "/// html | div[stype='border: 1px solid red;']\n"
                "some *markdown* content\n"
                "///\n"
            )
            expected_output = (
                '<div stype="border: 1px solid red;">\n'
                "<p>some <em>markdown</em> content</p>\n"
                "</div>"
            )
            self.assertEqual(expected_output, md.convert(text))

        def test_pymdown_in_wiki_renders_block_html_wrap_test_bleach(self):
            text = (
                "/// html | div[stype='border: 1px solid red;']\n"
                "some *markdown* content\n"
                "///\n"
            )
            expected_output = (
                "<div>\n<p>some <em>markdown</em> content</p>\n</div>"
            )
            self.assertEqual(expected_output, md.convert(text))
        ```
    - The tests indicate that attributes within the `[]` in the `html_wrap` block are parsed and rendered as HTML attributes. The presence of `test_bleach` suggests awareness of sanitization needs, and that `bleach` is used to sanitize at least the `style` attribute. However, the tests are limited and do not explicitly verify the sanitization of event handler attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, etc., which are primary vectors for XSS through attribute injection. A deeper code review of the `wiki_plugin.PymdownPlugin`'s implementation of `html_wrap` processing is needed to confirm the extent and effectiveness of attribute sanitization, especially concerning event handlers.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Ensure the PyMdown plugin is enabled in the Django-wiki instance. This might involve modifying `settings.py` to include `wiki.plugins.pymdown` in `INSTALLED_APPS` and potentially in `WIKI_PLUGINS`.
    - Step 2: As an external attacker, create a new wiki article or edit an existing one if you have write access.
    - Step 3: Insert the following markdown content into the article body:
        ```markdown
        /// html | div[onload='alert("XSS Vulnerability Test");']
        This is a test HTML block with an injected onload attribute to test for XSS.
        ///
        ```
    - Step 4: Save the wiki article.
    - Step 5: As an external attacker (or any user), view the saved wiki article in a web browser by navigating to its URL.
    - Step 6: Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability Test" appears when the page loads. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the JavaScript code from the injected `onload` attribute was executed, demonstrating a successful XSS vulnerability.
    - Step 7: Further test with other event handler attributes like `onerror='alert("XSS Error")'`, `onclick='alert("XSS Click")'`, and potentially attributes like `href='javascript:alert("XSS Href")'` within the `html_wrap` block to comprehensively assess the scope of the XSS vulnerability and the effectiveness of attribute sanitization (or lack thereof).

- Vulnerability Name: Local File Read in `send_file` utility function
- Description: The `send_file` utility function in `/code/src/wiki/core/http.py` is used to serve files, such as attachments. It directly uses the provided `filepath` argument to open and read the file content without sufficient validation to ensure the file path is within the intended directory for serving files. If an attacker can control or influence the `filepath` argument in any view that utilizes `send_file`, they could potentially read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
    - Step 1: An attacker identifies an application view that uses the `send_file` function and where the `filepath` argument can be manipulated. For example, this might be a view intended to download attachments, where the `filepath` is derived from user-provided parameters like `attachment_id`.
    - Step 2: The attacker crafts a malicious request to this view, attempting to manipulate the parameters in such a way that the `filepath` argument passed to `send_file` points to a sensitive file outside the intended directory, such as `/etc/passwd` or application configuration files. This is typically achieved using path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`).
    - Step 3: The attacker sends the crafted request to the publicly accessible application instance.
    - Step 4: The application processes the request, and if the `send_file` function does not properly validate the `filepath`, it will attempt to open and read the file specified by the attacker-controlled path.
    - Step 5: The server responds with the content of the requested file (if readable by the application process). If the response contains the content of the sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), the Local File Read vulnerability is confirmed.
- Impact: An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem. This includes:
    - Application source code, potentially revealing application logic, vulnerabilities, and sensitive API keys or internal paths.
    - Configuration files, which may contain database credentials, secret keys, and other sensitive configuration parameters.
    - System files, such as `/etc/passwd` or other system configuration files, potentially leading to further system compromise.
    - Any other files accessible to the application's user account on the server, potentially including user data or other sensitive information.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The `send_file` function in `/code/src/wiki/core/http.py` directly uses the provided `filepath` without any explicit validation or sanitization before opening and reading the file. The code does not restrict the file path to a specific allowed directory.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust validation of the `filepath` argument within the `send_file` function. This validation must ensure that the resolved file path is strictly within the intended file storage directory for attachments and images, or any other directory from which files are intended to be served.
    - Avoid directly using user-controlled input to construct the `filepath`. Instead, use an indirect approach, such as mapping user-provided identifiers (e.g., `attachment_id`) to internal, safe file paths.
    - If feasible, implement chroot or similar mechanisms to restrict the application's file system access to only the necessary directories, limiting the scope of potential file read vulnerabilities.
    - Consider using a dedicated file serving mechanism or library that provides built-in path validation and security features.
- Preconditions:
    - There must be at least one view in the application that utilizes the `send_file` function to serve files (e.g., for attachment downloads, image display).
    - This view must accept user-controlled input that, directly or indirectly, influences the `filepath` argument passed to `send_file`. This input could be parameters in the URL (e.g., query parameters or path segments), or potentially data from POST requests if processed to construct the `filepath`.
    - `settings.USE_SENDFILE` is set to `False` in the application's settings, or the `django_sendfile_response` function itself is vulnerable (requires separate analysis of the `sendfile` library if used). If `USE_SENDFILE` is `True`, the vulnerability depends on the security of the underlying `sendfile` library and web server configuration.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/wiki/core/http.py`
    - Function: `send_file(request, filepath, last_modified=None, filename=None)`
    - Code Path:
        ```python
        def send_file(request, filepath, last_modified=None, filename=None):
            fullpath = filepath  # filepath is directly assigned to fullpath without validation
            ...
            if settings.USE_SENDFILE:
                response = django_sendfile_response(request, filepath) # Potentially delegates to sendfile library if enabled
            else:
                response = HttpResponse(
                    open(fullpath, "rb").read(), content_type=mimetype # fullpath is used to open file without validation
                )
            ...
            return response
        ```
    - The code directly assigns the `filepath` argument to `fullpath` and then uses `fullpath` in `open(fullpath, "rb").read()` when `settings.USE_SENDFILE` is `False`. No validation or sanitization is performed on `filepath` before using it to open the file. This means if an attacker can control the `filepath` argument in a calling view, they can control the file path opened by `send_file`.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Identify a view in the application that uses the `send_file` function and accepts some form of user input to determine the file being served. A likely candidate is an attachment download view, which might use an `attachment_id` parameter. For example, assume there is a view at `/attachments/download/<attachment_id>`.
    - Step 2: As an external attacker, craft a malicious URL to this view to attempt to access a sensitive file using path traversal. For instance, if the `attachment_id` is used to construct the `filepath`, try a URL like `/attachments/download/../../../../etc/passwd`. You might need to adjust the number of `../` sequences depending on the expected base path and the location of the target file. If the `attachment_id` is expected to be an integer, you might need to find a way to bypass this check or find other parameters that influence the `filepath`.
    - Step 3: Send the crafted request to the application (e.g., using `curl` or a web browser).
    - Step 4: Examine the HTTP response from the server.
    - Step 5: If the response body contains the content of `/etc/passwd` (or another sensitive file you attempted to access), it confirms the Local File Read vulnerability. For example, you would see the typical structure of the `/etc/passwd` file in the response. If you receive an error or a file not found message, you might need to adjust the path traversal sequence or investigate other views that use `send_file`.
