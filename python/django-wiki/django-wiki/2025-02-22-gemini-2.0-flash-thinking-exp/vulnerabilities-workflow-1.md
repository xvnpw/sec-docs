## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability Name: Default Admin Credentials

- Description: The project README.md file explicitly documents default credentials for the Django admin panel: username "admin" and password "admin". If these credentials are not changed upon deployment, an attacker can use them to gain administrative access to the application. This allows the attacker to bypass authentication and perform actions intended only for administrators.
    - Step 1: Attacker accesses the publicly available instance of the application.
    - Step 2: Attacker navigates to the Django admin login page, typically `/admin/`.
    - Step 3: Attacker enters "admin" as the username and "admin" as the password, as documented in the project's README.md.
    - Step 4: If the administrator has not changed the default credentials, the attacker successfully logs in to the Django admin panel.
- Impact: Full administrative access to the Django application. An attacker could:
    - Modify or delete wiki content.
    - Manage users and permissions, potentially granting themselves more privileges.
    - Potentially gain further access to the server and underlying infrastructure, depending on server configuration and Django admin capabilities, which could lead to complete compromise of the server.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The project documentation in `README.md` explicitly provides the default credentials.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Remove the default admin credentials from the README.md file to prevent easy discovery.
    - Implement a post-installation script or Django system check that warns administrators about the use of default credentials and strongly encourages them to change them immediately upon deployment.
    - Include a security checklist in the documentation that explicitly highlights the critical importance of changing default credentials as a mandatory post-deployment step.
- Preconditions:
    - The application is deployed in a publicly accessible environment.
    - The administrator has not changed the default Django admin credentials after deployment.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/testproject/README.md`
    - Content:
        ```markdown
        Login
        -----

        Django admin:

        Username: admin
        Password: admin
        ```
    - The README.md file, intended for public access, directly exposes highly sensitive default administrative credentials. An external attacker can simply read this file (if publicly accessible via repository or deployment documentation) or be aware of common Django default credentials and attempt to use them.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Deploy the django-wiki project to a publicly accessible server using the provided `manage.py runserver` or a similar deployment method, without making any changes to the default admin user.
    - Step 2: As an external attacker, access the Django admin login page of the deployed instance by navigating to `https://<deployed-instance-url>/admin/` in a web browser.
    - Step 3: In the login form, enter "admin" as the username and "admin" as the password.
    - Step 4: Click the login button.
    - Step 5: If login is successful, the attacker will be redirected to the Django admin dashboard, confirming successful exploitation of default credentials and gaining administrative access. The attacker can further verify administrative privileges by attempting to access administrative functionalities within the Django admin panel.

### Vulnerability Name: HTML Injection Vulnerability in PyMdown HTML Blocks

- Description: The PyMdown plugin allows embedding raw HTML blocks within Markdown content using the `/// html` syntax. While HTML sanitization is intended using `bleach`, it is bypassed, leading to HTML injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can craft a malicious Markdown article containing an `html` block with arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the article. This vulnerability can be exploited through injecting malicious HTML content directly within the HTML block or by injecting malicious attributes into HTML tags within the block.
    - Step 1: An attacker with write access to a wiki article crafts a malicious payload using the PyMdown `html` block syntax. This can be either by injecting malicious HTML content or by injecting malicious HTML attributes.
    - Step 2: The attacker injects this payload into a wiki article. Examples of payloads:
        - Content Injection:
            ```markdown
            /// html | div
            <img src=x onerror=alert("XSS Content Injection")>
            ///
            ```
        - Attribute Injection:
            ```markdown
            /// html | div[onload='alert("XSS Attribute Injection")']
            Some content
            ///
            ```
    - Step 3: The attacker saves the modified wiki article.
    - Step 4: When a user (including the attacker or other users) views the wiki article, the PyMdown plugin processes the markdown content and renders the HTML block.
    - Step 5: If the HTML content or attributes are not properly sanitized, the browser executes the injected JavaScript code, resulting in XSS.
- Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
    - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the affected wiki page.
    - Steal sensitive information, such as session cookies, which can lead to account hijacking.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying wiki content, creating new administrative accounts, or performing other privileged actions if the victim user has sufficient permissions.
    - Deface the wiki page, redirect users to malicious websites, or conduct further attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: The project intends to sanitize HTML using `bleach` as indicated in `/code/src/wiki/core/markdown/__init__.py`.  Tests using `bleach` in `/code/tests/plugins/pymdown/test_pymdown.py` suggest an attempt to sanitize certain attributes like `style`. However, the current configuration and tests are insufficient to prevent HTML injection and XSS.  The current tests primarily focus on style attributes and do not comprehensively cover event handler sanitization or broader HTML injection vectors.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust and comprehensive sanitization of all HTML content and attributes provided within the `html_wrap` block of the PyMdown plugin. This sanitization should be performed using a well-vetted HTML sanitization library (like Bleach or similar) and must explicitly target and remove or escape potentially malicious attributes, especially all JavaScript event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`, `onfocus`, etc.) and attributes that could be abused for script execution (e.g., `href`, `src` in certain contexts). Ensure strict configuration of `bleach` with a whitelist of allowed tags and attributes.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further mitigate the impact of XSS by controlling resource loading and preventing inline JavaScript execution.
- Preconditions:
    - The PyMdown plugin is enabled in the Django-wiki instance.
    - An attacker has write access to wiki articles.
    - A user views a wiki page containing the malicious `html_wrap` block.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/wiki/core/markdown/__init__.py`
        - The `ArticleMarkdown.convert` function uses `bleach.clean` for HTML sanitization if `settings.MARKDOWN_SANITIZE_HTML` is True. However, the effectiveness depends on the configuration of allowed tags and attributes, which might be too permissive or incomplete.
    - File: `/code/src/wiki/plugins/pymdown/wiki_plugin.py`
        - Registers the PyMdown plugin, enabling the `/// html` block syntax through `pymdownx.blocks.html`.
    - File: `/code/tests/plugins/pymdown/test_pymdown.py`
        - Contains tests like `test_pymdown_in_wiki_renders_block_html_wrap_test_bleach` which show an attempt to use `bleach` for sanitization, but these tests are limited and do not cover comprehensive XSS vectors, especially event handlers and broader HTML injection.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Ensure the PyMdown plugin is enabled in the Django-wiki instance.
    - Step 2: As an external attacker, create a new wiki article or edit an existing one if you have write access.
    - Step 3: Insert the following markdown content into the article body:
        ```markdown
        /// html | div
        <img src=x onerror=alert("XSS Vulnerability Test - HTML Content Injection");>
        ///
        ```
    - Step 4: Save the wiki article.
    - Step 5: As an external attacker (or any user), view the saved wiki article in a web browser by navigating to its URL.
    - Step 6: Observe if an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability Test - HTML Content Injection" appears when the page loads. If the alert box appears, it confirms that the JavaScript code from the injected `onerror` attribute within the `<img>` tag was executed, demonstrating a successful HTML Injection and XSS vulnerability.
    - Step 7: Further test with attribute injection using markdown like `/// html | div[onload='alert("XSS Vulnerability Test - Attribute Injection")'] Test Content ///` to comprehensively assess the scope of the XSS vulnerability.


### Vulnerability Name: Local File Read in `send_file` utility function

- Description: The `send_file` utility function in `/code/src/wiki/core/http.py` is used to serve files, such as attachments. It directly uses the provided `filepath` argument to open and read the file content without sufficient validation to ensure the file path is within the intended directory for serving files. If an attacker can control or influence the `filepath` argument in any view that utilizes `send_file`, they could potentially read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
    - Step 1: Attacker identifies an application view that uses the `send_file` function and where the `filepath` argument can be manipulated.
    - Step 2: The attacker crafts a malicious request to this view, attempting to manipulate the parameters in such a way that the `filepath` argument passed to `send_file` points to a sensitive file outside the intended directory, such as `/etc/passwd` or application configuration files, using path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`).
    - Step 3: The attacker sends the crafted request to the publicly accessible application instance.
    - Step 4: The application processes the request, and if the `send_file` function does not properly validate the `filepath`, it will attempt to open and read the file specified by the attacker-controlled path.
    - Step 5: The server responds with the content of the requested file (if readable by the application process).
- Impact: An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem. This includes:
    - Application source code.
    - Configuration files containing sensitive credentials.
    - System files like `/etc/passwd`.
    - User data or other sensitive information accessible to the application's user account.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. The `send_file` function in `/code/src/wiki/core/http.py` directly uses the provided `filepath` without any validation.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust validation of the `filepath` argument within the `send_file` function to ensure it stays within the intended file storage directory.
    - Avoid directly using user-controlled input to construct the `filepath`. Use indirect mapping from user identifiers to safe file paths.
    - Implement chroot or similar mechanisms to restrict application's filesystem access.
    - Use a dedicated file serving mechanism with built-in path validation.
- Preconditions:
    - A view in the application utilizes `send_file` to serve files.
    - This view accepts user-controlled input influencing the `filepath` argument.
    - `settings.USE_SENDFILE` is set to `False`.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/wiki/core/http.py`
    - Function: `send_file(request, filepath, last_modified=None, filename=None)`
    - The `filepath` argument is directly used in `open(fullpath, "rb").read()` without validation when `settings.USE_SENDFILE` is `False`.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Identify a view using `send_file` and accepting user input for file paths (e.g., attachment download).
    - Step 2: Craft a malicious URL to access a sensitive file using path traversal (e.g., `/attachments/download/../../../../etc/passwd`).
    - Step 3: Send the crafted request to the application.
    - Step 4: Examine the HTTP response. If it contains the content of `/etc/passwd`, the vulnerability is confirmed.

### Vulnerability Name: Directory Traversal via Malicious Filename in Image Upload

- Description: In the images plugin, the `upload_path` function in `/code/src/wiki/plugins/images/models.py` determines the file upload path by concatenating the upload directory with the user-provided filename without sanitization. An attacker can supply a filename with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `"../../evil.jpg"`), causing the saved file to be placed outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting files or allowing arbitrary file placement.
    - Step 1: An attacker crafts an image file with a filename containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `"../../evil.jpg"`).
    - Step 2: The attacker uploads this file using the publicly accessible image upload interface of the images plugin.
    - Step 3: The `upload_path` function processes the filename by appending it to the configured upload path without sanitization.
    - Step 4: The file is saved to a location potentially outside the intended upload directory due to the directory traversal sequences in the filename.
- Impact: An attacker can overwrite important files or place files in unintended locations, potentially leading to file integrity compromise or even remote code execution if files are placed in web-accessible directories.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: The image file handling uses Django's built-in mechanisms and `settings.IMAGE_PATH` for storage. However, the filename is not sanitized before path concatenation.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Sanitize user-supplied filenames to remove directory traversal characters (e.g., using `os.path.basename()` or `get_valid_filename()`).
    - Enforce a whitelist for acceptable filename characters and patterns.
    - Normalize and verify the final file path to ensure it resides within the intended upload directory before writing the file.
- Preconditions:
    - The image upload endpoint of the images plugin is publicly accessible.
    - The deployment uses `settings.IMAGE_PATH` for file storage.
    - The filesystem permits relative path injections.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/wiki/plugins/images/models.py`
    - Function: `upload_path(instance, filename)`
    - The function directly uses `os.path.join(upload_path, filename)` without sanitizing `filename`, allowing directory traversal through a malicious filename.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Deploy the application with the images plugin active.
    - Step 2: Access the public image upload interface.
    - Step 3: Prepare a valid image file and rename it to `"../../evil.jpg"`.
    - Step 4: Upload the file.
    - Step 5: Check the file storage directory to see if "evil.jpg" is stored outside the intended folder, confirming directory traversal.
    - Step 6: Optionally, attempt to overwrite critical files to further confirm the vulnerability's impact.
