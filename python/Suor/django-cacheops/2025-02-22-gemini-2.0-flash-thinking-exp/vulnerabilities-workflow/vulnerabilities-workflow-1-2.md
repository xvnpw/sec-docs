- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deserialization via Pickle Serializer  
  **Description:**  
  The project uses Python’s built‑in pickle module as the default serializer (configured in the cacheops settings and used in functions such as settings.CACHEOPS_SERIALIZER.loads in multiple modules). If an attacker somehow can inject arbitrary data into the cache (for example, by exploiting a misconfigured or externally accessible Redis instance), the application will deserialize that data without validation. An attacker could craft a malicious pickle payload so that when it is loaded, arbitrary code is executed in the application’s process.  
  **Impact:**  
  An attacker who successfully injects a malicious payload may achieve remote code execution, compromise the entire host, steal sensitive data, or tamper with application behavior.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • Redis connection calls are wrapped by a generic “handle_connection_failure” decorator that catches connection problems, but no serialization‐level sanitization is in place.  
  • The default configuration sets CACHEOPS_SERIALIZER to “pickle” without additional safeguards.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Use a safe (e.g. JSON) or explicitly secured serializer in production.  
  • Enforce that the cache store (Redis) is only accessible from trusted backends by requiring authentication and binding to localhost (or another secure interface).  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The Redis instance must be misconfigured (i.e. be accessible externally and allow unauthenticated writes).  
  • The application must use the default pickle serializer, and an attacker must be able to inject a crafted payload into the cache.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In **cacheops/serializers.py**, the PickleSerializer simply wraps pickle.dumps and pickle.loads.  
  • In **cacheops/conf.py**, the default CACHEOPS_SERIALIZER is set to the string “pickle”.  
  • In several modules (e.g. **cacheops/getset.py**), data read from Redis is processed using settings.CACHEOPS_SERIALIZER.loads. This creates a deserialization “sink” that can be exploited if an attacker controls the stored data.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Identify or simulate a scenario where Redis is accessible with no authentication (for example, by overriding the CACHEOPS_REDIS settings).  
  2. Using a Redis client, inject a malicious pickle payload under a key that the application would later read. For example, craft a pickle object that runs an arbitrary command when deserialized.  
  3. Trigger a cache read from the application (via an HTTP GET request that causes a query cache hit).  
  4. Verify that the payload is executed (for example, by checking for file creation or other side effects).

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Redis Configuration Allowing External Access  
  **Description:**  
  The Redis connection settings (from **/code/tests/settings.py**) default to connecting to “127.0.0.1” on port 6379 without specifying a password. Although “127.0.0.1” is a localhost address, if—through misconfiguration or container/network setup—Redis becomes exposed on a public interface, an attacker will be able to connect without credentials. This exposure, in conjunction with the use of the insecure pickle serializer, significantly increases the risk that an attacker may modify cache entries or inject malicious payloads.  
  **Impact:**  
  If an attacker gains direct access to Redis, they can poison the cache (inject malicious serialized objects), result in arbitrary code execution upon deserialization, or otherwise interfere with application data integrity.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The default configuration enforces “127.0.0.1” as the host if no REDIS_HOST environment variable is provided. However, no authentication (password) or additional network restrictions are enforced by code.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Configure Redis to require authentication and restrict its network exposure (bind only to localhost or use proper firewall rules).  
  • Consider using TLS to secure connections if Redis must be accessible over a network.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The Redis instance is misconfigured to be publicly accessible (for example, if environment variables override the defaults so that Redis binds to 0.0.0.0).  
  • No password is required for Redis access.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In **/code/tests/settings.py**, the CACHEOPS_REDIS setting is defined as:  
    `{'host': os.getenv('REDIS_HOST') or '127.0.0.1', 'port': 6379, 'db': 13, 'socket_timeout': 3}`  
    There is no password parameter, meaning that if an attacker can route to Redis, no barrier prevents access.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Verify (in a test environment) that Redis is accessible from a remote machine (simulate misconfiguration by binding Redis to a public IP address).  
  2. Connect using a standard Redis client (e.g. redis-cli) without supplying a password.  
  3. Attempt to read keys (including those used by cacheops) and modify or inject a malicious cache entry.  
  4. Confirm that these operations succeed, demonstrating the insecure configuration.
