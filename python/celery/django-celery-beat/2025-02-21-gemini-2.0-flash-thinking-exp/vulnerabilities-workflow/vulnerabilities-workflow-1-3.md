### Vulnerability: Default Credentials in Docker Setup

*   Vulnerability Name: Default Credentials in Docker Setup
*   Description:
    1.  The provided Dockerfile `/code/docker/django/Dockerfile` automatically sets up a Django project named `mysite`.
    2.  Within this Dockerfile, default credentials are configured for the PostgreSQL database in `/code/docker/base/Dockerfile`:
        ```dockerfile
        RUN echo 'DATABASES = {"default": {"ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql", "NAME": "postgres", "USER": "postgres","PASSWORD": "s3cr3t", "HOST": "postgres", "PORT": 5432}}' >> mysite/settings.py
        ```
        and for the Django admin superuser in `/code/docker/django/entrypoint.sh`:
        ```bash
        python3 manage.py createsuperuserwithpassword \
                --username admin \
                --password admin \
                --email admin@example.org \
                --preserve
        ```
    3.  An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the PostgreSQL database and Django admin panel using these default credentials if the Docker containers are exposed publicly or accessible from an untrusted network.
*   Impact:
    *   **PostgreSQL Database Breach:** An attacker can access and manipulate sensitive data stored in the PostgreSQL database. This could lead to data theft, data manipulation, or complete data loss.
    *   **Django Admin Panel Takeover:** An attacker can log in to the Django admin panel with `username: admin` and `password: admin`. This grants full administrative control over the Django application, allowing the attacker to create, modify, or delete data, users, and configurations. In the context of django-celery-beat, this could allow manipulation of scheduled tasks.
*   Vulnerability Rank: High
*   Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    *   None. The Dockerfiles explicitly configure these default credentials.
*   Missing Mitigations:
    *   **Remove Default PostgreSQL Password:** The default PostgreSQL password `s3cr3t` should be removed from the Dockerfile. Instead, environment variables should be used to configure the database credentials, and users should be instructed to set strong, unique passwords during deployment.
    *   **Remove Default Django Admin Credentials:** The automatic creation of a Django admin superuser with default credentials `admin:admin` should be removed.  A secure setup process should be documented, instructing users to create an admin user with a strong password as part of their deployment process, ideally after the application is deployed and running.
*   Preconditions:
    *   The application is deployed using the provided Docker configuration.
    *   The Docker containers (especially the Django and PostgreSQL services) are publicly accessible or accessible from an untrusted network.
*   Source Code Analysis:
    1.  **`/code/docker/base/Dockerfile`**:
        *   `RUN echo 'DATABASES = {"default": {"ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql", "NAME": "postgres", "USER": "postgres","PASSWORD": "s3cr3t", "HOST": "postgres", "PORT": 5432}}' >> mysite/settings.py`
            *   This line directly embeds the hardcoded password `s3cr3t` into the Django `settings.py` file for the PostgreSQL database configuration during the Docker image build process.
    2.  **`/code/docker/django/entrypoint.sh`**:
        *   `python3 manage.py createsuperuserwithpassword --username admin --password admin --email admin@example.org --preserve`
            *   This line in the entrypoint script automatically creates a Django superuser named `admin` with the password `admin` every time the Django container starts. This is intended for ease of initial setup in a development environment but is highly insecure for any publicly accessible instance.

*   Security Test Case:
    1.  Build the Docker image using `docker-compose build django`.
    2.  Run the Docker containers using `docker-compose up -d django`.
    3.  Access the Django admin panel in a browser by navigating to `http://<your-public-ip>:<exposed-django-port>/admin/` (replace `<your-public-ip>` and `<exposed-django-port>` with your instance's public IP and the port mapping defined in `docker-compose.yml`, default is `58000`).
    4.  Attempt to log in using `username: admin` and `password: admin`.
    5.  If login is successful, the vulnerability is confirmed for the Django admin panel.
    6.  To test the PostgreSQL default password, you need to access the PostgreSQL database externally. This might require configuring port forwarding or using `docker exec` to enter the PostgreSQL container.
    7.  Using a PostgreSQL client (e.g., `psql`), attempt to connect to the PostgreSQL server using the following credentials:
        *   Host: `<your-public-ip>` or `localhost` if port forwarding is set up
        *   Port: `5432` (default PostgreSQL port, also exposed in docker-compose)
        *   Database: `postgres`
        *   User: `postgres`
        *   Password: `s3cr3t`
    8.  If the connection is successful, the vulnerability is confirmed for the PostgreSQL default password.
