## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Celery's Serialization Mechanism [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_celery's_serialization_mechanism__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Use Insecure Deserializer (pickle) [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting the inherent insecurity of Python's `pickle` module when used for deserializing untrusted data.
    *   **1.1.1 Craft Malicious Pickle Payload (RCE) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Creating a specially crafted byte stream (pickle payload) that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the worker.
        *   **1.1.1.1 Send Malicious Task with Pickle Payload [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Submitting a Celery task that includes the malicious pickle payload as part of its arguments or data.
        *   **1.1.1.2 Trigger Task Execution on Worker [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  The Celery worker, upon receiving the task, deserializes the payload using `pickle`, triggering the execution of the embedded malicious code.
    *   **1.1.3 Data Exfiltration via Pickle (Read Sensitive Files) [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Crafting a pickle payload that, upon deserialization, accesses and reads sensitive files on the worker's file system.
        *   **1.1.3.1 Craft Pickle Payload to Read Files**
            *   **Description:** Creating a pickle payload that uses Python's file I/O capabilities to open and read files.
        *   **1.1.3.2 Exfiltrate File Contents via Task Result/Error**
            *   **Description:**  Returning the contents of the read files as part of the task's result or embedding them in an error message, allowing the attacker to retrieve the data.

*   **1.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Other Serializers**
    *   **1.2.2 YAML: Exploit YAML Unsafe Loading (if used and not configured securely) [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting the `yaml.load()` function in PyYAML (or similar unsafe loading in other YAML libraries) when used with untrusted input.  This function can execute arbitrary code if the YAML data contains malicious constructs.
        *   **1.2.2.1 Craft Malicious YAML Payload (RCE) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Creating a YAML document that includes special tags and constructs that, when parsed by `yaml.load()`, execute arbitrary Python code.
        *   **1.2.2.2 Send Malicious Task with YAML Payload [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Submitting a Celery task containing the malicious YAML payload.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise the Message Broker [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_the_message_broker__high-risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities**
    *   **2.1.1 Find/Exploit Known Broker Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the message broker software (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) to gain unauthorized access or control.  This often involves using publicly available exploit code.

*   **2.2 Weak Broker Authentication/Authorization [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **2.2.2 Default/Weak Credentials [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Using default credentials (e.g., `guest`/`guest` for RabbitMQ) or easily guessable passwords to gain access to the message broker.

*   **2.4 Broker-Specific Attacks**
    *   **2.4.1 Redis: Exploit Redis Modules/Lua Scripting (if enabled) [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  If Redis modules or Lua scripting are enabled, attackers can load malicious modules or execute malicious Lua scripts to gain control of the Redis server, potentially leading to RCE on the host.
    *   **2.4.2 RabbitMQ: Exploit RabbitMQ Management Plugin (if exposed) [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  If the RabbitMQ management plugin is exposed to the internet without proper authentication or access controls, attackers can use it to manage the broker, create users, delete queues, and potentially gain further access.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Celery Worker Configuration/Deployment [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_celery_worker_configurationdeployment__high-risk_.md)

*   **3.1 Insecure Worker Configuration [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **3.1.1 `CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT` Includes Insecure Serializers (e.g., 'pickle') [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The `CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT` setting in the Celery configuration allows specifying which content types (serializers) the worker will accept.  If `pickle` is included, the worker is vulnerable to RCE via pickle deserialization attacks.
    *   **3.1.2 `task_serializer` Set to Insecure Serializer (e.g., 'pickle') [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The `task_serializer` setting defines the default serializer used for tasks. Setting this to `pickle` makes the worker vulnerable.
    *   **3.1.3 Exposed Debugging/Monitoring Ports (e.g., Flower without authentication) [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Celery monitoring tools like Flower, if exposed without authentication, can allow attackers to view task details, worker status, and potentially control the workers.

*   **3.2 Weak Worker Authentication/Authorization**
    *   **3.2.1 No/Weak Authentication for Task Submission [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  If there's no authentication mechanism for submitting tasks to Celery, any attacker who can reach the message broker can submit arbitrary tasks, potentially leading to RCE or other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Celery Features](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_celery_features.md)

*    **5.2 Exploit `task_always_eager` (if misconfigured)**
    *   **5.2.1 Bypass security measures by running tasks locally [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** If `task_always_eager` is set to `True`, tasks are executed locally and synchronously instead of being sent to the worker queue.  This can bypass security measures that rely on the worker environment (e.g., sandboxing, network restrictions).  It essentially runs the task code within the context of the application initiating the task, potentially exposing the application server to vulnerabilities in the task code.
