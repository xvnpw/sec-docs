# Attack Surface Analysis for celery/celery

## Attack Surface: [1. Task Code Injection (via Arguments)](./attack_surfaces/1__task_code_injection__via_arguments_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates task arguments to inject malicious code that is executed by Celery workers.
**Celery Contribution:** Celery workers execute arbitrary Python code based on task definitions and received arguments. Celery's core function is to execute this code; it's the *misuse* of this function that creates the vulnerability.
**Example:** A task accepts a Python code snippet as a string argument and uses `eval()` to execute it. An attacker provides malicious code.
**Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on worker nodes.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   System compromise.
    *   Lateral movement.
**Risk Severity:** **Critical**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation & Sanitization:** *Never* trust user-supplied data. Validate all task arguments against a strict whitelist. Sanitize input before use.
    *   **Avoid `eval()`, `exec()`, and Unsafe Deserialization:** Do not use `eval()`, `exec()`, `pickle.loads()`, or `yaml.load()` with untrusted input. Use safer alternatives like `json.loads()`.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Celery workers with the *minimum* necessary privileges.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review code, focusing on how task arguments are handled.

## Attack Surface: [2. Message Interception/Modification (Man-in-the-Middle) - *When Using Celery's Message Signing*](./attack_surfaces/2__message_interceptionmodification__man-in-the-middle__-_when_using_celery's_message_signing.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies messages, *specifically targeting the integrity checks provided by Celery's message signing*. This is distinct from a general MitM on the broker connection (which is infrastructure-related).
**Celery Contribution:** Celery *provides* the `task_serializer = 'signed'` option.  A vulnerability here would be a flaw in *Celery's implementation* of the signing/verification process, allowing an attacker to bypass it.  (This is less likely than a misconfiguration or a general broker MitM, but it's a *Celery-direct* concern if signing is used).
**Example:** A hypothetical flaw in Celery's signature verification logic allows an attacker to forge a valid signature for a modified message. (This is *not* a known vulnerability, but an example of the *type* of Celery-direct issue).
**Impact:**
    *   Modification of task arguments to trigger malicious actions, bypassing integrity checks.
    *   Replay attacks, if the signing mechanism is flawed.
**Risk Severity:** **High** (Assuming a vulnerability exists in the signing implementation; otherwise, this risk is mitigated by correct usage).
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Celery Updated:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Celery, which will include any security patches related to message signing.
    *   **Strong Cryptographic Keys:** Use strong, randomly generated keys for message signing. Protect these keys carefully.
    *   **Monitor for Verification Failures:** If Celery's signature verification fails, treat this as a *critical security event* and investigate immediately.

## Attack Surface: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) - *Exploiting Celery's Task Handling*](./attack_surfaces/3__denial_of_service__dos__-_exploiting_celery's_task_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker overwhelms Celery workers by sending a large number of resource-intensive tasks, *specifically exploiting Celery's task queuing and execution mechanisms*. This is distinct from a general DoS against the broker (which is infrastructure).
**Celery Contribution:** Celery's core function is to queue and execute tasks.  The vulnerability lies in how Celery handles excessive or malicious tasks.
**Example:** An attacker sends many tasks that consume excessive memory or CPU, causing workers to crash or become unresponsive.  This exploits Celery's task execution, not just the broker's queue.
**Impact:**
    *   Workers become unresponsive, preventing legitimate tasks from being processed.
    *   Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) on worker nodes.
**Risk Severity:** **High**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Task Time Limits:** Set appropriate `time_limit` and `soft_time_limit` values for *all* tasks. This is a *direct* Celery configuration.
    *   **Worker Concurrency Control:** Carefully configure the number of worker processes/threads (`-c` option). This is a *direct* Celery configuration.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Application-Side):** Implement rate limiting *at the application level* to control task submission. While not *directly* within Celery, this is essential to prevent abuse of Celery's queuing.
    *   **Prioritize Tasks:** Use Celery's priority queues to ensure that critical tasks are processed even under high load.

## Attack Surface: [4. Insecure Serializer (e.g., Pickle)](./attack_surfaces/4__insecure_serializer__e_g___pickle_.md)

**Description:** Using an insecure serializer like `pickle` for task arguments or results allows for arbitrary code execution.
**Celery Contribution:** Celery *provides* the serializer configuration option and handles the serialization/deserialization process. The choice of serializer is a *direct* Celery configuration.
**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious pickle payload and sends it as a task argument. When the worker deserializes the argument (using Celery's configured serializer), the attacker's code is executed.
**Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on worker nodes.
**Risk Severity:** **Critical**
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Serializers:** *Always* use `json` (default), `msgpack`, or `yaml` (with `SafeLoader`). *Never* use `pickle` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. This is a *direct* Celery configuration choice.
