# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for celery/celery

## Mitigation Strategy: [Message Signing (Cryptographic Signatures)](./mitigation_strategies/message_signing__cryptographic_signatures_.md)

1.  **Choose a Secure Serializer:** Select `auth` as the serializer in your Celery configuration. This uses HMAC for signing.
2.  **Generate a Secret Key:** Create a strong, random secret key. A good way to do this is using Python's `secrets` module: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"`. The longer the key, the better.
3.  **Securely Store the Key:** *Never* hardcode the key. Store it in an environment variable (e.g., `CELERY_SECRET_KEY`). For production, use a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
4.  **Configure Celery:**
    *   Set `task_serializer = 'auth'`
    *   Set `result_serializer = 'auth'`
    *   Set `accept_content = ['auth', 'json']` (or just `['auth']`)
    *   Set the `CELERY_SECRET_KEY` environment variable in your worker and application environments.
5.  **Key Rotation:** Establish a process for regularly rotating the secret key. This involves generating a new key, updating the configuration in all environments, and restarting Celery workers. The old key should be kept for a grace period to allow in-flight tasks to complete.
6.  **Verify Configuration:** Ensure all workers and the application are using the *same* secret key and serializer settings.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Task Execution:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary tasks into the queue.
        *   **Message Tampering:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from modifying the content of legitimate task messages.
        *   **Replay Attacks:** (Severity: High) - While `auth` doesn't inherently prevent replay attacks, it makes them significantly harder. Combining it with unique task IDs and short task expiration times further mitigates this.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Task Execution:** Risk reduced from Critical to Very Low.
        *   **Message Tampering:** Risk reduced from Critical to Very Low.
        *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Serializer set to `auth` in `celeryconfig.py`.
        *   Secret key stored in environment variable `CELERY_SECRET_KEY` on worker servers.
        *   `accept_content` configured correctly.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Key rotation process is not yet defined or automated.
        *   The application server (where tasks are *sent* from) does not yet have the `CELERY_SECRET_KEY` environment variable set, meaning it cannot *send* signed tasks. This needs to be added to the application server's deployment configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting (Task Level)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting__task_level_.md)

1.  **Identify Rate-Limited Tasks:** Determine which tasks are susceptible to abuse or could cause performance issues if executed excessively.
2.  **Apply `@task(rate_limit='...')`:** Use Celery's built-in rate limiting decorator. For example, `@task(rate_limit='10/m')` limits the task to 10 executions per minute. You can use `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), or `h` (hours).
3.  **Consider Burst Limits:** If you need to allow short bursts of activity, you might need a custom rate limiting solution (e.g., using Redis) that implements token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms. However, this is less *directly* Celery-specific.
4.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Monitor the effectiveness of rate limits and adjust them as needed based on observed traffic patterns.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Task Flooding:** (Severity: High) - Limits the rate at which specific tasks can be executed, preventing attackers from overwhelming workers.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents excessive consumption of resources (CPU, memory, database connections) by frequently executed tasks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Task Flooding:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Rate limiting is applied to the `send_email` task (`@task(rate_limit='5/m')`).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No rate limiting is applied to other potentially resource-intensive tasks, such as `process_large_file`. These tasks need to be assessed and have appropriate rate limits applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Task Time Limits](./mitigation_strategies/task_time_limits.md)

1.  **Set `task_time_limit`:** This is a hard time limit (in seconds). If a task exceeds this limit, it will be forcibly terminated. Set this in your Celery configuration.
2.  **Set `task_soft_time_limit`:** This is a soft time limit. If a task exceeds this limit, a `SoftTimeLimitExceeded` exception will be raised *within* the task. Set this in your Celery configuration.
3.  **Handle `SoftTimeLimitExceeded`:** Within your tasks, include `try...except` blocks to catch the `SoftTimeLimitExceeded` exception and handle it gracefully (e.g., releasing resources, logging the event).  This is *within* the task, so it's less directly a Celery configuration item.
4.  **Choose Appropriate Values:** Set time limits based on the expected execution time of your tasks. Start with generous limits and gradually reduce them as you gain confidence in the task's performance.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Long-Running Tasks:** (Severity: High) - Prevents tasks from running indefinitely and consuming worker resources.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Limits the amount of time a task can consume resources.
        *   **Deadlocks/Hangs:** (Severity: Medium) - Helps prevent tasks from getting stuck in infinite loops or deadlocks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Long-Running Tasks:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Deadlocks/Hangs:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `task_time_limit = 300` (5 minutes) is set globally in `celeryconfig.py`.
        *   `task_soft_time_limit = 240` (4 minutes) is set globally.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Not all tasks have specific `try...except` blocks to handle `SoftTimeLimitExceeded`. This needs to be added to tasks that might benefit from graceful shutdown on timeout. Specifically, the `process_large_file` task should handle this exception.  (While this is important, it's *within* the task code, not a direct Celery setting.)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Pickle Serializer](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_pickle_serializer.md)

1.  **Use `json` or `auth`:** Configure Celery to use the `json` serializer for general data or the `auth` serializer for signed messages.  This is done via the `task_serializer`, `result_serializer`, and `accept_content` settings.
2.  **Remove `pickle` from `accept_content`:** Ensure that `pickle` is *not* included in the `accept_content` setting. This prevents Celery from accepting pickled data.
3.  **Review Existing Code:** If `pickle` was previously used, carefully review any code that might have deserialized pickled data and ensure it is no longer vulnerable.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (via Deserialization):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from executing arbitrary code by sending malicious pickled data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (via Deserialization):** Risk reduced from Critical to None (if `pickle` is completely avoided).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `json` is the default serializer, and `auth` is used for signed messages.
        *   `pickle` is *not* in `accept_content`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   None. This mitigation is fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prefetch Limit (`worker_prefetch_multiplier`)](./mitigation_strategies/prefetch_limit___worker_prefetch_multiplier__.md)

1.  **Understand Prefetching:** Celery workers prefetch tasks from the queue to improve efficiency.  The `worker_prefetch_multiplier` setting controls how many tasks are prefetched per worker process.
2.  **Lower the Multiplier:**  Set `worker_prefetch_multiplier = 1` (or a low value) in your Celery configuration.  This reduces the number of tasks a worker will prefetch, making it less susceptible to being overwhelmed by a sudden burst of tasks.
3. **Consider Concurrency:** The total number of prefetched tasks is `worker_prefetch_multiplier` * `concurrency` (number of worker processes).
4. **Trade-off:**  Lowering the prefetch multiplier can slightly reduce performance in some scenarios, but it significantly improves resilience to DoS attacks.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Worker Overload:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the impact of a large number of tasks arriving simultaneously.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Worker Level):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents a single worker from consuming excessive resources due to prefetching too many tasks.

    * **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Worker Overload:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Worker Level):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    * **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not explicitly set; Celery is using the default value (which is usually 4).

    * **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `worker_prefetch_multiplier` should be set to `1` in `celeryconfig.py` to improve DoS resilience.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Result Expiration (`result_expires`)](./mitigation_strategies/result_expiration___result_expires__.md)

1.  **Set `result_expires`:**  In your Celery configuration, set `result_expires` to a value (in seconds) that represents how long task results should be stored in the result backend.  After this time, the results will be automatically removed.
2.  **Choose an Appropriate Value:**  Select a value that is long enough for your application to retrieve the results but short enough to minimize the window of exposure.  Consider using a relatively short expiration time (e.g., a few hours or a day).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Result Data Exposure:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the time window during which task results are available in the result backend.
        *   **Result Backend Storage Exhaustion:** (Severity: Low) - Prevents the result backend from filling up with old, unused results.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Result Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Result Backend Storage Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `result_expires` is set to 86400 (24 hours).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   None. The current setting is reasonable, but it could be reviewed and potentially shortened if the application doesn't need to retain results for a full day.
