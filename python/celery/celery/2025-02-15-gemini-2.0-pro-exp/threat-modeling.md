# Threat Model Analysis for celery/celery

## Threat: [Malicious Task Injection via Unauthenticated Broker Access](./threats/malicious_task_injection_via_unauthenticated_broker_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Task Injection via Unauthenticated Broker Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) due to weak or missing authentication. The attacker then publishes crafted messages directly to the Celery task queue, bypassing any application-level authentication or validation. These messages could contain malicious code or commands to be executed by the worker.  This bypasses Celery's intended workflow.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the worker nodes, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying application behavior, or launching further attacks.
    *   **Affected Celery Component:** Message Broker (interaction with); Celery's task queuing mechanism (`celery.app.task.Task.apply_async`, `celery.send_task`, etc.). Celery's reliance on the broker's security is the key factor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Broker Authentication:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the message broker. Use unique, complex passwords or, preferably, certificate-based authentication.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the message broker on a separate network segment, restricting access.
        *   **Broker Hardening:** Follow security best practices for the specific message broker.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to the broker's ports.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Insecure Deserialization (Pickle)](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_insecure_deserialization__pickle_.md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Insecure Deserialization (Pickle)

    *   **Description:** Celery is configured to use the `pickle` serializer for task messages. An attacker crafts a malicious pickled object and sends it as a task (either through a vulnerability in the application or by directly accessing the broker). When the Celery worker deserializes the object, it executes arbitrary code contained within the malicious pickle payload.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the worker nodes.
    *   **Affected Celery Component:** Celery's serialization/deserialization mechanism; specifically, the use of the `pickle` serializer (`CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'pickle'`). This is a direct Celery configuration issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Pickle:** *Never* use the `pickle` serializer with untrusted input. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Use JSON:** Use a secure serializer like JSON (`CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'`).
        *   **Signed Serializers:** If a complex serializer is absolutely necessary, use Celery's digitally signed serializers.
        *   **Content-Type Validation:** Strictly validate `content-type` and `content-encoding` headers.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Task Queue Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_via_task_queue_flooding.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Task Queue Flooding

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a massive number of task requests to the Celery queue, exceeding the capacity of the workers to process them. This overwhelms Celery's queuing system, preventing legitimate tasks from being executed.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service. The application becomes unresponsive or unavailable.
    *   **Affected Celery Component:** Message Broker; Celery worker pool (`celery worker` process); Celery's task queuing mechanism. This directly impacts Celery's core functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on task submission (both application-level and using Celery's `rate_limit`).
        *   **Queue Length Monitoring:** Monitor queue length and set up alerts.
        *   **Broker Capacity Planning:** Ensure the broker has sufficient resources.
        *   **Priority Queues:** Use a broker that supports priority queues.
        *   **Auto Scaling:** Use auto-scaling for workers.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Unencrypted Broker Communication](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_unencrypted_broker_communication.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure via Unencrypted Broker Communication

    *   **Description:** Task arguments or results contain sensitive data. Communication between the application and the message broker, or between the broker and the Celery workers, is not encrypted. An attacker eavesdrops on the network and intercepts the sensitive data as it's passed through Celery's communication channels.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure. Sensitive data is exposed.
    *   **Affected Celery Component:** Message Broker communication; Celery's transport layer (interaction with the broker). This is a direct consequence of how Celery communicates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **TLS Encryption:** Use TLS to encrypt all communication between the application, broker, and workers. Configure both the broker and Celery to use TLS.
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Arguments/Results:** Avoid passing sensitive data directly. Use secure alternatives.
        *   **Data Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data if it *must* be stored.

## Threat: [Worker Impersonation](./threats/worker_impersonation.md)

* **Threat:** Worker Impersonation

    * **Description:** An attacker deploys a rogue Celery worker that connects to the message broker and pretends to be a legitimate worker. This rogue worker can intercept and process tasks, potentially stealing data or executing malicious code. This directly exploits Celery's worker registration and task distribution.
    * **Impact:** Data leakage, execution of malicious code, disruption of legitimate task processing.
    * **Affected Celery Component:** Celery worker (`celery worker` process), Broker connection, Celery's worker registration and discovery mechanism.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Broker Authentication:** Use strong authentication for worker connections (e.g., TLS client certificates).
        * **Worker Whitelisting:** Maintain a whitelist of authorized worker hostnames or IPs.
        * **Monitoring:** Monitor for unexpected worker connections.
        * **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic.

## Threat: [Unprivileged Task Execution Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/unprivileged_task_execution_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

* **Threat:** Unprivileged Task Execution Leading to Privilege Escalation

    * **Description:** A Celery worker runs with higher privileges than necessary. An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within a task* to gain control of the worker process.  The worker's elevated privileges allow the attacker to perform actions they wouldn't normally be able to. This leverages the Celery worker's execution context.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    * **Affected Celery Component:** Celery worker (`celery worker` process), operating system user permissions (as configured for the Celery worker).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Least Privilege Principle:** Run Celery workers with the *minimum* necessary privileges.
        * **Containerization:** Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to isolate workers.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit worker permissions and configurations.
