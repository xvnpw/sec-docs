# Attack Surface Analysis for celery/celery

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Task Serialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_task_serialization.md)

*   **Description:** Using insecure serialization formats allows for arbitrary code execution when a worker deserializes a malicious task payload.
    *   **How Celery Contributes:** Celery supports various serialization formats, including the highly insecure `pickle`. If `pickle` is used and an attacker can influence the task payload, they can execute arbitrary code on the worker.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious task payload serialized with `pickle` and submits it to the Celery queue. When a worker processes this task, the `pickle` deserialization executes the attacker's code.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution on worker machines, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Absolutely avoid using `pickle` for task serialization.**
        *   Prefer safer serialization formats like `json` or `msgpack`.
        *   If custom serialization is necessary, ensure it is implemented securely and thoroughly reviewed.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization even when using safer serialization formats, as vulnerabilities might exist in the deserialization libraries themselves.

## Attack Surface: [Worker Exploitation via Task Arguments](./attack_surfaces/worker_exploitation_via_task_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the code of Celery tasks can be exploited if task arguments are not properly validated and sanitized, especially when sourced from untrusted inputs.
    *   **How Celery Contributes:** Celery facilitates the execution of arbitrary code defined in tasks with arguments passed to them. If these arguments come from untrusted sources, they can be a vector for attacks.
    *   **Example:** A Celery task processes a filename provided as an argument. An attacker provides a malicious filename like `; rm -rf /`, which, if not properly sanitized within the task, could lead to unintended consequences on the worker's file system.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability in the task code - ranging from information disclosure and data manipulation to remote code execution if the vulnerability allows it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all task arguments, especially those originating from external or untrusted sources.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to worker processes, limiting their access to system resources.
        *   Regularly audit and pen-test Celery task code for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Scheduled Tasks (Celery Beat)](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_scheduled_tasks__celery_beat_.md)

*   **Description:** If the configuration source for Celery Beat (the task scheduler) is compromised, attackers can modify scheduled tasks to execute malicious code at specific times.
    *   **How Celery Contributes:** Celery Beat relies on a configuration source (e.g., a database, configuration file) to determine which tasks to schedule. If this source is insecure, it can be manipulated.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the Celery Beat schedule configuration and adds a malicious task to be executed periodically, potentially compromising the worker infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on worker machines at scheduled intervals, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the configuration source for Celery Beat with appropriate access controls.
        *   Implement integrity checks for the schedule configuration.
        *   Regularly review and audit the scheduled tasks.
