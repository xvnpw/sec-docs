# Threat Model Analysis for celery/celery

## Threat: [Code Injection via Task Names](./threats/code_injection_via_task_names.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate input used to dynamically generate task names. When a worker attempts to import or execute a task with this crafted name, malicious code embedded within the name could be executed. This exploits how Celery uses Python's import mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the worker node, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `celery.app.registry.tasks` (task registration mechanism), Python's `importlib` (used internally by Celery for task loading).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamically generating task names based on untrusted input.
    *   Use a predefined, static set of task names.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization if dynamic task name generation is absolutely necessary (though highly discouraged).

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Task Payloads](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_task_payloads.md)

*   **Description:** Celery often uses serialization (e.g., Pickle) to transmit task arguments. If the broker is accessible to untrusted sources or if the application doesn't enforce strong security around message consumption, an attacker can inject malicious serialized payloads. When a worker deserializes this payload, it can lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a direct vulnerability stemming from Celery's message handling.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the worker node, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `kombu.serialization` (the underlying library Celery uses for serialization), task execution logic within workers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucially, avoid using insecure serializers like Pickle for task payloads, especially if the broker is exposed to untrusted networks.**
    *   Use safer serialization formats like JSON or MessagePack.
    *   Implement message signing and verification to ensure message integrity and origin.
    *   Restrict access to the message broker.

## Threat: [Message Injection/Spoofing in the Broker](./threats/message_injectionspoofing_in_the_broker.md)

*   **Description:** If the message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) is not properly secured with authentication and authorization, an attacker can inject malicious tasks into the queue that Celery workers will process. They can also spoof the origin of messages, potentially bypassing access controls or triggering unintended actions within the Celery application. This directly targets Celery's reliance on the broker.
*   **Impact:** Execution of malicious tasks by workers, leading to data manipulation, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** The configured message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) and the underlying communication layer used by Celery (`kombu`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable authentication and authorization on the message broker.**
    *   Use strong passwords or key-based authentication for broker access.
    *   Restrict network access to the broker.
    *   Consider using TLS/SSL to encrypt communication with the broker.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering](./threats/configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker can modify the Celery configuration (e.g., `celeryconfig.py`), they could potentially redirect tasks to malicious brokers that Celery workers will connect to, configure insecure serialization settings that Celery will use, or otherwise compromise the system's security through Celery's own configuration mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Significant compromise of the Celery infrastructure, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Celery configuration files and the mechanism Celery uses to load configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Protect Celery configuration files with appropriate file system permissions.**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use environment variables or secure secrets management.
    *   Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of configuration files.
