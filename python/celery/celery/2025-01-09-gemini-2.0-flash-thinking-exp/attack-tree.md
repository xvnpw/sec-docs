## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Task Data Handling Vulnerabilities -> Code Injection via Deserialization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_task_data_handling_vulnerabilities_-_code_injection_via_deserialization_fla_8d53584c.md)

*   **Critical Node: Code Injection via Deserialization Flaws:** This is a critical point because successful exploitation directly leads to arbitrary code execution on the Celery worker.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1. **Identify Insecure Serializer (e.g., pickle without verification):** The attacker first identifies that the Celery application is using an insecure serializer like `pickle` without proper safeguards.
        2. **Craft Malicious Serialized Payload:**  The attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload. This payload, when deserialized, will execute arbitrary code on the worker. This requires knowledge of the serialization format and potentially the classes available in the worker's environment.
        3. **High Risk Node: Trigger Task Execution with Malicious Payload:** The attacker then finds a way to trigger the execution of a Celery task containing this malicious payload. This could involve directly creating a task, modifying an existing task in the queue (if the attacker has broker access), or exploiting a vulnerability in the task creation process of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_broker_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities:** The message broker is a central component. Compromising it grants the attacker significant control over the task processing workflow.
    *   **Attack Vector 1: Broker Compromise (High Risk Node):**
        1. **Exploit Vulnerability in Broker Software (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis):** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the broker software itself. This requires identifying a relevant vulnerability and developing or obtaining an exploit.
        2. **Gain Unauthorized Access to Broker:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the broker. This could be through exploiting software vulnerabilities, using default or weak credentials, or by compromising the network where the broker is running.

    *   **Attack Vector 2: Message Queue Poisoning (High Risk Node):**
        1. **Gain Access to Broker (potentially with limited privileges):** The attacker gains some level of access to the message broker. This access might not be full administrative control but enough to publish messages to queues.
        2. **Inject Malicious Tasks into Queues:** The attacker injects specially crafted, malicious tasks into the Celery task queues. These tasks are designed to perform actions that compromise the application or the worker.
        3. **Workers Process Malicious Tasks:**  The Celery workers pick up and process these malicious tasks, leading to the execution of the attacker's intended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via Celery](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_celery.md)

This is the root goal and inherently critical as it represents the ultimate objective of the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Code Injection via Deserialization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_code_injection_via_deserialization_flaws.md)

As explained in High-Risk Path 1, this node is critical due to the direct consequence of arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_broker_vulnerabilities.md)

As explained in High-Risk Path 2, compromising the broker has widespread implications for the security of the Celery application.
