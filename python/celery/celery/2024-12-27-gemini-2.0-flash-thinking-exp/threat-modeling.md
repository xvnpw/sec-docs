## High and Critical Celery Threats

| Threat | Description (What the attacker might do and how) | Impact | Affected Celery Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Worker Joining the Cluster** | An attacker gains access to the broker credentials or exploits a vulnerability in the broker's authentication mechanism. They then spin up a rogue worker instance that connects to the broker, masquerading as a legitimate worker. This rogue worker can then pick up and execute tasks, potentially with malicious intent. | Data breaches, unauthorized actions, resource consumption, denial of service by executing resource-intensive or crashing tasks. | Broker (message queue), Workers | High | - **Strong Broker Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, TLS certificates) on the broker and ensure only authorized workers can connect. - **Secure Broker Credentials Management:** Store broker credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management tools) and avoid hardcoding them. - **Worker Instance Identification and Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms to identify and monitor worker instances, potentially using unique identifiers or certificates. - **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the broker and worker network to limit the attack surface. |
| **Spoofing Task Origin** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the broker and injects malicious tasks that appear to originate from the legitimate application. This could involve crafting messages that mimic the expected task format and routing them to the appropriate queues. | Execution of malicious code on workers, data manipulation by tasks with altered parameters, bypassing application logic by triggering unintended workflows. | Broker (message queue), Tasks | High | - **Broker Access Control:** Restrict access to the broker to only authorized application components. Use strong authentication and authorization. - **Secure Broker Communication:** Use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) for communication with the broker to prevent eavesdropping and tampering. - **Task Signing/Verification (Advanced):** Implement mechanisms to cryptographically sign tasks at the source and verify their authenticity on the worker side. This adds a layer of trust to the task origin. |
| **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Task Payloads** | Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal data) directly in the task arguments when defining tasks. This data is then transmitted through the broker and potentially stored in the result backend. | Exposure of sensitive data if the broker, result backend, or communication channels are compromised. This can lead to data breaches and further attacks. | Tasks (arguments passed to task functions), Broker (message queue), Result Backend | High | - **Avoid Passing Sensitive Data Directly:** Instead of passing sensitive data directly in task arguments, pass identifiers and retrieve the data securely within the task execution context (e.g., from a secure vault or database). - **Task Payload Encryption (Sensitive Data):** Encrypt sensitive data within the task payload before sending it to the broker. - **Review Task Definitions:** Regularly review task definitions to ensure no sensitive information is being inadvertently passed as arguments. |
| **Code Injection through Task Arguments** | If task logic directly executes code based on untrusted input from task arguments (e.g., using `eval()` or similar constructs), an attacker could inject malicious code into the task arguments, leading to arbitrary code execution on the worker. | Arbitrary code execution on worker instances, potentially leading to system compromise, data breaches, and further attacks. | Workers (task execution logic) | Critical | - **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution Based on Task Arguments:** Design tasks to avoid directly executing code based on untrusted input. - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received within tasks to prevent the injection of malicious code. - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure worker processes have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. |
| **Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Task Payloads** | If custom serialization formats are used for task payloads and the deserialization process is vulnerable, an attacker could craft malicious payloads that, when deserialized by the worker, lead to arbitrary code execution. | Arbitrary code execution on worker instances, potentially leading to system compromise, data breaches, and further attacks. | Workers (task deserialization logic) | Critical | - **Use Secure Serialization Formats:** Prefer well-vetted and secure serialization formats like JSON or MessagePack. Avoid using pickle or other formats known to have security vulnerabilities. - **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:** Be extremely cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources. If possible, avoid deserialization altogether or use safer alternatives. - **Keep Deserialization Libraries Updated:** Ensure that any deserialization libraries used are up-to-date with the latest security patches. |
