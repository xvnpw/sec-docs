# Threat Model Analysis for celery/celery

## Threat: [Task Argument Deserialization Vulnerability](./threats/task_argument_deserialization_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** Celery workers deserialize task arguments, often using libraries like `pickle` or JSON. If the application configures Celery to use an insecure deserialization format like `pickle` for data originating from untrusted sources, an attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized by the Celery worker, executes arbitrary code. This directly involves Celery's choice of serialization mechanism and how it handles task arguments.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on Celery workers.

**Affected Component:** Celery Worker process, Task execution logic, Serialization/Deserialization within Celery.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure Celery to avoid using insecure deserialization formats like `pickle` for untrusted data. Prefer safer formats like JSON.
*   If `pickle` is necessary, ensure it's only used for data from highly trusted sources within the application's control.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all task arguments *before* they are passed to Celery tasks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Celery or its Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_celery_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Celery, like any software, may contain security vulnerabilities within its codebase. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or its infrastructure. This directly involves the security of the Celery library itself.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure directly related to Celery's functionality.

**Affected Component:** Celery library codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Celery updated to the latest version, ensuring you have applied security patches.
*   Regularly scan Celery's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `safety` or `pip-audit`.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for Celery to be informed of any newly discovered vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Task Injection leading to Code Execution via Celery](./threats/malicious_task_injection_leading_to_code_execution_via_celery.md)

**Description:** While the initial injection might occur at the broker level, the *execution* of the malicious task is handled by Celery workers. If Celery doesn't have sufficient safeguards against executing arbitrary code contained within a task (even if the injection point is external), it contributes to the threat. This includes scenarios where task logic directly executes code based on arguments without proper sanitization, a behavior facilitated by Celery's task execution model.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on Celery workers.

**Affected Component:** Celery Worker process, Task execution logic within Celery.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully validate and sanitize any data used within task logic, especially if it originates from external sources.
*   Avoid directly executing code based on task arguments without strict control and validation.
*   Implement security best practices within task code to prevent common vulnerabilities.
