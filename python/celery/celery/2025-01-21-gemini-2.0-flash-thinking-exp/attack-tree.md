## Attack Tree Path: [Guess default credentials -> Unauthorized Access to Broker -> Inject Malicious Task](./attack_tree_paths/guess_default_credentials_-_unauthorized_access_to_broker_-_inject_malicious_task.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker guesses or finds default credentials for the message broker. This grants them unauthorized access, allowing them to inject a malicious task that executes arbitrary code on a worker.

**Likelihood:** Medium (Default credentials are often not changed).

**Impact:** Critical (Arbitrary code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Anonymous access enabled -> Unauthorized Access to Broker -> Inject Malicious Task](./attack_tree_paths/anonymous_access_enabled_-_unauthorized_access_to_broker_-_inject_malicious_task.md)

**Attack Vector:** The message broker is misconfigured to allow anonymous access. This grants attackers immediate access to inject malicious tasks.

**Likelihood:** Low (Should be caught in security reviews).

**Impact:** Critical (Arbitrary code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing authentication requirements -> Unauthorized Access to Broker -> Inject Malicious Task](./attack_tree_paths/missing_authentication_requirements_-_unauthorized_access_to_broker_-_inject_malicious_task.md)

**Attack Vector:** The message broker lacks proper authentication mechanisms. Similar to anonymous access, this allows attackers to bypass security and inject malicious tasks.

**Likelihood:** Low (Should be caught in security reviews).

**Impact:** Critical (Arbitrary code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Celery uses insecure serializer (e.g., pickle):](./attack_tree_paths/celery_uses_insecure_serializer__e_g___pickle_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application is configured to use an insecure serializer like `pickle`. An attacker who can influence the data being serialized (even indirectly) can craft a malicious payload that executes arbitrary code when deserialized by the worker.

**Likelihood:** Medium (If developers are unaware of the risks).

**Impact:** Critical (Arbitrary code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Application code deserializes untrusted data within tasks:](./attack_tree_paths/application_code_deserializes_untrusted_data_within_tasks.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Even if Celery's default serializer is secure, application code within a task might deserialize untrusted data using a vulnerable method (like `pickle`). An attacker who can control this data can achieve code execution.

**Likelihood:** Medium (If application logic involves deserialization).

**Impact:** Critical (Arbitrary code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Task arguments are used in shell commands without proper sanitization:](./attack_tree_paths/task_arguments_are_used_in_shell_commands_without_proper_sanitization.md)

**Attack Vector:** Task code directly uses arguments in shell commands without proper sanitization. An attacker who can control these arguments (through broker compromise or other means) can inject malicious commands.

**Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on coding practices).

**Impact:** Critical (Arbitrary command execution on the worker host).

## Attack Tree Path: [Broker credentials stored insecurely -> Unauthorized Access to Broker -> Inject Malicious Task](./attack_tree_paths/broker_credentials_stored_insecurely_-_unauthorized_access_to_broker_-_inject_malicious_task.md)

**Attack Vector:** Broker credentials are stored in a location accessible to attackers (e.g., plain text configuration files, exposed environment variables). This allows them to gain unauthorized access and inject malicious tasks.

**Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration).

**Impact:** High (Full broker control leading to arbitrary code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Using default broker credentials -> Unauthorized Access to Broker -> Inject Malicious Task](./attack_tree_paths/using_default_broker_credentials_-_unauthorized_access_to_broker_-_inject_malicious_task.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses the default credentials provided with the message broker software. Attackers can easily find these default credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access and inject malicious tasks.

**Likelihood:** Medium (If not changed during setup).

**Impact:** High (Full broker control leading to arbitrary code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Using insecure serializer without understanding the risks:](./attack_tree_paths/using_insecure_serializer_without_understanding_the_risks.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers choose an insecure serializer like `pickle` without understanding the security implications. This makes the application vulnerable to deserialization attacks if an attacker can influence the serialized data.

**Likelihood:** Medium (If developers are unaware of the risks).

**Impact:** Critical (Code injection).
