# Attack Surface Analysis for celery/celery

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Task Arguments](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_task_arguments.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious code can be injected through serialized task arguments if an insecure serializer is used. When the worker deserializes these arguments, the malicious code is executed.
    *   **How Celery Contributes:** Celery serializes task arguments to send them to the broker. If configured to use insecure serializers like `pickle` (especially in older versions or through explicit configuration), it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious `pickle` payload as a task argument. When a worker receives and deserializes this task, the payload executes arbitrary code on the worker machine.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution on worker machines, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Secure Serializers: Configure Celery to use secure serializers like JSON. This significantly reduces the risk of arbitrary code execution through deserialization.
        *   Input Validation:  Validate and sanitize task arguments on the worker side before processing them, regardless of the serializer used.
        *   Avoid `pickle`:  Unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of the risks, avoid using the `pickle` serializer.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Task Arguments](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_task_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** If task logic dynamically executes code based on task arguments without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code through these arguments.
    *   **How Celery Contributes:** Celery passes arguments to task functions. If these arguments are used in a way that allows for dynamic code execution (e.g., using `eval` or similar constructs within the Celery task definition), it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A Celery task takes a string argument intended for a simple operation, but the code uses `eval(argument)`. An attacker provides a malicious code snippet as the argument, which is then executed by the worker.
    *   **Impact:** High - Remote code execution on worker machines, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:  Refrain from using functions like `eval` or `exec` on untrusted input from task arguments within Celery task definitions.
        *   Parameterized Functions: Design Celery tasks to use predefined logic paths and parameters instead of dynamically executing arbitrary code.
        *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all task arguments within the Celery task logic before using them in any operations.
