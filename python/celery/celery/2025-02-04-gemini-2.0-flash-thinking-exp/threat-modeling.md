# Threat Model Analysis for celery/celery

## Threat: [Message Queue Poisoning / Task Data Injection](./threats/message_queue_poisoning__task_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious messages and injects them directly into the message broker queues that Celery workers consume. This can be done by exploiting misconfigurations in broker access control or vulnerabilities in the application that allow message publishing. The attacker aims to execute arbitrary code on workers or manipulate application logic by providing unexpected or malicious data as task arguments.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Celery workers, leading to full system compromise.
        *   Data corruption or unauthorized access to databases and other systems connected to workers.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) by injecting resource-intensive or crashing tasks.
        *   Application logic bypass, allowing unauthorized actions or data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Celery Component:**
        *   Message Broker (RabbitMQ, Redis, etc.) - as the entry point for malicious messages.
        *   Celery Workers - as the component processing the malicious messages.
        *   Task functions - vulnerable task code that processes malicious input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation in Tasks:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within all Celery tasks to handle unexpected or malicious data.
        *   **Secure Serialization:** Avoid insecure serialization formats like `pickle`. Use safer alternatives like JSON or Protobuf.
        *   **Message Broker Access Control:** Configure strong authentication and authorization on the message broker to restrict message publishing to authorized clients only.
        *   **Queue Isolation:** Use dedicated queues with appropriate access controls for different task types and applications.
        *   **Content Type Verification:** Implement checks to verify the expected content type of messages before processing them in workers.

## Threat: [Worker Node Compromise](./threats/worker_node_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a Celery worker node. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in the worker's operating system, dependencies, or applications running on the same node.  Once compromised, the attacker can leverage the worker's access and resources.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Exfiltration: Access and steal sensitive data processed by tasks or stored on the worker node.
        *   Lateral Movement: Use the compromised worker as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Disrupt task processing by shutting down or misconfiguring the worker.
        *   Task Result Manipulation: Alter task results before they are stored in the result backend, leading to data integrity issues.
    *   **Affected Celery Component:**
        *   Celery Worker Node (Operating System, Dependencies, Worker Process) - the compromised entity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Security Patching:** Keep the worker node's operating system, Celery, dependencies, and all software up-to-date with security patches.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Celery worker processes with minimal necessary privileges. Avoid running as root.
        *   **Worker Node Hardening:** Harden worker nodes by disabling unnecessary services, closing unused ports, and implementing firewalls.
        *   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Implement IDPS to monitor worker nodes for malicious activity.
        *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct security assessments to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in worker infrastructure.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Workers](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_workers.md)

*   **Description:** Celery workers rely on external libraries and packages. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to compromise the worker process. This can be achieved if workers use outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on workers, leading to full system compromise.
        *   Data Exfiltration: Access and steal data processed by or accessible to the worker.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Crash or disrupt worker processes by exploiting vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Celery Component:**
        *   Celery Worker Environment (Python packages, libraries, dependencies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Regularly scan worker environments for known vulnerabilities in dependencies using vulnerability scanning tools.
        *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep worker dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches and versions.
        *   **Virtual Environments:** Use virtual environments to isolate worker dependencies and manage them effectively.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA tools in the development pipeline to track and manage dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
