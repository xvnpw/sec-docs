# Attack Surface Analysis for celery/celery

## Attack Surface: [1. Broker Access Control Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/1__broker_access_control_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficiently secured access to the message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) used by Celery.
*   **Celery Contribution:** Celery relies entirely on the broker for communication. Weak broker security directly exposes Celery and the application.
*   **Example:** Using default credentials for RabbitMQ. An attacker gains access, monitors task queues, and injects a task that executes `os.system('rm -rf /')` on a worker.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (task data), arbitrary code execution on workers, denial of service (broker disruption).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Credentials:** Use strong, unique passwords or key-based authentication for broker access.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict broker access to only necessary Celery components (clients, workers, beat).
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review and update broker access controls and configurations.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unencrypted Broker Communication](./attack_surfaces/2__unencrypted_broker_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between Celery components and the broker is not encrypted, allowing for eavesdropping and manipulation.
*   **Celery Contribution:** Celery's communication relies on the broker. Unencrypted broker communication directly exposes Celery traffic.
*   **Example:** Celery communicates with Redis over plain TCP. An attacker on the network intercepts task messages containing sensitive user data being passed as task arguments.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (task data), integrity compromise (task modification), potential arbitrary code execution (modified tasks).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS/SSL:** Configure the broker and Celery to use TLS/SSL encryption for all communication channels.
    *   **VPN/Secure Network:** If TLS/SSL is not feasible, ensure Celery components and the broker communicate within a trusted and isolated network (e.g., VPN).

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure Deserialization (Pickle)](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_deserialization__pickle_.md)

*   **Description:** Using `pickle` for task serialization when task content might originate from untrusted sources.
*   **Celery Contribution:** Celery's default serialization, or developer choice of `pickle`, can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker manages to inject a malicious task message into the queue. This message contains a pickled object crafted to execute arbitrary code when deserialized by a worker.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on Celery workers.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Pickle:** Do not use `pickle` for task serialization, especially if task content is not fully trusted.
    *   **Use Secure Serializers:** Utilize safer serialization formats like JSON or `json` serializer provided by Celery, especially for tasks handling external or user-provided data.
    *   **Input Validation:** If `pickle` is unavoidable, rigorously validate and sanitize any data before it is serialized into tasks.

## Attack Surface: [4. Malicious Task Injection](./attack_surfaces/4__malicious_task_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers are able to inject tasks directly into the Celery queue, bypassing intended application logic.
*   **Celery Contribution:** Celery's task queue mechanism can be directly interacted with if broker access is compromised or application logic is flawed.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the web application allows an attacker to directly enqueue tasks to Celery by manipulating API calls or exploiting injection flaws. The attacker injects a task to download and execute a malicious script from an external server on a worker.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on Celery workers.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Task Enqueueing Logic:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs used to create and enqueue Celery tasks within the application code.
    *   **Broker Access Control (see point 1):** Strong broker access controls prevent unauthorized direct queue manipulation.

## Attack Surface: [5. Scheduled Task Manipulation (Celery Beat)](./attack_surfaces/5__scheduled_task_manipulation__celery_beat_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized modification or injection of scheduled tasks in Celery Beat.
*   **Celery Contribution:** Celery Beat manages scheduled tasks. Compromising Beat or its configuration allows manipulation of scheduled task execution.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Beat configuration file or the system running Beat and modifies a scheduled task to execute a malicious script periodically.
*   **Impact:** Scheduled execution of arbitrary code, persistent compromise of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Beat Configuration:** Protect the Beat configuration file and access to the system running Beat with strong access controls.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Beat with minimal necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [6. Exposed Celery Control/Monitoring Interfaces](./attack_surfaces/6__exposed_celery_controlmonitoring_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:** Celery monitoring tools like Flower or Celery events are exposed without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Celery Contribution:** Celery provides monitoring and control mechanisms that, if improperly secured, become attack vectors.
*   **Example:** Flower is deployed and accessible without authentication. An attacker accesses Flower, monitors task details, and potentially uses control features to disrupt worker processes.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (task details, application activity), denial of service (worker control), potential control over Celery infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for all Celery monitoring and control interfaces (e.g., Flower, Celery events).
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to monitoring interfaces to authorized users and networks only.
