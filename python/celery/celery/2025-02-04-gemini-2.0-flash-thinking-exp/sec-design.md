# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Celery project is a distributed task queue focused on real-time operation, but supporting scheduling as well. It is used to execute tasks asynchronously outside the main application flow. This improves application responsiveness and allows for processing of long-running or resource-intensive tasks in the background.

- Business Priorities:
  - Reliability: Tasks should be executed reliably, even in the face of failures.
  - Scalability: The system should be able to handle increasing task loads.
  - Performance: Tasks should be executed efficiently and with minimal latency.
  - Maintainability: The system should be easy to operate, monitor, and debug.

- Business Risks:
  - Task failures leading to data inconsistency or incomplete operations.
  - Performance bottlenecks due to inefficient task processing or infrastructure limitations.
  - Security vulnerabilities in task processing logic or infrastructure leading to data breaches or service disruption.
  - Operational complexity increasing management overhead and potential for human error.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Secure coding practices are assumed to be followed during development. (Implemented by: Development team)
  - security control: Usage of standard message brokers like RabbitMQ or Redis, which have their own security features. (Implemented by: Infrastructure and deployment configuration)
  - security control: Code review process before merging code changes. (Implemented by: Development team and maintainers - described in project contribution guidelines)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Celery. Mitigation is through dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration of message brokers or result backends leading to security issues. Mitigation is through infrastructure as code and security hardening guidelines.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) in a staging environment to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Regularly perform dependency scanning to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Implement secret scanning to prevent accidental exposure of secrets in code or configuration.
  - security control: Enforce least privilege principle for Celery workers and related infrastructure components.
  - security control: Implement monitoring and alerting for security-related events, such as failed authentication attempts or unusual activity patterns.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Celery workers should authenticate to the message broker and result backend.
    - Requirement: Applications submitting tasks to Celery should authenticate if required by the message broker.
    - Requirement: Management interfaces (if any) for Celery should require strong authentication.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Celery workers should be authorized to access specific queues or task types.
    - Requirement: Applications submitting tasks should be authorized to submit specific task types.
    - Requirement: Access to management interfaces should be restricted to authorized users.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Task payloads should be validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
    - Requirement: Inputs to Celery configuration and management interfaces should be validated.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data in task payloads or results should be encrypted at rest and in transit if necessary.
    - Requirement: Communication channels between Celery components (e.g., worker to broker) should be encrypted if necessary.
    - Requirement: Secrets used for authentication or encryption should be securely managed and stored.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Asynchronous task processing for core application functionalities (e.g., background jobs, data processing, email sending).
  - Reliable execution of scheduled tasks.
  - Maintaining application responsiveness by offloading long-running tasks.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Task Payloads: Sensitivity depends on the application. Payloads might contain sensitive user data, financial information, or personal identifiable information (PII). Sensitivity level can range from low to high depending on the application context.
  - Task Results: Similar sensitivity to task payloads, as results often reflect processed data from payloads.
  - Celery Configuration and Secrets: High sensitivity. Misconfiguration or exposure of secrets can lead to unauthorized access or service disruption.
  - Monitoring Data: Low to medium sensitivity. Can contain performance metrics and operational logs, which might reveal some system information.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

  - What is the typical use case for Celery in the target environment? (e.g., specific types of tasks, scale of operations)
  - What message broker and result backend are currently used or planned to be used?
  - What are the specific security requirements and compliance standards that need to be met?
  - Are there any existing security policies or guidelines that need to be followed?

- Assumptions:
  - Celery is used for asynchronous task processing to improve application performance and scalability.
  - Standard message brokers like RabbitMQ or Redis are used.
  - Basic security practices are followed during development and deployment.
  - The target environment is a cloud-based infrastructure.
  - Security is a relevant concern, and the organization is willing to invest in reasonable security controls.
