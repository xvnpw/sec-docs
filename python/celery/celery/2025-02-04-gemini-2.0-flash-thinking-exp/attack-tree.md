## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Celery Broker (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_celery_broker__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to gain control of the Celery broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ). This is a critical point of failure as the broker manages task distribution and communication.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the broker can lead to:
        * Task queue manipulation (injection, deletion, modification).
        * Monitoring and interception of task data.
        * Denial of service by disrupting task processing.
        * Potential lateral movement to other parts of the application infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Credential Theft for Broker Access (HIGH RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_credential_theft_for_broker_access__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to steal valid credentials to access the Celery broker.
    * **Sub-Vectors (High Risk):**
        * **1.2.2 Steal Credentials from Application Configuration/Environment (HIGH RISK PATH):**
            * **1.2.2.2 Extract Broker Credentials (Plaintext or weakly encrypted):**  Credentials for the broker are found stored insecurely in application configuration files, environment variables, or other accessible locations.
    * **Impact:** Successful credential theft grants the attacker direct access to the broker, enabling all the impacts listed under "Compromise Celery Broker".

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Celery Worker(s) (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_celery_worker_s___high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target Celery workers, which execute tasks. Compromising a worker allows for code execution within the application's processing environment.
    * **Impact:** Worker compromise can lead to:
        * Code execution on the worker server.
        * Data breaches by accessing data processed by tasks.
        * Lateral movement to other systems accessible from the worker environment.
        * Disruption of application functionality by manipulating task execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Code Execution via Task Deserialization Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_code_execution_via_task_deserialization_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploits insecure deserialization practices in Celery task handling. If Celery is configured to use insecure serializers like `pickle` or `yaml` (especially with untrusted data), attackers can inject malicious payloads within task messages.
    * **Sub-Vectors (Critical Nodes):**
        * **2.1.1 Celery configured to use insecure serializer (e.g., `pickle`, `yaml`) (CRITICAL NODE):** The application is configured to use a vulnerable serializer, creating the *possibility* of this attack.
        * **2.1.2 Inject Maliciously Crafted Task Message (HIGH RISK PATH):**
            * **2.1.2.2 Craft malicious serialized payload to execute arbitrary code during deserialization on worker (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers craft a malicious serialized payload that, when deserialized by the worker using the insecure serializer, executes arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Code execution on the Celery worker, potentially leading to full worker and application compromise. **This is a highly critical Celery-specific vulnerability.**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Worker Dependencies (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_worker_dependencies__medium-high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by Celery workers.
    * **Sub-Vectors (Critical Node):**
        * **2.2.2 Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE):**  Workers use outdated or vulnerable libraries with publicly known exploits.
    * **Impact:** Code execution on the worker, potentially leading to full worker and application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Malicious Task Execution through Application Logic Flaws (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_malicious_task_execution_through_application_logic_flaws__medium-high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the application's task handler code itself (e.g., injection flaws like command injection, SQL injection, path traversal).
    * **Sub-Vectors (Critical Node):**
        * **2.3.1 Identify Application Logic Vulnerabilities in Task Handlers (CRITICAL NODE):**  Vulnerabilities exist in the code that processes Celery tasks, allowing for malicious actions based on crafted task parameters.
    * **Impact:** Code execution within the task handler context, data breaches, application compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the task's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Task Queue Manipulation/Injection (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/3__task_queue_manipulationinjection__medium-high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to manipulate the Celery task queue to inject malicious tasks or disrupt legitimate task processing.
    * **Sub-Vectors (High Risk via Broker Compromise):**
        * **3.1 Direct Task Queue Access (Requires Broker Compromise - see 1) (HIGH RISK PATH):**  If the broker is compromised (as in attack vector 1), attackers gain direct access to the task queues.
            * **3.1.2 Directly Interact with Task Queues (e.g., using broker CLI or API):**
                * **3.1.2.1 Inject Malicious Tasks into Queues (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers inject crafted tasks directly into the queue that, when processed by workers, execute malicious code or perform unauthorized actions.
    * **Sub-Vectors (Application Vulnerability):**
        * **3.2 Application Vulnerability Leading to Task Injection (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH):**  Vulnerabilities in the application's task enqueuing logic allow attackers to inject tasks through application interfaces.
            * **3.2.2 Exploit Input Validation or Authorization Flaws in Task Enqueuing Logic (CRITICAL NODE):**
                * **3.2.2.1 Inject Malicious Task Parameters (e.g., command injection via task arguments) (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers exploit input validation flaws to inject malicious parameters into tasks enqueued through the application, leading to code execution when the task is processed.
    * **Impact:** Code execution on workers via injected tasks, denial of service by flooding the queue, disruption of application functionality by manipulating or deleting tasks.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Celery Configuration Exploitation (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/4__celery_configuration_exploitation__medium-high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit insecure Celery configuration practices or exposed configuration files to gain sensitive information or weaken security.
    * **Sub-Vectors (Medium-High Risk Paths):**
        * **4.1 Exposed Celery Configuration Files (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH):**
            * **4.1.2 Configuration files contain sensitive information (CRITICAL NODE):** Configuration files are exposed (e.g., in web root, public repositories) and contain sensitive data like broker credentials, secret keys, or insecure settings.
        * **4.2 Insecure Celery Configuration Settings (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK PATH):**
            * **4.2.1 Default or Weak Celery Settings (CRITICAL NODE):** The application uses default or weak Celery settings, such as insecure serializers or disabled security features, increasing the attack surface.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure (credentials, settings), increased vulnerability to other attacks due to insecure configurations.
