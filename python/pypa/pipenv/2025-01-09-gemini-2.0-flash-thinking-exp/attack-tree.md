## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using Pipenv [CRITICAL_NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_pipenv__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the ultimate success of their efforts to exploit Pipenv.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Dependency Management [CRITICAL_NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_dependency_management__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical area because Pipenv's core function is dependency management. Exploiting this allows attackers to introduce malicious code or vulnerabilities into the application's environment through its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Introduce Malicious Dependency [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__introduce_malicious_dependency__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on the attacker's ability to get a malicious dependency installed in the application's environment. This can be achieved through various means:
    * **Uploading Malicious Packages:**  Creating and publishing packages with malicious code to public repositories like PyPI, often using techniques like typosquatting or name squatting.
    * **Compromising Existing Packages:** Taking over legitimate package maintainer accounts to inject malicious code into updates.
    * **Dependency Confusion:**  Exploiting naming similarities between internal/private packages and public packages to trick Pipenv into installing the attacker's malicious version.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Victim Installs Malicious Dependency [CRITICAL_NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__victim_installs_malicious_dependency__critical_node_.md)

This is a crucial step where the attacker's efforts to introduce a malicious dependency culminate in its actual installation. This typically happens when a developer or the CI/CD system executes `pipenv install` or `pipenv update`.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Malicious code in setup.py or package is executed during installation [CRITICAL_NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__malicious_code_in_setup_py_or_package_is_executed_during_installation__critical_node_.md)

This is the point where the malicious payload is delivered. During the installation process, Pipenv (and `pip`) executes the `setup.py` script of a package. If this script or other parts of the package contain malicious code, it will be executed on the system, potentially leading to:
    * Downloading and installing further malware.
    * Creating backdoors for persistent access.
    * Exfiltrating sensitive data.
    * Gaining control over the application environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Utilize Dependency Confusion Attack [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__utilize_dependency_confusion_attack__high_risk_path_.md)

This specific high-risk path leverages the possibility of naming collisions between internal, private packages used within an organization and packages available on public repositories like PyPI. Attackers can upload a malicious package to the public repository with the same name as an internal package. If the organization's Pipenv configuration is not properly set up to prioritize private repositories, it might inadvertently download and install the attacker's malicious package.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Tamper with Pipfile or Pipfile.lock [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/7__tamper_with_pipfile_or_pipfile_lock__high_risk_path_.md)

This path involves the attacker gaining the ability to directly modify the `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock` files within the application's repository. This can happen if:
    * **Developer machines or CI/CD pipelines are compromised:** Attackers gain access and can directly push changes to these files.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle attacks are successful:** Attackers intercept and modify network traffic during dependency resolution, altering the contents of these files.
* By modifying these files, the attacker can:
    * **Introduce malicious dependency entries:** Add specific malicious packages to the dependency list.
    * **Modify the package source:** Point Pipenv to a malicious package index server.
    * **Pin vulnerable versions:** Force the installation of older, vulnerable versions of legitimate packages.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Introduce Malicious Dependency Entry (within Tamper with Pipfile/Pipfile.lock):](./attack_tree_paths/8__introduce_malicious_dependency_entry__within_tamper_with_pipfilepipfile_lock_.md)

This action, within the "Tamper with Pipfile or Pipfile.lock" path, specifically refers to the act of adding a malicious package name and version to the `Pipfile` or ensuring a malicious version is locked in `Pipfile.lock`. This directly leads to the installation of the attacker's chosen malicious dependency when `pipenv install` is run.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Exploit Setup Scripts of Dependencies [HIGH_RISK_PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/9__exploit_setup_scripts_of_dependencies__high_risk_path_.md)

This path directly focuses on the inherent risk of executing arbitrary code during the dependency installation process. The `setup.py` file in a Python package can contain arbitrary code that is executed when the package is installed. If a dependency (either intentionally malicious or a legitimate package that has been compromised) contains malicious code in its `setup.py`, Pipenv will execute it.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Malicious Code in setup.py [CRITICAL_NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/10__malicious_code_in_setup_py__critical_node_.md)

This is the critical point within the "Exploit Setup Scripts" path. It represents the presence of malicious code within the `setup.py` file of a dependency. This malicious code is the key to the attacker achieving their goals, as it will be executed during the installation process.
