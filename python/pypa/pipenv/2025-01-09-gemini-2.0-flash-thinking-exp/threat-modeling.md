# Threat Model Analysis for pypa/pipenv

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Installation](./threats/malicious_dependency_installation.md)

**Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package to a public or private index with a name similar to a legitimate dependency or compromises an existing package. A developer, through a typo or by unknowingly depending on the compromised package, installs this malicious dependency using `pipenv install`. The malicious package then executes arbitrary code on the developer's machine or the deployment environment during installation or runtime.

**Impact:** Code execution, data breach, system compromise, supply chain attack affecting the application and potentially its users.

**Affected Component:** `pipenv install`, `Pipfile`, package resolution logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review package names before installation.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Verify package integrity using checksums or signatures (if available).
*   Pin specific versions of dependencies in the `Pipfile` and review updates carefully.
*   Consider using a private package repository with stricter controls for internal dependencies.
*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in the development pipeline.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock`](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in__pipfile__or__pipfile_lock_.md)

**Description:** Developers might accidentally commit sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or private repository credentials, directly into the `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock`. This information is then directly accessible within files managed by Pipenv.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, and potential compromise of other systems.

**Affected Component:** `Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never** store secrets directly in the `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock`.
*   Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
*   Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent committing files containing sensitive information.
*   Regularly scan repositories for accidentally committed secrets.

## Threat: [Lock File Manipulation](./threats/lock_file_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains write access to the `Pipfile.lock` (e.g., through a compromised development environment or CI/CD pipeline) and modifies it to point to specific, potentially vulnerable or malicious, versions of dependencies. When `pipenv install` is run, Pipenv will install these manipulated versions as dictated by the altered `Pipfile.lock`.

**Impact:** Installation of vulnerable or malicious dependencies, leading to potential security breaches.

**Affected Component:** `Pipfile.lock`, `pipenv install`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the development environment and CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized access.
*   Implement code review processes for changes to `Pipfile.lock`.
*   Consider using tools that can detect inconsistencies between `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.
*   Store `Pipfile.lock` securely and restrict write access.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via `pipenv run` Scripts](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via__pipenv_run__scripts.md)

**Description:** If the `Pipfile` defines scripts in the `[scripts]` section, an attacker who can modify the `Pipfile` can introduce malicious commands into these scripts. When a developer or automated system executes these scripts using `pipenv run`, Pipenv directly executes these malicious commands with the permissions of the user running the command.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data manipulation, or denial of service, depending on the malicious commands injected.

**Affected Component:** `pipenv run`, `Pipfile` (scripts section).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and control who can modify the `Pipfile`.
*   Avoid defining complex or potentially dangerous commands directly in the `Pipfile` scripts.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization if scripts accept user input.
*   Run `pipenv run` in environments with least privilege.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion](./threats/dependency_confusion.md)

**Description:** An organization uses internal packages with names that might conflict with public packages on PyPI. An attacker could publish a malicious package with the same name on PyPI. Depending on Pipenv's configuration and the order in which package sources are checked during `pipenv install`, the malicious public package might be installed instead of the intended private one.

**Impact:** Installation of unintended and potentially malicious code, compromising the application.

**Affected Component:** `pipenv install`, package resolution logic, configuration of package indexes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use private package repositories with unique namespaces or prefixes for internal packages.
*   Configure Pipenv to prioritize private repositories over public ones.
*   Implement strict naming conventions for internal packages to avoid collisions.
