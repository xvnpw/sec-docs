# Attack Surface Analysis for pypa/pipenv

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Packages in `Pipfile` / `Pipfile.lock`](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_packages_in__pipfile____pipfile_lock_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious packages or vulnerable versions directly into the project's dependency files.
    *   **Pipenv Contribution:** `Pipenv` uses these files to manage and install dependencies, making them a direct target for dependency manipulation. `Pipfile.lock`'s precise version pinning increases the risk if compromised.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies `Pipfile.lock` to include a backdoored version of `requests` (e.g., `requests==2.28.1-malicious`).
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory, multi-person reviews for *all* changes to `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.
        *   **SCA Scanning:** Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies *before* deployment.
        *   **Dependency Pinning Policies:** Enforce strict policies, potentially using tools beyond `Pipfile.lock` for greater control (e.g., signed packages, curated lists).
        *   **Repository Security:** Strong access controls (MFA, least privilege) for the source code repository.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodic audits of dependencies for vulnerabilities and outdated packages.

## Attack Surface: [2. Dependency Confusion](./attack_surfaces/2__dependency_confusion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers publish malicious packages on public repositories with the same names as internal, private packages.
    *   **Pipenv Contribution:** `Pipenv` might install the malicious public package if the private package index is not properly configured.
    *   **Example:** An internal package named `mycompany-utils` is not configured with a private index. An attacker publishes `mycompany-utils` on PyPI. `Pipenv install` pulls the malicious package.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Private Package Indexes:** *Always* explicitly configure private package indexes in `Pipfile` using the `[[source]]` section with `url` and `verify_ssl = true`.
        *   **Scoped Packages:** Use scoped package names (e.g., `@mycompany/mycompany-utils`) to minimize naming conflicts.
        *   **Package Repository Manager:** Employ a dedicated package repository manager (Artifactory, Nexus) for robust security and access control.
        *   **Public Repository Monitoring:** Regularly monitor public repositories for potentially confusing package names.

## Attack Surface: [3. Compromised Package Index](./attack_surfaces/3__compromised_package_index.md)

*   **Description:** The package index itself (e.g., a custom index or, less likely, PyPI) is compromised, serving malicious packages.
    *   **Pipenv Contribution:** `Pipenv` relies on the integrity of the configured package index to download safe packages.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains control of a company's internal package index and replaces a legitimate package with a trojanized version.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Critical for custom indexes, High for PyPI)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Custom Indexes:** Harden and regularly patch custom package index servers. Implement strong authentication and authorization.
        *   **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS (`verify_ssl = true` in `Pipfile`) for *all* package index interactions.
        *   **Repository Manager Security:** Use a package repository manager with built-in security features and vulnerability scanning.
        *   **Index Integrity Monitoring:** Monitor the integrity of the package index itself.

## Attack Surface: [4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks](./attack_surfaces/4__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept the communication between `Pipenv` and the package index, injecting malicious code.
    *   **Pipenv Contribution:** `Pipenv` handles the download of packages, making it susceptible to MitM if SSL verification is disabled.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as a developer uses a tool like `mitmproxy` to intercept `pipenv install` and replace a downloaded package.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **SSL Verification:** *Never* disable SSL verification (`verify_ssl = true` in `Pipfile` â€“ this is the default).
        *   **Secure Networks:** Use VPNs or other secure network connections, especially in untrusted environments.
