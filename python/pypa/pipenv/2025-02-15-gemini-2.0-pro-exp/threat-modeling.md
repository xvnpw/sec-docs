# Threat Model Analysis for pypa/pipenv

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion / Substitution](./threats/dependency_confusion__substitution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package on a public repository (e.g., PyPI) with the same name as a private package used internally, or a very similar name to a popular public package (typosquatting). The attacker might use a higher version number. Pipenv, during dependency resolution (`pipenv install`, `pipenv update`), might inadvertently install the malicious package instead of the intended one, especially if private repository configuration is incorrect or resolution order is manipulated.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary code on development machines or production servers.
        *   Data exfiltration or modification.
        *   Complete system compromise.
    *   **Pipenv Component Affected:**
        *   Dependency resolution process (`pipenv install`, `pipenv update`).
        *   `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` (malicious entries here lead to the threat).
        *   Interaction with package indexes (PyPI, private indexes).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicit Index Configuration:** Use `--index-url` and `--extra-index-url` in `Pipfile` to *explicitly* define the order of package indexes, prioritizing the private repository. Secure the private repository with authentication and access controls.
        *   **Version Pinning:** Use strict version pinning in `Pipfile` (e.g., `package = "==1.2.3"`). Avoid wildcard versions (`*`) or overly broad ranges.
        *   **Hash Verification:** Use `--require-hashes` in `Pipfile`. This forces Pipenv to verify the cryptographic hash of downloaded packages against `Pipfile.lock`, preventing installation of tampered packages.
        *   **Private Package Index:** Use a private package index (e.g., DevPI, Artifactory) to host internal packages securely.
        *   **Namespace Packages (for internal packages):** Use Python's namespace packages to create a unique namespace unlikely to be duplicated.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit `Pipfile.lock` for unexpected package sources or versions.

## Threat: [Installation of Packages with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/installation_of_packages_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A package in `Pipfile` (or a transitive dependency) has a known, publicly disclosed vulnerability (CVE).  An attacker exploits this. This often happens if `Pipfile.lock` isn't updated, or a vulnerable version is pinned. Pipenv installs the vulnerable package.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies, but can range from denial of service to remote code execution and data breaches.
    *   **Pipenv Component Affected:**
        *   `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` (contain vulnerable dependency information).
        *   Dependency resolution and installation (`pipenv install`, `pipenv update`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Run `pipenv update` regularly to update `Pipfile.lock` with the latest secure versions. Automate this in your CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate a vulnerability scanning tool (e.g., Safety, Snyk, Dependabot, Ochrona) into your workflow. These tools scan `Pipfile.lock` for vulnerabilities and often provide automated pull requests.
        *   **`pipenv check`:** Use `pipenv check` to scan for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Database Monitoring:** Stay informed about new vulnerabilities by monitoring databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) and security advisories.
        *   **Policy Enforcement:** Establish a policy for addressing vulnerabilities, including patching timelines.

## Threat: [Malicious Code in Transitive Dependencies](./threats/malicious_code_in_transitive_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** A direct dependency (in `Pipfile`) depends on other packages (transitive dependencies). An attacker compromises a transitive dependency, injecting malicious code. The developer may be unaware of the vulnerability. Pipenv installs these dependencies.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Similar to direct dependency vulnerabilities: code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Pipenv Component Affected:**
        *   `Pipfile.lock` (contains the full dependency tree).
        *   Dependency resolution process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Deep):** Use tools that analyze *transitive* dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Tree Review:** Regularly review `Pipfile.lock` to understand the full dependency tree. Use `pipenv graph` to visualize it.
        *   **SBOM Generation:** Consider tools that generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Minimization:** Prefer packages with fewer transitive dependencies.
        *   **Auditing Key Dependencies:** Prioritize auditing and vetting of critical or widely used dependencies, even transitive ones.

## Threat: [Tampering with `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock`](./threats/tampering_with__pipfile__or__pipfile_lock_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains access (development environment, source control, CI/CD) and modifies `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock` to introduce malicious dependencies or vulnerable versions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Installation of malicious/vulnerable packages: code execution, data breaches.
    *   **Pipenv Component Affected:**
        *   `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Source Control Security:** Strong access controls, authentication (including MFA), and authorization for repositories.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews, including scrutiny of `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` changes.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Digital signatures or other integrity checks (e.g., Git hooks) to verify `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.
        *   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:** Secure the CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Developers and build systems have only minimum necessary permissions.
