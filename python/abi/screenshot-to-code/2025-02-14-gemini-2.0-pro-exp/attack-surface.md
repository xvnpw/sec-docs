# Attack Surface Analysis for abi/screenshot-to-code

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Input (Image Processing Exploits)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_input__image_processing_exploits_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Image Input (Image Processing Exploits)

    *   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in image processing libraries used by the backend to handle uploaded screenshots.
    *   **`screenshot-to-code` Contribution:** The core functionality relies on processing user-provided image files, making this a primary entry point for attacks.  This is *directly* related to the library's image handling.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG file that triggers a buffer overflow in the `libpng` library used by the backend, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use a robust image processing library:** Choose a well-maintained and security-focused image processing library (e.g., ImageMagick with security policies, or a memory-safe alternative).
        *   **Keep libraries up-to-date:** Regularly update all image processing dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Image Sanitization:** Implement image sanitization techniques (e.g., re-encoding the image to a standard format, stripping metadata) to remove potentially malicious content.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate image dimensions, file size, and format *before* processing. Reject excessively large or malformed images.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run image processing in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container with limited privileges) to contain potential exploits.
        *   **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Use a WAF with rules to detect and block known image exploit patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Indirect Prompt Injection (LLM Manipulation)](./attack_surfaces/indirect_prompt_injection__llm_manipulation_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Indirect Prompt Injection (LLM Manipulation)

    *   **Description:** Manipulation of the LLM's output by crafting a screenshot with specific visual elements or text that influences the generated code.
    *   **`screenshot-to-code` Contribution:** The image itself acts as the primary input (indirect prompt) to the LLM, making it the vector for this attack. This is the *core* mechanism of how `screenshot-to-code` works, and thus the attack is directly related.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a screenshot of a web form with a hidden field containing malicious JavaScript. The LLM includes this hidden field in the generated HTML, leading to an XSS vulnerability.  Another example: a screenshot showing a button labeled "Grant Admin Access" might trick the LLM into generating code that performs that action.
    *   **Impact:** XSS, CSRF, unauthorized actions, data exfiltration, generation of insecure or buggy code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Sanitization:** *Always* treat the LLM's output as untrusted.  Thoroughly sanitize the generated HTML, CSS, and any other code using a robust HTML sanitizer and appropriate escaping techniques.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the execution of inline scripts and other potentially dangerous content, mitigating XSS.
        *   **LLM Input Filtering (Difficult but Important):**  Attempt to detect and filter potentially malicious visual patterns or text within the screenshot *before* sending it to the LLM. This is challenging but can reduce the attack surface.  Examples include:
            *   **OCR and Text Analysis:** Use OCR to extract text from the image and analyze it for potentially malicious keywords or patterns.
            *   **Object Detection:** Use object detection to identify potentially sensitive UI elements (e.g., password fields, admin panels) and flag them for review or rejection.
        *   **Human Review (for High-Risk Scenarios):**  For applications where security is paramount, consider incorporating human review of the generated code before deployment.
        *   **Least Privilege for LLM:** Ensure the LLM has absolutely minimal access to any sensitive data or backend systems.
        *   **Contextual Awareness (Ideal but Advanced):** Ideally, the system should be designed to understand the *context* of the screenshot and the intended functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Data Leakage to Third-Party LLM Provider](./attack_surfaces/data_leakage_to_third-party_llm_provider.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Data Leakage to Third-Party LLM Provider

    *   **Description:** Sensitive information contained in screenshots is sent to a third-party LLM provider, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access or misuse.
    *   **`screenshot-to-code` Contribution:** If a hosted LLM service is used, the screenshots are transmitted to that provider's servers. This is a direct consequence of using the `screenshot-to-code` library with a hosted LLM.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a screenshot of a dashboard containing confidential financial data. This data is sent to the LLM provider.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, regulatory non-compliance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use a Local LLM:** The *best* mitigation is to run the LLM locally.
        *   **Choose a Privacy-Focused Provider:** If using a hosted service, carefully review the provider's privacy policy and security practices.
        *   **Data Minimization:** Avoid uploading screenshots that contain sensitive information. Pre-process images to redact or blur sensitive areas.
        *   **Data Encryption:** If possible, encrypt the image data before sending it to the LLM provider.
        *   **Contractual Agreements:** Establish clear contractual agreements with the LLM provider regarding data handling.
        * **User Awareness:** Inform users about the potential risks.
