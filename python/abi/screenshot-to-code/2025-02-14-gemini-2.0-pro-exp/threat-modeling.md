# Threat Model Analysis for abi/screenshot-to-code

## Threat: [Malicious Screenshot Injection (XSS via Image)](./threats/malicious_screenshot_injection__xss_via_image_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Screenshot Injection (XSS via Image)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a screenshot that visually appears benign but, when processed by `screenshot-to-code`, generates code containing malicious JavaScript (XSS payload). This payload could steal cookies, redirect users, or otherwise compromise the application. The core vulnerability lies in `screenshot-to-code`'s inability to distinguish between visually harmless and semantically malicious content within the image.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of user accounts.
        *   Data theft (session cookies, user input).
        *   Defacement of the application.
        *   Redirection to phishing sites.
        *   Loss of user trust.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `screenshot-to-code`'s image processing and code generation engine (specifically the AI model and the code generation logic that translates the model's output into HTML/CSS/JS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Output Sanitization:** Employ a robust HTML/CSS/JS sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove *all* potentially dangerous elements and attributes from the generated code *before* it is used or rendered. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded, providing a secondary layer of defense against XSS.
        *   **Limited UI Element Generation:** Configure `screenshot-to-code` (if possible) or modify its output to *strictly* limit the types of HTML elements generated.  Forbid `<script>`, `<form>`, `<input type="password">`, and other high-risk elements.
        *   **Code Review (Automated/Manual):** Implement a review process (preferably automated) for *all* generated code before deployment.

## Threat: [API Request/Response Tampering](./threats/api_requestresponse_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** API Request/Response Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network communication between the application and the `screenshot-to-code` backend (e.g., OpenAI API).  They modify the request (altering the screenshot data) or the response (injecting malicious code into the generated HTML/CSS/JS). This relies on a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, exploiting vulnerabilities in the communication channel.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Similar to Malicious Screenshot Injection, but the attack vector is network-based.
        *   Potential for complete control over the generated code.
        *   Bypass of client-side security measures.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   The network communication layer between the application and the `screenshot-to-code` backend API.  This is a direct threat because the application *relies* on this external service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS with Strict Certificate Validation:** Use HTTPS for *all* communication with the backend.  Ensure the application rigorously validates the server's certificate to prevent MitM attacks.  *Never* disable certificate verification.
        *   **Request Signing (If Supported):** If the backend API supports request signing or other authentication mechanisms, implement them to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of requests.
        *   **Response Validation:** Perform basic sanity checks on the response from the backend.  Look for unexpected data types, sizes, or structures. While comprehensive validation is difficult, basic checks can detect some tampering.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Backend Overload](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_backend_overload.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Backend Overload

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a large volume of screenshots, excessively large images, or computationally complex screenshots to the `screenshot-to-code` service. This overwhelms the backend, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This directly impacts the availability of the `screenshot-to-code` service, which the application depends on.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application downtime due to the unavailability of the `screenshot-to-code` service.
        *   Loss of functionality.
        *   Potential financial losses.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   The `screenshot-to-code` backend service (e.g., OpenAI API, image processing servers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting on screenshot submissions, both per user and globally, to prevent abuse.
        *   **Input Size Limits:** Enforce limits on the maximum file size and dimensions of screenshots that can be processed.
        *   **Complexity Analysis (Advanced):**  Ideally, estimate the computational complexity of processing a screenshot *before* sending it to the backend. Reject screenshots that are likely to be too resource-intensive. This is a complex mitigation.
        *   **Backend Monitoring and Scaling:** Monitor the backend service for signs of overload and scale resources (e.g., increase server capacity) as needed. This is the responsibility of the `screenshot-to-code` provider, but the application should have monitoring in place to detect issues.
        *   **Queueing System:** Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle screenshot processing asynchronously. This prevents a surge of requests from overwhelming the backend.
