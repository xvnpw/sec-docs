## Project Design Document: Screenshot to Code (Improved)

**1. Introduction**

This document provides a detailed design for the "Screenshot to Code" project, a tool designed to convert images of user interface designs (screenshots) into functional code. This document outlines the system's architecture, components, data flow, and technologies. Its primary purpose is to serve as a foundation for comprehensive threat modeling activities.

**2. Goals and Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** To enable users to efficiently generate clean and functional code (primarily HTML and CSS, with potential for JavaScript/framework-specific code) directly from UI screenshots.
* **Key Objectives:**
    * **Accuracy:**  Accurately identify a wide range of UI elements (e.g., buttons, text inputs, images, containers, icons) within a screenshot.
    * **Translation:**  Translate identified UI elements and their visual properties (e.g., size, position, color, font) into semantically correct and well-structured code.
    * **User Experience:** Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for uploading screenshots, reviewing the identified elements, configuring code generation options, and accessing the generated code.
    * **Configurability:** Offer users options to customize the generated code, such as choosing target frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS), naming conventions, and code formatting preferences.
    * **Extensibility:** Design the system with modularity in mind to allow for future expansion and the addition of support for more code languages, frameworks, and UI element types.

**3. Architecture Overview**

The system employs a modular, client-server architecture with clearly defined responsibilities for each component. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and scalability.
