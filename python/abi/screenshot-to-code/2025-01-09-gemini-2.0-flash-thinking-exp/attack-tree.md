## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Supply a Deceptive Screenshot --> Trigger Generation of Insecure Code --> Exploit Lack of Output Sanitization --> Directly Execute Generated Code Without Review](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_supply_a_deceptive_screenshot_--_trigger_generation_of_insecure_code_--_exploit_lac_880e3c0d.md)

**Supply a Deceptive Screenshot (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Start):**
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a seemingly benign screenshot that, due to biases or limitations in the `screenshot-to-code` model, leads to the generation of code containing vulnerabilities.
*   **Attacker Action:**  Carefully designs the visual elements in the screenshot to trick the model into producing specific code constructs known to be insecure (e.g., code vulnerable to XSS or SQL injection).
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  Weaknesses in the machine learning model's training data or architecture that cause it to misinterpret the visual input and generate flawed code.

**Trigger Generation of Insecure Code (High-Risk Path):**
*   **Attack Vector:** The deceptive screenshot successfully causes the `screenshot-to-code` process to generate code with security vulnerabilities.
*   **Attacker Action:**  No direct action at this stage, as this is a consequence of the previous step.
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  The inherent limitations or biases of the ML model in the `screenshot-to-code` project.

**Exploit Lack of Output Sanitization (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
*   **Attack Vector:** The application integrating `screenshot-to-code` fails to properly sanitize or validate the generated code before using it.
*   **Attacker Action:** Relies on the developers' oversight or lack of robust security measures.
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  Absence or inadequacy of input validation and output encoding mechanisms in the integrating application.

**Directly Execute Generated Code Without Review (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
*   **Attack Vector:** The application directly executes the generated code without any manual review or automated security checks.
*   **Attacker Action:**  No direct action at this stage, as this is a consequence of the application's design.
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  A critical flaw in the application's architecture and development practices, where trust is implicitly placed in the output of `screenshot-to-code`.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization --> Trigger Generation of Insecure Code --> Exploit Lack of Output Sanitization --> Directly Execute Generated Code Without Review](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_lack_of_input_sanitization_--_trigger_generation_of_insecure_code_--_exploi_b057c02b.md)

**Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
*   **Attack Vector:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the input screenshot before passing it to the `screenshot-to-code` process.
*   **Attacker Action:**  Provides a screenshot with unexpected or malicious content that might not be a specific "deceptive" image but could still trigger unexpected behavior or influence code generation.
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  Failure to implement proper input validation and sanitization routines in the integrating application.

**Trigger Generation of Insecure Code (High-Risk Path):**
*   **Attack Vector:** The unsanitized input screenshot influences the `screenshot-to-code` process to generate code containing vulnerabilities.
*   **Attacker Action:** No direct action at this stage, as this is a consequence of the previous step.
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  The susceptibility of the `screenshot-to-code` model to unexpected or malformed inputs.

**Exploit Lack of Output Sanitization (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** (Same as in High-Risk Path 1)
*   **Attack Vector:** The application integrating `screenshot-to-code` fails to properly sanitize or validate the generated code before using it.
*   **Attacker Action:** Relies on the developers' oversight or lack of robust security measures.
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  Absence or inadequacy of input validation and output encoding mechanisms in the integrating application.

**Directly Execute Generated Code Without Review (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):** (Same as in High-Risk Path 1)
*   **Attack Vector:** The application directly executes the generated code without any manual review or automated security checks.
*   **Attacker Action:**  No direct action at this stage, as this is a consequence of the application's design.
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  A critical flaw in the application's architecture and development practices, where trust is implicitly placed in the output of `screenshot-to-code`.

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting inherent weaknesses or biases within the `screenshot-to-code` project's machine learning model or code generation logic to produce vulnerable code.
*   **Attacker Action:**  May involve reverse engineering the model or experimenting with different input screenshots to identify patterns that lead to insecure code.
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  Flaws in the design, training data, or implementation of the `screenshot-to-code` project itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes (Attack Vectors): Insufficient Sanitization of Generated Code Before Execution](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes__attack_vectors__insufficient_sanitization_of_generated_code_before_execution.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application attempts to sanitize the generated code but fails to adequately remove all malicious elements or bypasses.
*   **Attacker Action:**  Crafts screenshots or relies on model biases to generate code that bypasses the implemented sanitization measures.
*   **Exploited Vulnerability:**  Weaknesses or oversights in the sanitization logic implemented by the application developers.
