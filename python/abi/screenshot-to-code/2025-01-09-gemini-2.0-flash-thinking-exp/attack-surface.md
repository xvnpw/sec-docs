# Attack Surface Analysis for abi/screenshot-to-code

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Processing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_processing.md)

**Description:** The `screenshot-to-code` library processes user-provided image files. Attackers can upload specially crafted images designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image processing libraries.

**How screenshot-to-code contributes:** The core function of the library is to take an image as input and process it. This direct interaction with image data makes it vulnerable to flaws in image processing.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a TIFF file with a malformed tag that triggers a heap overflow in the image parsing library used by `screenshot-to-code`, leading to potential remote code execution.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input validation:**  Strictly validate image file formats and basic structure before processing.
* **Use secure and updated image processing libraries:**  Ensure the underlying image processing libraries are up-to-date with security patches. Consider memory-safe alternatives.
* **Sandboxing:** Isolate image processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `screenshot-to-code` library relies on other open-source libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited.

**How screenshot-to-code contributes:** By including these dependencies, the application directly inherits their potential security flaws.

**Example:** An older version of an OCR library used by `screenshot-to-code` has a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker provides a specific screenshot that triggers the vulnerable code path in the OCR library.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Dependency management:** Use a robust system to track and manage dependencies.
* **Regular dependency updates:** Keep all dependencies updated with the latest security patches.
* **Vulnerability scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools.
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA to monitor and manage dependency risks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Code Generation](./attack_surfaces/insecure_code_generation.md)

**Description:** The library generates code based on the screenshot analysis. Flaws in the generation logic can lead to insecure code.

**How screenshot-to-code contributes:** The fundamental purpose of the library is to generate code from visual input, making the security of this generated code a direct concern.

**Example:** The library generates HTML containing user-provided text from the screenshot without proper encoding, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability when the generated code is rendered.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to account compromise or further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Output sanitization/encoding:**  Sanitize and encode the generated code before use to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
* **Secure code generation practices:** Design the generation logic to avoid introducing common security flaws.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP if the generated code is used in a web context.

## Attack Surface: [Prompt Injection (If Applicable and User-Configurable)](./attack_surfaces/prompt_injection__if_applicable_and_user-configurable_.md)

**Description:** If the library allows user-provided prompts to guide code generation, malicious prompts can generate harmful code.

**How screenshot-to-code contributes:** By offering user-configurable prompts, the library directly allows users to influence the code generation process, creating a potential manipulation vector.

**Example:** A user provides a prompt that tricks the library into generating code that makes unauthorized API calls or exposes sensitive information.

**Impact:** Generation of malicious code, potentially leading to further attacks or data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input sanitization for prompts:**  Strictly sanitize and validate user-provided prompts.
* **Restrict prompt capabilities:** Limit the scope and power of user prompts.
* **Principle of least privilege:** Ensure the code generation process operates with minimal necessary permissions.
