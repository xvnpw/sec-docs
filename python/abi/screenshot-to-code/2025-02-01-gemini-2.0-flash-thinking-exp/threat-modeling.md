# Threat Model Analysis for abi/screenshot-to-code

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Generated Code](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_generated_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits the AI model's code generation to inject malicious JavaScript code into the generated output. This occurs when the screenshot depicts user input fields or dynamic content, and the AI fails to properly sanitize or encode these elements in the generated code. When a user interacts with an application using this generated code, the malicious script executes in their browser.
**Impact:** User account compromise, session hijacking, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, and malware distribution.
**Affected Component:** Code Generation Module, specifically the part responsible for handling user input and dynamic content recognition from screenshots.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Input Sanitization in Generated Code: Train the AI model to automatically include input sanitization and output encoding functions in the generated code, especially for user-provided data or elements derived from the screenshot that resemble user inputs.
* Security Audits of Generated Code: Implement automated and manual security code reviews of the generated code to identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities before deployment.
* Content Security Policy (CSP): If deploying the generated code as part of a web application, implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the sources of content the browser is allowed to load.
* Regular AI Model Updates: Continuously update and retrain the AI model with security best practices and vulnerability detection techniques to improve the security of generated code over time.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage via Screenshot Logging](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_via_screenshot_logging.md)

**Description:** The screenshot-to-code application logs or stores the uploaded screenshots for debugging, training, or other purposes. If these logs or storage are not properly secured, an attacker could gain unauthorized access and extract sensitive information inadvertently present in the screenshots, such as API keys, passwords, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, PII data breaches, privacy violations, reputational damage, and potential regulatory fines.
**Affected Component:** Screenshot Processing Pipeline, Logging and Storage Modules.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Data Minimization - Avoid Logging Screenshots: Minimize or eliminate the logging and storage of uploaded screenshots entirely if possible.
* Secure Logging Practices: If logging is necessary, implement secure logging practices, including access controls, encryption of logs at rest and in transit, and regular security audits of logging infrastructure.
* Data Sanitization and Redaction in Logs: If logging screenshot content (even processed), implement sanitization and redaction techniques to remove or mask potentially sensitive information before logging.
* Data Retention Policies: Implement strict data retention policies for logs and stored screenshots, automatically deleting data after a defined period.
