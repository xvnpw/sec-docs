### 5. Overall Impact and Effectiveness

The "User Awareness and Responsibility" mitigation strategy, when implemented effectively, can significantly contribute to reducing both **User-Introduced Vulnerabilities** and **Data Privacy Risks** associated with the `screenshot-to-code` application.

*   **User-Introduced Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity Mitigation):** By emphasizing code review and providing guidance, the strategy encourages users to be more cautious and proactive in identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in the generated code.  The impact is "Medium" because it relies on user behavior and expertise, and some users may still overlook vulnerabilities or lack the skills to effectively review code. However, it is a crucial layer of defense.
*   **Data Privacy Risks (Medium Severity Mitigation):**  Raising awareness about sensitive data in screenshots and outlining data handling practices can effectively reduce the risk of users inadvertently exposing confidential information. The impact is "Medium" because, again, it depends on user compliance.  Technical controls (like data sanitization, if feasible) would be needed for stronger mitigation, but user awareness is a vital first step.

**The strategy's effectiveness is heavily dependent on:**

*   **Clarity and Prominence of Warnings and Guidance:**  How well are the messages communicated to users? Are they easily noticeable and understandable?
*   **User Engagement and Compliance:**  Do users actually read and follow the warnings and guidance provided?
*   **Comprehensiveness of Education:**  Does the strategy adequately educate users about the specific security risks associated with screenshot-to-code conversion?

### 6. Currently Implemented vs. Missing Implementation
