# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for abi/screenshot-to-code

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Image Format Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_image_format_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Whitelist Allowed Formats:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed image file formats that the screenshot-to-code application will accept (e.g., `image/png`, `image/jpeg`).
    2.  **MIME Type Checking:**  On the server-side, verify the `Content-Type` header of the uploaded screenshot against the whitelist.
    3.  **Magic Number Verification:**  Implement "magic number" (file signature) verification to confirm the actual file type of the screenshot, regardless of the `Content-Type` header.
    4.  **Reject Invalid Files:** If the screenshot format is not whitelisted or magic number verification fails, reject the upload and provide an informative error message to the user.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from uploading files disguised as screenshots but containing malicious payloads that could exploit vulnerabilities during image processing or code generation.
    *   **Server-Side Image Processing Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of triggering vulnerabilities in image processing libraries by limiting the application to handle only expected and validated image formats from screenshots.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the attack surface related to malicious input through screenshots.
    *   **Server-Side Image Processing Vulnerabilities:** Medium risk reduction. Limits potential exploitation vectors related to unexpected image formats in screenshots.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially implemented in the screenshot upload handling component. Standard practice for applications processing user-uploaded files.
*   **Missing Implementation:** May be missing robust magic number verification or consistent server-side validation across all screenshot upload paths.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Image Size and Complexity Limits](./mitigation_strategies/image_size_and_complexity_limits.md)

    1.  **Define Limits:** Determine reasonable maximum limits for screenshot file size (e.g., 2MB) and dimensions (e.g., 2000x2000 pixels) based on the application's processing capabilities and expected use cases.
    2.  **Client-Side Validation (Optional):** Implement client-side JavaScript validation to provide immediate feedback to users if their screenshot exceeds the limits before upload.
    3.  **Server-Side Enforcement:**  Enforce these limits on the server-side during screenshot file upload processing. Reject uploads exceeding the defined limits.
    4.  **Resource Allocation:** Configure server resources (memory, CPU time) allocated to screenshot processing tasks to prevent resource exhaustion from processing overly large or complex screenshots.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from uploading extremely large or complex screenshots to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) during processing, leading to application slowdown or crash.
    *   **Billion Laughs Attack/XML External Entity (XXE) (Medium Severity - if using SVG screenshots or similar):** While less likely with common raster image formats, overly complex or maliciously crafted vector screenshots (like SVG) could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in image parsing libraries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the impact of resource exhaustion attacks initiated through manipulated screenshots.
    *   **Billion Laughs/XXE:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Less direct mitigation, but reduces the likelihood of triggering vulnerabilities through overly complex screenshot input.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially implemented in the screenshot upload handling and image processing components. Common practice for web applications handling user uploads.
*   **Missing Implementation:** May be missing fine-grained resource limits specifically for screenshot processing tasks or consistent enforcement across all screenshot processing paths.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for OCR and Image Analysis](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for_ocr_and_image_analysis.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Characters:** Define a list of characters that are potentially dangerous in the context of code generation from screenshots (e.g., HTML special characters `< > & " '`, code injection characters `; $ { } ( )`, shell command characters).
    2.  **Sanitization Functions:** Implement sanitization functions that escape or remove these sensitive characters from the text extracted from screenshots by OCR and image analysis processes. Use appropriate escaping functions for the target code generation language (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML code, SQL escaping for SQL code if applicable).
    3.  **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  If possible, perform context-aware sanitization based on the identified type of code being generated from the screenshot. For example, apply JavaScript-specific sanitization if generating JavaScript code.
    4.  **Regular Expression Filtering (Use with Caution):**  Use regular expressions to filter out potentially malicious patterns or code snippets from the OCR output of screenshots, but be cautious as overly aggressive filtering can break legitimate code extracted from screenshots.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** If the generated code from a screenshot is displayed or executed in a web browser without proper sanitization, malicious scripts extracted from the screenshot's text could be injected.
    *   **Code Injection (Medium to High Severity):** If the generated code from a screenshot is used in a backend system or database without sanitization, malicious code snippets from the screenshot could be injected into the application logic or database queries.
