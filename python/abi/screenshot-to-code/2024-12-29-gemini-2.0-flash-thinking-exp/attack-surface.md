*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Image Processing**
    *   **Description:** The application processes user-provided image files, which could be maliciously crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries.
    *   **How screenshot-to-code contributes:** `screenshot-to-code` takes an image as input and relies on underlying libraries to decode and process it. Vulnerabilities in these libraries are exposed through the library's usage.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG file that triggers a buffer overflow in the image decoding library used by `screenshot-to-code`, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation on the server-side *before* passing the image to `screenshot-to-code`. This includes checking file types, sizes, and potentially using dedicated image sanitization libraries.
        *   Keep the `screenshot-to-code` library and its dependencies (especially image processing libraries) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider running image processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

*   **Attack Surface: Code Injection via Malicious Image Content**
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the content of the screenshot to influence the generated code in a way that introduces vulnerabilities.
    *   **How screenshot-to-code contributes:** The core function of `screenshot-to-code` is to interpret visual elements in an image and translate them into code. If the image is manipulated, the generated code can be malicious.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a screenshot of a login form where the "Submit" button text is subtly altered to generate JavaScript code that exfiltrates user credentials when the generated form is used.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), data exfiltration, unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict output sanitization and encoding on the generated code before displaying or executing it. Context-aware escaping is crucial.
        *   Educate users about the risks of using generated code without careful review.
        *   Implement a manual review process for generated code before deployment or execution in sensitive contexts.
        *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of injected scripts.

*   **Attack Surface: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Generated Code**
    *   **Description:** Screenshots might inadvertently contain sensitive information that is then included in the generated code.
    *   **How screenshot-to-code contributes:** The library blindly translates visual elements into code. If sensitive data is visually present in the screenshot, it will likely be included in the output.
    *   **Example:** A developer takes a screenshot of a configuration file containing API keys and uses `screenshot-to-code`. The generated code inadvertently includes these API keys, making them potentially accessible.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Educate users about the risks of including sensitive information in screenshots used with `screenshot-to-code`.
        *   Implement mechanisms to detect and redact potentially sensitive information from screenshots before processing.
        *   Thoroughly review the generated code for any accidental inclusion of sensitive data before deployment.
