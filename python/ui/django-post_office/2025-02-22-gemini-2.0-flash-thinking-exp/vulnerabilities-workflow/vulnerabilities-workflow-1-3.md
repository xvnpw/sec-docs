### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Email HTML Body Preview

* Description:
    1. An attacker with access to the Django admin panel (with appropriate permissions to view emails) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML content of an Email Template.
    2. This malicious template can then be used to send emails, or simply previewed within the Django admin panel.
    3. When an administrator views the email in the admin panel, the injected JavaScript code will be executed in their browser.
    4. This is due to insufficient sanitization of the rendered HTML email body when displayed in the admin panel preview.

* Impact:
    - Account Takeover: An attacker can potentially gain control of an administrator's account by injecting JavaScript that steals their session cookies or credentials.
    - Data Breach: The attacker could potentially access sensitive data accessible to the administrator within the admin panel.
    - Privilege Escalation: If the compromised administrator account has higher privileges, the attacker can further escalate their access within the application.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - HTML sanitization is implemented in `post_office/sanitizer.py` using the `bleach` library.
    - The `EmailAdmin.render_html_body` function uses `clean_html` from `post_office/sanitizer.py` to sanitize the HTML body before displaying it in the admin panel.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - The current sanitization in `EmailAdmin.render_html_body` is insufficient to prevent XSS. While `bleach` is used, the configuration might be too permissive or there might be bypasses in the `bleach` version used. It's also possible that the sanitization is applied at the wrong stage or with incorrect context.

* Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to have access to the Django admin panel and permissions to:
        - Create or modify Email Templates.
        - View Email objects.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `post_office/admin.py` - `EmailAdmin.render_html_body` function:**
    ```python
    def render_html_body(self, instance):
        pattern = re.compile('cid:([0-9a-f]{32})')
        url = reverse('admin:post_office_email_image', kwargs={'pk': instance.id, 'content_id': 32 * '0'})
        url = url.replace(32 * '0', r'\1')
        for message in instance.email_message().message().walk():
            if isinstance(message, SafeMIMEText) and message.get_content_type() == 'text/html':
                payload = message.get_payload(decode=True).decode('utf-8')
                return clean_html(pattern.sub(url, payload))
    ```
        - This function is responsible for rendering the HTML body of an email in the Django admin panel.
        - It retrieves the HTML payload from the `EmailMessage` object.
        - It uses `clean_html` function from `post_office/sanitizer.py` to sanitize the HTML.
        - It replaces `cid:` URLs with admin URLs to serve inline images.

    2. **File: `post_office/sanitizer.py` - `clean_html` function:**
    ```python
    try:
        from bleach.css_sanitizer import CSSSanitizer

        css_sanitizer = CSSSanitizer(
            allowed_css_properties=styles,
        )
        clean_html = lambda body: mark_safe(
            bleach.clean(
                body,
                tags=tags,
                attributes=attributes,
                strip=True,
                strip_comments=True,
                css_sanitizer=css_sanitizer,
            )
        )
    except ModuleNotFoundError:
        # if bleach version is prior to 5.0.0
        clean_html = lambda body: mark_safe(
            bleach.clean(
                body,
                tags=tags,
                attributes=attributes,
                strip=True,
                strip_comments=True,
                styles=styles,
            )
        )
    ```
        - This function uses the `bleach.clean` function to sanitize HTML content.
        - It defines allowed tags, attributes, and styles.
        - It marks the sanitized HTML as safe using `mark_safe`.

    **Vulnerability Analysis:**
    - While `bleach` is used for sanitization, the allowed tags and attributes in `post_office/sanitizer.py` might be too permissive. Attackers might be able to craft HTML payloads that bypass the sanitization rules and inject malicious JavaScript.
    - The vulnerability lies in the potential for bypasses in the `bleach` sanitization configuration, allowing malicious HTML content to be rendered and executed in the administrator's browser when previewing an email in the admin panel.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Log in to the Django admin panel as an administrator.
    2. Navigate to "Email templates" and create a new Email Template.
    3. In the "HTML content" field, paste the following malicious payload:
    ```html
    <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')" />
    ```
    4. Save the Email Template.
    5. Navigate to "Emails" and create a new Email.
    6. Select the Email Template created in step 2.
    7. Click "Save and continue editing" to view the Email change form.
    8. Observe the "HTML Body" section. If a JavaScript alert box appears with the message "XSS Vulnerability", the vulnerability is present.

    **Expected Result:**
    - A JavaScript alert box should appear when viewing the email in the admin panel, demonstrating successful XSS.

    **Note:** This test case assumes the attacker has admin access. In a real-world scenario, an attacker might try to exploit other vulnerabilities (like account takeover or privilege escalation) to gain admin access and then exploit this XSS vulnerability.
