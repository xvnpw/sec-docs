## Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability 1: Insufficient HTML Sanitization in Email Templates leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* Description:
    1. An attacker with access to create or modify Email Templates (e.g., if admin account is compromised or through another vulnerability) can inject malicious HTML code within the `html_content` of an Email Template.
    2. When an email is sent using this template, the `html_content` is rendered and sanitized using `bleach` library with a predefined set of allowed tags, attributes, and styles in `post_office/sanitizer.py`.
    3. If the allowed tags, attributes, and styles are not restrictive enough, an attacker can craft a malicious HTML payload that bypasses the sanitization and injects JavaScript code.
    4. When a recipient opens the email in their email client that renders HTML, the injected JavaScript code will be executed, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

* Impact:
    * **High**. Successful XSS can lead to various malicious activities:
        * **Data theft**: Attacker can steal recipient's cookies, session tokens, and potentially sensitive information displayed in the email client if it's web-based.
        * **Account takeover**: In some scenarios, XSS can be used to perform actions on behalf of the recipient, potentially leading to account takeover if the email client is integrated with other web services.
        * **Malware distribution**: Attacker could redirect the recipient to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware.
        * **Reputation damage**: Sending emails containing malicious content can damage the sender's reputation and lead to blacklisting.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * HTML content of email templates is sanitized using the `bleach` library in `post_office/sanitizer.py` before being displayed in the Django admin interface.
    * The `clean_html` function in `post_office/sanitizer.py` defines allowed tags, attributes, and styles for sanitization. This sanitization is applied when rendering the email body in the Django admin panel.

* Missing mitigations:
    * **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implementing a strict CSP header for the Django admin interface could help mitigate the impact of XSS if an attacker manages to inject malicious code that gets executed within the admin panel itself. However, this is not directly related to email sending vulnerability but general admin security.
    * **More restrictive sanitization rules**: The current set of allowed tags, attributes, and styles in `post_office/sanitizer.py` might be too permissive. A security review of these rules is needed to identify and remove potentially dangerous elements that could be exploited for XSS. For example, allowing `<a>` tags with `target` attribute might be risky. Allowing `style` attribute on many tags could also be problematic if not very carefully filtered.
    * **HTML Sanitization during email sending**: The code review suggests that HTML sanitization is only performed when rendering the email for preview in the admin panel, not during the actual email sending process. Sanitization should be applied right before sending the email to ensure recipients are protected from potentially malicious HTML.
    * **Security Test Cases**: There are no specific test cases in the provided `test_mail.py` that verify the effectiveness of HTML sanitization or ensure that XSS is prevented in emails. Security test cases should be added to cover XSS scenarios in email templates.

* Preconditions:
    * Attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify Email Templates. This could be achieved by compromising an admin account or exploiting another vulnerability that allows template modification.
    * Recipient's email client must be HTML-enabled and vulnerable to XSS. Most modern email clients render HTML emails by default.

* Source code analysis:
    * **`post_office/sanitizer.py`**:
        ```python
        try:
            import bleach
        except ImportError:
            # if bleach is not installed, render HTML as escaped text to prevent XSS attacks
            heading = gettext_lazy("Install 'bleach' to render HTML properly.")
            clean_html = lambda body: format_html('<p><em>{heading}</em></p>\n<div>{body}</div>', heading=heading, body=body)
        else:
            # ... (allowed tags, attributes, styles are defined here) ...
            try:
                from bleach.css_sanitizer import CSSSanitizer
                # ... (CSSSanitizer is used if available) ...
                clean_html = lambda body: mark_safe(
                    bleach.clean(
                        body,
                        tags=tags,
                        attributes=attributes,
                        strip=True,
                        strip_comments=True,
                        css_sanitizer=css_sanitizer,
                    )
                )
            except ModuleNotFoundError:
                # if bleach version is prior to 5.0.0
                clean_html = lambda body: mark_safe(
                    bleach.clean(
                        body,
                        tags=tags,
                        attributes=attributes,
                        strip=True,
                        strip_comments=True,
                        styles=styles,
                    )
                )
        ```
        This code snippet confirms that `bleach` is used for sanitization with a defined set of allowed tags, attributes and styles. The security of this sanitization depends on how restrictive these rules are.

    * **`post_office/admin.py`**:
        ```python
        class EmailAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
            # ...
            def render_html_body(self, instance):
                pattern = re.compile('cid:([0-9a-f]{32})')
                url = reverse('admin:post_office_email_image', kwargs={'pk': instance.id, 'content_id': 32 * '0'})
                url = url.replace(32 * '0', r'\1')
                for message in instance.email_message().message().walk():
                    if isinstance(message, SafeMIMEText) and message.get_content_type() == 'text/html':
                        payload = message.get_payload(decode=True).decode('utf-8')
                        return clean_html(pattern.sub(url, payload))
            # ...
        ```
        The `render_html_body` function in `EmailAdmin` uses `clean_html` to sanitize HTML content before displaying it in the admin panel.

    * **`post_office/mail.py` and `post_office/models.py`**:
        Further review of `post_office/mail.py`, `post_office/models.py` and the provided `test_mail.py` files does not reveal any explicit sanitization of the `html_message` content before sending emails. The tests in `test_mail.py` also do not include any test cases related to HTML sanitization or XSS prevention. This reinforces the conclusion that sanitization might be missing in the email sending pipeline.

        **Visualization:**

        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            A[Email Template Creation/Modification (Admin Panel)] --> B{Email Template Database};
            B --> C[Email Sending Process (mail.send)];
            C --> D{Email Object Creation};
            D --> E[Email Dispatch (email.dispatch)];
            E --> F{Email Message Preparation (email_message)};
            F --> G{Django Email Backend (EmailMultiAlternatives)};
            G --> H[Recipient Email Client];
            B --> I[Admin Panel - Email Preview (render_html_body in EmailAdmin)];
            I --> J{HTML Sanitization (clean_html in sanitizer.py)};
            J --> K[Admin Display];
            style J fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
            style K fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
            style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
            style H fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        ```
        The visualization confirms that `clean_html` is used for Admin display (I->J->K), but it's not evident in the email sending path (C->D->E->F->G->H).

* Security test case:
    1. Log in to the Django admin panel as a superuser.
    2. Navigate to "Post Office" -> "Email Templates".
    3. Create a new Email Template with:
        * Name: `xss_test_template`
        * Subject: `XSS Test`
        * Content: `This is a plain text email.`
        * HTML content: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS Vulnerability!')>`
    4. Save the Email Template.
    5. Go to "Post Office" -> "Emails".
    6. Click "Add Email".
    7. Fill in the form:
        * To: `test_recipient@example.com`
        * From email: `test_sender@example.com`
        * Template: Select `xss_test_template`
    8. Save the Email.
    9. Run the management command `python manage.py send_queued_mail`.
    10. Check the inbox of `test_recipient@example.com`.
    11. Open the received email in an HTML-enabled email client.
    12. Observe if an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability!" is displayed when the email is opened. If the alert box appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.
