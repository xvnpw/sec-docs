## High and Critical JAX-Specific Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected JAX Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Code Injection via JIT Compilation** | An attacker crafts input that, when processed, influences the code being Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled by JAX. This could involve manipulating shapes, data types, or even injecting code snippets if the application dynamically constructs JAX functions based on user input. The attacker aims to execute arbitrary code within the JAX process. | **Critical:** Full control over the JAX process, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. | `jax.jit` (module) | **High** | - **Strict Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs that could influence JAX computations, especially shapes, data types, and function arguments. - **Avoid Dynamic Code Generation:** Minimize or eliminate the use of dynamic code generation that directly feeds into JAX compilation. If necessary, use safe and well-tested code generation libraries. - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the JAX process with the minimum necessary permissions. - **Static Analysis:** Employ static analysis tools to identify potential code injection vulnerabilities in code that constructs JAX functions. |
| **Deserialization of Untrusted JAX Objects** | An attacker provides a maliciously crafted serialized JAX object (e.g., using `jax.numpy.save` or libraries like Flax's serialization) that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code or causes other harmful effects. This is similar to pickle vulnerabilities in Python. | **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or client deserializing the object. | `jax.numpy.save`, `jax.numpy.load`, `flax.serialization` (modules/functions) | **High** | - **Only Deserialize Trusted Data:** Only load serialized data from trusted sources. - **Use Secure Serialization Formats:** Consider using safer serialization formats than pickle if possible, or implement robust validation of the loaded data. - **Input Validation:** Validate the structure and content of deserialized data before using it. - **Sandboxing:** If possible, deserialize untrusted data in a sandboxed environment. |
| **Vulnerabilities in Custom Operations** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution) within custom operations defined using `jax.custom_vjp`, `jax.custom_jvp`, or `jax.pure_callback`. This is particularly relevant if these custom operations interact with external libraries or systems. | **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data corruption depending on the vulnerability. | `jax.custom_vjp`, `jax.custom_jvp`, `jax.pure_callback` (functions) | **High** | - **Secure Coding Practices:** Apply secure coding practices when implementing custom operations, including thorough input validation, bounds checking, and memory management. - **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom operations, paying close attention to potential security vulnerabilities. - **Sandboxing:** If possible, sandbox the execution of custom operations to limit their access to system resources. - **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in custom operation code. |
