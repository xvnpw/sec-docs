**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Exploit Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends malicious data within a WebSocket message to the server. If the server-side application does not properly validate or sanitize this input, it can lead to various vulnerabilities.
    * **Examples:**
        * Injecting JavaScript code that is then executed in the client's browser (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
        * Injecting commands or data that are processed by the server-side application without proper sanitization, potentially leading to data manipulation, unauthorized access, or even remote code execution depending on how the data is used.

* **Exploit Header Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates user-provided input that is directly used to construct HTTP headers in the server's response. By injecting specific characters and newlines, the attacker can insert arbitrary headers into the response.
    * **Examples:**
        * **HTTP Response Splitting:** Injecting headers to create a second, malicious HTTP response within the original response. This can be used for cache poisoning, cross-site scripting (by injecting `Content-Type` and malicious script), or bypassing security controls.
        * **Setting Malicious Cookies:** Injecting `Set-Cookie` headers to set arbitrary cookies in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other attacks.
        * **Redirecting Users:** Injecting `Location` headers to redirect users to malicious websites.

* **Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious code into template directives or expressions that are processed by the server-side template engine. If user-provided data is not properly escaped before being rendered in the template, the template engine will execute the injected code on the server.
    * **Examples:**
        * Injecting code snippets that allow the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
        * Injecting code to read sensitive files from the server's file system.
        * Injecting code to establish a reverse shell, granting the attacker persistent access to the server.

* **Exploit Resource Exhaustion via WebSocket Connections:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker establishes a large number of WebSocket connections to the server, consuming server resources such as memory, file descriptors, and processing power.
    * **Examples:**
        * Opening numerous connections from a single IP address.
        * Distributing the connection attempts across multiple IP addresses (Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS).
        * Sending large amounts of data over the established connections to further strain server resources.
    * **Consequences:** This can lead to the server becoming unresponsive, crashing, or being unable to handle legitimate user requests, resulting in a denial of service.

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages:** (See detailed breakdown above under High-Risk Paths)

* **Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** (See detailed breakdown above under High-Risk Paths)

* **Exploit Debug Mode Enabled in Production:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The Tornado application is running with the debug mode enabled in a production environment. This exposes sensitive information through error pages and potentially allows for interactive debugging.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Information Disclosure:** Error pages reveal stack traces, internal file paths, and potentially sensitive variable values, aiding attackers in understanding the application's internals and identifying further vulnerabilities.
        * **Interactive Debugging:** In some cases, debug mode might allow for interactive debugging sessions, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server if they can trigger specific conditions.

* **Exploit Insecure Cookie Settings:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application's cookies are not configured with appropriate security flags.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Missing `HttpOnly` flag:** Allows client-side JavaScript to access the cookie, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks where an attacker can steal the cookie and hijack the user's session.
        * **Missing `Secure` flag:** The cookie is transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, making it vulnerable to interception by attackers performing Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
        * **Improper `SameSite` attribute:**  Can make the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks if not configured correctly.

* **Exploit Resource Exhaustion via WebSocket Connections:** (See detailed breakdown above under High-Risk Paths)
