## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no new high-rank vulnerabilities were identified that are exploitable by an external attacker and are not already mitigated.

It is noted in `CHANGELOG.md` version 1.8.0: "- #263 Fix vunerability in views". This indicates that a vulnerability existed in previous versions and has been addressed. However, without the specific details of vulnerability #263 and the code changes associated with its fix, and based on static analysis of the current code, no new high-rank vulnerabilities are apparent in the provided files.

Therefore, based on the current project files and the constraints provided, there are no vulnerabilities to report that meet the criteria (high rank, unmitigated, introduced by project, exploitable by external attacker, not DoS, not due to insecure usage by developers, not missing documentation).

It is recommended to perform a more in-depth security audit, including dynamic analysis and review of commit history related to vulnerability fix #263, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the project's security posture.
