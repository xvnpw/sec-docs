# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for misp/misp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/data_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define expected data types and formats for each MISP attribute your application consumes from MISP (e.g., IP addresses, domains, hashes, strings).
    2.  Implement validation routines in your application code to check all incoming MISP data against these defined types and formats *before* using it.
    3.  For string data, especially free-text fields like descriptions or comments from MISP events, apply sanitization techniques. This includes:
        *   Encoding special characters to prevent injection attacks (e.g., HTML encoding, URL encoding).
        *   Removing or escaping potentially harmful code or markup (e.g., stripping HTML tags if not expected).
    4.  Log any validation failures or sanitization actions for monitoring and debugging purposes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Prevents various injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) if unsanitized MISP data is directly used in queries or displayed in the application.
    *   Application Errors and Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of application crashes or malfunctions due to unexpected data formats or invalid data from MISP.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction.
    *   Application Errors and Unexpected Behavior: Medium risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the log ingestion module. Basic type validation is performed for IP addresses and hashes.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Sanitization of free-text fields from MISP events is not implemented in the alert generation module. Validation for all consumed MISP attributes (e.g., domains, URLs) is also missing in the reporting dashboard.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize MISP Data Confidence Levels](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_misp_data_confidence_levels.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When querying MISP, retrieve the `confidence` attribute associated with each event or attribute.
    2.  Configure your application with a configurable confidence threshold. This threshold determines the minimum confidence level required for your application to act upon a piece of MISP data.
    3.  Filter or prioritize MISP data based on this confidence level. For example, only trigger automated actions (like blocking an IP) for indicators with "high" confidence. Use "medium" or "low" confidence data for informational purposes or manual review.
    4.  Allow users to adjust the confidence threshold based on their risk tolerance and operational needs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   False Positives and Erroneous Actions (Medium Severity): Reduces the likelihood of taking incorrect actions (e.g., blocking legitimate traffic) based on inaccurate or unverified threat intelligence from MISP.
    *   Operational Disruption (Medium Severity): Minimizes disruptions caused by acting on false positives, which can lead to unnecessary investigations and system downtime.
*   **Impact:**
    *   False Positives and Erroneous Actions: Medium risk reduction.
    *   Operational Disruption: Medium risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Confidence levels are retrieved from MISP, but the application currently acts on all indicators regardless of confidence.

        *   Historical accuracy of data from each source (track false positive rates).
        *   Source type (e.g., trusted ISAC, open-source feed, commercial vendor).
    3.  Prioritize data from sources with higher reputation scores. You can assign weights to data based on source reputation when making decisions.
    4.  Regularly review and update source reputations based on ongoing performance and feedback. Consider removing or de-prioritizing sources that consistently provide low-quality or inaccurate data.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Ingestion of Inaccurate or Malicious Data (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of relying on unreliable threat intelligence that could lead to false positives or even intentionally misleading information.

        *   The attribute UUID or ID within the event.
        *   The source organization or user who contributed the data in MISP (if available and relevant).
    2.  Store this provenance information alongside the MISP data in your application's database or logs.
    3.  Make this provenance information accessible to users and analysts within your application's interface.
    4.  Use provenance data for:
        *   Investigating the origin and context of threat intelligence.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Anonymization and Pseudonymization](./mitigation_strategies/anonymization_and_pseudonymization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify any potentially sensitive data within the MISP data you consume (e.g., IP addresses that might be considered PII in certain contexts, email addresses, usernames).
    2.  Determine if this sensitive data is absolutely necessary for your application's core functionality.
    3.  If possible, anonymize or pseudonymize this data *before* storing or using it within your application, especially for logging, reporting, or analytics purposes.
        *   **Anonymization:** Irreversibly remove identifying information so that the data can no longer be linked to an individual.
        *   **Pseudonymization:** Replace identifying information with pseudonyms or tokens, which can be reversed under specific controlled conditions (e.g., for security investigations).
    4.  Document the anonymization or pseudonymization techniques used and ensure they are compliant with relevant privacy regulations.
