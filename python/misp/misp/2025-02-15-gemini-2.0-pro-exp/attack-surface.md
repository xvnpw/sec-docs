# Attack Surface Analysis for misp/misp

## Attack Surface: [1. API Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/1__api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to MISP functionality through compromised API keys.
    *   **MISP Contribution:** MISP relies heavily on API keys for programmatic access and automation. This is a core design element, making key management *inherently* a MISP-specific concern.
    *   **Example:** An attacker obtains an API key from a poorly secured configuration file or a compromised developer workstation.
    *   **Impact:** Full read/write/delete access to the MISP instance, including all threat intelligence data. Potential for data exfiltration, data poisoning, and disruption of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Provide clear documentation and examples on secure API key management.
            *   Implement robust API key validation and error handling.
            *   Consider supporting alternative authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
        *   **Users:**
            *   Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
            *   Implement strict key rotation policies (e.g., every 90 days, or more frequently).
            *   Use least-privilege API keys (create keys with only the necessary permissions).
            *   Never hardcode API keys in code or configuration files.
            *   Monitor API key usage for anomalies.
            *   Implement IP whitelisting for API access.
            *   Use MFA for accounts that can manage API keys.

## Attack Surface: [2. Data Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/2__data_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** Introduction of false or malicious data into the MISP instance, corrupting the threat intelligence database.
    *   **MISP Contribution:** MISP's *primary function* is to aggregate and share threat intelligence.  This inherent purpose makes it a target for data poisoning, and the mechanisms for data ingestion and sharing are MISP-specific.
    *   **Example:** An attacker submits a crafted event with false indicators of compromise (IOCs) that trigger false positives in security tools.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect security decisions, wasted resources investigating false positives, potential for missed detections of real threats.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data submitted to MISP.
            *   Enhance MISP's built-in data validation features (warning lists, correlation rules).
            *   Provide mechanisms for users to report and flag suspicious data.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Establish trust levels for different data sources and users.
            *   Implement a review process for new data submissions, especially from untrusted sources.
            *   Use MISP's sighting feature to track the reliability of information.
            *   Regularly audit the data in the MISP instance for anomalies.
            *   Use multiple, independent sources of threat intelligence to cross-validate information.

## Attack Surface: [3. Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/3__misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or insecure configuration of the MISP instance, leading to exposed services or weakened security controls.
    *   **MISP Contribution:** MISP's extensive configuration options, *specific to its functionality*, create a significant risk if not properly managed.  This is not a general web application issue, but tied to MISP's features.
    *   **Example:** Exposing the MISP web interface or API to the public internet without proper authentication or firewall rules. Using default passwords for MISP's administrative interface or connected services (like Redis).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the MISP instance, data exfiltration, data tampering, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Provide clear and comprehensive documentation on secure configuration.
            *   Implement secure defaults where possible.
            *   Include security checks and warnings in the MISP interface for common misconfigurations.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Follow MISP's security best practices and hardening guides.
            *   Regularly review and audit the MISP configuration.
            *   Use configuration management tools to automate and enforce secure configurations.
            *   Restrict access to the MISP server itself (e.g., using SSH key authentication, limiting access to specific users).
            *   Change default passwords immediately after installation.
            *   Use a reverse proxy with appropriate security configurations.

## Attack Surface: [4. Redis Exposure](./attack_surfaces/4__redis_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Redis instance used by MISP.
    *   **MISP Contribution:** MISP *specifically* uses Redis for caching and message queuing, making the security of *this particular Redis instance* a MISP-specific concern.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans for open Redis ports and connects to a MISP instance's Redis server that is exposed to the internet without a password.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration (cached data, potentially including API keys or session tokens), potential for remote code execution (depending on Redis configuration and vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Provide clear documentation on securing Redis in a MISP deployment.
            *   Consider implementing automatic Redis security checks during MISP installation and startup.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Bind Redis to localhost or a trusted internal network interface.  Do *not* expose it to the public internet.
            *   Set a strong password for Redis using the `requirepass` directive.
            *   Consider using TLS encryption for Redis communication.
            *   Regularly monitor Redis logs for suspicious activity.
            *   Rename dangerous commands.
