# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for misp/misp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict MISP Input Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/strict_misp_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Comprehensive Input Validation and Sanitization within MISP.

**Description:**
1.  **Leverage MISP Object Templates:** Use MISP's built-in object templates and attribute type definitions as the basis for validation.  Ensure all custom objects and attributes also have clearly defined templates.
2.  **MISP Validation Libraries:** Utilize MISP's provided validation libraries (e.g., in `app/Lib/Tools/`) for common data types (UUIDs, timestamps, etc.) and MISP-specific structures.
3.  **Custom Validation Logic (MISP Context):**  For complex validation rules not covered by built-in libraries, write custom validation logic *within MISP's framework* (e.g., as model callbacks or controller logic). This ensures validation is consistently applied across all input methods (UI, API, sync).
4.  **Taxonomy and Galaxy Validation:**  Implement strict validation against defined taxonomies and galaxies.  Reject any values not present in the configured, trusted sets.  This is done *within MISP's taxonomy and galaxy management features*.
5.  **MISP-Specific Sanitization:**  Use MISP's built-in sanitization functions (where available) to handle potentially dangerous content within attributes (e.g., comments).  Ensure this sanitization is applied consistently across all relevant fields.
6.  **Reject, Don't Fix:**  If validation fails, reject the entire input (event, attribute, etc.) within MISP.  Do not attempt to automatically correct invalid data.
7.  **MISP Logging:**  Utilize MISP's logging system to record all validation failures, including the specific input, the reason for failure, and the source (user, API key, server).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Poisoning (Severity: High):** Prevents injection of false or malicious data into the MISP database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Sanitization within MISP prevents stored XSS attacks.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Reduces RCE risk by validating and sanitizing input within MISP's processing logic.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Validating input structure and size within MISP can prevent some DoS attacks.

**Impact:** (Same as before, but focused on MISP's internal handling)
*   **Data Poisoning:** Significantly reduces successful data poisoning.
*   **XSS:** Virtually eliminates stored XSS within MISP.
*   **RCE:** Reduces the attack surface for RCE within MISP.
*   **DoS:** Mitigates some DoS attacks targeting MISP's input processing.

**Currently Implemented:** [e.g., "Implemented in `app/Model/Event.php` and `app/Controller/EventsController.php` for basic event fields.  Taxonomy validation is partially implemented."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "Comprehensive validation for all MISP object types is incomplete.  Consistent sanitization across all relevant fields is missing."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [MISP API Key Management and Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/misp_api_key_management_and_permissions.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Robust API Key Management and Granular Permissions *within MISP*.

**Description:**
1.  **MISP Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Utilize MISP's built-in RBAC system to create different user roles with specific permissions.  Assign API keys to these roles, granting only the minimum necessary access.
2.  **API Key Permissions:**  Leverage MISP's fine-grained API key permissions (e.g., `read-only`, `publish_event`, `admin`) to restrict the actions each key can perform.
3.  **MISP Admin Interface:**  Use the MISP admin interface to manage API keys, including creation, revocation, and permission assignment.
4.  **MISP Audit Logs:**  Enable and regularly review MISP's audit logs to monitor API key usage and detect suspicious activity.  This is done *within MISP's logging configuration*.
5.  **No Hardcoded Keys:** Absolutely prohibit hardcoding API keys within any scripts or integrations that interact with MISP.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized access via compromised API keys.
*   **Data Breach (Severity: Critical):** Limits the scope of a breach if a key is compromised.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized data changes.
*   **API Abuse (Severity: Medium):**  Reduces the potential for API misuse.

**Impact:** (Same as before, focused on MISP's internal controls)
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces unauthorized access risk.
*   **Data Breach:** Minimizes the impact of a compromised API key.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Prevents unauthorized data manipulation.
*   **API Abuse:**  Limits the scope of API abuse.

**Currently Implemented:** [e.g., "Basic RBAC is used for UI users, but API key permissions are not fully utilized."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "Fine-grained API key permissions are not consistently applied.  Regular review of API key usage logs is not performed."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [MISP Rate Limiting (Using MISP's Built-in Features)](./mitigation_strategies/misp_rate_limiting__using_misp's_built-in_features_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Configure and Utilize MISP's Built-in Rate Limiting.

**Description:**
1. **`Security.max_requests`:** Configure the `Security.max_requests` setting in MISP's `app/Config/config.php` to limit the number of requests per user/IP address within a defined time window.
2. **`Security.time_unit`:** Set the `Security.time_unit` setting (also in `config.php`) to define the time window for rate limiting (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours).
3. **`Security.limit_login_attempts`:** Enable and configure `Security.limit_login_attempts` to limit failed login attempts, mitigating brute-force attacks against user accounts.
4. **`Security.login_attempt_time_unit`:** Set the time unit for login attempt limiting.
5. **`Security.login_attempt_limit`:** Set the maximum number of allowed failed login attempts.
6. **Monitor MISP Logs:** Regularly review MISP's logs for entries related to rate limiting (e.g., "Too many requests") to identify potential abuse and fine-tune the settings.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Helps prevent basic DoS attacks by limiting request rates.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium):**  Mitigates brute-force attacks against user accounts and API keys.
*   **API Abuse (Severity: Medium):**  Limits the ability of attackers to abuse the API.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Reduces the risk of simple DoS attacks.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Increases the difficulty of brute-force attacks.
*   **API Abuse:**  Provides a basic level of protection against API abuse.

**Currently Implemented:** [e.g., "Default `Security.max_requests` setting is enabled, but not customized."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "`Security.limit_login_attempts` is not enabled.  Rate limiting settings are not regularly reviewed or adjusted."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [MISP Source Trust Levels (Using MISP's Features)](./mitigation_strategies/misp_source_trust_levels__using_misp's_features_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Utilize MISP's Organization and Sharing Group features to manage trust and control data sharing.

**Description:**
1.  **Organization Management:**  Use MISP's "Organizations" feature to define and manage known organizations, both internal and external.
2.  **Sharing Groups:**  Create and manage "Sharing Groups" within MISP to control which organizations can access specific events and data.  Use sharing groups for sensitive data or data shared with specific partners.
3.  **Distribution Levels:**  Consistently use MISP's distribution levels (0-4) when creating and sharing events:
    *   0: Your organization only.
    *   1: This community only.
    *   2: Connected communities.
    *   3: All communities (use with extreme caution).
    *   4: Sharing group (use for controlled sharing).
4.  **Synchronization Settings:**  When configuring synchronization with other MISP instances, carefully define which organizations and distribution levels to accept.  *Do not* automatically accept all data from all connected instances.
5.  **User Training:**  Train MISP users on the proper use of organizations, sharing groups, and distribution levels.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Poisoning (Severity: High):**  Reduces the risk of accepting data from untrusted sources.
*   **Data Leakage (Severity: High):**  Prevents unintentional sharing of sensitive data.
*   **Misinformation (Severity: Medium):**  Helps control the flow of information and prioritize trusted sources.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Poisoning:**  Limits the impact of data poisoning by controlling data sources.
*   **Data Leakage:**  Significantly reduces the risk of accidental data disclosure.
*   **Misinformation:**  Improves the reliability of information within MISP.

**Currently Implemented:** [e.g., "Organizations are defined, but sharing groups are not widely used.  Distribution levels are not consistently applied."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "A formal policy for using sharing groups and distribution levels is missing.  Synchronization settings are not configured to restrict data sources."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [MISP Data Provenance (Using MISP's Audit Logs)](./mitigation_strategies/misp_data_provenance__using_misp's_audit_logs_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Enable and Regularly Review MISP's Audit Logs.

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Audit Logs:**  Ensure that MISP's audit logging is enabled in the `app/Config/config.php` file (`'Config.audit_logs'` should be set to `true`).
2.  **Log Level:**  Set an appropriate log level to capture sufficient detail (e.g., `INFO` or `DEBUG`).
3.  **Log Rotation:**  Configure log rotation within MISP or at the operating system level to prevent log files from growing excessively large.
4.  **Regular Review:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing MISP's audit logs.  This could involve:
    *   Manual review by security personnel.
    *   Automated analysis using log management tools.
    *   Integration with a SIEM system.
5.  **Search and Filtering:**  Utilize MISP's built-in log searching capabilities (or external tools) to efficiently analyze log data.
6.  **Alerting:** Configure alerts for suspicious log entries, such as failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, or data modifications from unexpected sources.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Poisoning (Severity: High):**  Helps trace the origin of poisoned data.
*   **Insider Threats (Severity: Medium):**  Provides an audit trail of user activity.
*   **Non-Repudiation (Severity: Medium):**  Provides evidence of user actions.
* **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Detect failed login attempts.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Poisoning:**  Facilitates investigation and response to data poisoning.
*   **Insider Threats:**  Deters insider threats and aids in investigations.
*   **Non-Repudiation:**  Improves accountability.
*  **Unauthorized Access:** Detect the attempts of unauthorized access.

**Currently Implemented:** [e.g., "Audit logs are enabled, but not regularly reviewed."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "A formal process for reviewing and analyzing audit logs is missing.  Alerting for suspicious log entries is not configured."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [MISP Resource Limits (Using MISP's Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/misp_resource_limits__using_misp's_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure MISP's built-in resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

**Description:**
1.  **`Event.attribute_count_limit`:** Set a limit on the number of attributes per event in `app/Config/config.php`.
2.  **`Event.max_size`:**  Limit the overall size of an event (in bytes) in `config.php`.
3.  **`Event.max_objects`:** Limit the number of objects within an event in `config.php`.
4.  **`Object.max_attributes`:** Limit the number of attributes within an object in `config.php`.
5.  **`Object.max_depth`:** Limit the nesting depth of objects in `config.php`.
6.  **`Galaxy.max_elements`:** Limit the number of elements within a galaxy cluster in `config.php`.
7. **Job Queue Configuration (Redis):** If using Redis for the job queue, configure appropriate limits within the Redis configuration itself (e.g., `maxmemory`, `maxclients`). This is *indirectly* related to MISP, as MISP relies on Redis.
8. **`MISP.max_execution_time`:** Set a reasonable maximum execution time for PHP scripts within MISP's configuration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the MISP instance by consuming excessive resources.

**Impact:**
* **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of successful DoS attacks targeting resource exhaustion within MISP.

**Currently Implemented:** [e.g., "Default values for some resource limits are in place, but not customized based on expected usage."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "Limits on object depth and galaxy elements are not configured.  Redis configuration is not optimized for MISP's workload."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure MISP Sharing Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_misp_sharing_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Carefully configure MISP's sharing settings and distribution levels to prevent unintended data disclosure.  This is a repeat of #4 (Source Trust Levels) but re-emphasized here as it's *entirely* within MISP's configuration.

**Description:** (Same as #4, but highlighting the MISP-specific actions)
1.  **MISP Organizations:**  Use the MISP "Organizations" feature to define and manage trusted entities.
2.  **MISP Sharing Groups:**  Create and manage "Sharing Groups" within MISP for controlled data sharing.
3.  **MISP Distribution Levels:**  Consistently use MISP's distribution levels (0-4) when creating and sharing events.
4.  **MISP Synchronization Settings:**  Configure synchronization with other MISP instances *within MISP's interface*, specifying which organizations and distribution levels to accept.
5.  **User Training (MISP Focus):** Train users on the proper use of MISP's sharing features.

**Threats Mitigated:** (Same as #4)
*   **Data Leakage (Severity: High):** Prevents accidental data sharing.
*   **Data Breach (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of data exposure through compromised instances.
*   **Misinformation (Severity: Medium):** Controls the flow of information.

**Impact:** (Same as #4)
*   **Data Leakage:** Significantly reduces unintended disclosure.
*   **Data Breach:** Limits the impact of a breach.
*   **Misinformation:** Improves information reliability.

**Currently Implemented:** [e.g., "Organizations are defined, but sharing groups are underutilized. Distribution level usage is inconsistent."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "A formal policy for using MISP's sharing features is missing. Synchronization settings are not restrictive enough."]
