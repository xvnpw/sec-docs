# Threat Model Analysis for misp/misp

## Threat: [Data Poisoning via Malicious Event Creation](./threats/data_poisoning_via_malicious_event_creation.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Poisoning via Malicious Event Creation

    *   **Description:** An attacker with event creation privileges (either legitimately or through compromised credentials specific to MISP) creates events containing false or misleading indicators of compromise (IOCs). They leverage MISP's event and attribute creation features to inject this data. They might craft these IOCs to trigger false positives, overload analysis systems, or redirect investigations. They could use the event creation API or the MISP web interface's event creation forms.
    *   **Impact:** Wasted analyst time, incorrect incident response decisions, misdirection of security resources, erosion of trust in the MISP data, potential for incorrect automated actions based on poisoned data.
    *   **Affected MISP Component:** Event creation API (`/events/add`), Web UI event creation form, Attribute creation (`/attributes/add`), Object creation (`/objects/add`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within MISP to limit event creation privileges to trusted users. Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users with event creation rights, specifically within the MISP application.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all fields during event and attribute creation within MISP. Use whitelisting where possible, and reject suspicious patterns. Validate IOC formats against known standards, leveraging MISP's built-in validation capabilities.
        *   **Data Quality Scoring:** Utilize MISP's built-in confidence levels and sighting mechanisms. Implement a workflow that requires review and approval for events and attributes with low confidence scores, using MISP's internal review features.
        *   **Auditing:** Enable detailed audit logging within MISP for all event and attribute creation, modification, and deletion actions. Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity, focusing on MISP-specific logs.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the MISP event creation API to prevent attackers from flooding the system with malicious events.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via API Abuse](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_api_abuse.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via API Abuse

    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid MISP API key (through theft, phishing targeting MISP users, or MISP misconfiguration) and uses it to extract large amounts of sensitive threat intelligence from the MISP instance. They specifically target MISP's API endpoints for data retrieval. They might use custom scripts to query the API and download all available data, or target specific events or attributes using MISP's search functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidential threat intelligence, exposure of sensitive organizational information, potential compromise of connected systems (if MISP data is used for further attacks), reputational damage.
    *   **Affected MISP Component:** MISP REST API (`/events`, `/attributes`, `/sightings`, etc.), specifically search and export functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **API Key Management:** Implement strict MISP API key management policies. Use short-lived API keys, rotate keys regularly, and restrict key permissions to the minimum necessary (least privilege) within MISP's user and role management.
        *   **API Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on all MISP API endpoints to prevent attackers from rapidly extracting large amounts of data. This is a built-in MISP feature.
        *   **API Monitoring:** Monitor MISP API usage for anomalous activity, such as unusually large data transfers or requests from unexpected IP addresses. Utilize MISP's logging and monitoring capabilities.
        *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for API Access (if feasible):** Explore options for requiring 2FA for MISP API access, even if it involves a workaround (e.g., using a separate authentication service that integrates with MISP).

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Correlation Engine Overload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_correlation_engine_overload.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Correlation Engine Overload

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a crafted search query or series of queries, specifically designed to exploit MISP's correlation engine. This could involve searching for extremely broad patterns, using complex regular expressions within MISP's search interface, or triggering a large number of correlations, intentionally overloading MISP's processing capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Inability to access or use MISP, disruption of threat intelligence operations, potential data loss (if the MISP system crashes due to resource exhaustion).
    *   **Affected MISP Component:** Correlation engine (`app/Model/Correlation.php`, database queries related to correlation), Search API (`/events/restSearch`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Optimization:** Optimize database queries and indexing related to the MISP correlation engine. Regularly review and improve query performance within MISP's codebase.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, time) on MISP user accounts and processes, particularly those related to search and correlation, using MISP's configuration options.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on MISP search queries, especially complex or resource-intensive ones, using MISP's built-in rate limiting features.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate search queries within MISP for potentially malicious patterns (e.g., overly complex regular expressions).
        *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeout mechanisms for long-running queries within MISP to prevent them from indefinitely consuming resources.

## Threat: [Synchronization Hijacking](./threats/synchronization_hijacking.md)

*   **Threat:** Synchronization Hijacking

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a MISP instance that is synchronized with the target instance. They then use MISP's built-in synchronization mechanism to push malicious data (poisoned events, attributes) or pull sensitive data from the target instance. This exploits the trust relationship established between MISP instances.
    *   **Impact:** Data poisoning, data exfiltration, compromise of the target MISP instance, potential compromise of other connected systems (if data from the compromised MISP is used elsewhere).
    *   **Affected MISP Component:** Synchronization functionality (`app/Controller/ServersController.php`, `app/Model/Server.php`, related database tables), Push and Pull mechanisms within MISP.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Synchronization Partner Vetting:** Only synchronize with trusted MISP instances. Establish clear agreements and security requirements with synchronization partners, specifically for MISP-to-MISP synchronization.
        *   **Mutual Authentication:** Use mutually authenticated TLS (mTLS) for all MISP synchronization connections. This is a crucial security control for MISP synchronization.
        *   **Data Filtering:** Implement filters within MISP to control which data is synchronized (e.g., only synchronize events with a certain confidence level or from specific organizations). Utilize MISP's built-in filtering capabilities.
        *   **Regular Auditing:** Regularly audit MISP synchronization logs and configurations.
        *   **One-Way Synchronization (where appropriate):** Consider using one-way synchronization (push-only or pull-only) within MISP to limit the potential impact of a compromise.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via MISP Plugin Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_misp_plugin_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via MISP Plugin Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a third-party MISP plugin to gain elevated privileges *within the MISP instance itself*. This could allow them to access data they shouldn't have, modify MISP system settings, or potentially execute code within the context of the MISP application.
    *   **Impact:** Data compromise, MISP system takeover, potential compromise of the underlying server (if the plugin vulnerability allows for escaping the MISP application context).
    *   **Affected MISP Component:** Third-party MISP plugins (located in `app/Plugin`), Plugin API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Plugin Selection:** Only install MISP plugins from trusted sources. Carefully review the code and security posture of any third-party plugins before installing them in MISP.
        *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all MISP plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Plugin Sandboxing (if feasible):** Explore options for sandboxing MISP plugins to limit their access to the MISP core and the underlying system. This is a complex mitigation, but highly recommended for MISP.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan MISP and its plugins for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege for Plugin Execution:** Run MISP plugins with the least privilege necessary within the MISP environment.
