## Attack Tree Path: [Root Node](./attack_tree_paths/root_node.md)

*   **Exfiltrate Data AND Manipulate Data in MISP [CN]:**
    *   Description: The attacker's ultimate objective is to steal sensitive threat intelligence data from the MISP instance and also alter the data within MISP to deceive analysts or disrupt operations. This is a critical node because it represents the core security concern.

## Attack Tree Path: [Level 1 Nodes (Main Attack Vectors)](./attack_tree_paths/level_1_nodes__main_attack_vectors_.md)

*   **Abuse MISP API Functionality [HR]:**
    *   Description: This attack vector involves exploiting legitimate features of the MISP API in ways that were not intended, leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation. It's high-risk due to the direct access the API provides.
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Strict API key management (rotation, strong passwords, least privilege).
        *   Secure storage of API keys (environment variables, vaults).
        *   Monitor API usage for anomalies.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for API key generation.
        *   User education on phishing and social engineering.

*   **Exploit MISP Configuration [HR]:**
    *   Description: This attack vector focuses on leveraging misconfigurations within the MISP application itself, such as weak authentication settings or overly permissive data sharing rules. It's high-risk because misconfigurations are common and can provide easy access to attackers.
    *    Mitigation:
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Use a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system.
        *   Regularly review and audit user accounts and permissions.
        *   Carefully review and configure data sharing settings.
        *   Use a least privilege approach for data sharing.
        *   Regularly audit data sharing configurations.
        *   Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures.
        *   Provide user training on data sharing practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Level 2 Nodes (Specific Attack Techniques)](./attack_tree_paths/level_2_nodes__specific_attack_techniques_.md)

*   **(A) API Key Leakage/Theft [HR]:**
    *   Description: An attacker obtains a valid MISP API key through various means, such as social engineering, phishing, finding exposed keys in code repositories, or compromising a user's workstation.
    *   Impact: Very High (Full API access)
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

*   **(G) Weak Authentication / Authorization [HR]:**
    *   Description: MISP's user authentication or authorization mechanisms are weak or misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access. This could be due to weak default passwords, lack of MFA, or improper role-based access control (RBAC).
    *   Impact: High to Very High
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy to Medium

*   **(H) Misconfigured Data Sharing Settings [HR]:**
    *   Description: MISP allows for granular control over data sharing. Misconfigurations could lead to sensitive data being shared with unauthorized users or organizations.
    *   Impact: Medium to High
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Effort: Very Low
    *   Skill Level: Novice
    *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
