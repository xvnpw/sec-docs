# Threat Model Analysis for misp/misp

## Threat: [Compromised MISP Instance Ingestion](./threats/compromised_misp_instance_ingestion.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the connected MISP instance and injects malicious or inaccurate threat intelligence data. The application, trusting the source, ingests and acts upon this flawed data.
*   **Impact:** The application makes incorrect security decisions, potentially blocking legitimate traffic (false positives) or allowing malicious activity (false negatives). This can lead to operational disruptions, security breaches, or wasted resources investigating non-existent threats.
*   **Affected MISP Component:** MISP Core - Event and Attribute storage, Sharing functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify the integrity and trustworthiness of the MISP instance.
    *   Implement strong security measures for the MISP instance itself (access controls, regular updates, security audits).
    *   Consider implementing a validation layer within the application to cross-reference MISP data with other trusted sources or known good data.
    *   Monitor the MISP instance for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Exposure of MISP API Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_misp_api_credentials.md)

**Description:** The API key or other credentials used by the application to authenticate with the MISP instance are stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, stored in plain text in configuration files). An attacker gaining access to the application's codebase or configuration could retrieve these credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the MISP instance, potentially allowing attackers to retrieve sensitive threat intelligence data, manipulate the platform, or disrupt its operation.
*   **Affected MISP Component:** MISP Core API - Authentication mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store MISP API credentials securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application's code.
    *   Use environment variables or secure configuration files with restricted access.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys.

## Threat: [Insufficient Validation of MISP Server Certificate](./threats/insufficient_validation_of_misp_server_certificate.md)

**Description:** The application does not properly validate the SSL/TLS certificate of the MISP server during HTTPS communication. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept communication and potentially steal API keys or manipulate data.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of API keys, potential manipulation of threat intelligence data in transit, leading to incorrect security decisions.
*   **Affected MISP Component:** Application's HTTPS client implementation interacting with MISP API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the application's HTTPS client library is configured to properly validate the MISP server's certificate.
    *   Pin the MISP server's certificate or use a trusted certificate authority.
