# Attack Surface Analysis for misp/misp

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of the API key used for communication with the MISP instance.](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_the_api_key_used_for_communication_with_the_misp_instance.md)

*   **Description:** Compromise of the API key used for communication with the MISP instance.
    *   **How MISP Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  The application relies on an API key to authenticate and authorize its requests to the MISP instance. This key becomes a critical secret directly tied to MISP access.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes the MISP API key in the application's source code, which is then exposed in a public repository. An attacker finds the key and uses it to access and manipulate data on the MISP instance.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive threat intelligence data *within MISP*, potential for data manipulation or deletion *within MISP*, and the ability to submit false information, impacting the integrity of the MISP platform for all users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store the API key securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or secure configuration files with restricted access.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Use an API key with the minimum necessary permissions required for the application's functionality *on the MISP instance*.
        *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate the API key to limit the window of opportunity if it is compromised.
        *   **Avoid Hardcoding:** Never hardcode the API key directly in the application's source code.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient validation of data received from the MISP instance.](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_validation_of_data_received_from_the_misp_instance.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient validation of data received from the MISP instance.
    *   **How MISP Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MISP provides threat intelligence data in various formats. If the application doesn't properly validate this *MISP-provided* data, it can be vulnerable to injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** The application receives a description of a malware family *from MISP* containing malicious JavaScript. Without proper sanitization, this script is rendered in the application's web interface, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack against users of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, or other injection vulnerabilities depending on how the *MISP data* is processed and used within the application. This can lead to account compromise, data theft, or malicious actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received *from the MISP API*. Use appropriate encoding techniques based on the context where the data is used (e.g., HTML escaping for web display).
        *   **Data Type Validation:** Verify the data types and formats of the received information *from MISP* against expected schemas.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on the communication channel with the MISP instance.](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_the_communication_channel_with_the_misp_instance.md)

*   **Description:**  Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on the communication channel with the MISP instance.
    *   **How MISP Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The application communicates with an external MISP instance over a network. If this *MISP communication* is not properly secured, it's vulnerable to interception.
    *   **Example:** The application communicates with the MISP API over HTTP instead of HTTPS. An attacker intercepts the communication and steals the API key *used for MISP access* or modifies the threat intelligence data being exchanged *with MISP*.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the API key *used for MISP*, injection of false or malicious threat intelligence data *from or to MISP*, denial of service by disrupting communication *with MISP*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for all communication with the MISP API.
        *   **Certificate Validation:** Ensure proper validation of the MISP instance's SSL/TLS certificate to prevent connecting to rogue or compromised instances.
        *   **Network Security:** Implement appropriate network security measures to protect the communication path between the application and the MISP instance.
