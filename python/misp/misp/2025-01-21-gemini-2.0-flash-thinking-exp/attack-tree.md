│    │    ├─── Steps:

│    │    │    2. Attacker intercepts the communication and eavesdrops on sensitive data (e.g., API keys, fetched indicators).
│    │    │    3. Attacker may attempt to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to modify requests or responses.

│        ├─── Steps:
│        │    1. Attacker identifies known vulnerabilities in the MISP client library used by the application. **CRITICAL NODE**
│        │    2. Attacker crafts malicious data or requests that trigger these vulnerabilities.
│        │    3. This could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or other security issues within the application's context.

├─── OR ─ Exploit Weaknesses in MISP Instance Security (Indirect Impact) **HIGH RISK PATH (Indirect)**
│    └─── AND ─ Compromised MISP Instance
│        ├─── Goal: Leverage a compromised MISP instance to inject malicious data or manipulate the application.
│        ├─── Steps:
│        │    1. Attacker compromises the MISP instance that the application connects to (this is outside the application's direct control but impacts it). **CRITICAL NODE**
│        │    2. Attacker injects malicious indicators or manipulates data within the compromised MISP instance.
│        │    3. Application fetches and processes this malicious data, leading to compromise (as described in "Exploit Vulnerabilities in Data Received from MISP").

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Data Received from MISP (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_data_received_from_misp__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Goal:** Execute arbitrary code or manipulate application logic.
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious Indicator Injection.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Attacker compromises a MISP instance or gains privileges to add/modify indicators:** If an attacker gains control over the MISP instance or has sufficient privileges, they can inject malicious data.
    *   **Attacker crafts malicious indicators:** The attacker needs to create indicators specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes data.
*   **Steps:**
    *   The attacker compromises the MISP instance or gains privileged access.
    *   The attacker crafts malicious indicators.
    *   The application fetches and processes these indicators.
    *   A vulnerability in the application is triggered, leading to code execution or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application's MISP Integration (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_application's_misp_integration__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Sub-Path 2.1: API Key Compromise (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to MISP data or manipulate MISP on behalf of the application.
    *   **Critical Node:** Attacker gains access to the application's API key for MISP. This is the key enabler for this attack path.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   The attacker obtains the application's MISP API key through various means (e.g., code leaks, configuration errors).
        *   The attacker uses the compromised API key to access or manipulate data within the MISP instance.

*   **Sub-Path 2.2: Insecure API Communication (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Goal:** Intercept or manipulate communication between the application and MISP.
    *   **Critical Node:** Application uses insecure communication protocols (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS) to interact with MISP. This lack of encryption makes the communication vulnerable.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   The application communicates with the MISP API over an insecure protocol.
        *   The attacker intercepts this communication, potentially gaining access to API keys or other sensitive data.
        *   The attacker might attempt to modify the communication to manipulate data or actions.

*   **Sub-Path 2.3: Vulnerabilities in MISP Client Library Usage (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Goal:** Exploit vulnerabilities in the specific MISP client library used by the application.
    *   **Critical Node:** Attacker identifies known vulnerabilities in the MISP client library used by the application. This knowledge is the prerequisite for exploiting the library.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   The attacker researches and identifies vulnerabilities in the MISP client library.
        *   The attacker crafts malicious data or requests that specifically target these vulnerabilities.
        *   The application, using the vulnerable library, processes this data, leading to exploitation (e.g., remote code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Weaknesses in MISP Instance Security (Indirect Impact) (HIGH RISK PATH (Indirect))](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_weaknesses_in_misp_instance_security__indirect_impact___high_risk_path__indirect__.md)

*   **Goal:** Leverage a compromised MISP instance to inject malicious data or manipulate the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Compromised MISP Instance.
*   **Critical Node:** Attacker compromises the MISP instance that the application connects to. This is the initial breach point that enables the subsequent attack.
*   **Steps:**
    *   The attacker successfully compromises the external MISP instance.
    *   The attacker injects malicious indicators or manipulates data within the compromised MISP instance.
    *   The application, trusting the MISP instance, fetches and processes this malicious data, leading to compromise (similar to the "Malicious Indicator Injection" scenario).
