# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Threat Intelligence Sharing: The core business process is the sharing of threat intelligence data between organizations and users. Disruption or compromise of this process would severely impact the platform's value.
- Threat Intelligence Ingestion: Ingesting threat intelligence from various sources (feeds, user contributions) is crucial for platform content and effectiveness. Failure in this process would lead to outdated or incomplete threat intelligence.
- Threat Intelligence Analysis and Correlation: The platform's ability to analyze and correlate threat intelligence data is essential for providing actionable insights. Impairment of this process would reduce the platform's analytical capabilities.
- User Access and Authentication: Secure and reliable user access to the platform is necessary for users to contribute and consume threat intelligence. Issues with authentication and authorization would prevent legitimate users from accessing the platform.

Data Sensitivity:
- Threat Intelligence Data (IOCs, malware samples, threat descriptions): High sensitivity. This data can contain sensitive information about threats, vulnerabilities, and organizational security posture. Unauthorized disclosure could lead to further attacks or compromise.
- User Account Information (usernames, email addresses, roles): Moderate sensitivity. Compromise of user accounts could lead to unauthorized access to threat intelligence data and platform functionalities.
- Audit Logs: Moderate sensitivity. Audit logs contain information about user activities and system events, which can be valuable for security monitoring and incident investigation. Unauthorized access or modification could hinder security investigations.
- Configuration Data: Moderate sensitivity. Configuration data contains settings for the platform and its components. Improper configuration or unauthorized modification could lead to security vulnerabilities or operational issues.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the expected scale of the MISP deployment in terms of users and data volume? (Assumption: Medium scale, supporting multiple organizations and a significant amount of threat intelligence data).
- What are the specific compliance requirements for the MISP deployment (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)? (Assumption: General data protection and privacy regulations apply, but no specific industry-specific compliance is mandated).
- What is the organization's risk appetite regarding security vulnerabilities and data breaches? (Assumption: Moderate risk appetite, with a focus on implementing reasonable security controls to mitigate major risks).
- Are there any existing security tools or infrastructure that MISP needs to integrate with? (Assumption: Integration with standard security tools like SIEM, WAF, and vulnerability scanners is desirable).
- What is the expected level of technical expertise of the users who will be managing and using MISP? (Assumption: Users are security professionals with moderate technical expertise).

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to improve cybersecurity through threat intelligence sharing. The organization prioritizes data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The organization is security-conscious and willing to invest in reasonable security controls. Secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) principles are followed.
- DESIGN: A cloud-based deployment is preferred for scalability and manageability. Standard web application architecture with separate web UI, API, database, and worker components is suitable.
