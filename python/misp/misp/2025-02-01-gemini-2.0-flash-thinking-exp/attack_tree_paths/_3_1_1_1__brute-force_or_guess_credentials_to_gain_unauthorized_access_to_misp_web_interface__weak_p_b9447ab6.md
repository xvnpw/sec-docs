### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1.1] Brute-force or guess credentials to gain unauthorized access to MISP web interface (Weak Passwords or Default Credentials - Web UI)

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown

This attack vector targets the authentication mechanism of the MISP web interface. Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying different username and password combinations until they find a valid set. This can be achieved through two primary methods:

*   **Brute-force Attack:** This involves using automated tools to try a large number of password combinations against a known username or a list of common usernames. These tools can be configured to test various password patterns, character sets, and lengths.
*   **Credential Guessing:** This relies on attackers guessing passwords based on publicly available information, common password patterns (e.g., "password," "123456," "companyname123"), or information gleaned from social engineering or data breaches. Default credentials, often used during initial setup and forgotten to be changed, are prime targets for guessing.

The success of this attack vector is heavily dependent on:

*   **Password Strength:** Weak passwords, easily guessable patterns, or reused passwords significantly increase the likelihood of success.
*   **Default Credentials:** If default usernames and passwords are not changed after MISP installation, they become an extremely easy entry point.
*   **Account Lockout Policies:** Lack of account lockout mechanisms allows attackers to attempt unlimited login attempts without being blocked.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Absence of rate limiting on login attempts allows attackers to perform brute-force attacks at a high speed without triggering alarms or being throttled.

#### 4.2. Justification of Risk Ratings

*   **Likelihood: Medium**
    *   **Justification:** While not every MISP instance is actively targeted by sophisticated attackers, the prevalence of automated brute-force tools and the common occurrence of weak passwords make this a reasonably likely attack. Many organizations, especially smaller ones or those with less mature security practices, may not enforce strong password policies or diligently change default credentials. Publicly accessible MISP instances are particularly vulnerable. The "medium" likelihood reflects the balance between the ease of execution for attackers and the varying levels of security awareness and implementation across MISP deployments.
*   **Impact: High**
    *   **Justification:** Successful exploitation of this attack path grants the attacker complete unauthorized access to the MISP web interface. This has severe consequences:
        *   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive threat intelligence data stored within MISP, including indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware samples, vulnerability information, and organizational intelligence. This data can be highly valuable to attackers for further malicious activities or sale on the dark web.
        *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify, delete, or inject false information into MISP, compromising the integrity of the threat intelligence platform and potentially leading to incorrect security decisions by users relying on MISP data.
        *   **System Compromise:** Depending on the MISP configuration and user privileges, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges within the MISP system or even gain access to the underlying server infrastructure, leading to broader system compromise.
        *   **Reputational Damage:** A data breach or compromise of a threat intelligence platform can severely damage the reputation of the organization using MISP, eroding trust from partners and stakeholders.
*   **Effort: Low**
    *   **Justification:**  Numerous readily available and user-friendly tools exist for brute-force attacks (e.g., Hydra, Medusa, Burp Suite).  Scripts and pre-built wordlists are easily accessible online.  For credential guessing, attackers can leverage common password lists and publicly available information. The effort required to launch this attack is minimal, even for relatively unsophisticated attackers.
*   **Skill Level: Low**
    *   **Justification:**  Executing a brute-force or credential guessing attack requires minimal technical expertise.  Using readily available tools is straightforward, and even scripting basic attacks is within the reach of individuals with limited programming skills.  No advanced exploitation techniques or deep understanding of MISP internals are necessary.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium**
    *   **Justification:** While brute-force attempts can generate noticeable login failures in logs, detecting them in real-time can be challenging without proper monitoring and alerting mechanisms.  Simple brute-force attempts might be easily detected by basic intrusion detection systems (IDS) or security information and event management (SIEM) systems if configured to monitor login failures. However, sophisticated attackers might employ techniques to evade detection, such as:
        *   **Slow and Low Attacks:** Spreading login attempts over a long period to avoid triggering rate limits or anomaly detection.
        *   **Distributed Attacks:** Using botnets or compromised machines to launch attacks from multiple IP addresses, making IP-based blocking less effective.
        *   **Credential Stuffing:** Using lists of compromised credentials from other breaches, which might appear as legitimate login attempts if the user reuses passwords.
    Therefore, while detection is possible, it requires proactive security measures and potentially more advanced monitoring techniques to reliably identify and respond to these attacks.

#### 4.3. Actionable Insights - Deep Dive and Recommendations

The actionable insights provided are crucial for mitigating this attack path. Let's delve deeper into each recommendation and provide specific implementation guidance for MISP deployments:

*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Minimum Password Length:** Enforce a minimum password length of at least 12 characters, ideally 16 or more.
        *   **Password Complexity:** Require passwords to include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
        *   **Password History:** Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
        *   **Password Expiration (Optional but Recommended):** Consider implementing password expiration policies (e.g., every 90 days) to encourage regular password changes, although this should be balanced with user usability and potential password fatigue.
        *   **MISP Configuration:**  While MISP itself might not have built-in password policy enforcement at the application level, these policies should be implemented at the organizational level and communicated clearly to MISP users. Consider using organizational password management tools and training to support strong password practices.
        *   **Operating System Level Policies:**  If MISP user accounts are managed at the operating system level (e.g., using PAM), leverage OS-level password policy enforcement mechanisms.

*   **Disable or Change Default Credentials:**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **During MISP Installation:**  The MISP installation process should strongly encourage or even mandate changing default credentials for administrative accounts (e.g., `admin@example.com` and default password).
        *   **Post-Installation Audit:** Regularly audit MISP user accounts to ensure no default or easily guessable usernames and passwords remain in use.
        *   **Documentation and Training:**  Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials and provide instructions to administrators.

*   **Implement Account Lockout and Rate Limiting for Login Attempts:**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Account Lockout:** Configure MISP (or the underlying web server/authentication mechanism) to automatically lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5-10 failed attempts within a short timeframe).  Locked accounts should require administrator intervention to unlock or have a time-based automatic unlock (e.g., after 30 minutes).
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the web server level (e.g., using `nginx` or `Apache` modules like `mod_evasive` or `mod_security`) to restrict the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a given timeframe. This can significantly slow down brute-force attacks.
        *   **MISP Plugins/Modules:** Explore if MISP offers any plugins or modules that provide built-in account lockout or rate limiting functionalities. If not, consider developing or requesting such features.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF in front of the MISP web interface. WAFs often have built-in protection against brute-force attacks and can provide advanced rate limiting and anomaly detection capabilities.

**Additional Recommendations:**

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for all MISP user accounts, especially administrative accounts. MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if they compromise credentials. MISP supports various MFA methods.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting the web interface authentication mechanisms, to identify and address any vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
*   **Login Attempt Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust logging and monitoring of login attempts, especially failed attempts. Configure alerts to notify security teams of suspicious activity, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a single IP or user account. Integrate MISP logs with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Conduct regular security awareness training for all MISP users, emphasizing the importance of strong passwords, password management best practices, and the risks of phishing and social engineering attacks that could lead to credential compromise.
*   **IP Address Whitelisting (for restricted access scenarios):** If MISP access is intended to be restricted to a specific set of networks or users, consider implementing IP address whitelisting at the firewall or web server level to limit access to only authorized IP ranges.

By implementing these comprehensive mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of successful brute-force or credential guessing attacks against their MISP web interface and protect their valuable threat intelligence data. Regular review and updates of these security measures are essential to adapt to evolving threats and maintain a strong security posture.
