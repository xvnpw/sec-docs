### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [2.1.4.1] SQL Injection via API parameters

#### 4.1. Understanding SQL Injection via API Parameters

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection vulnerability that occurs when user-controlled input is incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. In the context of APIs, this vulnerability arises when API endpoints accept parameters (e.g., GET or POST parameters, JSON payloads) that are directly used to construct SQL queries without adequate input validation and sanitization.

**How it works in API context:**

1.  **Attacker Identifies API Endpoint:** The attacker identifies an API endpoint that likely interacts with a database and accepts user-supplied parameters. This could be endpoints for searching, filtering, or creating/updating data.
2.  **Parameter Injection Point:** The attacker identifies a specific API parameter that is used in the backend SQL query.
3.  **Crafting Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL payload designed to manipulate the intended SQL query. This payload is injected into the identified API parameter.
4.  **API Processing and Query Execution:** The API endpoint processes the request, incorporating the attacker's malicious payload into the SQL query. If input validation is insufficient, the modified SQL query is executed against the database.
5.  **Exploitation:** Depending on the injected SQL code and database permissions, the attacker can achieve various malicious outcomes, including:
    *   **Data Breach:** Extracting sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Causing database errors or performance degradation.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (in some cases):**  If database permissions and configurations allow, potentially executing arbitrary code on the database server or even the application server.

#### 4.2. MISP API Context and Potential Vulnerabilities

MISP, as a threat intelligence platform, relies heavily on a database to store and manage sensitive threat data (events, attributes, indicators, etc.). Its API is crucial for data exchange, automation, and integration with other security tools.  Therefore, the MISP API likely exposes various endpoints that interact with the database and accept user-supplied parameters for operations such as:

*   **Searching for Events/Attributes:** API endpoints for querying events or attributes based on various criteria (e.g., keywords, tags, types, timestamps). These endpoints might accept parameters like `q`, `filter`, `value`, `type`, etc.
*   **Filtering Data:** API endpoints for retrieving subsets of data based on specific filters. Parameters could define filtering conditions.
*   **Data Creation/Modification:** API endpoints for creating new events, attributes, or modifying existing ones. Parameters would contain the data to be inserted or updated.
*   **User Management:** API endpoints for managing users, roles, and permissions. Parameters could be used for user lookups or modifications.

**Potential Vulnerable Scenarios in MISP API:**

If these API endpoints are not properly secured, vulnerabilities could arise in scenarios like:

*   **Search Queries:**  Imagine an API endpoint `/api/events/search` that accepts a parameter `keyword`. If the backend code directly constructs a SQL query like `SELECT * FROM events WHERE description LIKE '%" + keyword + "%'` without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject SQL code within the `keyword` parameter. For example, `keyword = "test' OR 1=1 --"` could modify the query to `SELECT * FROM events WHERE description LIKE '%test' OR 1=1 --%'`, potentially bypassing intended filtering and retrieving all events.
*   **Filtering Attributes:**  Similarly, an API endpoint `/api/attributes/filter` with a parameter `attribute_type`.  If the query is constructed as `SELECT * FROM attributes WHERE type = '" + attribute_type + "'` without sanitization, an attacker could inject SQL code in `attribute_type`.
*   **Data Modification (Less Common for GET, more for POST/PUT):** While less likely in GET requests, POST or PUT requests that use parameters to update database records are also potential targets if input validation is missing.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector Breakdown

An attacker attempting to exploit SQL Injection via API parameters in MISP might follow these steps:

1.  **Reconnaissance:**
    *   **Identify API Endpoints:** Explore the MISP API documentation or attempt to enumerate API endpoints (e.g., through fuzzing or analyzing network traffic).
    *   **Analyze API Parameters:** Examine the parameters accepted by identified API endpoints (e.g., through documentation, API requests, or reverse engineering client-side code).
    *   **Identify Potential Injection Points:** Look for API parameters that seem likely to be used in database queries (e.g., parameters related to search terms, filters, IDs, names, descriptions).

2.  **Vulnerability Testing:**
    *   **Basic Injection Attempts:** Start with simple SQL injection payloads in identified parameters (e.g., single quote `'`, double quote `"`, `OR 1=1`, `--`, `;`).
    *   **Error-Based Injection:** Observe the API responses for SQL errors. Error messages can reveal database structure and confirm vulnerability.
    *   **Boolean-Based Blind Injection:** If errors are suppressed, use boolean-based blind SQL injection techniques. Inject payloads that cause different responses based on true/false conditions in the SQL query (e.g., `AND 1=1` vs. `AND 1=2`).
    *   **Time-Based Blind Injection:** If boolean-based injection is difficult, use time-based blind SQL injection techniques (e.g., using `BENCHMARK()` or `SLEEP()` functions in MySQL) to infer information based on response times.

3.  **Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Once a vulnerability is confirmed, craft payloads to extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., using `UNION SELECT`, `SUBSTRING`, database-specific functions).
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Inject payloads to modify or delete data (e.g., `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements).
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** Attempt to escalate privileges if database permissions are misconfigured.
    *   **Further System Compromise (Potentially):** In extreme cases, if database permissions are overly permissive, attempt to execute operating system commands or gain access to the underlying server.

#### 4.4. Impact Assessment in MISP

A successful SQL Injection attack via API parameters in MISP can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach (High Impact):** MISP stores highly sensitive threat intelligence data. SQL injection could allow attackers to exfiltrate this data, including:
    *   **Event Details:** Information about security incidents, malware samples, threat actors, vulnerabilities, etc.
    *   **Attribute Data:** Indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware hashes, IP addresses, domain names, URLs, etc.
    *   **Organizational Data:** Information about organizations sharing threat intelligence.
    *   **User Credentials (Potentially):** If user tables are accessible, attackers might be able to steal user credentials.
    *   **Configuration Data (Potentially):** Access to configuration tables could reveal sensitive system settings.

*   **Data Manipulation (High Impact):** Attackers could modify or delete threat intelligence data, leading to:
    *   **Data Integrity Compromise:**  Corrupting the accuracy and reliability of threat intelligence.
    *   **False Positives/Negatives:**  Manipulated data could lead to incorrect security decisions.
    *   **Disruption of Threat Intelligence Sharing:**  Tampering with data could disrupt the effectiveness of MISP as a sharing platform.

*   **Potential Code Execution (Context Dependent - Medium to High Impact):** Depending on database permissions and configurations, SQL injection could potentially lead to:
    *   **Database Server Compromise:**  Executing operating system commands on the database server.
    *   **Application Server Compromise:**  In some scenarios, gaining access to the application server through database vulnerabilities.

*   **Denial of Service (Medium Impact):**  Maliciously crafted SQL queries could overload the database server, leading to performance degradation or denial of service for legitimate users.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies for MISP API

To effectively mitigate SQL Injection vulnerabilities in MISP API endpoints, the following strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial):**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all API parameters. Define expected data types, formats, and allowed character sets for each parameter. Reject any input that does not conform to these specifications.
    *   **Sanitization (Context-Aware):** Sanitize input data before using it in SQL queries. This might involve escaping special characters, encoding, or using appropriate sanitization functions provided by the programming language and database library. **However, sanitization alone is often insufficient and should be used in conjunction with parameterized queries.**

2.  **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) (Essential):**
    *   **Always Use Parameterized Queries:**  The most effective defense against SQL injection is to use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements). Parameterized queries separate the SQL query structure from the user-supplied data. Placeholders are used in the query for parameters, and the actual data is passed separately to the database driver. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not as executable SQL code.
    *   **Example (Conceptual Python with a database library):**

    ```python
    # Vulnerable (Example - DO NOT USE)
    # query = "SELECT * FROM events WHERE description LIKE '%" + request.GET.get('keyword') + "%'"

    # Secure (Using parameterized query)
    keyword = request.GET.get('keyword')
    query = "SELECT * FROM events WHERE description LIKE %s" # %s is a placeholder
    cursor.execute(query, ('%' + keyword + '%',)) # Data passed separately
    ```

3.  **Least Privilege Database Access (Best Practice):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure database user accounts used by the MISP application with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid using database accounts with `root` or `admin` privileges.
    *   **Restrict Permissions:** Grant only the specific permissions required for the application to function (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on specific tables).  Avoid granting `CREATE`, `DROP`, or other administrative privileges.

4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Deploy a WAF:** Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the MISP application. A WAF can help detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns in HTTP requests.
    *   **WAF Rules:** Configure WAF rules specifically designed to protect against SQL injection attacks.

5.  **Regular Security Testing (Proactive Approach):**
    *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools to analyze the MISP codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities during development.
    *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Perform DAST (penetration testing) on the running MISP application, including its API endpoints, to identify and validate SQL injection vulnerabilities in a real-world environment.
    *   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct regular vulnerability scans to identify known vulnerabilities in MISP and its dependencies.

6.  **Security Awareness Training for Developers:**
    *   **Educate Developers:** Provide security awareness training to developers on secure coding practices, specifically focusing on SQL injection prevention and secure API development.
    *   **Promote Secure Coding Culture:** Foster a security-conscious development culture that prioritizes security throughout the software development lifecycle.

### 5. Actionable Insights and Recommendations

Based on this deep analysis, the following actionable insights and recommendations are provided to the MISP development team:

*   **Prioritize Input Validation and Parameterized Queries:**  Make input validation and parameterized queries the **cornerstones** of API security. Ensure that **all** API endpoints that interact with the database utilize parameterized queries for all user-supplied parameters.
*   **Conduct Thorough API Security Review:**  Perform a comprehensive security review of all MISP API endpoints, specifically focusing on input validation and SQL query construction. Identify and remediate any instances where user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper protection.
*   **Implement Automated Security Testing:** Integrate SAST and DAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect SQL injection vulnerabilities during development and testing phases.
*   **Strengthen Database Security:**  Review and enforce the principle of least privilege for database user accounts used by the MISP application. Regularly audit database permissions.
*   **Consider WAF Deployment:**  Evaluate the feasibility of deploying a WAF to provide an additional layer of security against SQL injection and other web application attacks.
*   **Continuous Security Monitoring:** Implement security monitoring and logging to detect and respond to potential SQL injection attempts in real-time.
*   **Developer Training is Key:** Invest in ongoing security training for developers to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge and skills to build secure APIs and prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and recommendations, the MISP development team can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection via API parameters and enhance the overall security posture of the MISP platform, protecting sensitive threat intelligence data and ensuring the platform's integrity and availability.
