# Threat Model Analysis for misp/misp

## Threat: [Consumption of Malicious or Inaccurate Threat Intelligence](./threats/consumption_of_malicious_or_inaccurate_threat_intelligence.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, having compromised a MISP instance or a data source feeding into MISP, could inject malicious or intentionally inaccurate threat intelligence data (e.g., false indicators, misleading analysis). The application, trusting MISP data, would then consume and act upon this corrupted information.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect security decisions by the application (e.g., blocking legitimate traffic, allowing malicious activity), wasted resources investigating false positives, missed real threats (false negatives), potential for application malfunction if acting on malicious data (e.g., deleting critical files based on a false positive indicator).
*   **MISP Component Affected:** Events, Attributes, Objects, Feeds, potentially the MISP core data storage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement data validation and sanitization on all data received from MISP within the application.
    *   Utilize MISP's data validation features and workflows to improve data quality within MISP itself.
    *   If possible, prioritize data from trusted MISP communities or sources.
    *   Implement anomaly detection within the application to identify potentially suspicious threat intelligence data.
    *   Regularly audit MISP data sources and community trust levels.

## Threat: [Unintentional Exposure of Sensitive MISP Data within the Application](./threats/unintentional_exposure_of_sensitive_misp_data_within_the_application.md)

*   **Description:**  The application, while processing and potentially logging or storing MISP data, might unintentionally expose sensitive information contained within MISP events or attributes. This could occur through application logs, error messages, debugging outputs, insecure data storage, or vulnerabilities in the application's data handling.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive threat intelligence data, potentially revealing information about victims, sources, or ongoing investigations if MISP data contains such details, leading to privacy breaches, reputational damage, or compromised investigations.
*   **MISP Component Affected:** Events, Attributes, Objects (depending on the sensitivity of the data within them), potentially the API responses.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict logging policies, avoiding logging sensitive MISP data.
    *   Sanitize or redact sensitive information from logs and error messages.
    *   Securely store any MISP data cached or stored by the application, using encryption and access controls.
    *   Regularly review application code and configurations to identify and eliminate potential data leakage points.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when accessing and processing MISP data within the application.

## Threat: [Application Downtime due to MISP Unavailability](./threats/application_downtime_due_to_misp_unavailability.md)

*   **Description:** If the application critically depends on MISP for its operation, and MISP becomes unavailable (due to network issues, MISP server downtime, attacks on MISP), the application's functionality might be severely degraded or completely disrupted.
*   **Impact:** Loss of application functionality, reduced security posture if threat intelligence is essential, service disruption for users, potential financial losses due to downtime.
*   **MISP Component Affected:** Entire MISP instance, network connectivity to MISP, API endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement fallback mechanisms in the application to operate (possibly with reduced functionality) when MISP is unavailable.
    *   Implement caching of threat intelligence data within the application to reduce reliance on constant MISP connectivity.
    *   Monitor MISP availability and performance proactively.
    *   Consider deploying MISP in a highly available configuration (if feasible and necessary).
    *   Design the application to be resilient to temporary MISP outages.

## Threat: [Weak or Compromised MISP API Credentials](./threats/weak_or_compromised_misp_api_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  If the application uses API keys or other credentials to authenticate to MISP, weak credentials or insecure storage of these credentials (e.g., hardcoded, insecure configuration files) can lead to unauthorized access to the MISP API by attackers who compromise the application or its environment.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to MISP data, potential for attackers to manipulate MISP data if write access is granted, compromise of the application's integration with MISP, potentially leading to further attacks on MISP or the application.
*   **MISP Component Affected:** API authentication mechanisms, API keys, user accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong, randomly generated API keys for MISP authentication.
    *   Securely store API credentials using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secret managers).
    *   Avoid hardcoding API keys in the application code or configuration files.
    *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) on MISP API keys to restrict their permissions to the minimum necessary.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control on MISP API Endpoints](./threats/insufficient_access_control_on_misp_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:**  If MISP is not configured with granular access controls, the application might be granted excessive permissions to MISP API endpoints. This could allow the application (or an attacker exploiting a vulnerability in the application) to perform actions on MISP that it should not be authorized to do, such as modifying events, accessing sensitive data beyond its needs, or deleting information.
*   **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized actions on MISP, data breaches if excessive access is granted, compromise of MISP integrity, potential for denial of service if write access is misused.
*   **MISP Component Affected:** MISP's access control system, API endpoint permissions, user roles and permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure MISP with granular access controls, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   Grant the application only the necessary permissions to MISP API endpoints required for its functionality.
    *   Regularly review and audit MISP access control configurations.
    *   Use dedicated MISP API users for the application with restricted roles and permissions.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Application's Processing of MISP Data](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_application's_processing_of_misp_data.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities in the application's code that processes data received from MISP could be exploited by attackers. For example, if the application parses MISP data without proper input validation, it might be vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., command injection, path traversal) or other data processing flaws triggered by maliciously crafted data within MISP events.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, security vulnerabilities within the application itself (potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or other compromises), exploitation of the application's infrastructure.
*   **MISP Component Affected:** API responses, data formats (e.g., JSON, XML), application's data parsing and processing logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received from MISP.
    *   Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities in data processing.
    *   Regularly perform security testing (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis, penetration testing) of the application's MISP integration.
    *   Keep application dependencies and libraries up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
