# Attack Surface Analysis for misp/misp

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within MISP's database queries to inject malicious SQL code. This allows attackers to bypass MISP's intended data access controls and directly interact with the underlying database.
    *   **MISP Contribution:** MISP's core functionality relies on database interactions for storing and retrieving threat intelligence data (events, attributes, objects, etc.). Vulnerabilities in MISP's PHP code or modules that construct and execute SQL queries can introduce SQL injection points.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a specially crafted input within a MISP event attribute (e.g., a malicious URL or comment) that is not properly sanitized by MISP. When MISP processes this input in a database query (e.g., when searching or displaying events), the malicious SQL code is executed, potentially allowing the attacker to extract sensitive MISP data like user credentials, API keys, or threat intelligence details.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical Data Breach:** Exposure of highly sensitive threat intelligence data, user credentials (including administrator accounts), and potentially MISP API keys stored in the database.
        *   **Critical Data Manipulation:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of critical threat intelligence data, leading to data integrity compromise and potentially disrupting security operations relying on MISP.
        *   **Critical System Compromise:** In severe cases, successful SQL injection can be leveraged to execute operating system commands on the database server, leading to full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Parameterized Queries:** Enforce the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements throughout MISP's codebase and all custom modules. This is the primary defense against SQL injection.
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all user-provided data processed by MISP before it is used in database queries. Use appropriate escaping functions provided by the database library.
        *   **Database User Least Privilege:** Configure the database user account used by MISP with the absolute minimum privileges necessary for its operation. Restrict permissions to only the required tables and actions.
        *   **Regular MISP Security Updates:**  Apply all security updates released by the MISP project promptly. These updates often include patches for identified SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Reviews Focused on Database Interactions:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on areas of MISP code that interact with the database to identify and remediate potential SQL injection flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into MISP web pages that are then executed in the browsers of other MISP users. This allows attackers to manipulate the user's session and potentially gain unauthorized access or steal data.
    *   **MISP Contribution:** MISP's web interface displays user-generated content extensively, including event details, attribute values, object descriptions, galaxy information, and comments. If MISP fails to properly sanitize this user-provided content before displaying it, XSS vulnerabilities can be introduced.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a MISP event's "analysis" field. When a legitimate MISP user views this event, the malicious script executes in their browser within the context of the MISP application. This script could steal the user's session cookie, redirect them to a malicious site, or perform actions on their behalf within MISP.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High Account Compromise:** Stealing MISP user session cookies or credentials, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially including administrator accounts.
        *   **High Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive threat intelligence data displayed within the MISP interface, potentially including private event details or user information.
        *   **High Malware Distribution:** Using XSS vulnerabilities within MISP to redirect users to external websites hosting malware or phishing attacks, leveraging the trust users have in the MISP platform.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Output Encoding:** Implement strict output encoding for all user-generated content displayed by MISP. Use context-aware encoding appropriate for the output context (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML content, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript contexts).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Enforcement:** Implement and enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) for the MISP web application. This significantly reduces the impact of XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources and execute scripts.
        *   **Regular Security Scanning for XSS:** Utilize automated security scanners specifically designed to detect XSS vulnerabilities in web applications and integrate these scans into the MISP development and deployment pipeline.
        *   **User Education on XSS Risks:** Educate MISP users about the risks of XSS and the importance of reporting any suspicious behavior or unexpected prompts within the MISP interface.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Leakage and Insecure API Access](./attack_surfaces/api_key_leakage_and_insecure_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure or insecure management of MISP API keys, granting unauthorized access to MISP's powerful API. This allows attackers to bypass the web interface and directly interact with MISP's data and functionalities programmatically.
    *   **MISP Contribution:** MISP provides a comprehensive REST API for automation and integration. API keys are the primary authentication mechanism for this API.  Vulnerabilities in how MISP generates, stores, transmits, or manages these API keys can lead to unauthorized API access.
    *   **Example:** A MISP administrator inadvertently commits an API key to a public Git repository while managing MISP configuration. An attacker discovers this exposed API key and uses it to access the MISP API, potentially exfiltrating large volumes of threat intelligence data, creating or modifying events, or even deleting critical information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High Data Breach via API:** Unauthorized access to and large-scale exfiltration of sensitive threat intelligence data through the MISP API, potentially bypassing web interface access controls.
        *   **High Data Manipulation via API:** Unauthorized modification, creation, or deletion of data within MISP through API calls, leading to data integrity issues and potential disruption of MISP operations.
        *   **High Denial of Service (DoS) via API Abuse:** Abusing the API with leaked keys to overload the MISP server with excessive requests, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure API Key Generation and Storage:** Generate cryptographically strong, random API keys using secure methods. Store API keys securely using dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, environment variables, encrypted configuration files). Never hardcode API keys directly in code or configuration files committed to version control.
        *   **API Key Rotation Policy:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of MISP API keys to limit the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for API Keys:** Grant API keys only the minimum necessary permissions required for their intended purpose. Utilize MISP's role-based access control to restrict API key capabilities. Create separate API keys for different integrations with varying levels of access.
        *   **API Rate Limiting and Monitoring:** Implement robust rate limiting on MISP API endpoints to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks. Monitor API usage logs for suspicious activity and unauthorized access attempts.
        *   **Secure API Key Transmission:** Transmit API keys securely over HTTPS. Avoid passing API keys in URL parameters. Use secure header-based authentication for API requests.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_module_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting security vulnerabilities present in third-party modules or extensions installed within MISP. These modules, while extending MISP's functionality, can introduce new attack vectors if they are not developed and maintained securely.
    *   **MISP Contribution:** MISP's modular architecture encourages the use of extensions and modules to enhance its capabilities. However, the security of these modules is often outside the direct control of the core MISP development team and relies on the security practices of third-party module developers.
    *   **Example:** A MISP administrator installs a seemingly useful third-party module for importing threat intelligence data from a specific, less common format. This module, however, contains an unpatched vulnerability (e.g., a command injection flaw or insecure deserialization issue). An attacker exploits this vulnerability in the module to gain remote code execution on the MISP server, compromising the entire MISP instance.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical System Compromise via Module Vulnerability:** Remote code execution on the MISP server, leading to full system compromise, data breach, and potential disruption of MISP services.
        *   **High Data Breach via Module Vulnerability:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within MISP through vulnerabilities in modules that handle or process threat intelligence data.
        *   **High Denial of Service (DoS) via Module Vulnerability:** Module vulnerabilities could lead to system crashes, resource exhaustion, or other forms of denial of service affecting MISP availability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Module Vetting and Selection:** Exercise extreme caution when selecting and installing third-party MISP modules. Thoroughly vet modules from untrusted sources. Prioritize modules from reputable developers or organizations with a proven track record of security. Review module code if possible before installation.
        *   **Regular Module Security Updates and Patching:**  Actively monitor for and apply security updates and patches for all installed third-party modules. Subscribe to module developer security mailing lists or watch module repositories for security announcements.
        *   **Dependency Management for Modules:** Ensure that modules and their dependencies are kept up-to-date. Vulnerable dependencies within modules can also introduce security risks.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Modules:** Run modules with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid granting modules excessive permissions that are not essential for their functionality.
        *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing of Modules:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing of installed third-party modules, especially those that handle sensitive data or have elevated privileges. Focus on modules that interact with external systems or process untrusted data.
        *   **Module Sandboxing or Isolation (Advanced):** For highly sensitive MISP deployments, consider using containerization or sandboxing techniques to isolate third-party modules from the core MISP system. This can limit the impact of vulnerabilities within modules.
