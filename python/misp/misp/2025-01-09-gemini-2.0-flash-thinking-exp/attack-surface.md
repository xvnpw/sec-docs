# Attack Surface Analysis for misp/misp

## Attack Surface: [Compromised MISP API Key](./attack_surfaces/compromised_misp_api_key.md)

*   **Description:** The API key used by the application to authenticate with the MISP instance is exposed or stolen.
*   **How MISP Contributes:** The application relies on this key to interact with MISP. If compromised, the entire interaction is vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits the API key to a public code repository. An attacker finds it and uses it to access and manipulate data in the connected MISP instance.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive threat intelligence data, potential modification or deletion of data in MISP, potentially impacting other users of the MISP instance, and the ability to inject false positives or negatives into the application's decision-making process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never hardcode API keys in the application code.
    *   Use secure storage mechanisms for API keys (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Implement proper access controls on where the API key is stored and who can access it.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys.
    *   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection via Unsanitized MISP Data](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_via_unsanitized_misp_data.md)

*   **Description:** The application processes data received from the MISP API without proper sanitization or validation, allowing malicious data to be interpreted as commands or injected into other systems.
*   **How MISP Contributes:** MISP data, while intended for security purposes, can contain free-form text fields that could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the receiving application.
*   **Example:** A MISP event contains a malicious payload in the description field. The application directly uses this description in a system command without sanitization, leading to command injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server, data breaches, denial of service, or other security compromises depending on where the unsanitized data is used.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization of all data received from the MISP API before using it.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when using MISP data in database interactions.
    *   Avoid directly executing commands based on unsanitized MISP data.
    *   Implement proper output encoding when displaying MISP data in user interfaces to prevent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on MISP API Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_misp_api_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and the MISP API is intercepted by an attacker.
*   **How MISP Contributes:** The application's reliance on external communication with MISP introduces a potential point of interception.
*   **Example:** The application connects to the MISP API over HTTP instead of HTTPS, or fails to properly validate the SSL/TLS certificate. An attacker on the network intercepts the communication, steals the API key, or modifies data being exchanged.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of the API key, modification of threat intelligence data being exchanged, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior or further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use HTTPS for communication with the MISP API.
    *   Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate validation to prevent MITM attacks.
    *   Consider using VPNs or other secure channels for communication if necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the MISP Client Library](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_misp_client_library.md)

*   **Description:** The specific MISP client library used by the application contains security vulnerabilities.
*   **How MISP Contributes:** The application's interaction with MISP relies on this external library, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in it.
*   **Example:** The application uses an outdated version of the PyMISP library that has a known vulnerability allowing for remote code execution when processing certain API responses.
*   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, or other security compromises depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the client library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the MISP client library and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the specific client library being used.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when using the client library.
