# Threat Model Analysis for misp/misp

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection into MISP](./threats/malicious_data_injection_into_misp.md)

**Description:** An attacker, having compromised the application or exploiting a vulnerability within it, could use the application's API credentials to inject false positives, incorrect indicators, or even malicious data directly into the MISP instance. This could involve crafting API requests to create or modify events and attributes with misleading information.

**Impact:** Corruption of the shared threat intelligence within MISP, leading to incorrect security decisions for other users of the platform and potentially for the application itself if it relies on this poisoned data. This can also erode trust in the MISP instance.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Compromised MISP Instance Serving Malicious Data](./threats/compromised_misp_instance_serving_malicious_data.md)

**Description:** If the MISP instance itself is compromised by an attacker, it could serve the application with manipulated or malicious threat intelligence through its API. The application, trusting the source, might then act on this false information.

**Impact:** The application could make incorrect security decisions, potentially blocking legitimate traffic, allowing malicious activity, or taking other inappropriate actions based on the flawed intelligence.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on MISP API Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_misp_api_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept the communication between the application and the MISP API, potentially modifying the threat intelligence being returned to the application or the data being sent to MISP. This could be achieved through network attacks if HTTPS is not properly implemented or certificate validation is disabled.

**Impact:** The application might receive and act upon tampered threat intelligence, leading to incorrect security decisions. Conversely, data sent to MISP could be altered, leading to data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exposure of MISP API Keys or Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_misp_api_keys_or_credentials.md)

**Description:** If the application's API keys or authentication credentials for accessing the MISP instance are stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in the code, stored in plaintext configuration files) or are leaked, attackers could gain unauthorized access to the MISP instance.

**Impact:** Attackers could read sensitive threat intelligence, inject malicious data, or perform other actions on the MISP instance using the compromised credentials, potentially impacting other users and the application itself.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Weak or Stolen MISP API Keys Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/weak_or_stolen_misp_api_keys_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** Using weak or easily guessable API keys for MISP access increases the risk of unauthorized access. If these keys are stolen, attackers can impersonate the application.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to MISP data, potentially leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or denial of service on the MISP instance.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Failure to Validate MISP Certificates Leading to MITM](./threats/failure_to_validate_misp_certificates_leading_to_mitm.md)

**Description:** If the application does not properly validate the SSL/TLS certificate of the MISP instance, it could be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, even if HTTPS is used.

**Impact:**  Attackers could intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and MISP.

**Risk Severity:** High
