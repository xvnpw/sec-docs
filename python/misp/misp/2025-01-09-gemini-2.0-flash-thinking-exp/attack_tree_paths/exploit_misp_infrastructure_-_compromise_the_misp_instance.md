* **Attack Vector: Gaining unauthorized physical access to the MISP server.**

    * **Technical Details:** This involves physically breaching the security of the server room or data center where the MISP server is located.
        * **Methods:** This could involve bypassing physical security controls like locks, security guards, or surveillance systems. It could also involve insider threats where someone with legitimate physical access abuses their privileges.
    * **Potential Impact:** Physical access can grant the attacker direct access to the server, allowing them to:
        * **Install malware:** Directly install malicious software on the server.
        * **Steal sensitive data:** Copy data directly from the server's storage.
        * **Manipulate the system:** Modify system configurations or install backdoors.
        * **Cause physical damage:** Disrupt the server's operation.
    * **Mitigation Focus (Specific to this vector):**
        * **Physical Security Controls:** Implement strong physical security measures for the server room, including:
            * **Access Control:** Restrict physical access to authorized personnel only using key cards, biometric scanners, or other access control systems.
            * **Surveillance Systems:** Implement CCTV cameras and monitoring systems to deter and record unauthorized access.
            * **Security Guards:** Employ security personnel to monitor access points and patrol the premises.
