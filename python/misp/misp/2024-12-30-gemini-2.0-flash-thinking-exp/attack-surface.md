### Key Attack Surface List: MISP Integration (High & Critical, MISP-Specific)

Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving MISP, focusing on high and critical severity risks:

*   **Attack Surface: Compromised MISP API Key**
    *   **Description:** The API key used by the application to authenticate with the MISP instance is exposed or stolen.
    *   **How MISP Contributes:** The application relies on this key to interact with the MISP API, making it a critical credential. MISP's authentication mechanism centers around these API keys.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits the API key to a public code repository. An attacker finds the key and uses it to access and manipulate data within the connected MISP instance.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to MISP data, potential data manipulation (adding, modifying, deleting indicators), and the ability to perform actions within MISP as the application. This could lead to poisoning threat intelligence data or disrupting MISP operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Secret Management:** Utilize secure vault solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage the API key.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Store the API key as an environment variable, avoiding hardcoding in the application.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the API key has only the necessary permissions required for the application's functionality within MISP.
        *   **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating the MISP API key.
        *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to the systems and environments where the API key is stored.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Handling of MISP Data**
    *   **Description:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize data received from the MISP instance before using it.
    *   **How MISP Contributes:** MISP provides threat intelligence data, which, if not handled carefully, can be a source of malicious content. The application's reliance on this external data stream introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a MISP attribute (e.g., a comment). The application retrieves this data and renders it in a web interface without proper sanitization, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (if MISP data is used in database queries), Command Injection (if MISP data is used in system commands), and other injection vulnerabilities. This can lead to account compromise, data theft, or system takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all data received from the MISP API, ensuring it conforms to expected formats and types.
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Encode or escape data received from MISP before displaying it in any user interface to prevent XSS.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when using MISP data in database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Command Sanitization:** Sanitize any MISP data used in system commands to prevent command injection.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface: Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on MISP Communication**
    *   **Description:** Communication between the application and the MISP instance is intercepted and potentially manipulated by an attacker.
    *   **How MISP Contributes:** The application needs to communicate with the external MISP instance to retrieve and potentially send data. This communication channel is a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** The application communicates with the MISP instance over HTTP instead of HTTPS. An attacker on the network intercepts the communication and reads or modifies the data being exchanged, potentially gaining access to API keys or manipulating threat intelligence data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (including API keys), manipulation of threat intelligence data, and potential compromise of the application or the MISP instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all communication between the application and the MISP instance uses HTTPS with valid and trusted certificates.
        *   **Certificate Validation:** Implement proper certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks using forged certificates.
        *   **VPN or Secure Network:** If possible, establish a VPN or secure network connection between the application and the MISP instance.
