Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the MISP component:

*   **Threat:** Poisoned Threat Intelligence Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the MISP instance (either through compromised credentials or by exploiting vulnerabilities in MISP itself) injects false or misleading threat intelligence data, such as incorrect indicators or fabricated events, into the MISP database. This could be done through the MISP web interface or the MISP API.
    *   **Impact:** The integrating application might take incorrect security actions based on this false data. This could lead to blocking legitimate traffic (false positives), failing to block actual threats (false negatives), or wasting resources on investigating non-existent threats.
    *   **Which https://github.com/misp/misp component is affected:** MISP Event data structure, Attribute data structure, potentially the MISP API endpoints used for event creation/modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust validation and verification mechanisms for data received from MISP.
        *   Prioritize data from trusted MISP organizations and sources.
        *   Implement a feedback loop to report potentially false positives back to MISP administrators for review.
        *   Consider using multiple MISP instances or threat intelligence feeds for cross-validation.
        *   Monitor MISP logs for suspicious activity related to data modification.

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering in Transit (MISP to Application)
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the MISP instance and the integrating application (e.g., API calls) and modifies the threat intelligence data being transmitted. This could involve techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to poisoned data, the application might make incorrect security decisions based on the altered data.
    *   **Which https://github.com/misp/misp component is affected:** MISP API endpoints used for data retrieval, the communication channel itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication between the application and the MISP API.
        *   If available, utilize API features for data integrity verification (e.g., signatures or checksums).
        *   Ensure the application properly validates the data received from MISP, even if HTTPS is used.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of MISP API Keys/Credentials within Application
    *   **Description:** MISP API keys or credentials used by the application are inadvertently exposed, for example, by being hardcoded in the application's source code, stored in insecure configuration files, or leaked through logging.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized individuals could gain access to the MISP instance with the application's privileges, allowing them to retrieve sensitive data, inject malicious data, or disrupt the MISP instance.
    *   **Which https://github.com/misp/misp component is affected:**  Potentially all MISP API endpoints, depending on the permissions associated with the compromised keys.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode API keys or credentials in the application's source code.
        *   Use secure methods for storing and managing API keys (e.g., environment variables, dedicated secrets management solutions).
        *   Implement proper access controls and logging for accessing and using API keys within the application.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
