### Vulnerability List for django-admin-interface

* Vulnerability Name: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG Logo Upload

* Description:
    1. An attacker with administrative privileges logs into the Django admin panel.
    2. The attacker navigates to the "Admin Interface" section and selects "Themes".
    3. The attacker edits the currently active theme or creates a new theme.
    4. In the "Logo" field, the attacker uploads a malicious SVG file. This SVG file contains embedded JavaScript code designed to execute when the SVG image is rendered by a web browser. For example, the SVG file could contain code like `<svg><script>alert("XSS")</script></svg>`.
    5. The attacker saves the theme configuration.
    6. When any administrator subsequently accesses any page within the Django admin panel, the uploaded SVG logo is rendered as part of the admin interface.
    7. Because the SVG contains malicious JavaScript, this script executes within the administrator's browser session, in the security context of the admin panel's domain.

* Impact:
    - Account Takeover: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of an administrator viewing the admin panel. This can lead to session hijacking by stealing session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the administrator and gain full control over the Django application and its data.
    - Data Breach: The attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of the administrator, including viewing, modifying, or deleting data. Sensitive information accessible to the administrator could be exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server.
    - Privilege Escalation: If the compromised administrator account has permissions to manage users or roles, the attacker might be able to escalate privileges, create new administrative accounts, or compromise other users.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - File Extension Validation: The `Theme` model's `logo` and `favicon` fields utilize Django's `FileExtensionValidator`. This validator restricts the types of files that can be uploaded, allowing only `gif`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, and `svg` extensions for logos and additionally `ico` for favicons. While this provides some level of protection against uploading executable files directly, it does not prevent the upload of malicious SVG files, which are valid image files but can contain embedded scripts.
    - Mitigation Location: `admin_interface/models.py` in the `Theme` model definition for `logo` and `favicon` fields.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - SVG Sanitization: The most critical missing mitigation is the sanitization of uploaded SVG files. Before storing and serving SVG logos and favicons, the application should process these files to remove any potentially malicious or executable code, such as `<script>` tags, `onclick` attributes, and other event handlers. Libraries like `defusedxml` or specialized SVG sanitizers should be employed.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) would significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities. A properly configured CSP can restrict the sources from which the admin panel can load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) and can prevent inline JavaScript execution. This would act as a defense-in-depth measure.
    - Input Validation for Filenames: While not directly related to XSS, sanitizing filenames of uploaded files can prevent other potential issues, such as path traversal vulnerabilities if filenames are used in file system operations.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the Django admin panel.
    - The attacker must have permissions to edit or create `Theme` objects within the admin panel.
    - The `admin_interface` application must be installed and configured in a Django project.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. `admin_interface/models.py`:
        ```python
        class Theme(models.Model):
            # ...
            logo = models.FileField(
                upload_to="admin-interface/logo/",
                blank=True,
                validators=[
                    FileExtensionValidator(
                        allowed_extensions=["gif", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "svg"]
                    )
                ],
                help_text=_("Leave blank to use the default Django logo"),
                verbose_name=_("logo"),
            )
            # ...
        ```
        - The `logo` field is defined as a `FileField`, allowing file uploads.
        - `FileExtensionValidator` is used to limit file extensions to image types, including `svg`.
        - There is no sanitization or further processing of the uploaded SVG content within the model or during file handling.

    2. `admin_interface/admin.py`:
        ```python
        @admin.register(Theme)
        class ThemeAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
            # ...
            fieldsets = (
                (
                    _("Logo"),
                    {
                        "classes": ("wide",),
                        "fields": (
                            "logo",
                            # ...
                        ),
                    },
                ),
                # ...
            )
            # ...
        ```
        - `ThemeAdmin` registers the `Theme` model in the Django admin.
        - The `logo` field is exposed in the admin form within the "Logo" fieldset, allowing administrators to upload and modify the logo.

    3. `admin_interface/templatetags/admin_interface_tags.py` and Templates (not provided, assumed `admin_interface/base.html`):
        - Template tags like `get_admin_interface_theme` and `get_admin_interface_setting` are used to retrieve theme settings, including the logo.
        - In the base admin template (`admin_interface/base.html`), the logo URL obtained from the theme settings is likely directly rendered within an `<img>` tag or similar HTML element.
        - If the SVG logo file path is directly inserted into the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag without sanitization, the browser will render the SVG, including any embedded JavaScript.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Pre-requisites:
        - Ensure you have a running Django application with `django-admin-interface` installed and configured.
        - Create a superuser account for administrative access.
    2. Create a malicious SVG file:
        - Create a new text file named `xss.svg` and paste the following content into it:
            ```xml
            <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 200 200">
              <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability in Logo");</script>
              <text x="10" y="20">Test SVG</text>
            </svg>
            ```
    3. Log in to the Django Admin Panel:
        - Open your web browser and navigate to the admin panel of your Django application (e.g., `/admin/`).
        - Log in using your superuser credentials.
    4. Navigate to Theme settings:
        - In the admin dashboard, find the "Admin Interface" section and click on "Themes".
        - You will see a list of themes. Either edit the "Django" theme or create a new theme by clicking "Add Theme".
    5. Upload the malicious SVG logo:
        - In the theme edit/create form, locate the "Logo" field.
        - Click on "Choose File" and select the `xss.svg` file you created in step 2.
        - Click "Save" to save the theme with the malicious logo.
    6. Verify the XSS vulnerability:
        - After saving, navigate to any other page within the Django admin panel, such as the dashboard or any model's changelist view.
        - Observe your browser window. If a JavaScript alert box pops up displaying the message "XSS Vulnerability in Logo", it confirms that the XSS vulnerability is present. The JavaScript code embedded in the SVG logo has been executed.

This test case demonstrates that uploading a malicious SVG logo can lead to Stored XSS in the Django admin interface when using `django-admin-interface`.
