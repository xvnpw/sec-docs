### Vulnerability List

*   #### Vulnerability Name: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG Logo Upload
    *   Description:
        1.  An attacker with admin privileges logs into the Django admin panel.
        2.  The attacker navigates to the "Themes" section and selects the active theme or creates a new theme.
        3.  In the theme configuration form, the attacker uploads a malicious SVG file as the logo. This SVG file contains embedded JavaScript code designed for XSS.
        4.  The attacker saves the theme configuration.
        5.  When another admin user views the Django admin panel, the malicious SVG logo is rendered in their browser.
        6.  The embedded JavaScript code within the SVG logo executes in the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or deface the admin panel.
    *   Impact: Account Takeover, Data Breach, Admin Panel Defacement. If an attacker successfully executes JavaScript in the admin panel, they can potentially gain full control over the admin account, access sensitive data managed through the admin panel, or deface the admin interface to cause disruption or misinformation.
    *   Vulnerability Rank: high
    *   Currently implemented mitigations: File extension validation is implemented using `FileExtensionValidator` on `logo` and `favicon` fields in `/code/admin_interface/models.py`. This prevents uploading files with disallowed extensions, but it does not sanitize file content.
    *   Missing mitigations:
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which resources can be loaded, which can help mitigate XSS attacks.
        *   SVG sanitization on logo and favicon uploads to remove potentially malicious scripts or elements from uploaded SVG files.
    *   Preconditions: Admin user access to the Django admin panel.
    *   Source code analysis:
        1.  File: `/code/admin_interface/models.py`
        2.  The `Theme` model is defined, including `logo` and `favicon` fields:
            ```python
            class Theme(models.Model):
                # ...
                logo = models.FileField(
                    upload_to="admin-interface/logo/",
                    blank=True,
                    validators=[
                        FileExtensionValidator(
                            allowed_extensions=["gif", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "svg"]
                        )
                    ],
                    help_text=_("Leave blank to use the default Django logo"),
                    verbose_name=_("logo"),
                )
                favicon = models.FileField(
                    upload_to="admin-interface/favicon/",
                    blank=True,
                    validators=[
                        FileExtensionValidator(
                            allowed_extensions=["gif", "ico", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "svg"]
                        )
                    ],
                    help_text=_("(.ico|.png|.gif - 16x16|32x32 px)"),
                    verbose_name=_("favicon"),
                )
                # ...
            ```
        3.  `FileExtensionValidator` is used to validate the extension of uploaded files for `logo` and `favicon`.
        4.  This validator only checks if the file extension is in the allowed list (`["gif", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "svg"]` for logo and `["gif", "ico", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "svg"]` for favicon). It does not perform any content sanitization.
        5.  If an admin uploads a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code as the logo, and the application renders this logo without sanitization, the JavaScript code within the SVG can be executed in the context of the admin user's browser, leading to XSS.
    *   Security test case:
        1.  Log in to the Django admin panel as an administrator.
        2.  Navigate to the "Admin Interface" > "Themes".
        3.  Click "Add Theme" or select the current active theme to edit.
        4.  In the "Logo" field, upload a file named "xss.svg" with the following content:
            ```xml
            <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
            <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
            <svg width="200" height="200" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
              <script type="text/javascript">
                alert('XSS Vulnerability');
              </script>
              <text x="0" y="15" fill="red">SVG Image</text>
            </svg>
            ```
        5.  Save the theme.
        6.  Navigate to any other admin page within the same domain (e.g., the dashboard or any model list page).
        7.  Observe if an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability" is displayed. If the alert box appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.
