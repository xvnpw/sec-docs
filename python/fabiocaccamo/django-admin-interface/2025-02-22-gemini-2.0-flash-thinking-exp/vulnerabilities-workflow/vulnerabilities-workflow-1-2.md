- **Vulnerability Name:** Stored Cross‐Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious SVG File Upload

  - **Description:**
    The project’s theme customization allows administrators to upload logo and favicon files via Django’s FileField. Both the “logo” and “favicon” fields permit files with a “.svg” extension. Since the only check is performed by Django’s FileExtensionValidator (which only verifies the file’s extension), an attacker who gains the ability to submit a file upload (for example by abusing an admin session via CSRF or compromised credentials) can supply a specially crafted SVG file embedding malicious JavaScript. When the uploaded SVG is later rendered (for instance, in the header or favicon of the admin interface), the malicious code will execute in the browser of any administrator viewing the page.

    **Step-by-step trigger scenario:**
    1. The attacker crafts an SVG file (for example, named “malicious.svg”) that embeds JavaScript (such as an alert or a payload to steal session cookies).
    2. By bypassing administrative protections (e.g. via CSRF manipulation or leveraging weak / compromised admin credentials), the attacker accesses the Theme administration interface.
    3. The attacker uploads the malicious SVG file in one of the upload fields (either the “logo” or the “favicon” field) when editing or creating a Theme instance.
    4. The file is accepted because the validator only checks the extension – the file content is not sanitized.
    5. Later, when an administrator loads a page where that uploaded graphic is used (for example, the admin header or favicon display on the login page), the browser renders the SVG and executes the embedded JavaScript code.

  - **Impact:**
    An attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the administrative interface. This may lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive credentials, and further compromise of the application or its users. The attack is “stored” because the malicious file is persistently saved and repeatedly served until corrected.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The file fields in the Theme model use Django’s built‑in FileExtensionValidator to restrict uploads to specific extensions (including “svg”).
    - The allowed extensions list is documented and enforced at the model level.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No content validation or sanitization is performed on the uploaded SVG files.
    - There is no check on the MIME type or an XML/SVG parser that could strip or reject embedded scripts.
    - Relying solely on a filename extension check is insufficient to determine the safety of an SVG file.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to trigger the file upload functionality (for example, by exploiting a CSRF weakness or using stolen/weak admin credentials).
    - The uploaded file must have a “.svg” extension and include malicious inline JavaScript.
    - The application must later render the uploaded file in a context (such as an admin header or favicon) where the browser will interpret and execute the SVG content.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **Location:** In the file `admin_interface/models.py` the Theme model is defined.
    - **Example snippet for “logo”:**
      ```python
      logo = models.FileField(
          upload_to="admin-interface/logo/",
          blank=True,
          validators=[
              FileExtensionValidator(
                  allowed_extensions=["gif", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "svg"]
              )
          ],
          help_text=_("Leave blank to use the default Django logo"),
          verbose_name=_("logo"),
      )
      ```
    - **Observation:**
      The validator only ensures that the uploaded file’s extension is one of the allowed types. There is no further inspection of the file’s internal content. This allows an attacker to upload a file with a “.svg” extension that contains malicious JavaScript payload embedded within SVG tags.
    - **Workflow Visualization:**
      1. **User Action:** Upload a file named “malicious.svg” with embedded `<script>` tags.
      2. **Backend Handling:** The FileField in the Theme model accepts the file because it passes the extension check.
      3. **Serving:** Later, when the Theme is rendered (e.g. as a logo or favicon), the SVG file is served as is and the browser executes the embedded script.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
       - Ensure you have administrative access to the Django admin interface (or simulate a CSRF scenario if testing without full authentication).
       - Create a malicious SVG file (e.g., `malicious.svg`) with content such as:
         ```xml
         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
         <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
           <script>alert('XSS');</script>
           <rect width="100" height="100" fill="red"/>
         </svg>
         ```
    2. **Upload:**
       - Log in to the Django admin interface and navigate to the Theme configuration page (provided by the `admin_interface` app).
       - Edit an existing Theme (or create a new one) and in the “logo” (or “favicon”) field, upload the malicious SVG file.
    3. **Save Changes:**
       - Save the Theme instance so that the malicious SVG is stored on the server.
    4. **Trigger:**
       - Navigate to a page in the admin interface where the uploaded logo or favicon is rendered (for example, the admin dashboard or the login screen if the logo appears there).
       - Observe whether a JavaScript alert (or other injected behavior) is executed.
    5. **Result:**
       - If the alert is triggered, this confirms that the SVG file is being rendered without proper sanitization, allowing stored XSS.

This vulnerability highlights the need for additional security checks on file uploads—especially when allowing file types like SVG that can include active content. A recommended mitigation is to implement content scanning or sanitization for SVG files (for example, using a dedicated SVG sanitizer library or validating the MIME type and XML content) and to consider restricting such uploads to trusted users only.
