# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for commaai/openpilot

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **CAN Message Whitelist (in `messaging` and `can` modules):**  Implement a strict, comprehensive whitelist of allowed CAN message IDs and data fields *within the openpilot code*.  Reject any message not on this list. This is the first line of defense against malicious CAN injection.
    2.  **Data Range Checks (per message/field):**  For each allowed CAN message and data field, define and enforce minimum and maximum acceptable values within the message processing logic.  Reject any data outside these bounds.
    3.  **Rate Limiting (for dynamic values):**  Implement rate limiting for rapidly changing values (steering, acceleration).  Track previous values and timestamps, and reject changes exceeding defined limits.
    4.  **Redundancy and Cross-Validation (using multiple sensors):**  Where multiple sensors provide the same data (e.g., speed), compare values within openpilot and flag/reject discrepancies exceeding a threshold.
    5.  **Checksum/Integrity Checks (on CAN and sensor data):**  Verify checksums or other integrity checks provided by the CAN protocol or sensor data streams *before* processing the data within openpilot.
    6.  **Temporal Consistency Checks (beyond rate limiting):**  Implement logic to detect physically impossible changes in sensor data (e.g., instantaneous acceleration changes).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CAN Bus Injection Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Directly prevents malicious CAN messages from affecting openpilot's behavior.
    *   **Sensor Spoofing (Severity: Critical):**  Reduces the impact of manipulated sensor data.
    *   **Faulty Sensor Data (Severity: High):**  Helps detect and reject erroneous data from malfunctioning sensors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CAN Bus Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (critical to low/negligible).
    *   **Sensor Spoofing:** Risk significantly reduced (critical to moderate/low).
    *   **Faulty Sensor Data:** Risk significantly reduced (high to moderate/low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial implementation exists in `messaging` and `can` related modules.  Basic message ID checks and some data range checks are present.  Some redundancy checking exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Whitelist:**  The whitelist needs to be more rigorous and cover all potential attack vectors.
    *   **Consistent Rate Limiting:**  Rate limiting needs to be applied more consistently to all relevant data fields.
    *   **Advanced Temporal Consistency:**  More sophisticated temporal consistency checks are needed.
    *   **Formal Verification:**  Formal methods could be used to verify the correctness of the input handling code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Boot and Code Signing Verification](./mitigation_strategies/secure_boot_and_code_signing_verification.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Signature Verification (at boot):**  Before executing the openpilot software, the bootloader (or a dedicated verification module) *must* verify the digital signature of the openpilot code against a trusted public key. This is typically handled by the underlying operating system and bootloader, but openpilot should *rely* on this verification.
    2.  **Integrity Checks (during runtime):**  Implement periodic (or event-triggered) integrity checks *within* the running openpilot process.  This could involve calculating a hash of the loaded code and comparing it to a known-good hash. This detects runtime modifications.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Software Replacement (Severity: Critical):**  Ensures that only authorized, signed openpilot code is executed.
    *   **Unauthorized Code Modification (Severity: High):**  Detects modifications to the openpilot code after it has been loaded.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Software Replacement:** Risk significantly reduced (critical to low/negligible).
    *   **Unauthorized Code Modification:** Risk reduced (high to moderate/low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Initial signature verification at boot is generally implemented (relies on the underlying OS and bootloader).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Runtime Integrity Checks:**  Continuous or periodic integrity checks *within* the running openpilot process are likely not fully implemented. This is a key area for improvement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation and Isolation](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation_and_isolation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Firewall Rules (on panda):**  Configure strict firewall rules on the panda interface (or any gateway device) to allow *only* necessary communication between openpilot and the vehicle's CAN bus.  This is a "deny all, allow only specific" policy.
    2.  **Limited Network Services (within openpilot):**  Disable any unnecessary network services (e.g., SSH, Telnet) running *within* the openpilot software or on the EON device.  Minimize the network attack surface.
    3.  **VLAN Configuration (if supported):** If the vehicle and network infrastructure support VLANs, configure VLANs to logically separate openpilot-related CAN traffic from other network traffic. This is often configured on the panda or a network switch.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement (Severity: High):**  Makes it harder for attackers to reach openpilot from other compromised systems.
    *   **Network-Based Attacks (Severity: Moderate):**  Reduces the attack surface by limiting exposed services.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Risk significantly reduced (high to moderate/low).
    *   **Network-Based Attacks:** Risk reduced (moderate to low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The panda provides *some* isolation.
    *   Some network services may be disabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Strict Firewall Rules:**  Panda firewall rules need to be thoroughly reviewed and tightened.
    *   **Comprehensive Service Hardening:**  A complete audit and disabling of unnecessary services on the EON and within openpilot is needed.
    *   **VLAN Configuration:**  VLAN usage is likely inconsistent and depends on the specific installation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Runtime Monitoring and Anomaly Detection](./mitigation_strategies/runtime_monitoring_and_anomaly_detection.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Behavioral Monitoring (within `controls` and other modules):**  Implement code to monitor the behavior of openpilot and its interactions with the vehicle.  Detect deviations from expected behavior (e.g., unexpected steering commands, inconsistent sensor data).
    2.  **Resource Monitoring (within openpilot):**  Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic of the openpilot process.  Detect unusual spikes or patterns.
    3.  **Safety Watchdog (software-based, within openpilot):** Implement a *software-based* watchdog timer within openpilot.  This is *less* secure than a hardware watchdog, but still provides some protection.  If the main openpilot process fails to "pet" the watchdog, it should trigger a safe shutdown or disengagement.
    4.  **Logging and Auditing (within openpilot):**  Log all relevant events (sensor data, control commands, anomalies) to a secure location.  This is crucial for post-incident analysis.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Severity: High):**  Can help detect and mitigate the effects of unknown vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sophisticated Attacks (Severity: High):**  Can detect attacks that bypass preventative measures.
    *   **Software Bugs (Severity: Moderate):**  Can help detect and mitigate unexpected software errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Risk reduced (high to moderate).
    *   **Sophisticated Attacks:** Risk reduced (high to moderate).
    *   **Software Bugs:** Risk reduced (moderate to low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some basic runtime monitoring and safety checks exist (e.g., in the `controls safety` module).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Behavioral Monitoring:**  More extensive and sophisticated behavioral monitoring is needed.
    *   **Robust Resource Monitoring:**  More detailed resource monitoring is needed.
    *   **Software Watchdog (Robust Implementation):**  A more robust software-based watchdog timer could be implemented.
    *   **Comprehensive Logging and Auditing:**  The logging system needs to be more comprehensive and secure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [OTA Update Security](./mitigation_strategies/ota_update_security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Signature Verification (before installation):**  The openpilot update mechanism *must* verify the digital signature of the update package before installation.
    2.  **Integrity Checks (before installation):**  Verify the integrity of the update package (e.g., using a hash) before installation.
    3.  **Rollback Mechanism (within openpilot):**  Implement a robust mechanism to roll back to the previous version if an update fails or causes problems. This should be part of the openpilot update process.
    4. **Atomic Updates (within openpilot):** Ensure that updates are applied atomically â€“ either fully applied or not at all.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Updates (Severity: Critical):**  Prevents installation of tampered updates.
    *   **Update Failures (Severity: Moderate):**  Allows recovery from failed updates.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Updates:** Risk significantly reduced (critical to low/negligible).
    *   **Update Failures:** Risk reduced (moderate to low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Signature verification is generally implemented.
    *   Some integrity checks are likely present.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Robust Rollback:**  The rollback mechanism needs to be thoroughly tested and made more robust.
    *   **Atomic Updates:** Full atomic update implementation may be missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fail-Safe Mechanisms and Driver Override](./mitigation_strategies/fail-safe_mechanisms_and_driver_override.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disengagement Logic (within `controls`):**  Implement robust and reliable logic for disengaging openpilot in response to:
        *   Brake pedal input.
        *   Steering wheel input.
        *   Dedicated disengagement button.
        *   Detected anomalies or errors.
    2.  **Alerts and Warnings (within openpilot's UI):**  Implement clear and unambiguous audible and visual alerts to the driver when openpilot is engaging, disengaging, or encountering problems.
    3. **DMS Integration (within openpilot):** If a Driver Monitoring System is present, integrate its output into openpilot's control logic. Disengage or warn the driver based on DMS data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **System Malfunction (Severity: High):**  Allows the driver to take over in case of failure.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Severity: High):**  Allows the driver to take over if openpilot acts unexpectedly.
    *   **Driver Inattention (Severity: High):**  Helps prevent accidents due to driver distraction (with DMS).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **System Malfunction:** Risk significantly reduced (high to low).
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk significantly reduced (high to low).
    *   **Driver Inattention:** Risk reduced (high to moderate/low, with DMS).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Disengagement mechanisms exist (brake, steering, button).
    *   Alerts and warnings are present.
    *   Some DMS integration exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Redundant Disengagement:**  Ensure disengagement mechanisms are truly redundant and don't rely on single points of failure.
    *   **Comprehensive DMS Integration:**  DMS integration could be more robust and consistent.
