# Threat Model Analysis for commaai/openpilot

## Threat: [Malicious CAN Bus Injection (Steering)](./threats/malicious_can_bus_injection__steering_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious CAN Bus Injection (Steering)

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects crafted CAN messages *through a compromised openpilot component (Panda firmware or openpilot software)* to override openpilot's steering commands. The attacker leverages a vulnerability within openpilot to send malicious steering requests.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of steering control, unintended turns, potential for high-speed collisions, vehicle veering off the road.
    *   **Affected Component:** Panda firmware, `can.cc` (CAN message handling), `controlsd` (control logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **CAN Message Authentication:** Implement cryptographic message authentication codes (MACs) for all safety-critical CAN messages *originating from openpilot*.
        *   **Panda Firmware Hardening:** Secure boot, code signing, vulnerability patching, and regular security audits of the Panda firmware.
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorous input validation and range checking within `controlsd` and `can.cc` to reject out-of-bounds or implausible steering commands *received from other openpilot components*.
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Monitor the CAN bus for anomalous message patterns *originating from the Panda* indicative of injection attacks.

## Threat: [Malicious CAN Bus Injection (Acceleration/Braking)](./threats/malicious_can_bus_injection__accelerationbraking_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious CAN Bus Injection (Acceleration/Braking)

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects CAN messages *via a compromised openpilot component* to control the vehicle's acceleration or braking.  This relies on a vulnerability within openpilot itself to send unauthorized commands.
    *   **Impact:** Sudden, unintended acceleration or braking, rear-end collisions, loss of control, potential for injury or death.
    *   **Affected Component:** Panda firmware, `can.cc`, `controlsd`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** (Same as Malicious CAN Bus Injection (Steering), plus):
        *   **Redundant Braking System Monitoring:** Implement independent monitoring *within openpilot* of brake system commands and compare them to expected values.

*   **Threat:** Sensor Spoofing (Camera) - *Impacting openpilot's Processing*

    *   **Description:** An attacker projects images or uses bright lights, and *openpilot's camera-based perception system* misinterprets the driving environment. The core issue is openpilot's susceptibility to manipulated visual input.

    *   **Affected Component:** `camerad` (camera processing), perception algorithms, lane detection models.

*   **Threat:** Driver Monitoring System (DMS) Bypass (Video/Image) - *Defeating openpilot's DMS*

    *   **Description:** An attacker uses a static image or video to trick *openpilot's DMS*, allowing inattentive driving while openpilot remains engaged.
    *   **Impact:** openpilot remains engaged even when the driver is inattentive, increasing the risk of accidents.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dmonitoringd` (driver monitoring), DMS algorithms, face detection and gaze estimation models.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Liveness Detection:** Implement techniques *within `dmonitoringd`* to distinguish between a live face and a static image/video.
        *   **Infrared (IR) Camera:** Use an IR camera *and integrate its data into `dmonitoringd`* for liveness detection.
        *   **Contextual Awareness:** Consider other factors *within openpilot's decision-making* (steering wheel input, vehicle speed) to assess driver attentiveness.
