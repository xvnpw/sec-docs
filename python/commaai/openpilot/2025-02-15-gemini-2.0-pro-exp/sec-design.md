# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a commercially viable, advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) that surpasses existing OEM offerings in terms of functionality and performance.
*   Maintain an open-source codebase to foster community contributions and rapid innovation.
*   Offer a system that is compatible with a wide range of vehicle makes and models.
*   Ensure the safety and reliability of the system, given its direct control over vehicle steering, acceleration, and braking.
*   Monetize through hardware sales (Comma 3X device) and potentially through subscription services for advanced features.
*   Build a strong brand reputation and community trust.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Safety incidents (accidents, injuries, or fatalities) caused by malfunctions or misuse of OpenPilot. This is by far the most significant risk, potentially leading to legal liabilities, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention.
*   Security vulnerabilities that could allow malicious actors to compromise the system and control a vehicle remotely.
*   Failure to maintain compatibility with a sufficiently broad range of vehicles, limiting market reach.
*   Inability to keep pace with technological advancements in the ADAS space, leading to obsolescence.
*   Negative public perception or regulatory scrutiny due to the open-source nature of the project and the potential for user modifications.
*   Supply chain disruptions affecting the availability of hardware components.
*   Infringement of intellectual property rights of other companies.

    F -- Results --> H[Build Status]
    G -- Results --> H
    E --> I[OTA Update Server]
    I --> J[Comma 3X Device]
```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Code Review: All code changes are subject to review before being merged.
*   Linters: Code linters are used to enforce coding style and identify potential errors.
*   Static Analysis Tools: Static analysis tools (e.g., Cppcheck, Clang-Tidy) are used to detect potential bugs and security vulnerabilities. (Needs verification from the repository).
*   Automated Build: The build process is automated using SCons, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.
*   OTA Updates: The build artifacts are deployed to Comma 3X devices via over-the-air updates.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Integrate SAST tools into the build pipeline.
*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   Generate and track a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
