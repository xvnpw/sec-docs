# Attack Surface Analysis for commaai/openpilot

## Attack Surface: [Sensor Data Spoofing/Injection](./attack_surfaces/sensor_data_spoofinginjection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers manipulate sensor data (camera, radar, GPS, IMU) fed into openpilot.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:** Openpilot relies entirely on sensor data for perception and decision-making. It inherently trusts the integrity of this input.
* **Example:** Injecting fake objects into the camera feed to trigger unnecessary braking or steering maneuvers, or spoofing GPS data to make openpilot believe the vehicle is in a different location.
* **Impact:**  Erratic vehicle behavior, potential accidents, denial of service of autonomous functionality.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement sensor fusion techniques that cross-validate data from multiple sensors to detect inconsistencies.
        * Develop anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual sensor readings.
        * Explore cryptographic signing or secure communication protocols for sensor data streams (if feasible with sensor hardware).
        * Implement rate limiting and input validation on sensor data.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Openpilot Software](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_openpilot_software.md)

* **Description:** Attackers exploit software vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, logic errors) within the openpilot codebase.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:**  As a complex software project, openpilot may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
* **Example:**  A buffer overflow in the perception module could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
* **Impact:**  Complete control over the openpilot system, potentially leading to dangerous vehicle behavior or data breaches.
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement rigorous code review processes, including static and dynamic analysis.
        * Utilize memory-safe programming languages or techniques where possible.
        * Regularly update openpilot to the latest version with security patches.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data processed by openpilot.
        * Employ fuzzing and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [CAN Bus Injection](./attack_surfaces/can_bus_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious messages onto the vehicle's Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, bypassing openpilot's intended actions.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:** Openpilot relies on the CAN bus to send control commands to the vehicle's actuators (steering, throttle, brakes).
* **Example:**  An attacker injects a CAN message to forcefully apply the brakes or steer the vehicle abruptly.
* **Impact:**  Direct and immediate control over vehicle functions, potentially leading to accidents.
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement CAN message filtering and validation within openpilot to ignore or reject unexpected or malicious messages.
        * Explore CAN bus security features like message authentication codes (MACs) if supported by the vehicle's architecture.

## Attack Surface: [Model Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/model_poisoning.md)

* **Description:** Attackers manipulate the training data or the model update process to introduce biases or vulnerabilities into openpilot's machine learning models.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:** Openpilot relies heavily on machine learning models for perception and planning. Compromising these models can directly impact its functionality.
* **Example:**  Introducing images of stop signs labeled as yield signs into the training data, causing the system to misinterpret stop signs.
* **Impact:**  Subtle but potentially dangerous errors in perception and decision-making, leading to unsafe driving behavior.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for training data.
        * Use trusted and verified sources for training data.
        * Employ techniques for detecting and mitigating adversarial examples during training.
        * Implement integrity checks for model updates to ensure they haven't been tampered with.

## Attack Surface: [Physical Tampering with Openpilot Hardware](./attack_surfaces/physical_tampering_with_openpilot_hardware.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain physical access to the device running openpilot and tamper with it.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:** The openpilot hardware is a critical component for its operation. Physical access bypasses many software security measures.
* **Example:**  Installing malicious software, extracting sensitive data, or physically modifying the hardware to disrupt its functionality.
* **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the openpilot system, potentially leading to dangerous vehicle behavior or data breaches.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement secure boot mechanisms to prevent unauthorized software from running.
        * Encrypt sensitive data stored on the device.
        * Consider hardware security features like Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs).
