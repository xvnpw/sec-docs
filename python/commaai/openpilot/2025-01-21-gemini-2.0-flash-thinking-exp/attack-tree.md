## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in openpilot Software [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_openpilot_software__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path encompasses attacks targeting weaknesses within the openpilot codebase itself. Successful exploitation can grant the attacker significant control over openpilot's functionality and data.
    *   **Exploit Software Vulnerabilities in Openpilot Core Components [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   This focuses on flaws within the main parts of openpilot's software.
        *   **Exploit Memory Corruption Bugs (e.g., buffer overflows) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Attackers can craft malicious inputs, such as sensor data or internal messages, that cause openpilot to write data beyond allocated memory.
            *   This can overwrite critical data or inject malicious code for execution, leading to full control of openpilot.
        *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Openpilot relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited to compromise openpilot.
            *   This can lead to code execution within openpilot, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate its behavior or access sensitive information.
