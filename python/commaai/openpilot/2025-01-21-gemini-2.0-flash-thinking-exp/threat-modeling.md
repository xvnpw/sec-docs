# Threat Model Analysis for commaai/openpilot

## Threat: [Sensor Data Injection (Camera)](./threats/sensor_data_injection__camera_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject false images or video streams into the camera input of the openpilot system. This could be done through physical manipulation of the camera or by intercepting and modifying the data stream *before* it reaches openpilot's processing.
*   **Impact:** Openpilot might misinterpret the environment, leading to incorrect driving decisions such as failing to recognize obstacles, misinterpreting traffic signs, or making inappropriate lane changes. This could result in accidents or dangerous situations.
*   **Affected Component:** `selfdrive.camerad` module, specifically the functions responsible for processing raw camera input.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement cryptographic signing and verification of camera data *within* openpilot's processing pipeline.
    *   Employ anomaly detection techniques *within* openpilot to identify unusual patterns in the camera input stream.

## Threat: [Sensor Data Injection (Radar/LiDAR)](./threats/sensor_data_injection__radarlidar_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject false data into the radar or LiDAR sensors used by openpilot. This could involve transmitting fake signals that mimic the presence of objects or altering existing signals *before* openpilot processes them.
*   **Impact:** Openpilot might perceive non-existent obstacles or fail to detect real ones, leading to incorrect acceleration, braking, or steering decisions. This could cause collisions or other dangerous maneuvers.
*   **Affected Component:** Modules responsible for processing radar and LiDAR data, likely within `selfdrive.controls.controlsd` or dedicated sensor processing modules *within openpilot*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement signal processing techniques *within openpilot* to filter out spurious or anomalous radar/LiDAR returns.
    *   Employ multi-sensor fusion *within openpilot* to cross-validate data from different sensors.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in openpilot Code](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_openpilot_code.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could discover and exploit software vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, remote code execution flaws) within the openpilot codebase. This could be done through reverse engineering or by analyzing publicly available code.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain unauthorized control over the openpilot system, execute arbitrary code *within openpilot*, or disrupt its functionality. This could lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous vehicle behavior.
*   **Affected Component:** Any module within the openpilot codebase, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain a rigorous software development lifecycle with security best practices *for openpilot development*.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the openpilot codebase.
    *   Stay up-to-date with openpilot releases and apply security patches promptly.

## Threat: [Model Poisoning (if retraining is involved *within openpilot*)](./threats/model_poisoning__if_retraining_is_involved_within_openpilot_.md)

*   **Description:** If openpilot itself allows for retraining or fine-tuning of its machine learning models, an attacker could inject malicious data into the training process.
*   **Impact:** This could subtly alter the model's behavior, causing it to make incorrect predictions or decisions in specific scenarios. This could lead to safety issues that are difficult to detect.
*   **Affected Component:** Modules related to model training and management *within openpilot*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict controls over the training data and process *within openpilot*.
    *   Validate the integrity and source of training data used for openpilot's models.
    *   Employ techniques to detect and mitigate model poisoning attacks *during openpilot's model training*.

## Threat: [Adversarial Attacks on Perception Models](./threats/adversarial_attacks_on_perception_models.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could craft specific inputs (e.g., carefully designed stickers on road signs) that cause openpilot's perception models to misclassify objects.
*   **Impact:** This could lead to openpilot failing to recognize critical road signs (like stop signs) or misinterpreting other road users, resulting in dangerous driving decisions.
*   **Affected Component:** Modules responsible for perception, such as those handling image recognition and object detection within `selfdrive.perception`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Train perception models with diverse and robust datasets, including examples of adversarial attacks.
    *   Implement input sanitization and anomaly detection *within openpilot's perception pipeline*.
    *   Explore techniques for making models more resilient to adversarial examples.

## Threat: [Compromised openpilot Updates](./threats/compromised_openpilot_updates.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the update mechanism for openpilot, potentially distributing malicious or backdoored versions of the software.
*   **Impact:** Users could unknowingly install compromised versions of openpilot, granting attackers control over the system or introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** The update mechanism and distribution infrastructure for openpilot.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure update mechanisms with cryptographic signing and verification of updates.
    *   Ensure the integrity of the update distribution channels for openpilot.
    *   Provide users with mechanisms to verify the authenticity of openpilot updates.
