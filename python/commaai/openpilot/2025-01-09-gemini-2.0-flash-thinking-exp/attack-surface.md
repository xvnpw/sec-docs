# Attack Surface Analysis for commaai/openpilot

## Attack Surface: [Malicious CAN Message Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_can_message_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects crafted or malicious messages onto the vehicle's Controller Area Network (CAN) bus.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:** Openpilot directly interacts with the CAN bus to read sensor data and send control commands (steering, throttle, brakes). Vulnerabilities in openpilot's CAN message handling or lack of proper message validation can create opportunities for injection.
* **Example:** An attacker sends a CAN message through openpilot's interface to abruptly engage the emergency brakes at high speed.
* **Impact:** Critical - Could lead to immediate loss of vehicle control, accidents, and severe injury or death.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust CAN message filtering and validation within openpilot to only accept expected message IDs and formats.
    * Utilize hardware or software CAN firewalls to restrict communication to authorized sources and message types.
    * Employ message authentication codes (MACs) or similar cryptographic techniques to verify the integrity and authenticity of CAN messages.
    * Design the overall system with redundancy and fail-safes to mitigate the impact of unexpected CAN messages.

## Attack Surface: [Sensor Data Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/sensor_data_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, etc.) that openpilot relies on for perception.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:** Openpilot's core functionality depends on accurate sensor readings. If these readings are compromised, openpilot's perception of the environment will be flawed, leading to incorrect decisions.
* **Example:** An attacker uses adversarial patches on road signs or projects fake objects into the camera feed, causing openpilot to misinterpret the driving scene.
* **Impact:** High - Could lead to incorrect driving decisions, such as failing to recognize obstacles, lane departures, or unintended acceleration/braking.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement sensor fusion techniques to cross-validate data from multiple sensors and detect anomalies.
    * Employ input validation and sanity checks on sensor data to identify and reject unrealistic or malicious inputs.
    * Develop robust algorithms that are resilient to noise and minor perturbations in sensor data.
    * Consider using cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity of sensor data from the source to openpilot.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Openpilot's Inter-Process Communication (IPC)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_openpilot's_inter-process_communication__ipc_.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how different modules within openpilot communicate with each other.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:** Openpilot is likely composed of multiple modules communicating via IPC mechanisms (e.g., shared memory, sockets, message queues). Vulnerabilities in these mechanisms can be exploited to gain control over components or inject malicious data.
* **Example:** An attacker exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in a message queue used by openpilot modules to execute arbitrary code.
* **Impact:** High - Could lead to the compromise of specific openpilot functionalities, denial of service, or even complete system takeover.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Utilize secure IPC mechanisms with built-in security features (e.g., authentication, encryption).
    * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data exchanged between openpilot modules.
    * Apply the principle of least privilege to restrict the permissions of individual modules.
    * Regularly audit and test the security of openpilot's IPC mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Configuration and Model Files](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_configuration_and_model_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to and modifies openpilot's configuration files or machine learning models.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:** Openpilot's behavior is governed by configuration files and its decision-making relies on machine learning models. Tampering with these files can lead to unpredictable or malicious behavior.
* **Example:** An attacker modifies a configuration file to disable safety checks or replaces a critical machine learning model with a compromised version.
* **Impact:** High - Could lead to unsafe driving behavior, bypassing of safety mechanisms, or the introduction of backdoors.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Store configuration and model files in secure locations with restricted access permissions.
    * Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) to detect unauthorized modifications.
    * Encrypt sensitive configuration data.
    * Implement a mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of downloaded models.

## Attack Surface: [Physical Access and Tampering](./attack_surfaces/physical_access_and_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains physical access to the device running openpilot and directly manipulates hardware or software.
* **How Openpilot Contributes:** As openpilot runs on a physical device within the vehicle, it is susceptible to physical attacks if security measures are insufficient.
* **Example:** An attacker physically connects to the CAN bus and sends malicious commands, or replaces openpilot software with a compromised version.
* **Impact:** Critical - Could lead to complete system compromise, the introduction of persistent backdoors, or direct manipulation of vehicle functions.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement physical security measures to restrict access to the device running openpilot.
    * Utilize secure boot mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the boot process.
    * Employ hardware tamper detection mechanisms to alert on unauthorized physical modifications.
    * Encrypt sensitive data at rest on the device.
