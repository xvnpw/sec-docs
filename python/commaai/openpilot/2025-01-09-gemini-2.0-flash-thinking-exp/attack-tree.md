## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Sensor Data Manipulation **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_sensor_data_manipulation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Spoof GPS Signals:**
    *   Attackers use readily available GPS spoofing devices to transmit fake GPS signals.
    *   OpenPilot receives these false signals, believing the vehicle is in a different location than it actually is.
    *   This can mislead navigation and planning algorithms, causing incorrect route following or dangerous maneuvers.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject False Camera Data:**
    *   Attackers manipulate the camera input stream to feed fabricated images or video.
    *   This can involve:
        *   **Feeding fabricated object detections:** Injecting data that makes OpenPilot believe there are obstacles (e.g., phantom cars, pedestrians) that do not exist, leading to unnecessary braking or evasive actions.
        *   **Obscuring real objects from detection:** Using adversarial patches or other techniques to subtly alter the camera input, making real obstacles invisible to OpenPilot's object detection algorithms, potentially leading to collisions.
*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Sensor Hardware/Firmware:**
    *   This involves gaining low-level access to the sensor hardware or its firmware.
    *   Attackers could directly manipulate the raw data output of the sensors before it even reaches OpenPilot's processing.
    *   This provides complete control over the sensor input, allowing for highly sophisticated and difficult-to-detect manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit OpenPilot Software Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_openpilot_software_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities:**
    *   These vulnerabilities occur when the software incorrectly manages memory, potentially leading to attackers overwriting critical data or executing arbitrary code.
    *   Specific attack vectors include:
        *   **Buffer overflows in parsing sensor data or configuration files:**  If OpenPilot doesn't properly validate the size of incoming sensor data or configuration parameters, attackers can send overly large inputs that overflow memory buffers, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions with malicious code.
        *   **Use-after-free vulnerabilities in core modules:** These occur when the software attempts to use memory that has already been freed. Attackers can manipulate memory allocation to place malicious data in the freed memory, which is then executed when the dangling pointer is accessed.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Compromise OpenPilot Communication Channels **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromise_openpilot_communication_channels__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Internal Communication:**
    *   Attackers position themselves between different modules within OpenPilot's system.
    *   They intercept communication between these modules (e.g., sensor data being sent to the planning module, control commands being sent to the vehicle's actuators).
    *   They can then modify these messages in transit, for example, altering the steering angle or acceleration commands before they reach the vehicle's control systems.
*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise cloud services used by OpenPilot for updates or data logging:**
    *   If OpenPilot communicates with cloud services for features like software updates or data logging, these services become potential attack vectors.
    *   Compromising these services could allow attackers to:
        *   Inject malicious updates, which would then be deployed to vehicles running OpenPilot.
        *   Access sensitive data logged by OpenPilot.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit the Update Mechanism **[HIGH-RISK PATH if successful]**](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_the_update_mechanism__high-risk_path_if_successful_.md)

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise the Update Server:**
    *   This is a high-impact but potentially lower-likelihood attack.
    *   If attackers gain control of the official update server, they can directly inject malicious updates into the legitimate update stream.
    *   This would allow them to compromise a large number of OpenPilot installations.
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Update Process:**
    *   Attackers intercept the communication between the vehicle and the update server during the update process.
    *   They replace the legitimate update package with a malicious one.
    *   If the update client doesn't have robust verification mechanisms, it will install the malicious update.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Weaknesses in Hardware Integration **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_weaknesses_in_hardware_integration__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Direct Access to CAN Bus:**
    *   The CAN (Controller Area Network) bus is the primary communication network within the vehicle.
    *   If attackers gain physical access to the CAN bus (e.g., through an OBD-II port or by tampering with wiring), they can inject malicious CAN messages.
    *   These messages can directly control vehicle functions like steering, acceleration, and braking, bypassing OpenPilot's software controls entirely.
