# Threat Model Analysis for commaai/openpilot

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Telemetry](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_telemetry.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the telemetry system to gain unauthorized access and extract sensitive driving data, logs, or camera snippets transmitted by openpilot. This could be achieved by intercepting network traffic, compromising telemetry servers, or exploiting weaknesses in data transmission protocols.

*   **Affected openpilot component:** `uploader.py` module, telemetry infrastructure, network communication channels.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust encryption for telemetry data in transit and at rest.

## Threat: [Sensor Spoofing and Data Injection](./threats/sensor_spoofing_and_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates sensor data (camera, radar, GPS, IMU) fed to openpilot, either through physical manipulation (e.g., jamming sensors) or software-based attacks (e.g., injecting false data into sensor communication channels). This could mislead openpilot and cause it to make incorrect driving decisions.
*   **Impact:** Erratic vehicle behavior, safety risks, potential accidents due to misinterpretation of the environment by openpilot, system malfunction.
*   **Affected openpilot component:** Sensor interfaces, sensor data processing modules (`camerad`, `sensord`), perception modules (`modeld`, `plannerd`).

    *   Secure sensor communication channels with encryption and authentication.
    *   Physically secure sensors to prevent tampering.
    *   Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual sensor readings.
    *   Develop fallback mechanisms for sensor failures or data corruption.

## Threat: [CAN Bus Injection and Control Manipulation](./threats/can_bus_injection_and_control_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the communication between openpilot and the vehicle's CAN bus to inject malicious messages. This could allow attackers to directly control vehicle functions (steering, acceleration, braking), bypassing safety mechanisms and potentially causing dangerous situations.
*   **Impact:** Complete loss of vehicle control, severe safety risks, potential for accidents and physical harm, vehicle hijacking.
*   **Affected openpilot component:** CAN interface modules (`car`, `boardd`), control modules (`controlsd`), vehicle interface libraries.

    *   Minimize the attack surface of the CAN bus interface.

## Threat: [Software Supply Chain Compromise](./threats/software_supply_chain_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** openpilot relies on numerous open-source libraries and dependencies. An attacker compromises these dependencies (e.g., through malicious updates or backdoors in libraries like `numpy`, `protobuf`, `opencv`) and introduces vulnerabilities into the openpilot system without directly modifying openpilot's core code.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious functionality into openpilot, leading to various security and safety risks, widespread compromise affecting many users.

## Threat: [Firmware and Bootloader Tampering](./threats/firmware_and_bootloader_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the firmware or bootloader of the device running openpilot (e.g., comma device). This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the firmware update process or gaining physical access to the device. Tampering allows for persistent malware installation, bypassing security measures, and gaining low-level control over the system.

## Threat: [Lack of Security Updates and Patch Management](./threats/lack_of_security_updates_and_patch_management.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to regularly update openpilot software and its dependencies with security patches. This leaves the system vulnerable to known exploits and attacks that have been publicly disclosed and for which patches are available. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise the system.
