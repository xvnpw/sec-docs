# Attack Surface Analysis for commaai/openpilot

## Attack Surface: [CAN Bus Injection](./attack_surfaces/can_bus_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is the communication backbone of vehicles. Injection attacks involve sending malicious messages onto the CAN bus to disrupt or control vehicle functions.
*   **Openpilot Contribution:** Openpilot's core functionality relies on direct interaction with the CAN bus to read sensor data and send control commands (steering, acceleration, braking). This direct interface is a primary pathway for CAN bus injection attacks targeting openpilot's operation.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a CAN message that spoofs steering wheel angle data, causing openpilot to misinterpret the vehicle's intended direction and potentially steer the vehicle into oncoming traffic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unintended and dangerous vehicle behavior (e.g., sudden acceleration, braking, or steering).
    *   Loss of driver control and potential accidents.
    *   Complete compromise of vehicle operation through manipulated control commands.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust CAN Message Validation:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of all incoming CAN messages within openpilot to ensure they adhere to expected formats, ranges, and protocols. Discard or flag any suspicious or malformed messages.
    *   **CAN Bus Firewalling and Filtering:** Employ CAN bus firewalls or filters to restrict the types of CAN messages openpilot processes and transmits, limiting the attack surface and preventing injection of unexpected message types.
    *   **Secure CAN Communication Protocols:** Investigate and implement secure CAN communication protocols (like CANcrypt or similar) to encrypt and authenticate CAN messages, making it significantly harder for attackers to inject valid, malicious messages.
    *   **CAN Bus Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Integrate CAN bus intrusion detection systems to monitor CAN traffic for anomalous patterns and potential injection attempts, providing early warning and potential mitigation actions.
