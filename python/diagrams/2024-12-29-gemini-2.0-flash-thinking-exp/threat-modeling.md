* **Threat:** Malicious Code Execution via Diagram Definition
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a diagram definition that includes malicious Python code. When the `diagrams` library processes this definition, the embedded code is executed. This could involve manipulating node labels, attributes, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the library's parsing logic.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, including data theft, modification, or deletion; installation of malware; denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** Diagram parsing logic within the core `diagrams` library, specifically the components responsible for interpreting node and edge definitions and any custom code execution features.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation on diagram definitions, ensuring they conform to the expected schema and do not contain potentially executable code.
        * Sanitize any user-provided data before incorporating it into the diagram definition.
        * Consider running the diagram generation process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of potential code execution.
        * Regularly update the `diagrams` library to patch any discovered vulnerabilities related to code execution.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `diagrams` Library Dependencies
    * **Description:** The `diagrams` library relies on other Python packages. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them through the `diagrams` library.
    * **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    * **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable dependency of the `diagrams` library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the `diagrams` library and all its dependencies to the latest secure versions.
        * Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
        * Pin dependency versions in the project's requirements file to ensure consistent and controlled updates.

* **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External Resource Inclusion (Hypothetical)
    * **Description:** If future versions of the `diagrams` library introduce functionality to include external resources (e.g., images, data) based on user-provided URLs within the diagram definition, an attacker could potentially exploit this to perform SSRF attacks. They could provide URLs to internal resources or external services, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing other harm.
    * **Impact:** Access to internal resources, port scanning of internal networks, potential for further exploitation of internal services.
    * **Affected Component:** Hypothetical future functionality within the `diagrams` library that handles external resource inclusion.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if the functionality is introduced without proper security measures).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * If such functionality is introduced, implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs provided in diagram definitions.
        * Use a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols for external resources.
        * Avoid directly using user-provided URLs for external resource inclusion. Consider fetching and processing resources on the server-side.
