Title: High-Risk Attack Sub-Tree for Application Using `diagrams` Library

Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access or control over the application or its environment by leveraging vulnerabilities within the `diagrams` library.

Sub-Tree:

└── **Compromise Application Using Diagrams Library**
    ├── **Inject Malicious Diagram Definition** [CRITICAL NODE]
    │   └── **Via User Input** [HIGH-RISK PATH START]
    │       └── **Application fails to sanitize user-provided diagram code/configuration** [CRITICAL NODE]
    │           └── **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)** [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH END]
    └── **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Diagrams Library** [CRITICAL NODE]
        └── **Code Injection Vulnerabilities** [HIGH-RISK PATH START]
            └── Diagrams library interprets user-provided strings as code
                └── **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)** [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH END]

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path 1: Inject Malicious Diagram Definition via User Input leading to RCE

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a malicious diagram definition through a user interface or API endpoint that the application uses to generate diagrams.
*   **Weakness Exploited:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the user-provided diagram definition, allowing the inclusion of executable code.
*   **Diagrams Library Involvement:** The `diagrams` library, when processing the unsanitized input, interprets and executes the malicious code embedded within the diagram definition.
*   **Outcome:** Successful execution of arbitrary code on the server hosting the application, leading to a complete compromise (Remote Code Execution).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided diagram definitions.
    *   Use a safe subset of the `diagrams` API or a dedicated, isolated environment for processing user-provided definitions.
    *   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) if diagrams are rendered client-side to mitigate potential client-side execution.

High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities in Diagrams Library leading to RCE

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages a specific vulnerability within the `diagrams` library that allows for the execution of arbitrary code by crafting a specific input.
*   **Weakness Exploited:** A flaw in the `diagrams` library's code that incorrectly handles or interprets certain input strings, leading to code execution.
*   **Diagrams Library Involvement:** The vulnerability resides within the `diagrams` library itself. The attacker's input triggers the vulnerable code path, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the library's context.
*   **Outcome:** Successful execution of arbitrary code within the application's process, leading to a complete compromise (Remote Code Execution).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `diagrams` library updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories related to the `diagrams` library.
    *   Consider static and dynamic code analysis of the `diagrams` library if feasible.

Critical Nodes Breakdown:

*   **Inject Malicious Diagram Definition:**
    *   Significance: This is a primary entry point for attackers aiming to compromise the application through the `diagrams` library. Success at this node allows the introduction of malicious code into the diagram generation process.
    *   Related High-Risk Path: Directly involved in the "Inject Malicious Diagram Definition via User Input" path.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Secure all sources of diagram definitions, especially user input.

*   **Application fails to sanitize user-provided diagram code/configuration:**
    *   Significance: This represents a critical security control failure. If the application fails to sanitize input, it directly enables the execution of malicious code.
    *   Related High-Risk Path: The central point of failure in the "Inject Malicious Diagram Definition via User Input" path.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Implement robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms.

*   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    *   Significance: This is the most critical outcome, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the application and potentially the underlying server.
    *   Related High-Risk Paths: The end goal of both identified high-risk paths.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Prevent the execution of untrusted code through strict input validation, secure library usage, and potentially sandboxing.

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Diagrams Library:**
    *   Significance: Highlights the risk associated with using third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities within the library can directly lead to application compromise.
    *   Related High-Risk Path: The starting point for the "Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities in Diagrams Library" path.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Keep the library updated, monitor for vulnerabilities, and consider security analysis of the library.

*   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities (under Exploit Vulnerabilities in Diagrams Library):**
    *   Significance: This specific type of vulnerability within the `diagrams` library is critical due to its direct potential for RCE.
    *   Related High-Risk Path: The core vulnerability being exploited in the "Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities in Diagrams Library" path.
    *   Mitigation Focus: Patching vulnerabilities, secure coding practices within the library (if contributing), and potentially using static analysis tools.
