- **Hardcoded Django SECRET_KEY Exposure**
  - **Description:**  
    The settings file (/code/test_project/test_project/settings.py) defines the Django `SECRET_KEY` as a literal static string:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY = 'o56l!!8q!rwqy13optbmnycu97^tvh@bsk1t!-^$&7o@t4nsbg'
    ```
    An external attacker who reviews the publicly available source code (or who gains access to a production instance deployed with these defaults) can extract the secret key. With this knowledge, the attacker can forge or tamper with session cookies, CSRF tokens, and other signed data. This could then be exploited—for example, by creating forged session cookies to impersonate legitimate users (including administrative users) or tampering with security-critical data.
    
  - **Impact:**  
    - Session hijacking and impersonation of users (including admin accounts).  
    - Tampering with Django’s signed cookies may bypass authentication/authorization controls.  
    - Undermines cryptographic integrity of all features that rely on the secret key.
    
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - *None.* The key is hardcoded directly in the settings file.
    
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Externalize the secret key by loading it from an environment variable or a secure configuration management system.  
    - Ensure that production deployments override the default key with a securely generated, random value.
    
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The application is deployed without overriding the hardcoded default and an attacker can view the repository or deduce the key from a misconfigured production environment.
    
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `/code/test_project/test_project/settings.py`, the secret key is assigned directly:
      ```python
      SECRET_KEY = 'o56l!!8q!rwqy13optbmnycu97^tvh@bsk1t!-^$&7o@t4nsbg'
      ```
    - There is no logic to override or replace this value at runtime.
    
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. Retrieve the source code or configuration (for example, via an unintended repository exposure).  
    2. Confirm that the `SECRET_KEY` is the hardcoded string.  
    3. Using Django’s signing utility (or a crafted session cookie based on Django’s algorithm), attempt to forge a session cookie or CSRF token.  
    4. Submit the forged token/cookie to a secure endpoint and verify whether the application accepts it (indicating a successful exploitation of the key).

- **Public Exposure of User Data via Completion Demo Endpoint**  
  - **Description:**  
    The view at `/code/test_project/core/views.py`—named `completion_demo`—is registered as the root URL (`^$`) in the URL patterns. This view unconditionally retrieves a full list of users via:
    ```python
    query = User.objects.all().order_by('username')
    ```
    and passes it directly to the template as part of the context. Because the view only requires a GET request (enforced by `@require_GET`) and does not restrict access via authentication or authorization, any external attacker can simply access the homepage to receive a complete list of user records.
    
  - **Impact:**  
    - Exposure of potentially sensitive user information (usernames and group associations).  
    - Enables account enumeration, facilitating targeted phishing attacks, brute-force login attempts, or other methods to compromise user accounts.
    
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - *None.* There is no authentication or authorization check before returning user data.
    
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Restrict access to endpoints that return user information (for example, by requiring authentication or moving demo functionality behind a protected area).  
    - Limit the fields returned to only non-sensitive information or employ pagination and filtering with strict access controls.
    
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The application is deployed with the public demo/search endpoint accessible at the root URL without login.
    
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `/code/test_project/core/views.py`, the `completion_demo` view starts by doing:
      ```python
      query = User.objects.all().order_by('username')
      ```
    - No checks (such as `login_required`) or sanitization measures are implemented before passing the complete queryset to the renderer.
    - The URL configuration in `/code/test_project/test_project/urls.py` maps the root URL (`r'^$'`) to `completion_demo`, making it publicly accessible.
    
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. As an unauthenticated external attacker, navigate to the application’s root URL (e.g., http://example.com/).  
    2. Observe that the rendered page contains a list of users (including usernames and group affiliations).  
    3. Verify that no authentication is required to access this data.

- **Excessive Error Information Disclosure via Malformed Search Queries**  
  - **Description:**  
    The same `completion_demo` view accepts an optional GET parameter `q` intended for search queries. When an attacker supplies an invalid or malformed query string, the view calls:
    ```python
    try:
        query = apply_search(query, q, schema=UserQLSchema)
    except DjangoQLError as e:
        query = query.none()
        error = str(e)
    ```
    The resulting error message (obtained via `str(e)`) is then passed to the template and rendered to the client. Since the underlying query language (via DjangoQL) raises errors that include internal schema details (such as valid field names and operator expectations), an attacker can trigger these errors to obtain detailed information about the internal data model.
    
  - **Impact:**  
    - Attackers gain insight into backend model structure, field names, and valid query parameters.  
    - Facilitates further exploitation by revealing internal logic that can inform injection, enumeration, or more targeted attacks.
    
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The view catches the exception and does not crash; however, it simply passes the raw error string along to the user.
    
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Sanitize error messages shown to the client so that they do not reveal internal schema details.  
    - Log the detailed error internally while returning a generic error message to the user.
    
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The application is publicly accessible at the completion demo endpoint.  
    - No input validation or generic error handling is applied to hide sensitive exception details.
    
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `/code/test_project/core/views.py`, when `q` is provided, the block:
      ```python
      try:
          query = apply_search(query, q, schema=UserQLSchema)
      except DjangoQLError as e:
          query = query.none()
          error = str(e)
      ```
      assigns the exact error string (which in cases of an unknown field, for example, will include a list of valid field names) to the variable `error`.  
    - In the schema resolution (in `/code/djangoql/schema.py` within the `resolve_name` method), if an unknown field is referenced, the error message lists the possible valid field names.
    
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. As an external attacker, access the completion demo endpoint by sending a GET request with a clearly invalid query, for example:  
       ```
       http://example.com/?q=nonexistentField=foo
       ```  
    2. Note that the response displays an error message including details like:
       ```
       Unknown field: nonexistentField. Possible choices are: author, content_type, genre, id, is_published, name, object_id, price, rating, similar_books, written, …
       ```
    3. Confirm that the error message contains internal schema details that should not have been exposed.  
    4. Verify that modifying the search query (e.g. omitting or changing field names) continues to reveal similar internal information.
