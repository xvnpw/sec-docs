## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Xadmin [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_xadmin__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within Xadmin to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Xadmin Interface [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_xadmin_interface__critical_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker successfully bypassing authentication and/or authorization mechanisms to gain access to the administrative interface of Xadmin. This access is a prerequisite for many subsequent attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_vulnerabilities.md)

This category encompasses attacks that target weaknesses in the authentication process itself.
    * **Default Credentials ***:**
        * Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to log in using commonly known default usernames and passwords that may not have been changed by the administrator during deployment. This is a straightforward attack if default credentials are still active.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication Mechanisms ***](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication_mechanisms.md)

This category includes techniques to circumvent the intended authentication process without necessarily knowing valid credentials.
    * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit flaws in the application's logic that allow access to protected resources or functionalities without proper authentication. This could involve accessing admin URLs directly or manipulating request parameters to bypass authentication checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Functionality within Xadmin After Gaining Access [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_functionality_within_xadmin_after_gaining_access__critical_.md)

Once inside the Xadmin interface, attackers can leverage its functionalities to further compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation.md)

Attackers aim to modify, delete, or exfiltrate data managed through Xadmin.
    * **Modify Sensitive Data ***:**
        * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities, primarily the lack of proper input validation, to inject malicious data into database fields or directly modify sensitive information through vulnerable Xadmin forms or APIs. This can lead to data corruption, manipulation of application logic, or the introduction of malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL] ***](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___critical_.md)

This critical node represents the ability of an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This is a highly severe vulnerability.
    * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities such as template injection (injecting code into templates), file upload vulnerabilities (uploading and executing malicious files like web shells), or deserialization vulnerabilities (executing code through manipulated serialized data). Successfully achieving RCE grants the attacker complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) ***](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

Attackers inject malicious scripts into the Xadmin interface, which are then executed in the browsers of other users (typically administrators).
    * Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into data managed by Xadmin (Stored XSS) or craft malicious URLs that inject scripts into Xadmin pages (Reflected XSS). This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, or the execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Xadmin [CRITICAL] ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_xadmin__critical_.md)

Xadmin relies on various third-party libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    * Attack Vector: Attackers identify and exploit known security vulnerabilities in the libraries used by Xadmin (e.g., Django, other Python packages). This can be done indirectly through Xadmin's functionalities or by directly targeting the underlying framework if access is gained. Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution or data breaches.
