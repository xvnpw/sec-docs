# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sshwsfc/xadmin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) within xadmin](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_principle_of_least_privilege__polp__within_xadmin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Unused `xadmin` Features:** In your `settings.py`, review the `XADMIN_SETTINGS` dictionary *thoroughly*. Disable *any* `xadmin` features, plugins, or views that are not absolutely necessary for your defined administrative roles. Start with the most minimal configuration possible and only enable features as required. This includes disabling default widgets, plugins, and menu items.
    2.  **Override `ModelAdmin` Permissions:** In your `xadmin` `ModelAdmin` classes, override the permission-related methods (`has_add_permission`, `has_change_permission`, `has_delete_permission`, `has_view_permission`).  These methods *directly* control access within `xadmin`.  Instead of relying solely on Django's `is_staff` or `is_superuser`, check for your custom, granular Django permissions. Example:

        ```python
        class ProductAdmin(object):
            def has_change_permission(self, request, obj=None):
                return request.user.has_perm('myapp.can_edit_products')
            def has_view_permission(self, request, obj=None):
                return request.user.has_perm('myapp.can_view_products')
        ```
    3. **`remove_permissions` setting:** Use `remove_permissions` in `ModelAdmin` to explicitly disable permissions like add, change, delete, view for specific models. This is a quick way to restrict access at the model level within xadmin.
    4. **Customize xadmin menus:** Use `xadmin`'s menu customization features to limit the visibility of menu items based on user permissions. This prevents users from even seeing options they don't have access to.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing parts of the `xadmin` interface they shouldn't, even if they are staff members.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Limits the ability of a compromised account to perform actions beyond its intended role *within the admin*.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive data being exposed through unauthorized access to `xadmin` features.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion (Medium Severity):** Minimizes the chance of users accidentally making changes or deleting data they shouldn't, *specifically through the admin interface*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced. Access is strictly controlled based on defined roles and permissions *within xadmin*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced. Compromised accounts are limited in their capabilities *within the admin*.
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced. Exposure of sensitive data is minimized *through the admin interface*.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification/Deletion:** Risk reduced. Users are less likely to have access to modify/delete data outside their responsibilities *via xadmin*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `ModelAdmin` permission overrides are implemented in the `orders` app.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `ModelAdmin` permission overrides are not consistently implemented across all apps.
    *   `XADMIN_SETTINGS` have not been fully reviewed and minimized.
    *   `remove_permissions` is not used.
    *   Menu customization based on permissions is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Sensitive Data Exposure in xadmin Views](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_sensitive_data_exposure_in_xadmin_views.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `ModelAdmin` Configurations:** For each model registered with `xadmin`, carefully review the `ModelAdmin` class. This is *entirely* within `xadmin`'s control.
    2.  **Use `exclude`:** Use the `exclude` attribute in your `ModelAdmin` to prevent sensitive fields from being displayed or edited in *any* `xadmin` view. This is the most direct and effective `xadmin`-specific control.
    3.  **Use `readonly_fields`:** Use the `readonly_fields` attribute in your `ModelAdmin` to make sensitive fields read-only, preventing modification but still allowing viewing within `xadmin`.
    4.  **Customize `list_display`:** Override the `list_display` attribute in your `ModelAdmin` to control which fields are shown in the `xadmin` list view. Avoid displaying sensitive information here.
    5.  **Customize `list_filter`:** Be extremely cautious with `list_filter` in your `ModelAdmin`. Avoid filtering on sensitive fields unless absolutely necessary and with appropriate access controls (using the permission methods from the previous strategy).
    6.  **Customize `search_fields`:** Avoid using sensitive fields in `search_fields` within your `ModelAdmin`. If searching is required, consider using a separate, less sensitive field (e.g., a hash or a masked version).
    7.  **Implement Data Masking/Redaction (within `ModelAdmin`):** For fields that *must* be displayed in `xadmin` but contain sensitive parts, create custom methods *within your `ModelAdmin`* to mask or redact the sensitive portions. Example:

        ```python
        class PaymentAdmin(object):
            list_display = ('masked_card_number', ...)

            def masked_card_number(self, obj):
                return '**** **** **** ' + obj.card_number[-4:]
        ```
    8.  **Review Inlines:** If you use inlines in `xadmin`, apply the same restrictions to the inline models' `ModelAdmin` configurations. Inlines are a core `xadmin` feature.
    9. **`style_fields`:** Carefully review and configure `style_fields` in your `ModelAdmin`. This setting controls how related fields are displayed, and misconfiguration could lead to information leakage.
    10. **`relfield_style`:** Similar to `style_fields`, ensure `relfield_style` is configured appropriately to avoid exposing sensitive data through related field lookups.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive data being exposed *through the `xadmin` interface*.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying sensitive data *via `xadmin`*.
    *   **Compliance Violations (High Severity):** Helps ensure compliance with data privacy regulations *regarding data displayed in the admin*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced. Sensitive data is either hidden or masked *within xadmin*.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Risk significantly reduced. Sensitive fields are either excluded or made read-only *within xadmin*.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk reduced. The application is more likely to comply with data privacy regulations *in its admin interface*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `exclude` is used in some `ModelAdmin` classes.
    *   `readonly_fields` are used sporadically.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive review of all `ModelAdmin` configurations has not been performed.
    *   `list_display`, `list_filter`, and `search_fields` are not consistently configured to minimize sensitive data exposure.
    *   Data masking/redaction within `ModelAdmin` methods is not implemented.
    *   Inline configurations have not been thoroughly reviewed.
    *   `style_fields` and `relfield_style` have not been reviewed.
