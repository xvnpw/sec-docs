# Threat Model Analysis for sshwsfc/xadmin

## Threat: [Custom Template Injection (Spoofing/Tampering)](./threats/custom_template_injection__spoofingtampering_.md)

*   **Threat:** Custom Template Injection (Spoofing/Tampering)

    *   **Description:** `xadmin` allows extensive customization via templates. An attacker with access to modify `xadmin` templates (e.g., through a compromised admin account with template editing permissions, or a file system vulnerability allowing them to upload a malicious template) injects malicious JavaScript or HTML into a custom template. This injected code is then executed in the browser of other `xadmin` users, including administrators, when they access pages using that template. The attacker could steal session cookies, redirect users, modify data displayed in the admin, or perform actions on behalf of the victim. The key here is that `xadmin`'s template customization *creates this attack surface*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of user accounts, including administrator accounts.
        *   Data breaches (theft of sensitive information displayed in the admin).
        *   Data modification or deletion.
        *   Defacement of the admin interface.
        *   Loss of user trust.
    *   **Affected xadmin Component:**
        *   Template rendering engine (`xadmin.views.base` and related template loading mechanisms). This is the core component that processes and renders the (potentially malicious) templates.
        *   Custom template files stored on the server (the location of the injected code).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Limit who can modify templates to a *very* small, trusted group of administrators. Implement a strict approval process for any template changes.
        *   **Input Validation/Sanitization:** Even for admin-provided content intended for templates, sanitize and validate any data used within templates.  Use Django's template auto-escaping features *diligently*. Treat all template input as potentially hostile.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to prevent the execution of inline scripts and limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Monitor template files for unauthorized changes using file integrity monitoring tools.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review custom templates for suspicious code, especially after any updates or changes.

## Threat: [Plugin-Based Privilege Escalation (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/plugin-based_privilege_escalation__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Threat:** Plugin-Based Privilege Escalation (Elevation of Privilege)

    *   **Description:** `xadmin`'s plugin architecture is a core feature. An attacker installs a malicious `xadmin` plugin, or compromises a legitimate plugin, to gain elevated privileges. The plugin contains code that bypasses `xadmin`'s or Django's permission checks, grants the attacker unauthorized access to data or functionality within the admin interface, or modifies data without proper authorization. The attacker leverages `xadmin`'s plugin API to inject malicious code that runs with the privileges of the `xadmin` application. This is a direct consequence of `xadmin`'s extensibility.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Full control over the application and its data (through the admin interface).
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Data modification or deletion.
        *   Denial of service (if the plugin is designed to disrupt the application).
    *   **Affected xadmin Component:**
        *   `xadmin.plugins` module (the plugin loading and execution mechanism). This is the core vulnerability point.
        *   Any custom plugin installed in the system (the vehicle for the malicious code).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Sources Only:** *Only* install plugins from reputable sources (e.g., the official `xadmin` repository or well-known, trusted developers). Never install plugins from untrusted sources.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the source code of *any* third-party plugins *before* installation. Look for suspicious code, especially code that interacts with permissions or performs data modifications.
        *   **Plugin Sandboxing (Ideal but Difficult):** If possible (though technically challenging), explore ways to isolate plugins and limit their access to the core application and data. This is a complex undertaking but offers the strongest protection.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep plugins updated to their latest versions to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Plugin Approval Process:** Implement a formal process for reviewing and approving new plugins *before* they are deployed to a production environment.

## Threat: [Custom View Data Leakage (Information Disclosure)](./threats/custom_view_data_leakage__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Threat:** Custom View Data Leakage (Information Disclosure) - *Specifically due to xadmin's custom view capabilities*

    *   **Description:** `xadmin` allows creating custom views within the admin interface.  If these custom views do not *rigorously* implement permission checks and data filtering that are *equivalent* to Django's built-in admin, they can inadvertently expose sensitive data.  The attacker accesses a custom `xadmin` view that was not properly secured, and the view exposes data to users who *should not* have access. This is a direct result of `xadmin` providing the ability to create custom views *outside* the standard Django admin protections.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., PII, financial information, internal documents).
        *   Violation of privacy regulations.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected xadmin Component:**
        *   Custom views created using `xadmin.views.BaseAdminView` or its subclasses. This is where the custom logic resides, and where the vulnerability is likely to be introduced.
        *   Any custom URL patterns associated with these views (the entry point to the vulnerable view).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Permission Checks:** Implement *extremely* robust permission checks in *every* custom view, using Django's built-in permission system (`has_perm`, `user_passes_test`, etc.).  Do *not* assume any level of access; explicitly check permissions for *every* action and *every* piece of data.
        *   **Object-Level Permissions:** Use Django's object-level permissions to control access to individual data objects. This is crucial for fine-grained access control.
        *   **Data Filtering:** Carefully filter the data displayed in custom views to ensure that users *only* see what they are authorized to see, based on their roles and permissions.
        *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test custom views with *different* user roles and permission levels to ensure that data is properly protected and that no unauthorized access is possible.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Custom Views (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_custom_views__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Custom Views (Elevation of Privilege) - *Specifically within xadmin custom views*

    *   **Description:** A custom `xadmin` view, created using `xadmin`'s view system, uses a direct object reference (e.g., a database primary key) in a URL parameter *without* proper authorization checks. An attacker could modify this parameter in the URL to access or modify data belonging to other users or objects they should not have access to. This vulnerability exists because `xadmin` allows developers to create custom views that might not adhere to secure coding practices.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        *   Unauthorized modification or deletion of data.
        *   Elevation of privilege (gaining access to data or functionality of other users).
    *   **Affected xadmin Component:**
        *   Custom views that use URL parameters to identify objects, built using `xadmin.views.BaseAdminView` and subclasses.
        *   The URL configuration that maps URLs to these custom views.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Indirect Object References:** Use indirect object references (e.g., random tokens, UUIDs, or slugs) instead of direct database IDs in URLs. This makes it much harder for an attacker to guess valid object identifiers.
        *   **Authorization Checks:** Implement robust authorization checks in *every* view to ensure that the currently logged-in user is authorized to access the *specific* object being requested. Use Django's permission system and object-level permissions. Do *not* rely solely on the URL parameter for access control.
        *   **Session-Based Access Control:** Ensure that access to objects is tied to the user's session and that users cannot access objects belonging to other sessions, even if they guess a valid object ID.
