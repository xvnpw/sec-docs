# Threat Model Analysis for sshwsfc/xadmin

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass via Custom Permission Logic Flaws](./threats/authorization_bypass_via_custom_permission_logic_flaws.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom permission checks implemented within xadmin's configuration, plugins, or custom views. By manipulating requests or user context, they might bypass xadmin's authorization mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to admin functionalities or data that should be restricted based on their role or permissions within xadmin.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed through xadmin, modification of critical application settings or data via the admin panel, privilege escalation to admin level within xadmin, potentially impacting the wider application.
**Affected xadmin component:** Custom views, custom actions registered in `ModelAdmin`, plugins extending permission checks, xadmin's permission decorators, `xadmin.sites.AdminSite` and `ModelAdmin` configurations.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and unit test all custom permission logic implemented within xadmin configurations, plugins, and custom views.
* Prefer leveraging Django's built-in permission system and ensure xadmin's custom permissions correctly integrate with and extend Django's standard permissions.
* Conduct focused security audits specifically on xadmin permission configurations and any custom permission-related code.
* Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) within xadmin and strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to xadmin users and groups.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in xadmin UI Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_xadmin_ui_components.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into xadmin UI elements through user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized by xadmin before being rendered in the admin panel. This could occur in list views, form fields, custom actions, or outputs from xadmin plugins. When an authenticated admin user interacts with the affected part of xadmin, the malicious script executes in their browser.
**Impact:** Account compromise of xadmin admin users, session hijacking of admin sessions, defacement of xadmin admin pages, malicious actions performed within xadmin on behalf of a legitimate admin user, potential information theft from the admin interface.
**Affected xadmin component:** xadmin templates, custom widgets provided by xadmin or plugins, form rendering logic within xadmin, list view rendering, plugin outputs displayed in the xadmin UI, JavaScript code within xadmin or plugins.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly sanitize all user-supplied data before rendering it within xadmin templates and JavaScript components. Ensure xadmin's template rendering and widget handling properly escape user inputs.
* Utilize Django's template auto-escaping features effectively within xadmin templates.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of potential XSS attacks within the xadmin interface.
* Regularly scan xadmin templates, JavaScript code, and custom plugins for potential XSS vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on areas where user input is displayed.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Custom xadmin Actions or Filters](./threats/sql_injection_in_custom_xadmin_actions_or_filters.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input to custom xadmin actions or filters that are implemented by developers extending xadmin. If these custom components directly construct SQL queries without using Django's ORM or proper parameterization, it could allow for SQL injection. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the application's database through the xadmin interface.
**Impact:** Data breach (unauthorized reading of sensitive data from the database), data modification or deletion within the database, denial of service by manipulating database queries, potential remote code execution on the database server depending on database permissions and configuration.
**Affected xadmin component:** Custom actions registered in `ModelAdmin`, custom filters implemented for xadmin list views, database interaction logic within custom xadmin components.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce the use of Django's ORM for all database interactions within custom xadmin actions and filters. Avoid direct raw SQL query construction.
* If raw SQL is absolutely necessary in custom xadmin components, rigorously use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
* Conduct mandatory code reviews of all custom xadmin actions and filters, specifically focusing on database interaction code and potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Utilize static analysis security tools to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in custom xadmin code.

## Threat: [Command Injection via File Uploads or Custom xadmin Features](./threats/command_injection_via_file_uploads_or_custom_xadmin_features.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit file upload functionalities within xadmin or custom features added via plugins or custom code that interact with the operating system. If file uploads are not properly validated or if custom features allow for execution of system commands based on user input processed through xadmin, command injection vulnerabilities could arise. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the xadmin application.
**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, full system compromise, data breach by accessing server files, denial of service by disrupting server operations.
**Affected xadmin component:** File upload handlers within xadmin or plugins, custom commands or features exposed through xadmin that interact with the operating system, plugin functionalities that process user input and interact with system commands.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate all file uploads handled by xadmin or its plugins, including file type, size, and content. Implement strict input validation for any file processing operations.
* Avoid allowing direct execution of system commands from within xadmin features or plugins if possible. Design alternative approaches that do not involve command execution.
* If command execution is absolutely necessary, sanitize and validate all input parameters passed to system commands with extreme rigor. Use whitelisting and avoid blacklisting approaches.
* Implement the principle of least privilege for the web server user account running the xadmin application to limit the potential impact of command injection vulnerabilities. Consider using sandboxing or containerization to further isolate the application.
