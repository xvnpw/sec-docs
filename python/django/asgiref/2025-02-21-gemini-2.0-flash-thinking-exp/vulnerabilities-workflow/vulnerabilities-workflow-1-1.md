### Vulnerability List:

*   #### Header Injection in WSGI Environment via Content-Length and Content-Type Headers

    *   **Description:**
        1.  An attacker sends an HTTP request to an application wrapped by `WsgiToAsgi`.
        2.  The attacker includes HTTP headers named `Content-Length` and/or `Content-Type` in their request.
        3.  The `WsgiToAsgi.build_environ` function processes these headers.
        4.  Due to direct assignment in `build_environ`, the attacker-controlled values for `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers are directly injected into the WSGI environment (`environ`) without sanitization or validation.
        5.  The wrapped WSGI application receives this modified `environ` dictionary.
        6.  If the WSGI application relies on `CONTENT_LENGTH` or `CONTENT_TYPE` from the environment for security checks, request parsing, or any other critical logic, it will be using attacker-controlled values.

    *   **Impact:**
        The impact of this vulnerability depends on how the wrapped WSGI application uses the `CONTENT_LENGTH` and `CONTENT_TYPE` environment variables. Potential impacts include:
        *   **Bypass security checks:** If the WSGI application uses `CONTENT_LENGTH` to validate the request body size for security reasons, an attacker could bypass these checks by injecting a smaller `CONTENT_LENGTH` value than the actual body size.
        *   **Request smuggling/desync:** In certain WSGI application setups or when interacting with other components that also process the request based on `CONTENT_LENGTH`, manipulating this header could lead to request smuggling or desync issues.
        *   **Unexpected application behavior:** If the WSGI application uses `CONTENT_TYPE` for content parsing or routing, an attacker could influence this behavior by injecting a different content type.
        *   **Information disclosure or other application-specific vulnerabilities:** Depending on the WSGI application's logic, manipulating these headers might expose other vulnerabilities or lead to information disclosure.

    *   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

    *   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
        No mitigations are implemented in the provided code. The `WsgiToAsgi.build_environ` function directly injects the header values into the WSGI environment.

    *   **Missing mitigations:**
        Input validation and sanitization for `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers in `WsgiToAsgi.build_environ` are missing. The application should either:
        *   Ignore `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers from the ASGI scope and rely on its own parsing or predefined values if needed.
        *   Sanitize or validate the values of `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers to ensure they are within expected bounds and formats before including them in the WSGI environment.

    *   **Preconditions:**
        *   The application must be using `asgiref.wsgi.WsgiToAsgi` to wrap a WSGI application.
        *   The wrapped WSGI application must rely on the `CONTENT_LENGTH` or `CONTENT_TYPE` environment variables for security-sensitive or critical operations.

    *   **Source code analysis:**
        ```python
        File: /code/asgiref/wsgi.py
        Content:
        ...
        def build_environ(self, scope, body):
            ...
            for name, value in self.scope.get("headers", []):
                name = name.decode("latin1")
                if name == "content-length":
                    corrected_name = "CONTENT_LENGTH"
                elif name == "content-type":
                    corrected_name = "CONTENT_TYPE"
                else:
                    corrected_name = "HTTP_%s" % name.upper().replace("-", "_")
                # HTTPbis say only ASCII chars are allowed in headers, but we latin1 just in case
                value = value.decode("latin1")
                if corrected_name in environ:
                    value = environ[corrected_name] + "," + value # Potential header merging issue, but not main vulnerability
                environ[corrected_name] = value # <--- Vulnerable line: direct assignment of header value to environ
            return environ
        ...
        ```
        The code iterates through the headers in the ASGI scope. When it encounters a header named "content-length" or "content-type", it directly assigns the header's value to the corresponding `CONTENT_LENGTH` or `CONTENT_TYPE` key in the `environ` dictionary.  There is no validation or sanitization of the `value` before assignment. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values for these critical environment variables.

    *   **Security test case:**
        1.  Set up a simple WSGI application that reads and prints the `CONTENT_LENGTH` environment variable.
            ```python
            # test_wsgi_app.py
            def application(environ, start_response):
                content_length = environ.get('CONTENT_LENGTH', 'Not Set')
                status = '200 OK'
                headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]
                start_response(status, headers)
                return [f"Content-Length: {content_length}".encode()]
            ```
        2.  Wrap this WSGI application with `WsgiToAsgi`.
            ```python
            from asgiref.wsgi import WsgiToAsgi
            from test_wsgi_app import application

            asgi_app = WsgiToAsgi(application)
            ```
        3.  Use `ApplicationCommunicator` to send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `Content-Length` header.
            ```python
            import asyncio
            from asgiref.testing import ApplicationCommunicator
            from asgi_wrapper import asgi_app # Assuming the wrapper from step 2 is in asgi_wrapper.py

            async def test_header_injection():
                instance = ApplicationCommunicator(
                    asgi_app,
                    {
                        "type": "http",
                        "http_version": "1.0",
                        "method": "GET",
                        "path": "/",
                        "query_string": b"",
                        "headers": [
                            [b"Content-Length", b"999999"] # Malicious Content-Length header
                        ],
                    },
                )
                await instance.send_input({"type": "http.request"})
                response_start = await instance.receive_output(1)
                response_body = await instance.receive_output(1)
                decoded_body = response_body['body'].decode()
                assert "Content-Length: 999999" in decoded_body # Verify injected value is present in WSGI app's output
                print(f"WSGI App Output: {decoded_body}")

            asyncio.run(test_header_injection())
            ```
        4.  Run the test case. Observe that the WSGI application's output shows `Content-Length: 999999`, demonstrating that the attacker-provided `Content-Length` header was successfully injected into the WSGI environment.
