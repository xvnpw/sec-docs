## Vulnerability List

There are no high-rank vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that meet the specified criteria.

After a thorough analysis of the code, focusing on potential issues exploitable by an external attacker and excluding DoS vulnerabilities and those due to insecure usage patterns, no critical or high-rank security flaws were identified within the `asgiref` library itself.

While the test suite includes an `xfail` test (`test_sync_to_async_with_blocker_thread_sensitive`) indicating a known limitation related to thread blocking in thread-sensitive contexts, this does not represent a direct, high-rank vulnerability that can be exploited by an external attacker to compromise the system's security or data integrity. It is more of a potential performance or deadlock issue under specific conditions, which leans towards denial of service and is explicitly excluded from the scope.

Therefore, based on the current project files and the given constraints, there are no vulnerabilities to list.
