## Vulnerability List

There are no vulnerabilities with a rank of high or critical identified in the provided project files that meet the specified criteria for external attackers.

After a thorough analysis focusing on vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in a publicly available instance and filtering based on the provided instructions, no such vulnerabilities were found that meet the rank of high or critical. The project demonstrates good security practices, and the identified potential issues are either already mitigated, related to misconfiguration rather than inherent code vulnerabilities, or do not meet the high or critical severity threshold for external attackers.

Therefore, based on the provided project files and the specified criteria for external attackers, there are no vulnerabilities to report in this updated list.
