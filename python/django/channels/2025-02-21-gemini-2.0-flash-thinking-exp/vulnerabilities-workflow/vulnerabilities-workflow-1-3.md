### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Origin Validation Bypass in Websocket Connections
* Description:
    * The `OriginValidator` middleware in `channels.security.websocket` is intended to protect against Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks by validating the `Origin` header of incoming WebSocket connections against a list of allowed origins.
    * However, the validation logic in `OriginValidator.match_allowed_origin` can be bypassed if an attacker crafts an `Origin` header that includes a valid allowed origin as a subdomain of a malicious domain.
    * Step-by-step trigger:
        1. An attacker identifies a valid allowed origin, for example, `allowed-domain.com`.
        2. The attacker registers a domain that includes the allowed origin as a subdomain, such as `allowed-domain.com.attacker-domain.com`.
        3. The attacker crafts a WebSocket connection request with the `Origin` header set to `http://allowed-domain.com.attacker-domain.com`.
        4. The `OriginValidator` middleware, using `is_same_domain`, incorrectly validates this origin as belonging to `allowed-domain.com`, bypassing the intended origin check.
        5. The WebSocket connection is established, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
* Impact:
    * **Critical**
    * Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass origin validation and establish a WebSocket connection from a malicious website, potentially leading to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).
    * This can allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user if the application relies on session-based authentication and WebSocket connections are used for sensitive operations.
* Vulnerability Rank: critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * The project uses `OriginValidator` middleware to check the `Origin` header.
    * Location: `/code/channels/security/websocket.py`
* Missing Mitigations:
    * The `is_same_domain` function used in `OriginValidator.match_allowed_origin` is too lenient and susceptible to subdomain bypasses.
    * Missing mitigation is to use more strict origin validation logic that prevents subdomain bypasses. For example by directly comparing hostnames after parsing and ensuring no subdomain matching is performed when not intended.
* Preconditions:
    * The Channels application uses `OriginValidator` middleware with a list of allowed origins.
    * The application relies on WebSocket connections for sensitive operations.
    * The allowed origins list contains domain names without wildcards or with wildcard patterns that are not strictly defined to prevent subdomain matching vulnerabilities.

    ```python
    def match_allowed_origin(self, parsed_origin, pattern):
        """
        ...
        """
        if parsed_origin is None:
            return False

        # Get ResultParse object
        parsed_pattern = urlparse(pattern.lower())
        if parsed_origin.hostname is None:
            return False
        if not parsed_pattern.scheme:
            pattern_hostname = urlparse("//" + pattern).hostname or pattern
            return is_same_domain(parsed_origin.hostname, pattern_hostname) # Vulnerable line
        # ...
    ```
    * The vulnerability lies in the line `return is_same_domain(parsed_origin.hostname, pattern_hostname)`.
    * `is_same_domain` from `django.http.request` performs a check that considers subdomains of the allowed host as valid.
    * For example, if `allowed_origins` includes `allowed-domain.com`, then `is_same_domain` will return `True` for both `allowed-domain.com` and `subdomain.allowed-domain.com`.
    * This behavior is exploited when the attacker uses `allowed-domain.com.attacker-domain.com` as the origin. `is_same_domain` will compare `allowed-domain.com.attacker-domain.com` with `allowed-domain.com` and incorrectly return `True` because `allowed-domain.com` is a "domain" of `allowed-domain.com.attacker-domain.com` in terms of `is_same_domain` logic (it checks for suffix match).

    ```python
    # django/http/request.py
    def is_same_domain(server_name, hostname):
        """
        Return ``True`` if the two hostnames are equal.

        If either hostname is a wildcard, return ``True`` if the non-wildcard
        hostname matches the wildcard.
        """
        server_name = server_name.lower()
        hostname = hostname.lower()
        if hostname.startswith('.'):
            return server_name.endswith(hostname)
        return server_name == hostname
    ```
    * As shown in Django's `is_same_domain` implementation, if `hostname` starts with `.`, it checks if `server_name` ends with `hostname`. In our case `hostname` is `allowed-domain.com` which doesn't start with `.`, so it performs simple equality check: `server_name == hostname`. However, if `hostname` is something like `.allowed-domain.com` then it will check if `server_name.endswith(hostname)`. Even though we are not using wildcard patterns here, the `is_same_domain` function still treats `allowed-domain.com` as a potential "domain" and allows subdomains of attacker-controlled domain to pass the check if they embed the allowed domain as a subdomain.

* Security Test Case:
    * Step-by-step test:
        1. Set up a Channels application that uses `OriginValidator` middleware with `allowed_origins = ["allowed-domain.com"]`.
        2. Prepare a malicious website hosted on `attacker-domain.com`.
        3. In the malicious website, create a JavaScript WebSocket client that attempts to connect to the Channels application's WebSocket endpoint.
        4. In the WebSocket client's connection request, set the `Origin` header to `http://allowed-domain.com.attacker-domain.com`.
        5. Observe the WebSocket connection attempt from the malicious website.
        6. Expected result: The WebSocket connection should be **accepted** by the Channels application, indicating a bypass of the origin validation.
        7. Correct behavior: The WebSocket connection should be **rejected** because the origin `http://allowed-domain.com.attacker-domain.com` is not in the allowed origins list and is from a different domain (`attacker-domain.com`).
