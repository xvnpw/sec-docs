# Vulnerability Report - Channels Project

## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files and considering the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified that meet the specified requirements for this report.

After thorough analysis focused on publicly exploitable vulnerabilities by external attackers, and filtering out vulnerabilities caused by insecure usage, missing documentation, or denial of service, no issues of high or critical severity were found within the Channels project itself.

The initial assessment stating that no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified remains valid based on the specified criteria.

It is important to reiterate that this analysis is limited to the Channels project's code and does not encompass vulnerabilities in user-developed applications built using Channels or the underlying deployment environment. Users of Channels must still adhere to secure coding practices and ensure proper configuration of their applications and infrastructure.

**Detailed Vulnerability Analysis (None Found Meeting Criteria):**

**Recommendations:**

While no specific high or critical vulnerabilities in the Channels project itself were identified according to the defined criteria, continuous security monitoring, code reviews, and security testing are always recommended as the project evolves.  Users should continue to follow security best practices when building and deploying applications using Channels, paying close attention to Django's security guidelines and best practices for WebSocket and asynchronous applications.
