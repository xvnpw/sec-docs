- **Vulnerability Name:** Missing Default Origin Validation on WebSocket Connections  
  **Description:**  
  The Channels framework provides an `OriginValidator` (and the helper `AllowedHostsOriginValidator`) in its security module, but it is not applied by default to WebSocket consumers. An external attacker can craft a WebSocket connection request that sets an arbitrary (or malicious) Origin header. If a deployed ASGI application does not wrap its WebSocket endpoints with an origin‐validating middleware, the connection will be accepted regardless of the request’s origin. In a step-by-step scenario, an attacker can connect from a malicious domain via a browser (or testing tool) supplied with a forged Origin header. Without validation, the endpoint may expose sensitive user data or allow unauthorized cross–origin interactions via an established WebSocket session.  

  **Impact:**  
  - Establishment of connections from hostile domains.  
  - Facilitation of Cross–Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH), possibly leading to session impersonation or unauthorized actions.  
  - Exposure of sensitive data sent via the WebSocket if user authentication is tied to session cookies.  

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The project includes an origin validation tool in `channels/security/websocket.py` (the `OriginValidator` and associated helper `AllowedHostsOriginValidator`).  
  - Tests demonstrate that when these validators are applied, connections with disallowed origins are rejected.  

  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no enforcement of origin checking by default. Developers must explicitly wrap their WebSocket consumers with an origin‐validating middleware.  
  - Clear documentation or secure defaults that apply origin validation automatically are missing.  

  **Preconditions:**  
  - The application exposes one or more WebSocket endpoints.  
  - The deployed application does not use middleware (such as `OriginValidator` or `AllowedHostsOriginValidator`) to limit acceptable origins.  
  - The allowed origins configuration is unset or misconfigured so that untrusted origins are permitted.  

  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `channels/security/websocket.py`, the `OriginValidator.__call__` method inspects the incoming connection’s headers for an “origin” value, decodes and parses it, and then calls the helper methods `valid_origin` and `validate_origin` to check against a provided list.  
  - However, because the Channels library does not enforce this check by default on all WebSocket applications, an ASGI application that is not wrapped by the validator will simply pass the connection request on to the inner application.  
  - The absence of a “default” requirement to verify origins means that if developers do not take extra (and explicit) steps, malicious origins can connect without further challenge.  

  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Deploy an ASGI application using Channels without wrapping the WebSocket consumers in an OriginValidator (i.e. use the raw consumer as provided).  
  2. Using a WebSocket testing tool (for example, the provided `WebsocketCommunicator` from the test suite or a tool like websocat), initiate a connection to a WebSocket endpoint.  
  3. In the connection request, include an “Origin” header with a value such as `http://malicious.com`.  
  4. Verify that the connection is accepted and that the WebSocket session is established.  
  5. Next, wrap the same WebSocket consumer using the `AllowedHostsOriginValidator` configured to allow only trusted domains (for instance, only `http://trusted.com`).  
  6. Repeat the connection with the malicious Origin header and confirm that the connection is now rejected.  

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Default Cookie Settings in Session Management  
  **Description:**  
  The session middleware implemented in the Channels package (in particular, within `channels/sessions.py`) uses a helper method `CookieMiddleware.set_cookie` to attach session cookies to HTTP responses. By default, many of the parameters (for example, `secure` is set to `False` and `samesite` is set to `"lax"`) come from the function’s defaults or the Django settings without enforcing stronger values. In production environments served over HTTPS, if the developer does not override these defaults (for example, by setting `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` in settings), session cookies may be sent over unencrypted channels or not have the ideal “SameSite” restrictions. An attacker with network access could intercept these cookies and hijack user sessions.  

  **Impact:**  
  - Session hijacking through interception of session cookies transmitted without the Secure flag over non‐TLS channels.  
  - Increased vulnerability to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and related attacks if cookie attributes are not set restrictively.  
  - Unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive application functionality if an attacker reuses a hijacked session cookie.  

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The `CookieMiddleware.set_cookie` method accepts parameters (such as `secure`, `httponly`, and `samesite`) and applies them to cookies.
  - Developers can configure these values by setting the corresponding Django settings (e.g. `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE`, etc.).  

  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no enforcement mechanism within the Channels code to require that secure attributes (like `secure=True`) be used in production.
  - By relying on developer configuration, an application deployed without revising defaults (which are typically more permissive) remains at risk.  
  - No automatic fallback or warning is built in to alert if insecure cookie settings are in effect in a public instance.  

  **Preconditions:**  
  - The application is deployed with default Django session settings (which often have `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False` in development).  
  - The application is running in an environment exposed to public traffic over non–TLS channels or with weak cookie security parameters.  
  - An attacker is able to observe or intercept HTTP traffic (for example, via a man–in–the–middle attack on an open Wi‑Fi network).  

  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `channels/sessions.py`, the `CookieMiddleware.set_cookie` method builds a cookie by calling Python’s `SimpleCookie` routines.  
  - The defaults provided include `secure=False` (unless overridden) and a default `samesite` value of `"lax"`.  
  - The code does not force stricter defaults (such as `Secure` and `HttpOnly` on production); it leaves adherence to best practices entirely up to the developer via Django’s settings.  
  - This “opt‐in” approach can lead to insecure cookie transmission if not corrected before deploying the Channels–based application in production.  

  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Deploy the application using the Channels session middleware with the default settings (i.e. without changing Django’s default `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and related settings).  
  2. Initiate a normal HTTP request (using a tool such as curl or a browser) that results in a response setting a session cookie.  
  3. Capture the response headers and verify that the `Set-Cookie` header does not include the `Secure` flag and that `SameSite` is only set to `"lax"`.  
  4. On a production–like deployment (or by simulating an HTTP environment), use a network proxy (e.g. Wireshark or mitmproxy) to verify that the session cookie is transmitted in cleartext.  
  5. Finally, simulate an attacker intercepting the cookie and reusing it in a subsequent request, thereby demonstrating session hijacking.  
  6. As an additional test, update the Django settings to enforce stricter parameters (for example, set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True`) and verify that the `Set-Cookie` header now includes secure attributes and that intercepted cookies are no longer transmitted over insecure channels.
