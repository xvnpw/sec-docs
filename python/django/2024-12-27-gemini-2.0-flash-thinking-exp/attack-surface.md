Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Django, with High and Critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface: SQL Injection**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.
    *   **How Django Contributes:**
        *   **Raw SQL Queries:**  Using `raw()` queries without proper parameterization bypasses Django's ORM protections.
        *   **Unsafe Query Construction:**  Dynamically building ORM queries based on user input without proper sanitization (e.g., string formatting).
        *   **Vulnerable ORM Features:**  In rare cases, specific ORM features or lookups, if used carelessly, might be exploitable.
    *   **Example:** A view function directly concatenates user input into a raw SQL query:
        ```python
        from django.db import connection

        def my_view(request):
            username = request.GET.get('username')
            with connection.cursor() as cursor:
                cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM auth_user WHERE username = '%s'" % username) # Vulnerable!
                row = cursor.fetchone()
            # ...
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries with the ORM:**  Let Django handle escaping.
        *   **Avoid `raw()` queries whenever possible.** If necessary, use parameterization.
        *   **Use Django's ORM query methods:**  These are designed to prevent SQL injection.

*   **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, redirect users, or deface websites.
    *   **How Django Contributes:**
        *   **Unescaped User Input in Templates:**  If user-provided data is rendered directly in templates without proper escaping, malicious scripts can be executed in the user's browser.
        *   **`safe` Filter Misuse:**  Incorrectly using the `safe` filter can bypass Django's auto-escaping and introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerable Template Tags/Filters:**  Custom or even built-in template tags or filters, if not carefully written, can introduce XSS.
    *   **Example:** A template directly renders user input without escaping:
        ```html+django
        <h1>Welcome, {{ user_input }}</h1>  <!-- Vulnerable if user_input contains <script> tags -->
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Account hijacking, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Django's auto-escaping:**  Django's template engine automatically escapes potentially dangerous characters by default.
        *   **Be cautious with the `safe` filter:** Only use it when you are absolutely sure the content is safe.
        *   **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

*   **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker tricks a logged-in user into making unintended requests on a web application.
    *   **How Django Contributes:**
        *   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** If CSRF protection is not enabled or implemented correctly, the application is vulnerable.
        *   **Misconfigured CSRF Middleware:**  Incorrectly configured `CsrfViewMiddleware` can lead to bypasses.
        *   **Missing CSRF Tokens in Forms:**  For POST requests, the CSRF token must be included in the form.
    *   **Example:** A malicious website contains a form that submits data to a vulnerable Django application while the user is logged in:
        ```html
        <form action="https://vulnerable-app.com/change_password/" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="new_password" value="attacker_password">
            <input type="submit" value="Click me!">
        </form>
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user (e.g., changing passwords, making purchases).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Django's CSRF protection:** Ensure `django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware` is in your `MIDDLEWARE` setting.
        *   **Use the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag in forms:** This inserts the necessary CSRF token.
        *   **Include the CSRF token in AJAX requests:**  Use the `X-CSRFToken` header.
        *   **Set `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True`:**  These settings enhance the security of the CSRF cookie.

*   **Attack Surface: Authentication and Authorization Issues**
    *   **Description:**  Flaws in how the application verifies user identity and controls access to resources.
    *   **How Django Contributes:**
        *   **Weak Password Policies:**  While Django provides strong password hashing, developers might implement weak custom authentication or not enforce strong password requirements.
        *   **Session Management Vulnerabilities:**  Improper handling of sessions can lead to session fixation or hijacking.
        *   **Insufficient Permission Checks:**  Failing to properly verify user permissions before granting access to views or data.
        *   **Insecure Password Reset Mechanisms:**  Weaknesses in the password reset process can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** A view function checks if a user is logged in but doesn't verify if they have the necessary permissions to access a specific resource:
        ```python
        from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

        @login_required
        def sensitive_data(request):
            # Accesses sensitive data without checking specific permissions
            data = get_sensitive_data()
            return render(request, 'sensitive_data.html', {'data': data})
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, account takeover, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce strong password policies:** Use Django's built-in password validation or implement custom validators.
        *   **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
        *   **Implement robust permission checks:** Use Django's permission system or custom authorization logic.
        *   **Secure session management:** Use HTTPS, set secure and HTTP-only flags on session cookies.
        *   **Follow secure password reset practices:** Use secure tokens and email verification.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure File Handling**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities related to how the application handles uploaded or accessed files.
    *   **How Django Contributes:**
        *   **Arbitrary File Upload:**  Allowing users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation can lead to code execution if the files are later accessed or executed by the server.
        *   **Path Traversal:**  Exploiting weaknesses in file path handling to access files outside of the intended directories.
        *   **Serving User-Uploaded Content Directly:**  Serving user-uploaded files directly from the application's domain can lead to XSS or other vulnerabilities if the files contain malicious content.
    *   **Example:** A view function allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file type:
        ```python
        def upload_file(request):
            if request.method == 'POST':
                uploaded_file = request.FILES['file']
                # Saves the file without checking its content or type
                with open('uploads/' + uploaded_file.name, 'wb+') as destination:
                    for chunk in uploaded_file.chunks():
                        destination.write(chunk)
                return HttpResponse("File uploaded!")
            return render(request, 'upload_form.html')
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate file types and content:**  Only allow specific file types and scan uploaded files for malicious content.
        *   **Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root:**  This prevents direct execution of uploaded files.
        *   **Use a dedicated storage service:**  Services like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage offer better security and scalability for file storage.
        *   **Serve user-uploaded content through a separate domain or with appropriate `Content-Disposition` headers:**  This can mitigate XSS risks.

*   **Attack Surface: Django Admin Interface Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:**  Security weaknesses in the Django admin interface.
    *   **How Django Contributes:**
        *   **Default Credentials:**  Using default credentials for the admin interface.
        *   **Weak Passwords for Admin Users:**  Admin accounts with easily guessable passwords.
        *   **Exposure of Admin Interface:**  Making the admin interface publicly accessible without proper access controls.
        *   **Exploiting Admin Functionality:**  Using the admin interface to perform malicious actions if custom actions or models have vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**  Leaving the default username and password for the superuser account unchanged.
    *   **Impact:** Full control of the application and its data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Change default admin credentials immediately.**
        *   **Enforce strong passwords for all admin users.**
        *   **Restrict access to the admin interface:**  Use IP whitelisting or VPNs.
        *   **Disable or remove unused admin features.**
        *   **Regularly audit admin user permissions.**

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Deserialization**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application deserializes data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **How Django Contributes:**
        *   **Using Pickle or other insecure serialization formats with untrusted data:**  Deserializing data from untrusted sources using formats like Pickle can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Example:** A view function deserializes data received from a user without proper validation:
        ```python
        import pickle

        def process_data(request):
            serialized_data = request.POST.get('data')
            data = pickle.loads(serialized_data.encode('latin1')) # Vulnerable!
            # ... process data ...
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.**
        *   **Use secure serialization formats like JSON:**  JSON is generally safer than Pickle.
        *   **If you must use Pickle, sign the data to ensure its integrity.**
        *   **Implement strict input validation before deserialization.**
