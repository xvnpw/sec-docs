# Attack Surface Analysis for django/django

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_template_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Django Contributes:** Django's template engine, if not used carefully, can render user-supplied data directly into HTML without proper escaping, leading to XSS. Specifically, using the `safe` filter or `mark_safe` incorrectly, or disabling auto-escaping in certain contexts, can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A comment form where user input is directly rendered in the template without escaping: `{{ comment.text|safe }}`. An attacker could submit a comment like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which would execute in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Rely on Django's automatic HTML escaping by default.
            *   Be extremely cautious when using the `safe` filter or `mark_safe`. Only use them when you are absolutely sure the data is safe and has been properly sanitized.
            *   Utilize Django's template context processors to pre-process data for safe rendering.
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
            *   Sanitize user input on the server-side before rendering it in templates.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Raw SQL or Improper ORM Usage](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_raw_sql_or_improper_orm_usage.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database queries.
    *   **How Django Contributes:** While Django's ORM provides protection against SQL injection when used correctly, developers can introduce vulnerabilities by:
        *   Using raw SQL queries (`cursor.execute()`) without proper parameterization.
        *   Using ORM methods like `extra()` or `raw()` with unsanitized user input.
        *   Dynamically constructing ORM query filters based on user input without proper sanitization.
    *   **Example:** A view that constructs a query using string formatting with user input: `Model.objects.raw('SELECT * FROM myapp_model WHERE name = %s', [request.GET.get('name')])`. If `request.GET.get('name')` contains `' OR '1'='1'`, it could lead to unintended data retrieval.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Always use parameterized queries with raw SQL.**
            *   **Rely on the ORM's query methods for filtering and data retrieval.**
            *   **Avoid using `extra()` or `raw()` with user-supplied data unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**
            *   **Sanitize and validate user input before using it in ORM queries.**
            *   Use Django's built-in form validation to ensure data integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on a web application.
    *   **How Django Contributes:** Django provides built-in CSRF protection through middleware and template tags. However, vulnerabilities can arise if:
        *   The CSRF middleware is not enabled or is incorrectly configured.
        *   The `{% csrf_token %}` template tag is missing from forms that perform state-changing actions.
        *   Custom views that handle POST requests do not properly check the CSRF token.
        *   AJAX requests are not configured to send the CSRF token.
    *   **Example:** A form without the `{% csrf_token %}` tag. An attacker could create a malicious website that submits a request to the vulnerable Django application, potentially performing actions as the logged-in user.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions on behalf of users, data modification, account compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Ensure the `CsrfViewMiddleware` is enabled in `MIDDLEWARE`.**
            *   **Always include the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag in all forms that perform state-changing actions (POST, PUT, DELETE).**
            *   **For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers (e.g., using JavaScript to fetch the token from cookies).**
            *   **Use the `@csrf_protect` decorator for views that handle POST requests if the middleware is not globally enabled.**
            *   **Consider using the `@ensure_csrf_cookie` decorator for views that serve forms with CSRF protection.**

## Attack Surface: [Session Hijacking and Fixation](./attack_surfaces/session_hijacking_and_fixation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers steal or manipulate user session IDs to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How Django Contributes:** Django manages user sessions using cookies. Vulnerabilities can occur if:
        *   Session cookies are not marked as `HttpOnly` and `Secure`, making them accessible to JavaScript and vulnerable to interception over insecure connections.
        *   Session IDs are predictable or easily guessable.
        *   The application doesn't regenerate session IDs after successful login (session fixation).
    *   **Example:** A Django application running over HTTP where the session cookie is not marked as `Secure`. An attacker on the same network could intercept the cookie.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Configure `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` in `settings.py`.**  Ensure your site is served over HTTPS for `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` to be effective.
            *   **Django's default session backend generates cryptographically secure session IDs.** Avoid custom session backends that might use weaker methods.
            *   **Django automatically regenerates session IDs upon login to prevent session fixation.** Ensure this default behavior is not overridden.
            *   Consider using `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Strict'` for enhanced protection against CSRF in some scenarios.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files that can be executed by the server or cause other harm.
    *   **How Django Contributes:** Django provides mechanisms for handling file uploads through forms and request data. Vulnerabilities arise if:
        *   Uploaded file names are not sanitized, allowing path traversal attacks (e.g., overwriting system files).
        *   Uploaded files are stored in publicly accessible locations without proper access controls.
        *   The application executes uploaded files directly (e.g., as scripts).
        *   File types are not validated, allowing the upload of unexpected or malicious file types.
    *   **Example:** A file upload form that saves files using the original filename without sanitization. An attacker could upload a file named `../../../../evil.php` to potentially overwrite a server-side script.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, remote command execution, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Sanitize uploaded file names to prevent path traversal.** Use Django's `os.path.basename` or similar functions.
            *   **Store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible by the web server.** Serve them through a controlled view that enforces access restrictions.
            *   **Never execute uploaded files directly.**
            *   **Validate file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.** Use libraries like `python-magic`.
            *   **Set appropriate file permissions on uploaded files.**
            *   **Implement file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.**
