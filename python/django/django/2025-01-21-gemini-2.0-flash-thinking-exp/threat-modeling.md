# Threat Model Analysis for django/django

## Threat: [SQL Injection via ORM `extra()` or `raw()`](./threats/sql_injection_via_orm__extra____or__raw___.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into a Django application by manipulating user input that is directly incorporated into raw SQL queries constructed using the `extra()` or `raw()` methods of the Django ORM. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database.
* **Impact:**  Data breach (accessing sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential for privilege escalation within the database, and denial of service.
* **Affected Component:** `django.db.models.query.QuerySet.extra()`, `django.db.models.query.QuerySet.raw()`
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid using `extra()` or `raw()` unless absolutely necessary.
    * If `extra()` or `raw()` are required, carefully sanitize and parameterize all user-provided input before incorporating it into the SQL query.
    * Prefer using the ORM's query methods for safer database interactions.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Template Variables](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unescaped_template_variables.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a Django template by providing input that is not properly escaped when rendered. This script will then execute in the browser of other users viewing the page, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on their behalf.
* **Impact:** Account takeover, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, and information theft.
* **Affected Component:** `django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates`, template rendering process.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure Django's automatic HTML escaping is enabled (it is by default).
    * Use the `safe` filter or `mark_safe` function with extreme caution and only for trusted content.
    * Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection Bypass](./threats/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__protection_bypass.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page or email that tricks a logged-in user into making unintended requests to the Django application. If Django's CSRF protection is not properly implemented or is bypassed, the attacker can perform actions as the authenticated user, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or modifying data.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized state changes, data modification, financial loss, and reputation damage.
* **Affected Component:** `django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware`, `{% csrf_token %}` template tag.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure the `CsrfViewMiddleware` is enabled in `MIDDLEWARE`.
    * Use the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag in all forms submitted via POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE.
    * For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers (e.g., `X-CSRFToken`).
    * Be cautious with custom form handling and ensure CSRF protection is applied.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can force a user to use a specific session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after they log in. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in Django's session management.
* **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionality.
* **Affected Component:** `django.contrib.sessions`, session management framework.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regenerate the session ID upon successful login.
    * Use HTTPS to protect session cookies from interception.
    * Configure session cookies with the `secure` and `httponly` flags.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Misconfigured Authentication Backends](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_misconfigured_authentication_backends.md)

* **Description:**  An attacker might exploit misconfigurations in custom or third-party authentication backends integrated with Django's authentication framework to bypass the normal authentication process. This could involve flaws in how credentials are verified or how user objects are created within the Django authentication system.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and application features.
* **Affected Component:** `django.contrib.auth.backends`, authentication framework.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly review and test custom authentication backends.
    * Ensure that authentication backends properly validate credentials and handle edge cases within the Django authentication flow.
    * Follow Django's best practices for implementing custom authentication.

## Threat: [Insecure Password Storage](./threats/insecure_password_storage.md)

* **Description:** If Django's password hashing mechanism is not used correctly or if a weak hashing algorithm is employed within the Django authentication system, attackers who gain access to the database can more easily crack user passwords.
* **Impact:** Account compromise, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
* **Affected Component:** `django.contrib.auth.hashers`, password hashing framework.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Always use Django's built-in password hashing functions (e.g., `make_password`, `check_password`).
    * Avoid implementing custom password hashing unless absolutely necessary and with expert security guidance.
    * Regularly update Django to benefit from improvements in password hashing algorithms.

## Threat: [Arbitrary File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/arbitrary_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., Python scripts) to the server if Django's file upload handling lacks proper validation. If these files are then accessible and executable by the web server, the attacker can gain remote code execution.
* **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
* **Affected Component:** File upload handling logic in views, `django.core.files.uploadhandler`.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Validate file types, sizes, and content using Django's form handling and validation features.
    * Store uploaded files in a non-executable location, ideally outside the web server's document root.
    * Consider using a dedicated storage service.
    * Implement virus scanning for uploaded files.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Debug Pages in Production](./threats/information_disclosure_via_debug_pages_in_production.md)

* **Description:** If Django's `DEBUG` setting is set to `True` in a production environment, detailed error pages generated by Django will be displayed to users. These pages can reveal sensitive information about the application's code, database structure, and server environment, which can be valuable to attackers.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, aiding attackers in identifying vulnerabilities and planning further attacks.
* **Affected Component:** `django.conf.settings`, error handling middleware provided by Django.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure that the `DEBUG` setting in `settings.py` is set to `False` in production environments.
    * Configure proper logging and error handling for production using Django's logging framework.
