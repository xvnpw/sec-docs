## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities (ORM & Database) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities__orm_&_database___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector: SQL Injection via Raw Queries or Improper ORM Usage [CRITICAL]**

*   **Description:** Attacker crafts malicious SQL queries that are executed against the database due to direct SQL usage or insufficient sanitization when using Django's ORM (e.g., `extra()`, `raw()`, or improper filtering).
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   Mitigation:  Strictly adhere to Django's ORM methods for data access and manipulation. Avoid raw SQL queries unless absolutely necessary and sanitize inputs thoroughly. Use parameterized queries where raw SQL is unavoidable. Regularly review ORM usage for potential injection points.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vector: Brute-Force Attacks on Login Forms**

*   **Description:** Attacker attempts to guess user credentials by repeatedly trying different combinations. While not strictly a Django vulnerability, lack of proper rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms can exacerbate this.
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   Mitigation: Implement rate limiting on login attempts. Consider using account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed attempts. Enforce strong password policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Misconfigurations [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_misconfigurations__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Settings Files [CRITICAL]**

*   **Description:** Accidental exposure of `settings.py` or environment variables containing sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secret keys.
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   Mitigation: Store sensitive information securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools. Avoid committing sensitive data directly to version control.

**Attack Vector: Debug Mode Enabled in Production [CRITICAL]**

*   **Description:** Leaving `DEBUG = True` in production exposes sensitive information and can provide attackers with valuable insights into the application's internals.
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   Mitigation: Ensure `DEBUG = False` in production environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Django Admin Interface [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_django_admin_interface__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector: Brute-Force Attacks on Admin Login [CRITICAL]**

*   **Description:** Similar to regular login, but targeting the admin interface.
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and account lockout for the admin interface. Consider using two-factor authentication for admin users. Rename the default `/admin/` URL.

**Attack Vector: Exploiting Missing or Weak Admin Permissions [CRITICAL]**

*   **Description:** Lack of proper permission controls within the admin interface can allow unauthorized users to modify data or perform administrative actions.
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   Mitigation: Carefully configure admin permissions and group assignments. Follow the principle of least privilege for admin users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector: Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI) via User-Uploaded Files [CRITICAL]**

*   **Description:** Improper handling of user-uploaded file paths can allow attackers to access or include arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   Mitigation: Sanitize and validate file paths. Store uploaded files outside the web root. Use secure file storage mechanisms.

**Attack Vector: Arbitrary File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution [CRITICAL]**

*   **Description:** Allowing users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation can enable attackers to upload malicious executable files (e.g., PHP, Python) and execute them on the server.
*   **Actionable Insight:**
    *   Mitigation: Restrict allowed file types. Perform thorough file content validation. Store uploaded files outside the web root and serve them through a separate domain or with restricted execution permissions.
