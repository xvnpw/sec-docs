# Attack Surface Analysis for django/django

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (ORM Misuse)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__orm_misuse_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, bypassing intended logic and gaining unauthorized access or control over the database.
    *   **Django Contribution:** Django's ORM, while designed to prevent SQL injection, can be misused by developers through raw queries, `extra()`, `raw()`, or incorrect usage of `F()` and `Q()` objects with unsanitized user input.
    *   **Example:** A view uses `request.GET.get('order_by')` directly in an `order_by()` clause without validation, allowing an attacker to inject SQL by manipulating the `order_by` parameter (e.g., `?order_by=id; DELETE FROM users; --`).
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution on the database server in severe cases.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries provided by the ORM.** Avoid `extra()` and `raw()` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   **Sanitize and validate user input** before using it in ORM queries, even with `F()` and `Q()` objects. Use Django's form validation and input sanitization features.
        *   **Employ database user with least privilege** principle. Limit database user permissions to only what is necessary for the application to function.
        *   **Regularly review and audit ORM queries** for potential injection vulnerabilities, especially in complex queries or those involving user input.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious template code into templates, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server when the template is rendered.
    *   **Django Contribution:** Django's template engine, while generally safe, can become vulnerable if developers dynamically generate templates or use unsafe custom template tags/filters that don't properly sanitize user input.
    *   **Example:** A developer allows users to customize email templates and directly renders user-provided template snippets using `Template` and `Context` without proper sandboxing or sanitization. An attacker could inject code like `{{ system('rm -rf /') }}`.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid dynamically generating templates based on user input.** If necessary, use a sandboxed template engine or strictly control the allowed template syntax.
        *   **Carefully review and secure custom template tags and filters.** Ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities by executing unsafe code or exposing sensitive data.
        *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** to limit the capabilities of the rendered page and mitigate the impact of potential SSTI.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Template Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_template_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages, which is then executed in users' browsers, allowing session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
    *   **Django Contribution:**  While Django provides auto-escaping, developers can bypass it using `mark_safe` incorrectly or in contexts where auto-escaping is not sufficient (e.g., rendering user input directly into JavaScript code blocks).
    *   **Example:** A developer uses `mark_safe` to render user-provided HTML content in a blog post without proper sanitization. An attacker injects `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` which executes JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, website defacement, phishing attacks, malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rely on Django's auto-escaping as much as possible.** Understand the contexts where it applies and where manual escaping is needed.
        *   **Sanitize user-provided HTML content** using a library like Bleach before rendering it in templates, especially when using `mark_safe`.
        *   **Escape data appropriately for the output context.** Use different escaping methods for HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and URLs.
        *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** to restrict the sources of JavaScript and other resources, reducing the impact of XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trick authenticated users into unknowingly performing actions on a web application, such as changing passwords or making purchases, without their consent.
    *   **Django Contribution:** Django provides built-in CSRF protection middleware and template tags, but developers must ensure they are correctly implemented in all state-changing forms and AJAX requests. Misconfigurations or omissions can leave the application vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A form for changing user settings is submitted via POST, but the developer forgets to include the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag in the form. An attacker can craft a malicious website that submits a forged request to change the user's settings when the user visits the attacker's site while logged into the vulnerable application.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions on behalf of users, data modification, account compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use Django's CSRF protection middleware.** Ensure it is enabled in `MIDDLEWARE` settings.
        *   **Include `{% csrf_token %}` template tag in all forms that use POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE methods.**
        *   **For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in headers or request data.** Refer to Django documentation for AJAX CSRF handling.
        *   **Test CSRF protection thoroughly** to ensure it is correctly implemented across all state-changing functionalities.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Interface Exposure](./attack_surfaces/admin_interface_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The Django admin interface, if accessible to the public internet without proper access controls, becomes a target for attackers to brute-force login credentials or exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **Django Contribution:** Django automatically provides a powerful admin interface. Leaving it publicly accessible is a common misconfiguration.
    *   **Example:** The `/admin/` URL is accessible without any IP restrictions. Attackers can attempt to brute-force admin usernames and passwords or try to exploit known vulnerabilities in Django or its dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data breach, data modification, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict access to the admin interface** to trusted IP addresses or networks using web server configurations (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or Django middleware.
        *   **Use strong and unique passwords** for admin users and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   **Rename the default admin URL** (e.g., change `/admin/` to something less predictable) to reduce automated attacks.
        *   **Regularly audit and update Django and its dependencies** to patch any security vulnerabilities in the admin interface.
        *   **Disable the admin interface entirely** if it's not needed in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Settings](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_settings.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive configuration settings like `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials, and API keys are accidentally exposed in version control, logs, or error messages, allowing attackers to gain full control of the application.
    *   **Django Contribution:** Django relies on `settings.py` to store configuration. Developers might inadvertently commit sensitive information to version control or expose it through debug pages.
    *   **Example:** The `SECRET_KEY` is hardcoded in `settings.py` and committed to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the repository, retrieves the `SECRET_KEY`, and can then sign cookies, generate password reset links, and potentially gain administrative access.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data breach, account takeover, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never hardcode sensitive settings directly in `settings.py`**.
        *   **Use environment variables** to store sensitive settings and load them into Django settings at runtime.
        *   **Use a secrets management tool** to securely store and manage sensitive configuration.
        *   **Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is strong, unique, and kept secret.** Rotate it periodically.
        *   **Disable `DEBUG = True` in production.** Debug mode exposes sensitive information in error pages.
        *   **Carefully review `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files** to prevent accidental commit of sensitive files.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File Upload](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., executable code, scripts) to the server, which can then be executed, leading to remote code execution or other attacks.
    *   **Django Contribution:** Django's file upload functionality, if not properly secured, can allow attackers to upload and potentially execute malicious files.
    *   **Example:** A file upload form doesn't validate file types or content. An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the web server is configured to execute PHP files in the media directory, the attacker can access the uploaded script via URL and execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, website defacement, malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate file types and extensions** on both client-side and server-side. Use Django's form validation and file field validators.
        *   **Scan uploaded files for malware** using antivirus software or dedicated file scanning libraries.
        *   **Store uploaded files outside of the web server's document root** if possible.
        *   **Configure web server to prevent execution of scripts** in media directories (e.g., disable PHP execution in media directories).
        *   **Use a dedicated storage service** (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for user uploads, which often provides built-in security features and prevents direct code execution.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (File Serving)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__file_serving_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate file paths to access files outside of the intended directories, potentially reading sensitive files or executing code.
    *   **Django Contribution:** Django's file serving, especially for user-uploaded media files, can be vulnerable if not implemented securely. Misconfigurations in URL patterns or file serving logic can lead to path traversal.
    *   **Example:** A view serves media files based on a user-provided filename from the URL. The code doesn't properly sanitize the filename, allowing an attacker to use paths like `../../../../etc/passwd` to access system files.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), potential for arbitrary file reading, in some cases, arbitrary file writing or code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the files accessible)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly serve user-provided file paths.**
        *   **Use Django's `FileField` and `upload_to` to manage file uploads.** Store files in a controlled directory structure.
        *   **Sanitize and validate filenames** before using them in file system operations.
        *   **Use secure file serving methods** provided by web servers (e.g., Nginx's `X-Accel-Redirect` or Apache's `X-Sendfile`) instead of Django directly serving files in production.
        *   **Restrict file permissions** to limit access to sensitive files on the server.
