# Threat Model Analysis for django/django

## Threat: [Insecure `SECRET_KEY` Management](./threats/insecure__secret_key__management.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure `SECRET_KEY` Management
*   **Description:** An attacker who obtains the `SECRET_KEY` can forge cryptographic signatures used by Django. This allows them to hijack user sessions, bypass CSRF protection, and potentially gain administrative access by manipulating signed data. This can be achieved if the `SECRET_KEY` is hardcoded, stored in version control, or easily guessed.
*   **Impact:** Critical account takeover, CSRF bypass, data manipulation, potential full application compromise.
*   **Django Component Affected:** `settings.py`, cryptographic functions (`django.core.signing`), session management (`django.contrib.sessions`), CSRF middleware (`django.middleware.csrf`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store `SECRET_KEY` securely outside of the codebase, ideally in environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
    *   Ensure strict file permissions on any files containing the `SECRET_KEY`.
    *   Regularly rotate the `SECRET_KEY`, especially if there is any suspicion of compromise.
    *   Generate a strong, randomly generated `SECRET_KEY` using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

## Threat: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./threats/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Threat:** Debug Mode Enabled in Production
*   **Description:** Running Django with `DEBUG = True` in a production environment exposes highly sensitive information in error pages. Attackers can leverage this information, including source code snippets, database query details, and environment variables, to understand the application's inner workings, identify vulnerabilities, and plan targeted attacks.
*   **Impact:** High information disclosure, significantly increased attack surface, easier vulnerability identification and exploitation by attackers.
*   **Django Component Affected:** `settings.py`, error handling mechanisms within Django, debug exception pages.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Absolutely ensure** that `DEBUG = False` is set in your production `settings.py` file.
    *   Implement robust logging and error monitoring solutions specifically designed for production environments to capture and analyze errors without exposing sensitive debug information to end-users or potential attackers.

## Threat: [Misconfigured `ALLOWED_HOSTS`](./threats/misconfigured__allowed_hosts_.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfigured `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
*   **Description:** If `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is not correctly configured, particularly if set to `['*']` or left with default insecure values, attackers can exploit Host header attacks. By injecting malicious Host headers, they can bypass Django's hostname validation. This can lead to vulnerabilities like password reset poisoning (sending password reset links to attacker-controlled domains) and cache poisoning, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites or serving them manipulated content.
*   **Impact:** High, password reset poisoning leading to account takeover, cache poisoning causing widespread redirection or serving of malicious content.
*   **Django Component Affected:** `settings.py`, Host header validation middleware (`django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully and explicitly configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include only the legitimate domain names and subdomains that your Django application is intended to serve.
    *   Strictly avoid using wildcard `*` in `ALLOWED_HOSTS` unless you have a very specific and well-understood reason to do so, and are fully aware of the security implications.
    *   Regularly review and update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` as your application's domain configuration evolves.

## Threat: [Insecure Static/Media File Serving in Production](./threats/insecure_staticmedia_file_serving_in_production.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Static/Media File Serving in Production
*   **Description:** Configuring Django to directly serve static and media files in production, especially using `django.contrib.staticfiles`'s development server, is highly insecure and inefficient. It can expose sensitive files if permissions are misconfigured, and the development server is not designed for production-level security or performance. Attackers might be able to directly access application code, configuration files, or user-uploaded content if not properly protected by a dedicated web server.
*   **Impact:** High, potential exposure of sensitive files (application code, configuration, user data), denial of service due to performance bottlenecks, increased attack surface.
*   **Django Component Affected:** `django.contrib.staticfiles`, URL configuration (`urls.py`), potentially `settings.py` if misconfigured, development server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** use Django's development server or `django.contrib.staticfiles` to serve static and media files in a production environment.
    *   Utilize a dedicated, production-grade web server like Nginx or Apache, or a Content Delivery Network (CDN), to efficiently and securely serve static and media files.
    *   Ensure proper access control configurations on the web server or CDN to restrict access to sensitive files and directories.

## Threat: [Template Injection](./threats/template_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Template Injection
*   **Description:** While Django's template engine is designed to be secure by default, vulnerabilities can arise if developers bypass automatic escaping mechanisms (e.g., using `mark_safe` without careful consideration) or create custom template tags/filters that do not properly sanitize user-provided data. Attackers can inject malicious code into templates, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if HTML is injected, or potentially Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) if unsafe template rendering is used, which in severe cases can lead to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** High, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) enabling session hijacking, defacement, and further attacks; Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and full server compromise.
*   **Django Component Affected:** Django template engine (`django.template`), custom template tags and filters (`django.template.Library`), `mark_safe` and related functions (`django.utils.html`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on Django's automatic HTML escaping for all user-provided data rendered in templates.
    *   Use `mark_safe` and similar functions that bypass auto-escaping with extreme caution and only after rigorous security review and input sanitization.
    *   Thoroughly sanitize user input before rendering it in templates, especially when using custom template tags or filters.
    *   Regularly audit custom template tags and filters for potential security vulnerabilities and ensure they properly handle and escape user input.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom ORM Methods or Managers](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_orm_methods_or_managers.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom ORM Methods or Managers
*   **Description:** Developers may introduce vulnerabilities when creating custom ORM methods or managers if they do not adequately handle user input or perform insecure operations within these custom components. This can lead to SQL injection if raw SQL queries are constructed insecurely, or other data manipulation vulnerabilities if custom logic is flawed. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass ORM protections, directly manipulate the database, and potentially gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **Impact:** High, potential SQL injection leading to data breach, data corruption, unauthorized data access, and in severe cases, remote code execution if database vulnerabilities are exploited.
*   **Django Component Affected:** Django ORM (`django.db.models`), custom model methods, custom model managers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Adhere to secure coding practices when developing custom ORM methods and managers.
    *   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries within custom ORM logic unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. When raw SQL is unavoidable, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Prefer using Django's ORM query methods and abstractions whenever possible, as they provide built-in protection against SQL injection.
    *   Thoroughly test custom ORM logic for potential vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on SQL injection and data manipulation flaws.

## Threat: [Insecure Password Reset Implementation](./threats/insecure_password_reset_implementation.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Password Reset Implementation
*   **Description:** Flaws in the password reset functionality, such as predictable reset tokens, insecure token storage, or lack of proper email verification, can enable attackers to hijack user accounts. An attacker could initiate a password reset for a target user and then intercept or guess the reset token to gain unauthorized access to the account, bypassing normal authentication.
*   **Impact:** High, account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application features, potential for further malicious actions after account compromise.
*   **Django Component Affected:** `django.contrib.auth`, password reset views (`django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetView`), password reset tokens, email sending mechanisms (`django.core.mail`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Django's built-in password reset functionality securely and avoid custom implementations unless absolutely necessary.
    *   Ensure password reset tokens are generated using cryptographically secure random number generators, are unpredictable, and have a limited lifespan.
    *   Implement robust email verification during the password reset process to confirm the user's identity.
    *   Protect password reset links from being intercepted or leaked by using HTTPS and secure email delivery mechanisms.

## Threat: [CSRF Protection Bypass due to Misconfiguration](./threats/csrf_protection_bypass_due_to_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** CSRF Protection Bypass due to Misconfiguration
*   **Description:** If Django's CSRF protection is disabled where it is needed, or not correctly implemented (e.g., missing `{% csrf_token %}` in forms, improper handling in AJAX requests), attackers can conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. They can trick authenticated users into unknowingly submitting malicious requests to the application, performing actions such as changing passwords, making unauthorized transactions, or modifying data without the user's conscious consent.
*   **Impact:** High, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users, data manipulation, potential account compromise, financial loss in transactional applications.
*   **Django Component Affected:** CSRF middleware (`django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware`), `{% csrf_token %}` template tag, AJAX request handling in JavaScript, form submission mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Django's CSRF middleware (`django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware`) is **always enabled** in your application's middleware settings.
    *   Consistently use the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag in all HTML forms that submit data using POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE methods.
    *   Properly handle CSRF tokens in AJAX requests by including the CSRF token in request headers (e.g., `X-CSRFToken`) or request data, as required by Django's CSRF protection.
    *   Avoid disabling CSRF protection unless there is an extremely compelling reason and a thorough understanding of the associated risks and alternative security measures are in place.

## Threat: [Unprotected Django Admin Interface](./threats/unprotected_django_admin_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Unprotected Django Admin Interface
*   **Description:** Leaving the Django admin interface publicly accessible without strong authentication and authorization makes it a highly attractive target for attackers. They can attempt brute-force attacks on admin login pages, exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the admin interface itself, or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and powerful administrative functionalities if login credentials are weak or compromised. Successful exploitation can lead to complete application and data compromise.
*   **Impact:** Critical, full application compromise, data breach, denial of service, complete administrative control takeover, potential for widespread damage and disruption.
*   **Django Component Affected:** `django.contrib.admin`, admin login views, admin interface URLs (`/admin/`), admin user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict access** to the Django admin interface to authorized users only. Implement network-level restrictions such as IP whitelisting or require access through a VPN.
    *   Enforce the use of **strong, unique passwords** for all admin accounts and mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced login security.
    *   Consider changing the default URL for the admin interface (e.g., from `/admin/` to a less predictable path) to obscure it from automated scanners and reduce its discoverability.
    *   Keep Django and all its dependencies up-to-date to patch any known security vulnerabilities in the admin interface and underlying framework.
    *   Implement rate limiting and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to protect the admin login page from brute-force attacks and suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Storage](./threats/insecure_session_storage.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Session Storage
*   **Description:** Utilizing insecure session storage backends, such as the default file-based sessions on a shared filesystem or database sessions without encryption at rest, can expose sensitive session data if the storage medium is compromised. Attackers who gain access to session data can hijack user sessions, impersonate users, and bypass authentication controls, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts and application functionalities.
*   **Impact:** High, session hijacking leading to account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application features, potential for further malicious actions after session compromise.
*   **Django Component Affected:** `settings.py` (specifically `SESSION_ENGINE` setting), session middleware (`django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware`), session backends (file-based, database, cache, cookies - defined by `SESSION_ENGINE`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Choose a **secure session backend** appropriate for your production environment. Consider using database sessions with encryption at rest, cached sessions (e.g., Redis or Memcached) with secure access controls, or signed cookies (with appropriate security considerations).
    *   Ensure proper security configurations for the chosen session backend. For database sessions, enable database encryption. For cached sessions, secure access to the cache server.
    *   If using cookie-based sessions, ensure `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` settings are set to `True` to enhance cookie security. Consider using signed cookies for integrity protection.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./threats/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

*   **Threat:** Unrestricted File Uploads
*   **Description:** If file upload functionality is not properly secured with validation and restrictions, attackers can upload malicious files, such as web shells or malware, to the server. If these malicious files can be executed (e.g., by being placed in a web-accessible directory or through other vulnerabilities), it can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, and complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Critical, Remote Code Execution (RCE) leading to full server compromise, data breach, data loss, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the infrastructure.
*   **Django Component Affected:** File upload views, forms utilizing `FileField` or `ImageField`, file handling logic in views, media storage mechanisms (`django.core.files.storage`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement **strict file upload validation** on both the client-side and server-side. Validate file types, file extensions, MIME types, file sizes, and file content.
    *   Utilize Django's form validation features and file field validators (`django.forms.FileField`, `django.forms.ImageField`) to enforce validation rules.
    *   Store uploaded files **outside of the web server's document root** to prevent direct execution of uploaded files via web requests.
    *   **Sanitize uploaded file names** to prevent directory traversal attacks and other injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a dedicated file storage service or Content Delivery Network (CDN) for handling and serving uploaded files, which can provide additional security layers.
    *   Implement **antivirus and malware scanning** on all uploaded files before they are stored or processed by the application.
