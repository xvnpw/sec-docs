# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for django/django

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Django's ORM for Database Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_django's_orm_for_database_interactions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Always use Django's ORM:**  Favor Django's ORM methods (e.g., `filter()`, `get()`, `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`) for database queries instead of writing raw SQL.
    2.  **Construct queries using ORM methods:** Build complex queries by chaining ORM methods. Avoid string concatenation or manual SQL construction within ORM calls.
    3.  **Review code for raw SQL:**  Periodically audit the codebase to identify and replace any instances of raw SQL queries with ORM equivalents where feasible.
    4.  **Educate developers:** Train developers on secure ORM usage and the risks of raw SQL within Django.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity): Attackers can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Reduction - The ORM's parameterization significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection by automatically escaping user inputs.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Generally Implemented: Django projects by default encourage and utilize the ORM. Most database interactions are likely already using the ORM in models, views, and forms.
    *   Implementation Location: Models (`models.py`), Views (`views.py`), Forms (`forms.py`), and template context processing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potential Raw SQL Usage:  Check for raw SQL usage in custom management commands, complex queries in views, or legacy code within Django components.
    *   `extra()` and `raw()` Queryset Methods: Review usage of `extra()` and `raw()` queryset methods within Django views and models, as these can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled carefully. Consider refactoring to use ORM methods if possible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterize Raw SQL Queries (when necessary in Django)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterize_raw_sql_queries__when_necessary_in_django_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify raw SQL in Django:** Locate all instances where raw SQL queries are used *within Django components* (e.g., with `connection.cursor()` or `extra()`/`raw()` querysets in views or models).
    2.  **Use placeholders:** Replace user-provided data within the SQL query string with placeholders (e.g., `%s` for PostgreSQL, `%s` or `?` for MySQL, depending on the database backend).
    3.  **Pass parameters separately:** Provide user inputs as a separate parameter list to the database cursor's `execute()` method or as arguments to `extra()`/`raw()` methods within Django.
    4.  **Avoid string formatting:** Never directly embed user input into SQL strings using string formatting (e.g., f-strings, `%` operator, `.format()`) within Django raw SQL contexts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity):  Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code through user inputs when raw SQL is necessary within Django components.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Reduction - Parameterization effectively prevents SQL injection by treating user inputs as data, not executable code, even in raw SQL scenarios within Django.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially Partially Implemented: Developers might be aware of parameterization but might not consistently apply it in all raw SQL instances within Django code.
    *   Implementation Location: Wherever raw SQL queries are used within Django views, models, or custom database interactions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Inconsistent Parameterization in Django: Ensure all raw SQL queries *within Django* are parameterized, especially in less frequently reviewed Django code paths.
    *   Lack of Awareness in Django Context: Developers might not fully understand the importance of parameterization specifically when using raw SQL within Django and might inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ensure CSRF Protection is Enabled and Used Correctly (Django Middleware & Templates)](./mitigation_strategies/ensure_csrf_protection_is_enabled_and_used_correctly__django_middleware_&_templates_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify CSRF Middleware:** Confirm that `'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware'` is present in the `MIDDLEWARE` setting in `settings.py`. This is Django's built-in CSRF protection.
    2.  **Use `{% csrf_token %}` in Django forms:**  Ensure the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag is included within all HTML forms rendered by Django templates that use POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE methods.
    3.  **Handle CSRF token in Django AJAX (if applicable):** For AJAX requests originating from Django templates that modify data, include the CSRF token in request headers (e.g., `X-CSRFToken`). Retrieve the token from cookies or the DOM using Django's JavaScript helpers.
    4.  **Minimize CSRF exemptions in Django views:**  Avoid using `@csrf_exempt` or `csrf_exempt()` on Django views unless absolutely necessary for public APIs or specific scenarios. Document and justify any exemptions within Django view code.
    5.  **Test Django CSRF protection:**  Thoroughly test forms and AJAX requests generated by Django to ensure CSRF protection is working correctly and not blocking legitimate requests within the Django application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High Severity): Prevents attackers from performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users by exploiting trust in the user's browser session, specifically within the Django application context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   CSRF: High Reduction - Django's CSRF protection, when correctly implemented using Django middleware and template tags, effectively mitigates CSRF attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially Implemented: CSRF middleware is often enabled by default in Django projects. `{% csrf_token %}` is commonly used in Django forms.
    *   Implementation Location: Middleware (`MIDDLEWARE` setting in `settings.py`), Django Templates (`.html` files), JavaScript code for AJAX requests originating from Django templates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   AJAX CSRF Handling in Django Context:  CSRF token handling in AJAX requests originating from Django templates might be missed, especially in single-page applications or complex JavaScript interactions within Django applications.
    *   Overuse of CSRF Exemptions in Django Views:  Unnecessary or poorly justified CSRF exemptions in Django views can weaken protection.
    *   Testing Gaps in Django Forms/AJAX:  CSRF protection might not be thoroughly tested across all Django forms and AJAX interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Secure Session Settings (Django Settings)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_secure_session_settings__django_settings_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` in Django settings:**  Enable this setting in `settings.py` to ensure Django session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
    2.  **Set `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True` in Django settings:** Enable this setting to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing Django session cookies, mitigating certain XSS attacks.
    3.  **Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Strict'` or `'Lax'` in Django settings:** Choose an appropriate `samesite` value to control when Django session cookies are sent in cross-site requests, helping prevent CSRF. `'Strict'` is generally more secure, but `'Lax'` might be needed for usability in some cases.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Session Hijacking (High Severity): `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` reduce the risk of Django session cookies being intercepted or stolen.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity): `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` mitigates some XSS attacks that aim to steal Django session cookies.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity): `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` helps prevent CSRF attacks related to Django sessions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Session Hijacking: High Reduction - Secure cookie settings significantly reduce the risk of Django session hijacking.
    *   XSS: Low Reduction - `HTTPONLY` provides limited mitigation against certain XSS scenarios related to session cookies.
    *   CSRF: Medium Reduction - `SAMESITE` provides a good layer of defense against CSRF related to session cookies.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially Partially Implemented: `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` might be set, but `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` might be missing in Django settings.
    *   Implementation Location: `settings.py` file.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` Configuration in Django: Might be set to `None` (default) or not optimally configured in Django settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set `DEBUG = False` in Production (Django Setting)](./mitigation_strategies/set__debug_=_false__in_production__django_setting_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate `DEBUG` setting in Django settings:** Find the `DEBUG` setting in your `settings.py` file.
    2.  **Set to `False` for production Django environment:** Ensure that `DEBUG = False` is set in your production environment's `settings.py` or environment variables used by Django.
    3.  **Verify in Django deployment:** Double-check that `DEBUG` is indeed `False` in your deployed production Django environment.
    4.  **Use separate Django settings for development and production:** Employ different settings files (e.g., `settings.py`, `settings_dev.py`, `settings_prod.py`) or environment variables to manage Django settings for different environments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (High Severity): `DEBUG = True` in Django exposes sensitive information like database credentials, application code, and server paths in error pages generated by Django, which can be exploited by attackers.
    *   Performance Degradation (Medium Severity): Debug mode in Django slows down application performance, making it more vulnerable to DoS attacks and impacting user experience.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: High Reduction - Setting `DEBUG = False` in Django prevents the exposure of sensitive information in Django error pages.
    *   Performance Degradation: Medium Reduction - Improves Django application performance by disabling debug-related overhead.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially Implemented in Production:  Hopefully, `DEBUG = False` is already set in production for Django. However, it's crucial to verify the Django settings.
    *   Implementation Location: `settings.py` file, environment variables used by Django.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Verification in Production Django Environment:  Need to explicitly verify that `DEBUG = False` in the deployed production Django environment's settings.
    *   Environment-Specific Django Settings:  Proper separation of development and production Django settings might be missing, leading to accidental `DEBUG = True` in production Django deployments.
