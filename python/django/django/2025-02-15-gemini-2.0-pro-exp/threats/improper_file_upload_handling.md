# Deep Analysis: Improper File Upload Handling in Django

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Improper File Upload Handling" threat within the context of a Django application, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the risk.  We aim to go beyond the general description and provide practical guidance for developers.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of file upload handling in a Django application:

*   **Django's Built-in Mechanisms:**  `FileField`, `ImageField`, and related model and form functionalities.
*   **Custom Upload Handlers:**  Any custom code written to process file uploads, including views, forms, and utility functions.
*   **Storage Configuration:**  How and where uploaded files are stored (local filesystem, cloud storage, etc.).
*   **Validation Logic:**  All checks performed on uploaded files (type, size, content).
*   **Interaction with Web Server:** How the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) handles requests for uploaded files.
*   **Third-party libraries:** Usage of any third-party libraries for file upload or processing.

This analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities that are purely within the operating system or web server configuration, *unless* they are directly exploitable due to improper file upload handling within the Django application.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Reiterate the threat model's description and impact to establish a baseline.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical & Best Practices):**  Analyze common Django code patterns (both vulnerable and secure) related to file uploads.  We'll use hypothetical examples to illustrate vulnerabilities and best-practice implementations.
3.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify specific points of failure in the Django application's file upload process that could lead to exploitation.
4.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic attack scenarios, demonstrating how an attacker could exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**  Provide detailed, actionable mitigation strategies, going beyond the high-level recommendations in the threat model.  This will include code examples and configuration recommendations.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Suggest specific testing techniques to verify the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1. Threat Model Review (Recap)

*   **Threat:** Improper File Upload Handling
*   **Description:**  The application allows users to upload files but lacks sufficient validation, allowing attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., shell scripts) that can be executed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Components:** `FileField`, `ImageField`, custom file upload logic, views handling uploads.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

### 4.2. Code Review & Vulnerability Identification

Let's examine common scenarios and vulnerabilities:

**4.2.1. Vulnerable Scenario 1: Relying Solely on File Extension**

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class UserProfile(models.Model):
    avatar = models.FileField(upload_to='avatars/')

# forms.py
from django import forms
from .models import UserProfile

class UserProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = UserProfile
        fields = ['avatar']

# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import UserProfileForm

def upload_avatar(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UserProfileForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('profile')
    else:
        form = UserProfileForm()
    return render(request, 'upload_avatar.html', {'form': form})
```

**Vulnerability:** This code only relies on Django's default behavior, which primarily checks the file extension.  An attacker could rename a PHP shell script (e.g., `shell.php`) to `shell.php.jpg` or `shell.jpg` and potentially bypass the validation.  If the web server is misconfigured to execute `.php.jpg` files as PHP, or if the attacker can find a way to access the file directly (e.g., through directory traversal), they can achieve RCE.

**4.2.2. Vulnerable Scenario 2:  Insufficient File Size Limit**

The code above also lacks an explicit file size limit.  An attacker could upload a very large file, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting server resources (disk space, memory).

**4.2.3. Vulnerable Scenario 3:  Storing Files in the Web Root**

The `upload_to='avatars/'` setting, without further configuration, might place uploaded files within the web root (e.g., `media/avatars/`).  This makes it easier for an attacker to directly access and potentially execute uploaded files.

**4.2.4. Vulnerable Scenario 4: Predictable File Names**

If the uploaded file retains its original name, or if a predictable naming scheme is used (e.g., sequential numbering), an attacker can more easily guess the file's URL and attempt to access it.

**4.2.5. Vulnerable Scenario 5: Lack of Content Inspection (Magic Numbers)**

Django's `FileField` and `ImageField` perform basic checks, but they don't deeply inspect the file's content.  An attacker could craft a file that appears to be a valid image (based on its header) but contains malicious code embedded within it.

### 4.3. Exploitation Scenarios

**Scenario 1:  PHP Shell Upload**

1.  **Attacker Action:**  The attacker creates a PHP file named `shell.php` containing malicious code (e.g., `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`).
2.  **Bypass:**  The attacker renames the file to `shell.php.jpg`.
3.  **Upload:**  The attacker uploads the file through the vulnerable form.
4.  **Execution:**  The attacker accesses the file via a URL like `https://example.com/media/avatars/shell.php.jpg?cmd=ls`.  If the web server is misconfigured, the PHP code executes, and the attacker gains a shell on the server.

**Scenario 2:  DoS via Large File Upload**

1.  **Attacker Action:** The attacker creates a very large file (e.g., several gigabytes).
2.  **Upload:** The attacker uploads the file through the vulnerable form.
3.  **Impact:** The server's disk space fills up, or the upload process consumes excessive memory, causing the application to become unresponsive.

**Scenario 3:  .htaccess Bypass (Apache)**

1.  **Attacker Action:** The attacker uploads a file named `.htaccess` containing directives to override server configurations.
2.  **Upload:** The attacker uploads the file to a directory within the web root.
3.  **Impact:**  The attacker can potentially disable security measures, enable directory listing, or even execute arbitrary code, depending on the server's configuration.  This is particularly dangerous if the uploaded files directory is within the web root.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

**4.4.1.  Robust File Type Validation (Magic Numbers)**

*   **Use `python-magic`:** This library identifies file types by examining their "magic numbers" (characteristic byte sequences at the beginning of the file).

    ```python
    import magic
    from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

    def validate_file_type(value):
        allowed_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif']
        file_type = magic.from_buffer(value.read(2048), mime=True) #read first 2kb
        value.seek(0) #reset position
        if file_type not in allowed_types:
            raise ValidationError('Invalid file type.  Only JPG, PNG, and GIF are allowed.')

    # In your models.py
    class UserProfile(models.Model):
        avatar = models.FileField(upload_to='avatars/', validators=[validate_file_type])
    ```

* **Important:** Always reset file's position after reading from stream.

**4.4.2.  File Size Limitation**

*   **Use Django's `FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` setting:** This limits the size of files that can be uploaded in memory.  Larger files will be streamed to disk, but you still need a hard limit.
*   **Use a validator:**

    ```python
    from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
    from django.conf import settings

    def validate_file_size(value):
        max_size = settings.MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE  # Define this in your settings.py (e.g., 5 * 1024 * 1024 for 5MB)
        if value.size > max_size:
            raise ValidationError(f'File too large. Size should not exceed {max_size / (1024 * 1024)} MB.')

    # In your models.py
    class UserProfile(models.Model):
        avatar = models.FileField(upload_to='avatars/', validators=[validate_file_size]) #add to validators
    ```

**4.4.3.  Store Files Outside the Web Root**

*   **Use `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` correctly:**
    *   `MEDIA_ROOT`:  An absolute path to a directory *outside* your web server's document root.  For example: `/var/www/myproject/media/`.
    *   `MEDIA_URL`:  The URL prefix for accessing uploaded files.  For example: `/media/`.
    *   Configure your web server (Apache, Nginx) to serve files from `MEDIA_ROOT` under the `MEDIA_URL` prefix.  This prevents direct execution of uploaded files.

**4.4.4.  Rename Uploaded Files**

*   **Use a UUID:**  Generate a universally unique identifier (UUID) for each uploaded file.

    ```python
    import uuid
    import os
    from django.db import models

    def user_directory_path(instance, filename):
        # file will be uploaded to MEDIA_ROOT/user_<id>/<uuid>.<ext>
        ext = filename.split('.')[-1]
        filename = f"{uuid.uuid4()}.{ext}"
        return 'user_{0}/{1}'.format(instance.user.id, filename)

    class UserProfile(models.Model):
        user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE) #example
        avatar = models.FileField(upload_to=user_directory_path)
    ```

**4.4.5.  Use a Dedicated File Storage Service (e.g., AWS S3)**

*   **Benefits:**  Offloads file storage and serving, improves security, scalability, and performance.
*   **Django Packages:**  Use `django-storages` to integrate with various cloud storage providers (S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage).
*   **Configuration:**  Configure `django-storages` to use your chosen provider and set appropriate permissions (e.g., make uploaded files private by default).

**4.4.6.  Virus Scanning**

*   **Integrate with a Virus Scanning API:**  Use a service like ClamAV or VirusTotal to scan uploaded files.
*   **Django Packages:**  Consider using a package that provides integration with virus scanning services.
*   **Asynchronous Scanning:**  Perform virus scanning asynchronously (e.g., using Celery) to avoid blocking the upload process.

**4.4.7. Sanitize filenames**

Sanitize filenames to remove any potentially dangerous characters.

```python
import re
from django.utils.text import get_valid_filename

def sanitize_filename(filename):
    return get_valid_filename(filename)
```

**4.4.8. Content-Disposition Header**

Set the `Content-Disposition` header to `attachment` to force the browser to download the file instead of trying to display it inline. This can prevent XSS attacks if an attacker manages to upload an HTML file. This should be handled by your webserver or storage backend.

**4.4.9. Disable directory listing**

Ensure that directory listing is disabled on your web server. This prevents attackers from browsing the contents of your upload directories.

### 4.5. Testing Recommendations

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Test the validators (`validate_file_type`, `validate_file_size`) with valid and invalid files.
    *   Test the file renaming logic.
    *   Test file upload with different file types and sizes.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Test the complete upload process, including form submission, validation, storage, and retrieval.
    *   Test with different web server configurations.
*   **Security Tests (Penetration Testing):**
    *   Attempt to upload malicious files (e.g., shell scripts, HTML files with XSS payloads).
    *   Attempt to bypass file type and size restrictions.
    *   Attempt to access uploaded files directly.
    *   Attempt DoS attacks by uploading large files.
    *   Use automated vulnerability scanners to identify potential weaknesses.
* **Fuzz testing:**
    * Use fuzz testing to test file upload with random data.
