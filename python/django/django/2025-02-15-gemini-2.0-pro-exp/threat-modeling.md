# Threat Model Analysis for django/django

## Threat: [DEBUG = True in Production](./threats/debug_=_true_in_production.md)

*   **Threat:** `DEBUG = True` in Production

    *   **Description:** An attacker accesses the application and triggers an error.  Because `DEBUG` is enabled, Django displays detailed error pages containing sensitive information like source code snippets, database queries, environment variables, and installed packages.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure leading to complete system compromise. Attackers can use the revealed information to identify further vulnerabilities, craft targeted attacks, and potentially gain access to the database or server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `settings.py` (`DEBUG` setting).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set `DEBUG = False` in production environments.
        *   Use environment variables to control the `DEBUG` setting, ensuring it's never accidentally committed to version control as `True`.
        *   Implement robust error handling and logging to capture errors without exposing sensitive information to users.

## Threat: [SECRET_KEY Leakage](./threats/secret_key_leakage.md)

*   **Threat:** `SECRET_KEY` Leakage

    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains the `SECRET_KEY` through various means (e.g., exposed in source code, error messages, compromised server, or weak configuration management). The attacker then uses the key to forge session cookies, craft malicious password reset tokens, or tamper with other cryptographically signed data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application compromise.  The attacker can impersonate users, gain administrative access, and potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Affected Component:** `settings.py` (`SECRET_KEY` setting), session management, cryptographic signing functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode the `SECRET_KEY` in `settings.py`.
        *   Load the `SECRET_KEY` from a secure environment variable or a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Regularly rotate the `SECRET_KEY`.
        *   Ensure the `SECRET_KEY` is not exposed in error messages or logs.
        *   Use a strong, randomly generated `SECRET_KEY` (at least 50 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols).

## Threat: [ALLOWED_HOSTS Misconfiguration](./threats/allowed_hosts_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** `ALLOWED_HOSTS` Misconfiguration

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a request with a manipulated `Host` header that doesn't match any of the entries in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.  If Django doesn't validate the `Host` header, it might process the request, potentially leading to vulnerabilities like cache poisoning, password reset poisoning, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Impact:**  Cache poisoning, password reset poisoning, redirection attacks, and potential for other vulnerabilities that rely on the `Host` header.
    *   **Affected Component:** `settings.py` (`ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting), HTTP request processing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to a list of the specific domains that the application should serve.  Never use `['*']` in production.
        *   Regularly review and update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` as the application's deployment changes.

## Threat: [Unprotected Django Admin Interface](./threats/unprotected_django_admin_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Unprotected Django Admin Interface

    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers the Django admin interface (often at the default `/admin/` URL) and attempts to brute-force login credentials or exploit vulnerabilities in the admin interface itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the application's data and administrative functionality.  The attacker can modify data, delete records, add malicious users, and potentially gain complete control of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Django admin interface (`django.contrib.admin`), authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change the default `/admin/` URL to a less predictable path.
        *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all admin users.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin access.
        *   Restrict access to the admin interface based on IP address or network.
        *   Regularly audit admin logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege, granting admin access only to users who absolutely need it.
        *   Ensure custom admin views have proper authentication and authorization checks.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a form with extra fields that are not explicitly handled by the form or serializer.  If the model doesn't protect against mass assignment, the attacker can modify fields they shouldn't have access to (e.g., setting `is_staff=True` to gain administrative privileges).
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized modification of data, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Django models, forms (`django.forms`), serializers (Django REST Framework).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the `fields` attribute in Django forms and serializers to explicitly specify which fields are allowed to be modified.
        *   Alternatively, use the `exclude` attribute to specify fields that should *not* be modified.
        *   Avoid using `__all__` for the `fields` attribute unless absolutely necessary and with careful consideration.
        *   Validate all user input on the server-side, even if client-side validation is in place.

## Threat: [Unsafe Use of `mark_safe` or `safe` Filter](./threats/unsafe_use_of__mark_safe__or__safe__filter.md)

*   **Threat:** Unsafe Use of `mark_safe` or `safe` Filter

    *   **Description:** A developer uses the `mark_safe` function or the `safe` template filter to bypass Django's automatic HTML escaping.  If user-provided input is passed to these functions without proper sanitization, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, potentially stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
    *   **Affected Component:** Django template engine, `django.utils.safestring.mark_safe`, `safe` template filter.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `mark_safe` or the `safe` filter whenever possible.
        *   If they must be used, ensure that any user-provided input is *thoroughly* sanitized and validated before being marked as safe.  Use a dedicated HTML sanitization library (e.g., Bleach) instead of relying on custom sanitization logic.
        *   Prefer using Django's built-in escaping mechanisms whenever possible.

## Threat: [Template Injection](./threats/template_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Template Injection

    *   **Description:** User input is directly incorporated into template logic (e.g., within `{% if %}` or `{% for %}` tags) without proper sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious template code, potentially gaining access to template context variables or executing arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Django template engine, custom template tags, views that render templates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid incorporating user input directly into template logic.
        *   Pass user input as variables to the template context and use Django's built-in escaping mechanisms to render them safely.
        *   If user input must be used in template logic, thoroughly sanitize and validate it before doing so.

## Threat: [Improper File Upload Handling](./threats/improper_file_upload_handling.md)

* **Threat:** Improper File Upload Handling

    * **Description:** The application allows users to upload files, but does not properly validate the file type, size, or content. An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a shell script disguised as an image) that can be executed on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** `FileField`, `ImageField`, custom file upload handling logic, views that handle file uploads.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate the file type using a robust method (e.g., checking the file's magic number, not just the extension).
        *   Limit the file size to a reasonable maximum.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct execution.
        *   Rename uploaded files to prevent attackers from guessing the file name.
        *   Use a dedicated file storage service (e.g., AWS S3) to handle file uploads and storage securely.
        *   Scan uploaded files for malware using a virus scanner.
