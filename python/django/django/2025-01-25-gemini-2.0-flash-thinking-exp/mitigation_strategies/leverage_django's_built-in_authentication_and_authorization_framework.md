Finding a balance between security and usability is crucial.
    *   **Bypassable if Not Consistently Applied:**  Password policies are only effective if consistently applied across all user creation and password modification pathways within the application.
    *   **Not a Silver Bullet:** Strong passwords alone are not sufficient to prevent all account takeovers. They are a crucial layer of defense but should be combined with other security measures like MFA.

**Threats Mitigated:** Primarily **Account Takeover** and **Brute-Force Attacks**. Strong passwords make it significantly harder for attackers to guess or brute-force passwords.

**Impact:** High positive impact. Significantly reduces the risk of account takeover and brute-force attacks by making passwords more resistant to cracking.

#### Step 3: Use Django's Permission System to Control Access

**Description:** This step emphasizes utilizing Django's permission system to implement role-based access control (RBAC). It advocates defining clear permission models and using decorators like `@login_required` and `@permission_required` to enforce authorization in views, models, and functionalities.

**Analysis:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Granular Access Control:**  Django's permission system allows for fine-grained control over access to different parts of the application based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Separation of Concerns:**  Decouples authorization logic from application code, making it easier to manage and maintain access control policies.
    *   **Declarative Authorization:**  Decorators like `@login_required` and `@permission_required` provide a declarative and readable way to enforce authorization in views.
    *   **Flexibility and Customization:**  Django's permission system is flexible and can be customized to meet complex authorization requirements, including group-based permissions, object-level permissions, and custom permission checks.
    *   **Integration with Admin Interface:**  Permissions are easily managed through Django's admin interface, simplifying administration and auditing.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Complexity in Complex Scenarios:**  Implementing complex permission structures can become challenging to manage and understand, especially in large applications with many roles and permissions. Careful planning and documentation are essential.
    *   **Potential for Over-Permissiveness or Under-Permissiveness:**  Incorrectly configured permissions can lead to either overly permissive access (allowing unauthorized access) or under-permissive access (hindering legitimate users). Thorough testing and review are crucial.
    *   **Performance Considerations (Object-Level Permissions):**  Object-level permissions, while powerful, can introduce performance overhead if not implemented efficiently, especially in scenarios with large datasets.

**Threats Mitigated:** Primarily **Unauthorized Access**.  Ensures that only authorized users can access specific functionalities and data.

**Impact:** High positive impact.  Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data by enforcing a robust authorization mechanism.

#### Step 4: Secure Password Reset and Account Recovery Processes
