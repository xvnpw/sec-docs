    * **1. SQL Injection (SQLi):** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries to manipulate data, bypass authentication, or even execute operating system commands.
        * **Django Relevance:** While Django's ORM provides some protection, raw SQL queries or improper use of `extra()` or `raw()` can introduce SQLi vulnerabilities.
        * **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation, potential remote code execution.
    * **2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
        * **Django Relevance:** Improper handling of user-generated content in templates or forms can lead to XSS.
        * **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
    * **3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Tricking authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application.
        * **Django Relevance:** While Django has built-in CSRF protection, misconfiguration or overlooking specific scenarios can lead to vulnerabilities.
        * **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data modification, privilege escalation.
    * **4. Insecure Deserialization:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application deserializes data, potentially leading to remote code execution.
        * **Django Relevance:**  If Django is used to deserialize untrusted data (e.g., from cookies or external sources), vulnerabilities can arise.
        * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    * **5. Command Injection:**  Injecting malicious commands into the operating system through the application.
        * **Django Relevance:** If the application interacts with the operating system (e.g., through `subprocess` or `os.system`), improper input sanitization can lead to command injection.
        * **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise.
    * **6. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Tricking the server into making requests to unintended locations, potentially internal resources or external systems.
        * **Django Relevance:** If the application fetches resources based on user input without proper validation, SSRF vulnerabilities can occur.
        * **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential compromise of other systems.
    * **7. Business Logic Flaws:** Exploiting flaws in the application's design or implementation to achieve unauthorized actions.
        * **Django Relevance:** These are highly application-specific and can involve issues like insecure payment processing, access control bypasses, or data manipulation.
        * **Impact:** Financial loss, data breaches, privilege escalation.

* **B. Authentication and Authorization Issues:**
    * **1. Weak or Default Credentials:** Using easily guessable passwords or default credentials for administrative accounts.
        * **Django Relevance:**  Ensuring strong password policies and avoiding default credentials during setup is crucial.
        * **Impact:** Account takeover, complete application control.
    * **2. Brute-Force Attacks:**  Repeatedly trying different usernames and passwords to gain access.
        * **Django Relevance:** Implementing rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms is essential.
        * **Impact:** Account takeover.
    * **3. Credential Stuffing:** Using compromised credentials from other breaches to attempt login.
        * **Django Relevance:**  Encouraging strong, unique passwords and potentially implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) can mitigate this.
        * **Impact:** Account takeover.
    * **4. Session Hijacking:** Stealing or intercepting valid session tokens to gain unauthorized access.
        * **Django Relevance:** Secure session management, using HTTPS, and implementing HTTP-only and secure flags for cookies are important.
        * **Impact:** Account takeover.
    * **5. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  Accessing resources directly by manipulating object identifiers without proper authorization checks.
        * **Django Relevance:** Ensuring proper permission checks and using secure methods for identifying resources is crucial.
        * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    * **6. Privilege Escalation:** Gaining access to higher-level privileges than initially authorized.
        * **Django Relevance:**  Carefully manage user roles and permissions within the application.
        * **Impact:** Complete application control.

**II. Exploiting Configuration and Deployment Issues:**

* **A. Debug Mode Enabled in Production:** Leaving Django's `DEBUG` setting set to `True` in a production environment.
    * **Django Relevance:** This exposes sensitive information, error details, and can potentially lead to remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential remote code execution.
* **B. Exposed Secret Key:**  Revealing the `SECRET_KEY` used for cryptographic signing.
    * **Django Relevance:** The `SECRET_KEY` is critical for security and should be kept confidential.
    * **Impact:** Session hijacking, CSRF bypass, data tampering.
* **C. Misconfigured Static File Serving:** Allowing access to sensitive files through improperly configured static file serving.
    * **Django Relevance:**  Ensure proper configuration of static file URLs and permissions.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential access to source code or configuration files.
