# Attack Surface Analysis for django/django

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

* **Description**: Attackers inject malicious code into template directives, which is then executed on the server.
    * **How Django Contributes**: If user-provided data is directly rendered into templates without proper escaping, especially when using template features like filters or tags that allow code execution.
    * **Example**:  A user comment containing `{{ request.environ.os.system('rm -rf /') }}` might be executed if not handled carefully.
    * **Impact**: Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity**: Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Always escape user-provided data when rendering in templates.
        * Avoid using `safe` filter or `mark_safe` unnecessarily.
        * Consider using a sandboxed template engine if complex user input is involved.
        * Regularly audit template code for potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via ORM](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_orm.md)

* **Description**: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access or manipulating data.
    * **How Django Contributes**: While Django's ORM provides some protection, vulnerabilities can arise when using `extra()`, `raw()`, or constructing complex `Q` objects with unsanitized user input.
    * **Example**: A URL like `/items/?order_by=name; DELETE FROM items;` might execute a destructive SQL command if the `order_by` parameter is directly used in an `extra()` query.
    * **Impact**: Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity**: Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Always use parameterized queries with the ORM.
        * Avoid using `extra()` and `raw()` queries with user-provided data.
        * Carefully construct `Q` objects and validate user input used in them.
        * Use database-specific escaping functions if necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_template_rendering.md)

* **Description**: Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by other users' browsers.
    * **How Django Contributes**: Failure to properly escape variables within templates can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. While Django's auto-escaping helps, it might be insufficient in certain contexts or when using the `safe` filter.
    * **Example**: A user profile containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` might execute the script when the profile is displayed to other users if not escaped.
    * **Impact**: Account takeover, data theft, defacement.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Rely on Django's automatic HTML escaping.
        * Be cautious when using the `safe` filter or `mark_safe`.
        * Use context-aware escaping when dealing with different output formats (e.g., JavaScript, CSS).
        * Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

* **Description**: Attackers trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on a web application.
    * **How Django Contributes**: If CSRF protection is not properly implemented (e.g., missing `@csrf_protect` decorator or CSRF token in forms), attackers can forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
    * **Example**: An attacker could embed a malicious form on their website that, when visited by an authenticated user of the Django application, transfers funds or changes account settings.
    * **Impact**: Unauthorized actions, data manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Ensure the `CsrfViewMiddleware` is enabled in `MIDDLEWARE`.
        * Use the `@csrf_protect` decorator for views that handle sensitive form submissions.
        * Include the CSRF token in all forms using the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag.
        * Set the `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` settings.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

* **Description**: Allowing users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation can lead to various attacks.
    * **How Django Contributes**: Django provides mechanisms for handling file uploads, but it's the developer's responsibility to implement proper validation and security measures.
    * **Example**: An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image, which is then executed by the web server, leading to remote code execution.
    * **Impact**: Remote code execution, data breach, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity**: Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Validate file types and extensions on the server-side.
        * Limit file sizes.
        * Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root.
        * Generate unique and unpredictable filenames.
        * Scan uploaded files for malware.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/admin_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description**: Security flaws in the Django admin interface can expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized actions.
    * **How Django Contributes**: The default admin interface, while convenient, can be a target for brute-force attacks, and vulnerabilities in custom admin actions or configurations can be exploited.
    * **Example**: An attacker brute-forces weak admin credentials or exploits a missing authorization check in a custom admin action to delete user accounts.
    * **Impact**: Data breach, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Use strong and unique passwords for admin accounts.
        * Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin logins.
        * Restrict access to the admin interface by IP address or VPN.
        * Regularly audit custom admin actions for security vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using a custom admin interface with stricter security controls.

## Attack Surface: [Session Fixation](./attack_surfaces/session_fixation.md)

* **Description**: Attackers trick users into using a session ID that the attacker controls, allowing them to hijack the user's session.
    * **How Django Contributes**: If session IDs are predictable or not properly regenerated upon login, attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
    * **Example**: An attacker sends a user a link with a specific session ID, and if the user logs in using that link, the attacker can then use the same session ID to access the user's account.
    * **Impact**: Account takeover.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Ensure Django's session backend is configured securely.
        * Regenerate the session ID upon successful login.
        * Set the `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` settings.

## Attack Surface: [Management Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/management_command_injection.md)

* **Description**: Attackers can inject malicious commands into Django management commands if user input is not properly sanitized.
    * **How Django Contributes**: If management commands accept user input and directly use it in system calls or other potentially dangerous operations without validation, they can be vulnerable.
    * **Example**: A management command that accepts a filename as input might be exploited to execute arbitrary commands if the filename is crafted maliciously (e.g., `; rm -rf /`).
    * **Impact**: Remote code execution, data manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Avoid using user input directly in system calls within management commands.
        * Sanitize and validate all user input before using it in any potentially dangerous operations.
        * Consider using safer alternatives to system calls where possible.
