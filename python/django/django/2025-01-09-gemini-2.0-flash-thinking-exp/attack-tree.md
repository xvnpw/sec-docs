## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Django Application (*** Critical Node: Root Goal - Ultimate Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_django_application___critical_node_root_goal_-_ultimate_impact_.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved significant control over the application and its resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (OR)** (*** Critical Node: Common Entry Point)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__or____critical_node_common_entry_point_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks that target how the application processes user-supplied data. It's a common entry point because web applications inherently need to handle user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Inject Malicious Data (OR)** (*** Critical Node: Direct Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data__or____critical_node_direct_impact_.md)

This node signifies attacks where the attacker successfully inserts harmful data into the application. This data can then be interpreted and executed, leading to various forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [**SQL Injection via ORM Misuse** (*** Critical Node: High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_orm_misuse___critical_node_high_impact_.md)

**Craft Malicious ORM Queries:** Attackers exploit flaws in how the Django ORM is used (e.g., using `extra()` or `raw()` queries with unsanitized input) to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database. This can lead to data breaches, modification, or deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe Template Rendering** (*** Critical Node: High Impact, Enables Session Hijacking)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsafe_template_rendering___critical_node_high_impact__enables_sessio_9f8079f0.md)

**Inject Script into User-Generated Content:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into areas where user input is displayed (e.g., comments, forum posts) without proper sanitization. When other users view this content, the script executes in their browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Authentication and Session Management Vulnerabilities (OR)** (*** Critical Node: Direct Access Control Breach)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_session_management_vulnerabilities__or____critical_node_direct_access_con_6403892d.md)

This category focuses on bypassing or subverting the mechanisms that control who can access the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Default or Weak Credentials (e.g., on Admin Panel)** (*** Critical Node: Easy High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_or_weak_credentials__e_g___on_admin_panel____critical_node_easy_high_impact_.md)

Attackers attempt to log in using common default credentials (e.g., "admin"/"password") or easily guessable passwords, particularly targeting the Django admin panel which provides extensive control.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Hijack User Sessions (OR)** (*** Critical Node: Account Takeover)](./attack_tree_paths/hijack_user_sessions__or____critical_node_account_takeover_.md)

This involves stealing or manipulating a user's active session to gain unauthorized access to their account.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Session Hijacking via XSS** (*** Critical Node: Dependent on XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/session_hijacking_via_xss___critical_node_dependent_on_xss_.md)

**Steal Session Cookie via JavaScript Injection:** Leveraging an existing XSS vulnerability, attackers inject JavaScript to steal the user's session cookie and then use it to impersonate the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities (OR)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_engine_vulnerabilities__or_.md)

This category targets weaknesses in how the template engine processes and renders dynamic content.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** (*** Critical Node: Remote Code Execution)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti____critical_node_remote_code_execution_.md)

**Inject Malicious Code into Template Directives:** Attackers inject code directly into template syntax that is then executed by the server-side template engine. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Django Admin Panel Vulnerabilities (OR)** (*** Critical Node: High Privilege Access)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_django_admin_panel_vulnerabilities__or____critical_node_high_privilege_access_.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities specific to the Django admin interface, which offers significant control over the application's data and configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_admin_credentials.md)

Attackers systematically try different username and password combinations to gain access to the admin panel.

## Attack Tree Path: [CSRF Attacks on Admin Actions](./attack_tree_paths/csrf_attacks_on_admin_actions.md)

**Trick Admin User into Performing Malicious Actions:** Attackers trick an authenticated admin user into unknowingly submitting malicious requests that perform actions they didn't intend (e.g., creating a new admin user, changing settings).

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Settings Misconfigurations (OR)** (*** Critical Node: Fundamental Security Flaws)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_settings_misconfigurations__or____critical_node_fundamental_security_flaws_.md)

This category highlights vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure configuration of the Django application's settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [**DEBUG Mode Enabled in Production** (*** Critical Node: Easy to Exploit, High Information Disclosure)](./attack_tree_paths/debug_mode_enabled_in_production___critical_node_easy_to_exploit__high_information_disclosure_.md)

Leaving Django's `DEBUG` setting set to `True` in a production environment exposes sensitive information like source code snippets, database credentials, and internal paths, making it easier for attackers to find and exploit other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Insecure SECRET_KEY** (*** Critical Node: Core Security Compromise)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_secret_key___critical_node_core_security_compromise_.md)

The `SECRET_KEY` is used for cryptographic signing. If it's weak, known, or compromised, attackers can forge signatures, potentially leading to session hijacking, data tampering, and other severe consequences.
