# Threat Model Analysis for django/django

## Threat: [SQL Injection via ORM `extra()` or Raw SQL](./threats/sql_injection_via_orm__extra____or_raw_sql.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user input that is directly incorporated into `extra()` calls or raw SQL queries (using `connection.cursor().execute()`). This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting data. This vulnerability directly stems from how Django allows developers to interact with the database.

**Impact:** Database breach, data exfiltration, data manipulation, potential denial of service by dropping tables or executing resource-intensive queries.

**Affected Component:** `django.db.models.QuerySet.extra()`, `django.db.connection.cursor().execute()`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid using `extra()` or raw SQL when possible. If necessary, parameterize queries using placeholders (`%s`, `%d`) and pass parameters separately. Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs. Use Django's ORM methods for filtering and data manipulation whenever feasible.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_template_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into templates if auto-escaping is explicitly disabled or bypassed (e.g., using the `safe` filter incorrectly or rendering user-supplied HTML without proper sanitization). This allows them to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user. This is a direct consequence of how Django's templating engine renders dynamic content.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.

**Affected Component:** `django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates`, template rendering process, template tags and filters.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure auto-escaping is enabled and used correctly. Sanitize user-provided HTML using a library like Bleach before rendering it in templates if absolutely necessary. Avoid using the `safe` filter on user-controlled data. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability in Forms/Serializers](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability_in_formsserializers.md)

**Description:** An attacker could submit unexpected or additional data in form submissions or API requests that modifies model fields that were not intended to be changed. This occurs if forms or serializers are not explicitly defining allowed fields using `fields` or `exclude`. This vulnerability arises from Django's form and serializer handling mechanisms.

**Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation (if modifying permission-related fields), unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Component:** `django.forms.Form`, `django.forms.ModelForm`, Django REST Framework serializers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Explicitly define the fields that are allowed to be modified in forms and serializers using the `fields` attribute or exclude unwanted fields using the `exclude` attribute. Avoid using `fields = '__all__'` or leaving fields undefined in production.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Forms/Custom Fields](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_formscustom_fields.md)

**Description:** If custom form fields or data handling logic uses insecure deserialization methods (like `pickle`) on user-provided data, an attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server. While the *choice* of deserialization library might be external, Django's flexibility in custom form fields and data processing makes this a relevant threat.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.

**Affected Component:** Custom form fields, data processing logic within views or forms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid using `pickle` or other insecure deserialization methods for handling user input. Use safer data serialization formats like JSON. If deserialization is necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization before deserializing.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Misconfigured Authentication Backends](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_misconfigured_authentication_backends.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured authentication backends or custom authentication logic can create vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass the authentication process and gain access to user accounts without proper credentials. This directly involves Django's authentication framework and its pluggable backend system.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches, ability to perform actions as other users.

**Affected Component:** `django.contrib.auth.backends`, authentication middleware, custom authentication logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully review and test authentication backend configurations. Ensure strong password policies are enforced. Implement multi-factor authentication. Avoid custom authentication logic unless absolutely necessary and ensure it is thoroughly vetted for security.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

**Description:** If the session ID is not properly regenerated after a successful login, an attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by forcing them to use a known session ID. This is a vulnerability within Django's session management.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.

**Affected Component:** `django.contrib.sessions` middleware and backend.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure that Django's session management is configured to regenerate the session ID upon successful login (this is the default behavior). Use HTTPS to protect session cookies from being intercepted. Set the `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` flags.

## Threat: [CSRF Token Bypass](./threats/csrf_token_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers might find ways to bypass Django's CSRF protection, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in custom views that don't use the `csrf_protect` decorator or `csrf_token` template tag correctly, or by exploiting weaknesses in how CSRF tokens are handled in AJAX requests. This directly relates to Django's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms.

**Impact:** Ability to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or modifying data.

**Affected Component:** `django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware`, `csrf_token` template tag, `csrf_protect` decorator.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Always use the `csrf_protect` decorator for views that handle sensitive data modifications via POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Ensure the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag is included in all relevant forms. Properly handle CSRF tokens in AJAX requests (e.g., by including the token in headers).
