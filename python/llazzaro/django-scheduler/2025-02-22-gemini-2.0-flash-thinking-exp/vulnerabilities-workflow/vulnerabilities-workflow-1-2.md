- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Default Permission Functions Allowing Unauthorized Event Modification
  - **Description:**
    The scheduler’s default permission functions (used for events and occurrences) simply check that a user is authenticated rather than verifying that the user owns or is otherwise authorized to modify the event. This means that any logged‑in user can modify, move, or delete events and occurrences that do not belong to them. For example, the API endpoint for moving/resizing an occurrence calls the default function:
    ```python
    def check_event_permission(ob, user):
        return user.is_authenticated
    ```
    Since every authenticated user satisfies this check, an attacker with a low‑privilege (or non-privileged) account can exploit this weakness.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker who can log in—even with a low‑privilege account—can alter or delete events created by other users. This may result in loss of important scheduling data, unauthorized calendar modifications, and overall data integrity issues.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Sensitive views and API endpoints are decorated with permission check functions (e.g. via `check_event_permissions` and `check_occurrence_permissions`).
    - However, these decorators rely on functions that only check `user.is_authenticated`.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - A robust, fine‑grained authorization check is missing. The system should verify event ownership or privileges (for example, through role‑based or ownership‑based checks) before allowing modifications.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker must be able to log in to the system (even as a non‑privileged user).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In **schedule/settings.py**, the default permission function is defined as:
       ```python
       def check_event_permission(ob, user):
           return user.is_authenticated
       ```
    2. In views (such as in the `_api_move_or_resize_by_code` function in **schedule/views.py**), the permission is checked as follows:
       ```python
       if CHECK_OCCURRENCE_PERM_FUNC(occurrence, user):
           occurrence.save()
       ```
       Because the check merely verifies that the user is authenticated, any logged‑in user can trigger changes on any occurrence.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create two user accounts (e.g. “victim” and “attacker”).
    2. Log in as “victim” and create an event using the scheduler.
    3. Log out and then log in as “attacker.”
    4. Use the application’s front‑end or directly send a POST request (for example, via the API endpoint `api_move_or_resize_by_code`) with parameters (such as the victim’s occurrence ID and the appropriate delta) to modify the event’s timing.
    5. Verify that the change is applied, even though “attacker” is not the event’s owner.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unrestricted Access to Event Creation via API Endpoint
  - **Description:**
    The API endpoint `api_select_create` accepts POST parameters (such as “start”, “end”, and “calendar_slug”) and creates a new event with a default placeholder title. Although the endpoint is decorated with `@require_POST` and `@check_calendar_permissions`, when the configuration setting `CALENDAR_VIEW_PERM` is disabled (its default is False), the permission decorator bypasses authentication. This configuration allows both unauthenticated and unauthorized users to create events.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker or automated bot can flood the calendar with fake events. This can result in data pollution and may disrupt the scheduling functionality.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The endpoint requires a POST request (via `@require_POST`).
    - It is wrapped by a permission decorator; however, when `CALENDAR_VIEW_PERM` is False the decorator does not enforce authentication.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Enforce authentication and a proper authorization mechanism on all API endpoints that allow modification or creation of data.
    - Tie event creation to the identity of the authenticated user (for example, by explicitly setting the creator field) and restrict who may create events.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The default settings are in place (with `CALENDAR_VIEW_PERM = False`), allowing the API to be used without further access control.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In **schedule/views.py**, the endpoint is defined as:
       ```python
       @require_POST
       @check_calendar_permissions
       def api_select_create(request):
           start = request.POST.get("start")
           end = request.POST.get("end")
           calendar_slug = request.POST.get("calendar_slug")
           response_data = _api_select_create(start, end, calendar_slug)
           return JsonResponse(response_data)
       ```
    2. The internal function `_api_select_create` parses the start and end times and creates a new event:
       ```python
       Event.objects.create(
           start=start, end=end, title=EVENT_NAME_PLACEHOLDER, calendar=calendar
       )
       ```
    3. Since `CALENDAR_VIEW_PERM` defaults to False, the decorator bypasses authentication, meaning any user can create an event.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Without logging in, send a POST request to `/api/select_create/` with valid POST parameters for “start”, “end”, and “calendar_slug.”
    2. Check (via the application interface or directly in the database) that a new event is created with the default placeholder title.
    3. Confirm that the event lacks an owner assignment and that access control was not enforced.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insufficient Input Validation in API Endpoints Leading to Server Errors
  - **Description:**
    Several API endpoints perform direct type conversions and date parsing on user‑supplied parameters without rigorous validation or sanitization. For example, in the `api_move_or_resize_by_code` endpoint the “delta” parameter is converted via:
    ```python
    delta = datetime.timedelta(minutes=int(request.POST.get("delta")))
    ```
    without verifying that it is numeric. Similarly, the `api_occurrences` endpoint uses custom date “convert” functions that assume specific string formats. Malformed inputs may trigger unexpected runtime exceptions.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker may trigger unhandled exceptions that result in HTTP 500 errors. When debug settings are misconfigured in production, such errors might reveal stack traces or internal data structures, thereby leaking potentially useful information for further attacks.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Some endpoints include basic try/except blocks (especially around date parsing in `api_occurrences`), but these are not comprehensive.
    - The endpoints assume that the input data strictly follows specific formats rather than enforcing them.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust input validation (for example, using Django forms or serializers) to enforce strict data types and formats before processing.
    - Add comprehensive error handling that catches malformed inputs and returns generic error messages without revealing internal details.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The API endpoints are publicly accessible (or accessible to authenticated users) and an attacker can supply arbitrary POST or GET parameters.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In **schedule/views.py**, the `api_move_or_resize_by_code` endpoint retrieves the “delta” value and immediately converts it:
       ```python
       delta = datetime.timedelta(minutes=int(request.POST.get("delta")))
       ```
       If a non‑numeric string is provided, a `ValueError` will be raised.
    2. In the same file, the `api_occurrences` function uses a nested `convert` function that attempts to parse date strings with fixed formats (`"%Y-%m-%d"` or `"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"`). If the data does not match these formats, a `ValueError` is raised.
    3. These instances demonstrate that there is no robust pre‑validation of the inputs before type conversion or date parsing.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Use a tool such as curl or Postman to send a POST request to the `/api/move_or_resize/` endpoint with the “delta” parameter set to a non‑numeric value (e.g. “abc”).
    2. Observe whether the application returns an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error and inspect any error details.
    3. Similarly, send a GET request to `/api/occurrences` with deliberately malformed date strings for “start” and “end”.
    4. Verify that improper inputs trigger errors and note whether error messages expose internal details.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insufficient Input Validation in Recurrence Rule Parameters Leading to Application Errors
  - **Description:**
    The recurrence rule functionality allows for defining event recurrences using a textual parameter string (stored in the `params` field of the Rule model). The method `get_params` in **schedule/models/rules.py** parses this string by splitting it into key‑value pairs and converting each value to an integer or a weekday constant. However, there is no strict validation or whitelisting of the parameter keys or the allowed value ranges. An attacker who can supply or manipulate the recurrence rule (for example, via an event creation API endpoint or through an admin interface) may inject malformed or unexpected parameters. When these parameters are later passed directly to the dateutil.rrule constructor in `Event.get_rrule_object`, they may trigger runtime exceptions.
  - **Impact:**
    Triggering a runtime exception in the recurrence rule generation may lead to HTTP 500 errors, resulting in service disruption. If debug settings are enabled, such errors could reveal sensitive internal information (for example, stack traces and internal parameter values). This disrupts scheduling functionality and may aid an attacker in further probing the system.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - In the `get_params` method, the parameter string is split and attempts are made to convert values using a basic helper function (`_weekday_or_number`).
    - There is no explicit validation or enforcement of an allowed set of keys or value formats.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust input validation for the recurrence rule parameters. Use a strict schema or whitelist that only permits known keys (such as “count”, “bysetpos”, “bymonth”, “bymonthday”, etc.) and validates that the associated values fall within acceptable ranges.
    - Add comprehensive error handling in the recurrence rule generation to catch and log invalid parameters without exposing sensitive error details to the end user.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker must be able to supply or modify a recurrence rule’s `params` value (for example, via an unprotected event creation or rule‑editing endpoint) and have that rule used in generating event occurrences (triggering a call to `Event.get_rrule_object`).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In **schedule/models/rules.py**, the `get_params` method processes the textual `params` field as follows:
       - The method splits the string on semicolons to separate key‑value pairs.
       - Each key‑value pair is further split on a colon; if the split does not yield exactly two elements, the pair is skipped.
       - The value part is split by commas and each token is processed through `_weekday_or_number`, which attempts an integer conversion or maps known weekday abbreviations.
       - No check is made to ensure that the keys are among a defined list of allowed recurrence parameters.
    2. In **schedule/models/events.py**, the recurrence rule is constructed in `get_rrule_object` by retrieving these parameters using:
       ```python
       params = self._event_params()
       return rrule.rrule(frequency, dtstart=dtstart, until=until, **params)
       ```
       Here, any malformed or unexpected key/value in `params` is passed directly to dateutil’s rrule constructor, which may then raise an exception.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Through an API endpoint or the admin interface, create a new recurrence rule with the `params` field set to an invalid string (for example, `"invalid_key:non_numeric"`).
    2. Associate this rule with an event so that when `Event.get_rrule_object()` is called it uses the invalid rule.
    3. Access an API endpoint or view that triggers the generation of event occurrences (for example, by calling `get_occurrence()` or `get_occurrences()` on the event).
    4. Verify that this input results in an HTTP 500 error (or another unhandled exception) and that the response reveals internal error details, indicating that proper input validation and error handling are missing.
