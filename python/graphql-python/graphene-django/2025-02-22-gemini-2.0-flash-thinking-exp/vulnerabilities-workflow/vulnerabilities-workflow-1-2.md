- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposed GraphiQL and Introspection Endpoint
  - **Description:**
    An attacker who accesses a publicly available GraphQL endpoint may inadvertently encounter an interactive GraphiQL IDE and be able to execute introspection queries. This action discloses the full schema—including queries, mutations, types, fields, and their descriptions—which can help an adversary understand internal data structures, business logic, and potentially plan more focused attacks.
    - For example, several URL configuration files now (in `/code/graphene_django/tests/urls_pretty.py` and `/code/graphene_django/tests/urls_inherited.py`) configure the GraphQL view such that the GraphiQL parameter is either omitted (defaulting to a development setting) or explicitly set to `True`.
    - As a result, if these configurations make their way into a production deployment, introspection and an interactive IDE may be exposed to external attackers.
  - **Impact:**
    Full disclosure of the GraphQL schema enables attackers to examine the internal data model, understand resolver behavior, and potentially craft queries or mutations that bypass non‑standard business rules or discover further weaknesses in the back‑end implementations.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The example and test projects include documentation on how to configure the GraphQL view and highlight GraphiQL usage in a development/testing context.
    - However, the provided configurations themselves always instantiate the GraphQL view with GraphiQL enabled (or do not check for production mode).
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - In production deployments, the GraphiQL interface and introspection queries should be disabled (for example, by setting `graphiql=False` when `DEBUG` is not enabled).
    - Additional access control (such as enforcing authentication or IP‑whitelisting) should be applied to introspection endpoints.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed using one of the sample or test URL configurations, such as those in `/code/graphene_django/tests/urls_pretty.py` or `/code/graphene_django/tests/urls_inherited.py`, without proper environment‐based gating.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The original issue was observed in `/code/examples/cookbook/cookbook/urls.py`, where the GraphQL view is instantiated with `graphiql=True`.
    - The new evidence from `/code/graphene_django/tests/urls_pretty.py` (using `pretty=True`) and `/code/graphene_django/tests/urls_inherited.py` (with a custom subclass explicitly setting `graphiql=True`) confirms that multiple endpoint variants exist with GraphiQL enabled.
    - Without a runtime check (for example, verifying that `DEBUG` is False) to disable these features, an external attacker would be able to access the full schema via introspection.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. As an external attacker, use a browser, cURL, or Postman to send a GET request to the public GraphQL endpoint (for example, `http://target.example.com/graphql` or `http://target.example.com/graphql/inherited/`).
    2. Confirm that the response includes the GraphiQL IDE (or otherwise allows interactive query execution).
    3. Using the IDE or a crafted introspection query (such as `{ __schema { types { name } } }`), verify that detailed schema information is returned.
    4. Document that the full schema disclosure is possible due to the misuse of development settings in endpoint configuration.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Verbose Error Message Disclosure via GraphQL Errors
  - **Description:**
    When a client submits an invalid or intentionally malformed GraphQL query, the underlying exception is caught and its full, unsanitized details are returned in the response. This includes internal error messages, stack traces, and—based on new debug middleware tests—the executed SQL queries and debug information via the `_debug` field.
    - Several test files (such as `/code/graphene_django/tests/test_views.py` and `/code/graphene_django/tests/schema_view.py`) demonstrate that errors produce overly detailed responses.
    - Moreover, the new debugging components in `/code/graphene_django/debug/middleware.py` and its corresponding tests (e.g. `/code/graphene_django/debug/tests/test_query.py`) reveal that when the GraphQL query explicitly requests the `_debug` field, the response includes a complete list of executed SQL queries and full exception stack traces.
  - **Impact:**
    The detailed error output can inadvertently disclose critical internal system information (such as file paths, SQL statements, and internal logic) that an attacker can use to further refine exploits or identify other sensitive operations.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Although errors are returned in a structured JSON format, there is no filtering mechanism or environment‐specific error suppression in the core GraphQL view or the dedicated debug middleware.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - In production deployments, error messages should be sanitized to return only generic error responses (for example, “An error occurred”) without exposing internal details.
    - Debug middleware (which exposes detailed SQL queries and stack traces) should be deactivated or restricted to authorized users only.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The system is running with detailed error handling enabled (for example, with `DEBUG=True` or with the debug middleware active).
    - The public schema includes fields (such as `_debug`) that return sensitive information without proper access control.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/graphene_django/views.py`, exception handling within the GraphQL view does not remove internal error details before they are sent to the client.
    - Test cases such as those in `/code/graphene_django/tests/test_views.py` demonstrate that error messages include strings like “Throws!” along with full stack information.
    - Additional evidence from `/code/graphene_django/debug/middleware.py` shows that when the GraphQL type named `DjangoDebug` is returned (for example, via a `_debug` query), detailed debug information—including a list of executed SQL queries with full SQL texts—is provided.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Send a deliberately malformed GraphQL query (or one targeting the `_debug` field) to the public endpoint (for example, `http://target.example.com/graphql`).
    2. Capture the JSON response and inspect the `errors` array and, if present, the `_debug` field.
    3. Verify that the error output includes detailed internal information (such as full stack traces, SQL query logs, or internal exception messages).
    4. Document that such verbose error details provide an attacker with sensitive insights into the system’s inner workings.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Lack of Access Control on GraphQL Endpoint (Unauthorized Data Access)
  - **Description:**
    The GraphQL endpoints in the example and test projects are configured without enforcing authentication or authorization checks either at the view level or within resolver functions.
    - Testing in files such as `/code/graphene_django/tests/test_get_queryset.py` shows that queries can be submitted and immediately executed without credential verification.
    - Although some resolvers incorporate custom access checks (by raising exceptions in specific test cases), these checks are not applied by default across the exposed endpoints.
  - **Impact:**
    Without integrated access control, an unauthenticated attacker may submit arbitrary queries and mutations. This can lead not only to unauthorized data disclosure but also to potential modification of backend data, thus breaching confidentiality and integrity.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The documentation and tests mention possible integrations with Django’s authentication and permissions frameworks.
    - Some test resolvers simulate access control (for instance, by filtering querysets with custom `get_queryset` methods).
    - However, these measures are only demonstrated or applied in isolated test scenarios.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Robust authentication and authorization must be enforced on every GraphQL endpoint (for example, by applying Django middleware, decorators, or resolver‑level checks) so that only properly authenticated and authorized users can execute queries and mutations.
    - Critical operations should require additional safeguards such as API keys or session verification.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The GraphQL API is deployed using the example/test configurations without integrated access control middleware.
    - Endpoint access to queries and mutations is unrestricted for unauthenticated users.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In the URL configuration files (such as `/code/graphene_django/tests/urls.py`), the GraphQL view is registered without attachment of access control middleware.
    - Resolver methods in test files (for example, in `/code/graphene_django/tests/test_get_queryset.py`) illustrate that although custom access checks can be written, no default enforcement exists on publicly exposed endpoints.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. As an unauthenticated user, send a query requesting sensitive data (for example, requesting all fields from a Reporter model that includes personal data).
    2. Verify that the endpoint returns the data without prompting for credentials.
    3. Next, attempt to execute a mutation that modifies data and confirm that the operation is performed without any authentication challenge.
    4. Document that the absence of access control permits unauthorized access and data modification.
