- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Deserialization in Component Caching
  - **Description:**
    The framework caches full component trees by serializing component objects using Python’s pickle. Later, when the component is restored from the cache (e.g., during a queued component request), the cached payload is deserialized using `pickle.loads` without any integrity or cryptographic verification. An external attacker who can, for example, exploit an insecurely configured cache backend (such as an unauthenticated Redis or Memcached instance) could insert a malicious pickle payload. Upon deserialization, this payload may trigger arbitrary code execution.

    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**
    1. An attacker locates the cache key pattern (e.g., “unicorn:component:{component_id}”).
    2. By exploiting misconfiguration (lack of authentication or network isolation), the attacker writes a crafted pickle payload into the cache.
    3. The next time the application fetches the cached component state, it uses `pickle.loads` to deserialize the payload.
    4. Because pickle deserialization can execute arbitrary code, the malicious code embedded in the payload is executed, leading to remote code execution.

  - **Impact:**
    If successfully exploited, the attacker gains arbitrary code execution within the Python process running the server. This can lead to full server compromise, data exfiltration, persistent backdoors, lateral movement in the network, and other adverse outcomes.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The caching mechanism relies on Django’s cache backend, which in production is typically deployed behind network restrictions and authentication.
    - Experimental serialization settings are used in non‑production environments (for example, disabling serialization when using the dummy cache), reducing risk during development.
    - The application’s workflow expects that the site administrator configures the cache backend securely.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No cryptographic signing or integrity verification is applied to the pickled data before deserialization.
    - There is no alternative “safe” serialization format (e.g., JSON or a restricted serializer) available to replace pickle.
    - In environments where the cache backend may be misconfigured or shared with untrusted parties, the risk of malicious cache poisoning remains.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The cache backend (for example, Redis or Memcached) must be misconfigured or exposed without proper network isolation and authentication.
    - An attacker must be able to write to or poison the cache entry using the known key format (e.g., “unicorn:component:{component_id}”).

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Within the caching logic (in modules such as `django_unicorn/views/__init__.py` and the caching helper classes), the component request is “cleaned” by removing non‑pickleable parts (such as the HttpRequest object) and then the remaining state is serialized (pickled) and stored under a key derived from the component ID.
    - Later, when a queued or dynamic component request is processed, the application retrieves the pickled payload from the cache.
    - The payload is deserialized using `pickle.loads` with no verification of the payload’s origin, enabling an attacker who has poisoned the cache to trigger arbitrary code execution.
    - This behavior is confirmed by tests (e.g., those found in `tests/test_cacher.py`), which exercise the caching and restoration lifecycle. An attacker with cache write access could inject a malicious payload to execute arbitrary code.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Set Up:**
       - Configure the Django project to use an external cache backend (e.g., a Redis or Memcached instance) that is not secured by proper authentication or network restrictions.
       - Ensure that the caching mechanism is active (the cache alias in settings points to the insecure cache and caching is enabled for components).
    2. **Inject a Malicious Payload:**
       - Identify a valid component ID by first triggering a component render, which caches state under a key like `unicorn:queue:{component_id}`.
       - Using a tool that can interact directly with the cache backend (for example, redis-cli or a Memcached client), replace the corresponding cache key with a malicious pickle payload. For safe testing, craft a payload that causes a benign side effect (for instance, writing to a log file).
    3. **Trigger Deserialization:**
       - In a browser or via an HTTP client, perform an action that causes the cached component to be restored (such as an AJAX POST to the unicorn “message” endpoint).
       - Monitor the server to observe the effects of the malicious payload (e.g., log file creation or other side effects).
    4. **Verify Outcome:**
       - If the payload executes upon deserialization (demonstrated by the benign side effect), the vulnerability is confirmed. Document the behavior to validate that arbitrary code execution through cache poisoning is possible.
