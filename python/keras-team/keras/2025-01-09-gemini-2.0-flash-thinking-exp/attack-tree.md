## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Keras](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_keras.md)

The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Keras Library](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_keras_library.md)

A critical step that allows attackers to leverage inherent weaknesses within the Keras library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack (Compromise Keras Dependency)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack__compromise_keras_dependency_.md)

*   **AND Inject Malicious Code into Dependency (CRITICAL NODE):** An attacker's goal is to insert malicious code into a library that the Keras application depends on (e.g., TensorFlow, a backend library).
    *   **Compromise Dependency Repository/Distribution Channel (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker aims to gain control over the official repository (like PyPI) or a mirror used to distribute the dependency. This allows them to directly inject malicious code into the package.
        *   *Attack Vector:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository's infrastructure.
        *   *Attack Vector:* Using compromised credentials of a repository maintainer.
        *   *Attack Vector:* Submitting a malicious package with a similar name (typosquatting).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_dependency.md)

An attacker's goal is to insert malicious code into a library that the Keras application depends on (e.g., TensorFlow, a backend library).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Dependency Repository/Distribution Channel](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_dependency_repositorydistribution_channel.md)

The attacker aims to gain control over the official repository (like PyPI) or a mirror used to distribute the dependency. This allows them to directly inject malicious code into the package.
        *   *Attack Vector:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository's infrastructure.
        *   *Attack Vector:* Using compromised credentials of a repository maintainer.
        *   *Attack Vector:* Submitting a malicious package with a similar name (typosquatting).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keras-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keras-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **AND Exploit Unsafe Model Deserialization (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):** The attacker targets vulnerabilities in how Keras (or its underlying libraries like `pickle`) loads serialized model files.
    *   **Provide Maliciously Crafted Model File (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker creates a specially crafted model file that, when loaded by the application, executes arbitrary code.
        *   *Attack Vector:* Injecting malicious code using Python's `pickle` protocol (e.g., manipulating the `__reduce__` method).
        *   *Attack Vector:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in other serialization libraries used by Keras.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsafe Model Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsafe_model_deserialization.md)

The attacker targets vulnerabilities in how Keras (or its underlying libraries like `pickle`) loads serialized model files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Maliciously Crafted Model File](./attack_tree_paths/provide_maliciously_crafted_model_file.md)

The attacker creates a specially crafted model file that, when loaded by the application, executes arbitrary code.
        *   *Attack Vector:* Injecting malicious code using Python's `pickle` protocol (e.g., manipulating the `__reduce__` method).
        *   *Attack Vector:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in other serialization libraries used by Keras.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Application's Use of Keras](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_application's_use_of_keras.md)

*   **OR Leverage Insecure Model Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH):** The attacker exploits weaknesses in how the application manages and loads Keras model files.
    *   **AND Application Loads Untrusted Models Without Verification (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):** The application directly loads model files from untrusted sources (e.g., user uploads, external URLs) without verifying their integrity or safety.
        *   **Attacker Provides a Maliciously Crafted Model (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker provides a malicious model file, leveraging the application's lack of verification.
            *   *Attack Vector:* Providing a `pickle` file containing malicious code.
            *   *Attack Vector:* Providing a model file exploiting vulnerabilities in other loading mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Model Handling](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_model_handling.md)

The attacker exploits weaknesses in how the application manages and loads Keras model files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Loads Untrusted Models Without Verification](./attack_tree_paths/application_loads_untrusted_models_without_verification.md)
