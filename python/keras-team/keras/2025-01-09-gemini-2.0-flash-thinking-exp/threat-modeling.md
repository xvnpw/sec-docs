# Threat Model Analysis for keras-team/keras

## Threat: [Model Poisoning (Backdoor Injection)](./threats/model_poisoning__backdoor_injection_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the training process, potentially by influencing custom layers or loss functions defined within Keras, to introduce a "backdoor" into the model. This results in the model behaving normally on most inputs but producing a specific, attacker-chosen output when presented with a particular trigger input.

**Impact:** The attacker can control the model's behavior for specific inputs, potentially bypassing security measures, gaining unauthorized access, or causing targeted misclassifications.

**Keras Component Affected:** Model training process (`model.fit()`, custom training loops), custom layers (`tf.keras.layers.Layer`), and custom loss functions (`tf.keras.losses.Loss`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls and monitoring for the training environment and code repositories.
* Use trusted and verified training pipelines and code, especially when defining custom layers or loss functions.
* Employ techniques like neural network verification or backdoor detection methods to analyze trained models.
* Monitor model behavior for unexpected outputs on specific, potentially crafted inputs.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Malicious Model](./threats/deserialization_of_malicious_model.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted model file (e.g., using `model.save()` and loaded with `tf.keras.models.load_model()`) that, when loaded, exploits vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code on the system. This often leverages vulnerabilities in libraries like `h5py` (for HDF5 format) or `pickle`.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application server or client, leading to remote code execution, data breaches, and other severe consequences.

**Keras Component Affected:** `tf.keras.models.load_model()` function and the underlying serialization/deserialization mechanisms used by Keras (often relying on `h5py` or `pickle`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Crucially, only load models from trusted and verified sources.** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and origin of model files.
* Implement strict access controls for model storage and retrieval.
* Keep Keras and its dependencies (especially `h5py`) updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Consider using sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of potential code execution during deserialization.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (TensorFlow/Backend)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__tensorflowbackend_.md)

**Description:** Keras relies on backend libraries like TensorFlow. Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries can be directly exploited through Keras if not properly addressed. For example, a vulnerability in TensorFlow's handling of certain tensor operations could be triggered through Keras API calls.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, or other vulnerabilities depending on the specific flaw in the backend library.

**Keras Component Affected:** All Keras components that interact with the backend library, including layers, optimizers, loss functions, and the core training and inference processes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability in the backend)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Keras and its backend dependencies (especially TensorFlow) updated to the latest versions.** This is crucial for patching known security flaws.
* Regularly review security advisories for TensorFlow and other dependencies.
* Implement dependency scanning tools in the development pipeline to identify vulnerable dependencies.
* Consider using virtual environments or containerization to isolate dependencies and manage versions.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on Keras Packages](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_keras_packages.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the Keras library distribution channels (e.g., PyPI) or the source code repository, injecting malicious code directly into the Keras package itself. This could involve modifying core Keras functionalities or adding malicious features.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications using the affected version of Keras, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or the introduction of backdoors in the applications themselves.

**Keras Component Affected:** The entire Keras library codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use trusted package repositories and verify package integrity using checksums or signatures.
* Employ dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in installed packages.
* Consider using a private PyPI repository or mirroring trusted repositories to have more control over the packages being used.
* Regularly audit the project's dependencies and their sources.
* Be cautious about installing Keras packages from untrusted sources.
