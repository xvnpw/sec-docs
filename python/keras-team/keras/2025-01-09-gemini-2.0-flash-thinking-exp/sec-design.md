## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced design overview of the Keras project, an open-source Python library that offers a high-level API for building and training neural networks. Keras acts as a user-friendly interface to various backend deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch, abstracting away their complexities. This refined document aims to provide a clearer and more detailed understanding of the system's architecture, serving as a robust foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities.

## 2. Goals

The core objectives of the Keras project are to:
