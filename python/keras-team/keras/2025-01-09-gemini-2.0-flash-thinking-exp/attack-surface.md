# Attack Surface Analysis for keras-team/keras

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously crafted Keras model files can contain executable code that is triggered during the model loading process.](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_keras_model_files_can_contain_executable_code_that_is_triggered_during_the_model_ea1683fd.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted Keras model files can contain executable code that is triggered during the model loading process.
    *   **How Keras Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Keras provides functionalities to save and load models (e.g., `model.save()`, `keras.models.load_model()`). If these files are from untrusted sources, the loading process can execute embedded malicious code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a seemingly legitimate Keras model file. When the application uses `keras.models.load_model()` to load it, custom layers or deserialization routines within the model execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load models from trusted and verified sources.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures) for model files.
        *   Consider sandboxing the model loading process to limit potential damage.
        *   Regularly scan model files for known malware signatures.

## Attack Surface: [Custom layers, losses, metrics, or callbacks defined by developers can contain insecure code or introduce vulnerabilities.](./attack_surfaces/custom_layers__losses__metrics__or_callbacks_defined_by_developers_can_contain_insecure_code_or_intr_a8346f35.md)

*   **Description:** Custom layers, losses, metrics, or callbacks defined by developers can contain insecure code or introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Keras Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Keras allows developers to extend its functionality through custom components. If this custom code is not written securely, it becomes part of the application's attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A developer creates a custom layer that performs an insecure system call based on input data, allowing an attacker to inject commands through the model's input.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data manipulation, denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Keras components.
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom code.
        *   Avoid making direct system calls or accessing sensitive resources within custom layers if possible.
        *   Sandbox or isolate the execution environment for custom code.
