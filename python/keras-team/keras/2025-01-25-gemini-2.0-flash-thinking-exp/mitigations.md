## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly update Keras and its dependencies.](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_keras_and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly update Keras and its dependencies.
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Keras Dependencies:** List all libraries Keras directly depends on (e.g., TensorFlow, potentially NumPy, SciPy depending on Keras version and backend). Use `pip show keras` or your dependency management tool to inspect Keras's requirements.
        2.  **Monitor Keras and Dependency Updates:** Regularly check for new versions of Keras and its direct dependencies on PyPI, GitHub release pages, or security advisory databases.
        3.  **Test Keras Updates:** Before deploying updates, test the new Keras version and its dependencies in a staging environment to ensure compatibility with your models and application code, and to prevent regressions. Pay special attention to potential API changes in Keras or TensorFlow.
        4.  **Update Keras and Dependencies:** Use `pip install --upgrade keras tensorflow` (or your relevant backend) or your dependency manager to update to the latest stable versions.
        5.  **Automate Keras Update Checks (where possible):** Integrate checks for new Keras and dependency versions into your CI/CD pipeline to remind developers to update regularly.

        2.  **Input Validation Layer (Pre-Keras):** Implement an input validation layer *before* feeding data to your Keras model. This layer should use validation logic appropriate for the input types expected by your Keras model (e.g., numerical ranges, image dimensions, text encoding).
        3.  **Data Type and Format Checks for Keras Inputs:** Ensure input data types and formats strictly adhere to what your Keras model expects (e.g., NumPy arrays of specific shapes and dtypes, image formats compatible with Keras preprocessing layers).
        4.  **Range and Boundary Checks for Keras Inputs:** Validate that numerical inputs for your Keras model are within the expected ranges your model was trained on and is designed to handle.
        5.  **Error Handling for Invalid Keras Inputs:** Implement robust error handling to reject inputs that do not conform to the expected schema for your Keras model. Provide informative error messages and prevent invalid data from reaching the Keras model.

These functions are designed to securely handle Keras model structures and weights.
        2.  **Verify Keras Model Source Trustworthiness:** If loading Keras models from external sources, rigorously verify the trustworthiness of the source. Exercise extreme caution when loading models from untrusted or public repositories, as they could be maliciously crafted to exploit Keras vulnerabilities (though less common with default Keras formats).
        3.  **Implement Integrity Checks for Keras Model Files:** Consider using cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) to verify the integrity of saved Keras model files. Generate a hash of the saved `.keras` or `.h5` model file and compare it to a stored hash when loading to detect tampering.
        4.  **Secure Storage for Keras Model Files:** Store serialized Keras model files in secure storage locations with appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized modification or substitution of your trained Keras models.
        5.  **Avoid Custom or Unverified Serialization Methods for Keras Models:** Refrain from using custom serialization methods or formats for Keras models unless absolutely necessary and thoroughly vetted for security. Stick to Keras's provided `save()` and `load_model()` functions for standard use cases.
