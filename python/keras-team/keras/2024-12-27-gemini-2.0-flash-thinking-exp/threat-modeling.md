## High and Critical Keras Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the Keras library.

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Keras Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Model Poisoning** | An attacker manipulates the training data used with Keras functions like `model.fit()`. This can involve injecting malicious samples or altering existing data to subtly influence the model's learning process, causing it to make incorrect predictions under specific conditions or exhibit attacker-desired behavior. | The trained Keras model becomes unreliable and potentially harmful. It might make incorrect predictions, exhibit biases leading to unfair outcomes, or even act as a backdoor for further attacks. | `keras.Model.fit()`, data loading and preprocessing layers (e.g., `keras.layers.Normalization`, `keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator`) | High | - **Rigorous Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all training data before using it with Keras. Implement checks for anomalies, outliers, and potentially malicious data points. <br> - **Data Provenance Tracking:** Maintain a clear record of the origin and transformations applied to the training data used with Keras. This helps in identifying potentially compromised data sources. <br> - **Anomaly Detection during Training:** Monitor the training process (e.g., loss, accuracy) within Keras for unexpected changes that might indicate data poisoning. <br> - **Trusted Data Sources:** Rely on reputable and verified data sources for training Keras models. |
| **Model Backdoors** | An attacker injects malicious logic or parameters directly into a trained Keras model, often by manipulating the model file saved using `model.save()` or `tf.keras.models.save_model()`. The backdoor could be triggered by specific inputs processed by `model.predict()`, causing the model to perform actions unintended by the developers. | The Keras model can be exploited to perform unauthorized actions, leak sensitive information, or cause harm when specific trigger inputs are provided to `model.predict()`. This can bypass normal security measures. | Model saving (`keras.Model.save()`, `tf.keras.models.save_model`), model loading (`keras.models.load_model()`, `tf.keras.models.load_model`), `keras.Model.predict()`, potentially custom layers or callbacks. | Critical | - **Secure Model Storage and Access Control:** Store trained Keras models in secure locations with strict access controls. Limit who can read, write, or modify model files. <br> - **Model Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of loaded Keras models, such as digital signatures or checksums, before using them with `model.predict()`. Detect any unauthorized modifications. <br> - **Regular Model Audits and Retraining:** Periodically audit trained Keras models for suspicious patterns or unexpected behavior. Retrain models from trusted sources to ensure integrity. <br> - **Code Review of Custom Layers/Callbacks:** If using custom layers or callbacks within Keras, thoroughly review their code for potential vulnerabilities or backdoors. |
| **Code Execution via Deserialization Vulnerabilities** | If the application loads Keras models from untrusted sources using insecure deserialization methods (e.g., older versions of `pickle` which might be the underlying mechanism for `load_model` in some scenarios), an attacker could craft a malicious model file that, when loaded using `keras.models.load_model()`, executes arbitrary code on the server or client machine. | Complete compromise of the system where the Keras model is loaded, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, steal data, or install malware. | `keras.models.load_model()` (if using `pickle` as the underlying serialization format). | Critical | - **Avoid Using `pickle` for Loading Untrusted Models:** `pickle` is inherently insecure for loading data from untrusted sources. Prefer safer serialization formats like `HDF5` (default for `save_model`) or TensorFlow's `SavedModel` format with `tf.keras.models.load_model()`. <br> - **Strict Validation of Model Sources:** Only load Keras models from trusted and verified sources. <br> - **Sandboxing or Isolation:** If `pickle` is absolutely necessary for loading Keras models, load them within a sandboxed or isolated environment with limited privileges to mitigate the impact of potential code execution. <br> - **Regularly Update Keras and Dependencies:** Ensure you are using the latest versions of Keras and its dependencies, as security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases. |
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Keras Dependencies** | Keras relies on backend libraries like TensorFlow or potentially other libraries. Critical vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries can be indirectly exploited through Keras if Keras exposes functionality that interacts with the vulnerable part of the backend. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the Keras environment. | Potential for arbitrary code execution or other severe attacks depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, directly impacting the Keras application. | Various Keras modules and functions that interact with the backend (e.g., layers, optimizers, loss functions). | High | - **Regularly Update Keras and its Dependencies:** Keep Keras and its backend dependencies (TensorFlow, etc.) updated to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities. <br> - **Subscribe to Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories for Keras and its dependencies to be aware of newly discovered vulnerabilities. <br> - **Dependency Scanning Tools:** Use dependency scanning tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies, including those used by Keras. |
| **Supply Chain Attacks on Keras or Dependencies** | An attacker compromises the official Keras package or one of its direct dependencies on package repositories (e.g., PyPI) and injects malicious code. When developers install or update these compromised packages using tools like `pip install keras`, the malicious code is executed on their systems or within their applications. | Potential for widespread compromise of applications using the affected Keras package, leading to data breaches, malware installation, or other malicious activities. | The entire Keras library and its direct dependencies. | High | - **Verify Package Integrity:** Before installing or updating Keras or its dependencies, verify their integrity using checksums or digital signatures provided by the official repositories. <br> - **Use Dependency Scanning Tools:** Regularly scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and potential supply chain risks affecting Keras. <br> - **Consider Private Package Repositories:** For critical deployments, consider using private package repositories to have more control over the source and integrity of the Keras packages. <br> - **Be Cautious with Package Updates:** Be mindful of unexpected or suspicious Keras package updates and investigate them before installing. |
