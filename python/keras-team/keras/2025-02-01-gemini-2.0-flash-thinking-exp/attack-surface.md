# Attack Surface Analysis for keras-team/keras

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Model Deserialization (Pickle)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_model_deserialization__pickle_.md)

**Description:** Loading Keras models serialized using `pickle` from untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution. `pickle` is inherently unsafe for deserializing untrusted data.

    *   **Keras Contribution:** Keras's `load_model` function, especially in older versions or when using specific saving methods, can rely on `pickle` for deserializing model architectures and configurations if the model was saved in a format that utilizes it. This makes applications using `load_model` vulnerable if they load models from untrusted sources.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses a public repository of pre-trained Keras models. They download a model file and load it into their application using `keras.models.load_model`.  If this model file is a malicious `pickle` payload disguised as a Keras model, loading it will execute arbitrary code on the server or client machine running the application.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and full control of the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Absolutely avoid loading `pickle` based models from untrusted sources.**
        *   **If possible, re-train models from trusted sources and save them in safer formats.**
        *   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization for model file paths if they are derived from external input.**
        *   **Run model loading in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential code execution.**

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Model Deserialization (HDF5 vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_model_deserialization__hdf5_vulnerabilities_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the `h5py` library (used by Keras for HDF5 format) or the underlying HDF5 C library can be exploited by maliciously crafted HDF5 model files.

    *   **Keras Contribution:** Keras commonly uses `HDF5` format (via `h5py`) for saving and loading model weights and architectures through functions like `keras.models.save_model` and `keras.models.load_model`. This makes Keras applications dependent on the security of `h5py` and HDF5.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious HDF5 model file that exploits a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability in `h5py` or the HDF5 library. When a Keras application loads this model, the vulnerability is triggered, potentially leading to denial of service, memory corruption, or in some cases, code execution.
    *   **Impact:** **High to Critical**. Depending on the specific vulnerability, the impact can range from denial of service and crashes to memory corruption and potentially code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep `h5py` and the underlying HDF5 libraries updated to the latest versions.** Regularly check for and apply security patches.
        *   **Exercise caution when loading HDF5 models from untrusted or unknown sources.** Verify the source and integrity of model files.
        *   **Implement input validation and sanitization for model file paths.**
        *   **Consider using alternative, potentially more secure serialization methods if available and suitable for your Keras version and backend.**

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Layers and Functions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_layers_and_functions.md)

**Description:** Insecurely written custom layers, losses, metrics, or callbacks in Keras can introduce vulnerabilities due to developer errors in Python code.

    *   **Keras Contribution:** Keras's design allows for extensive customization through user-defined components. While powerful, this places the responsibility for security on the developer of these custom components. Keras directly executes this custom code as part of the model.
    *   **Example:** A developer creates a custom Keras layer that includes a vulnerable dependency or has a flaw in its input handling logic. This flaw could be exploited by providing specific input data to the model, leading to a denial of service, data corruption, or potentially code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough (e.g., memory corruption in a C extension used by the custom layer).
    *   **Impact:** **High**.  Vulnerabilities in custom code can lead to denial of service, data corruption, or potentially code execution, especially if the custom code interacts with external resources or native libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Apply secure coding practices when developing custom Keras components.** Focus on input validation, error handling, and avoiding common vulnerabilities.
        *   **Thoroughly review and test custom code, including unit tests and integration tests, with a security focus.**
        *   **Carefully manage dependencies of custom code and keep them updated.**
        *   **Implement input validation and sanitization within custom layers to handle unexpected or potentially malicious input data.**

## Attack Surface: [Input Data Handling Vulnerabilities in Keras Layers/Backend (Triggering Backend Bugs)](./attack_surfaces/input_data_handling_vulnerabilities_in_keras_layersbackend__triggering_backend_bugs_.md)

**Description:**  Specific input data patterns, when processed by Keras layers, might trigger underlying vulnerabilities or bugs in the Keras backend (like TensorFlow, etc.).

    *   **Keras Contribution:** Keras relies on backend libraries for numerical computation. While Keras itself might not have the vulnerability, it acts as an interface to the backend.  By feeding specific inputs through Keras layers, an attacker could trigger vulnerabilities present in the backend code that Keras utilizes.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in a specific version of TensorFlow's implementation of a certain activation function or layer operation. An attacker crafts input data that, when processed by a Keras model using this vulnerable TensorFlow version and layer, triggers the backend vulnerability, leading to a crash, denial of service, or potentially other security issues within TensorFlow.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Exploiting backend vulnerabilities through Keras can lead to denial of service, crashes, or potentially more severe issues depending on the nature of the backend vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Keras and the backend library (TensorFlow, etc.) updated to the latest versions.** This is crucial for patching known vulnerabilities in both Keras and its backend.
        *   **Monitor security advisories for Keras and the chosen backend.** Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities and apply updates promptly.
        *   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the application level.** While not a direct fix for backend bugs, it can help prevent unexpected input patterns that might trigger vulnerabilities.
        *   **Implement resource limits and monitoring for Keras applications to detect and mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks, even if triggered by backend issues.**
