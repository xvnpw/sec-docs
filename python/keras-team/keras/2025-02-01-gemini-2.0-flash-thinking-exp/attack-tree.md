## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Keras](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_keras.md)

*   **Compromise Application Using Keras:**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing harm to the application.
    *   It is a critical node because all high-risk paths converge here, representing the overall objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Model Loading](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_model_loading.md)

*   **Exploit Malicious Model Loading:**
    *   This is a critical step because loading a malicious model can directly lead to application compromise.
    *   If successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, manipulate data, or cause denial of service.
    *   It is a critical node as it is a central point for multiple high-risk attack vectors related to model integrity.
