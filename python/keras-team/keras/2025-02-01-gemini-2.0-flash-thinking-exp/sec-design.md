# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Keras, aims to provide a user-friendly, high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of various backends like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others. The primary business priority is to empower developers and researchers to build and experiment with machine learning models efficiently and effectively. The goal is to democratize deep learning by making it more accessible and easier to use.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of losing community support and contributions if the project becomes too complex or difficult to contribute to.
- Risk of being superseded by competing frameworks if Keras fails to adapt to the evolving machine learning landscape.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in Keras code that could be exploited in downstream applications using Keras.
- Risk of performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies that could hinder the adoption of Keras in performance-sensitive applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open source development model with public code review on GitHub. Implemented in: GitHub repository and contribution process.
- security control: Reliance on underlying backend frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) for core security features. Implemented in: Keras design and documentation.
- security control: Community-driven vulnerability reporting and patching. Implemented in: GitHub repository and community channels.
- security control: Regular updates and maintenance by the Keras team. Implemented in: Keras release cycle and GitHub activity.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in underlying backend frameworks are outside of Keras project's direct control.
- accepted risk: Security of user-provided models and data is the responsibility of the user.
- accepted risk: Open source nature implies public disclosure of vulnerabilities after they are patched.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially before major releases.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response policy.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for Keras users in documentation.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Keras library itself. Authentication is relevant in systems that use Keras models, but not within Keras library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to Keras library itself. Authorization is relevant in systems that use Keras models to control access to models or predictions, but not within Keras library.
- Input validation: Keras should perform input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to malformed input data during model training and inference. Implemented in: Keras code, especially in layers and model APIs.
- Cryptography: Keras relies on backend frameworks for cryptographic operations if needed for specific layers or functionalities. Keras itself does not implement core cryptographic algorithms. Cryptography is relevant for secure storage and transmission of models and data in systems using Keras, but not within Keras library.

## DEPLOYMENT

Keras itself is not deployed as a standalone application. It is a library that is included and used within other applications and systems. The deployment context is therefore the deployment of applications that *use* Keras.

Possible deployment scenarios for applications using Keras:
1. Cloud-based deployment (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) using containers (Docker, Kubernetes) or serverless functions.
2. On-premises deployment on servers or workstations.
3. Edge deployment on mobile devices, embedded systems, or IoT devices.

Let's consider a cloud-based deployment using Docker and Kubernetes as a representative example.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Development and distribution of the Keras library itself. Ensuring the integrity and availability of Keras for the machine learning community.
- Trust and reputation of the Keras project. Maintaining user confidence in the security and reliability of Keras.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Keras source code: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are important to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosure of vulnerabilities.
- Build artifacts (packages): High sensitivity. Integrity is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure users download legitimate and untampered Keras packages.
- User data and models: User responsibility. Keras project does not directly handle user data or models, but vulnerabilities in Keras could potentially impact the security of user data and models in applications using Keras. Sensitivity depends on the specific user data and models.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the Keras team's current vulnerability disclosure and response process?
- Are there any existing security audits or penetration testing reports for Keras?
- What SAST and dependency scanning tools are currently used in the Keras CI pipeline?
- Are there specific security guidelines for contributors to the Keras project?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal of Keras is to be a user-friendly and widely adopted machine learning library. Security is important for maintaining user trust and project reputation.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Keras relies heavily on the security of its backend frameworks. Security controls are primarily focused on open source development best practices and community involvement.
- DESIGN: Keras architecture is modular with a clear separation between the Python API and backend implementations. Deployment context is primarily about applications that use Keras, not Keras itself. Build process is automated using GitHub Actions.
