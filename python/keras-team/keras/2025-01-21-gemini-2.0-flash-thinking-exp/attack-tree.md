## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_server__critical_node_.md)

* **Execute Arbitrary Code on Server [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This represents the successful achievement of the attacker's goal. Any path leading to this node is a potential compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Keras Library [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_keras_library__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Keras Library [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This path involves directly exploiting weaknesses within the Keras library code itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Keras Library -> Leverage Known Keras Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_keras_library_-_leverage_known_keras_vulnerabilities__cves___high_risk_pa_65896371.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Keras Library -> Leverage Known Keras Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This focuses on exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of Keras. Attackers research CVE databases to find relevant vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Keras Library -> Leverage Known Keras Vulnerabilities (CVEs) -> Develop or Utilize Existing Exploits [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_keras_library_-_leverage_known_keras_vulnerabilities__cves__-_develop_or__52153a90.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Keras Library -> Leverage Known Keras Vulnerabilities (CVEs) -> Develop or Utilize Existing Exploits [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This step involves the attacker creating their own exploit or using an existing one to take advantage of a known Keras vulnerability, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_model_loading__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This path centers around manipulating the process of loading Keras models to introduce malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading -> Load Maliciously Crafted Model File [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_model_loading_-_load_maliciously_crafted_model_file__critical_node_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading -> Load Maliciously Crafted Model File [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This critical step involves the application loading a model file that has been intentionally designed to execute malicious code when loaded.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading -> Load Maliciously Crafted Model File -> Supply a Model File Containing Malicious Payloads -> Utilize Unsafe Deserialization Techniques (e.g., Pickle exploits) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_model_loading_-_load_maliciously_crafted_model_file_-_supply_a_model_file__6796fa30.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading -> Load Maliciously Crafted Model File -> Supply a Model File Containing Malicious Payloads -> Utilize Unsafe Deserialization Techniques (e.g., Pickle exploits) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This highlights the danger of using insecure deserialization methods like `pickle` to load model files from untrusted sources. Malicious code can be embedded within the pickled data and executed during the loading process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading -> Load Model from Untrusted Source [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_model_loading_-_load_model_from_untrusted_source__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading -> Load Model from Untrusted Source [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This path occurs when the application loads Keras models from external or untrusted sources, increasing the risk of loading a malicious model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading -> Load Model from Untrusted Source -> Compromise Model Repository or Storage [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_model_loading_-_load_model_from_untrusted_source_-_compromise_model_reposi_cf13b07d.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code via Model Loading -> Load Model from Untrusted Source -> Compromise Model Repository or Storage [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * If an attacker can compromise the repository or storage location where the application retrieves its models, they can replace legitimate models with malicious ones, affecting all users of those models.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Keras [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_keras__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Dependencies of Keras [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries that Keras relies on, such as TensorFlow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Keras -> Target Vulnerabilities in TensorFlow (or other backend) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_keras_-_target_vulnerabilities_in_tensorflow__or_other_backend___critical_no_5c4bebd5.md)

* **Exploit Dependencies of Keras -> Target Vulnerabilities in TensorFlow (or other backend) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This critical node focuses on exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) within the underlying TensorFlow or other backend library used by Keras. Attackers can trigger these vulnerabilities through the Keras API.
