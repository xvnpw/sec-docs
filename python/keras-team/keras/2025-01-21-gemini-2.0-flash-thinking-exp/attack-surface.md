# Attack Surface Analysis for keras-team/keras

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Models](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_models.md)

*   **Description:** Loading a Keras model from an untrusted source can lead to arbitrary code execution if the model file contains malicious code or exploits vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.
*   **How Keras Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Keras provides functions like `keras.models.load_model()` that directly handle the deserialization of model files (e.g., HDF5, SavedModel). This functionality is essential for using pre-trained models or sharing models, but it also introduces the risk of loading malicious content.
*   **Example:** A user downloads a pre-trained model from an untrusted website. This model, when loaded using `load_model()`, executes malicious code embedded within custom layers or the model's configuration.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only load models from trusted sources: Verify the origin and integrity of model files.
    *   Implement integrity checks: Use cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of downloaded model files.
    *   Sanitize custom objects: When loading models with custom layers or functions, carefully review and sanitize the `custom_objects` dictionary. Avoid directly using user-provided input for this parameter.
    *   Use secure serialization formats: Consider using safer serialization formats if available and practical.
    *   Run model loading in a sandboxed environment: Isolate the model loading process to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [YAML/JSON Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Model Architectures](./attack_surfaces/yamljson_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_model_architectures.md)

*   **Description:** Loading model architectures from untrusted YAML or JSON files can exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing libraries, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **How Keras Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Keras allows saving and loading model architectures using `model.to_json()` and `keras.models.model_from_json()`, or `model.to_yaml()` and `keras.models.model_from_yaml()`. If the parsing libraries have vulnerabilities, malicious architecture definitions can be crafted to exploit them.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a malicious JSON file representing a model architecture. When loaded using `model_from_json()`, a vulnerability in the JSON parsing library is triggered, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only load architecture definitions from trusted sources: Verify the origin and integrity of architecture files.
    *   Keep parsing libraries updated: Ensure that the YAML and JSON parsing libraries used by Keras and its dependencies are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Consider alternative model definition methods: If possible, define model architectures programmatically instead of relying on external files.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Layer Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/custom_layer_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to define or provide custom layers that are then loaded by Keras, malicious code can be embedded within the custom layer definition and executed during model loading or training.
*   **How Keras Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Keras provides the flexibility to define and use custom layers. The code for these layers is executed by Keras during model building, loading, and training.
*   **Example:** A user provides a Python file containing a custom Keras layer. This layer's `build()` or `call()` method contains malicious code that is executed when the model is instantiated or used.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid accepting custom layer code from untrusted sources:  Thoroughly vet any user-provided custom layer code.
    *   Implement strict code review for custom layers:** Carefully review the code of custom layers for any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.
    *   Run custom layer code in a sandboxed environment: Isolate the execution of custom layer code to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    *   Restrict the use of dynamic code execution:** Avoid using functions like `eval()` or `exec()` within custom layer definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Callbacks during Training](./attack_surfaces/malicious_callbacks_during_training.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious callbacks into the Keras training process can allow for arbitrary code execution during training.
*   **How Keras Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Keras allows the use of callbacks to perform actions at different stages of training. If an attacker can control the callbacks used, they can inject malicious code.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a malicious callback that, when triggered at the end of an epoch, executes a script to steal training data or compromise the training environment.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, compromise of the training environment, model poisoning.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only use trusted callbacks:** Avoid using callbacks from untrusted sources.
    *   Review callback code:** Carefully review the code of any custom callbacks before using them.
    *   Restrict callback functionality:** Limit the permissions and access of callback functions.
    *   Avoid dynamic callback loading:** Do not load callback code dynamically from user-provided input.
