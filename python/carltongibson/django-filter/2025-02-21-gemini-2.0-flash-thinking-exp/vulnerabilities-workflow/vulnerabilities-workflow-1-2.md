- **Vulnerability: Hardcoded Secret Key in Test Settings**
  - **Description:**
    The file `/code/tests/settings.py` hardcodes the secret key as `"foobar"`. Although it is intended for testing only, if by mistake these test settings get deployed to a production environment (or are used as a template for production), an attacker can exploit this weak secret key to forge or tamper with cryptographic signatures (e.g. on session cookies, tokens, etc.).
    **Steps to trigger:**
    1. Deploy the application with `/code/tests/settings.py` active (i.e. without overriding the secret key).
    2. Inspect the configuration endpoint or other diagnostic information to confirm the secret key is `"foobar"`.
    3. Craft and sign session cookies or tokens using the known key and send requests to the application.
  - **Impact:**
    - Forged session cookies or tokens can allow session hijacking and unauthorized access.
    - Attacker may bypass critical parts of authentication and cryptographic integrity checks.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The key is placed in a test settings file that is expected only in a testing environment.
    - Deployment guidance assumes production settings will override the test key (e.g. via environment variables).
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No safeguard currently prevents the test settings from being used in a production deployment.
    - No runtime check exists to enforce use of a strong, uniquely generated and secret key in production.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The test settings file is used in a publicly accessible or live environment with debugging enabled.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The file `/code/tests/settings.py` contains the line:
      ```
      SECRET_KEY = "foobar"
      ```
      This gives an attacker in control of cryptographic signature creation.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application in a staging or production–like environment using the test settings file (or without overriding the secret).
    2. Verify from an endpoint or configuration dump that the secret key is set to `"foobar"`.
    3. Use a cryptographic tool or script to craft a signed session cookie (or token) using `"foobar"`.
    4. Send a request with the forged cookie/token and verify whether the application accepts it (demonstrating the cryptographic flaw).

- **Vulnerability: Information Disclosure via Unhandled Unknown Field Types**
  - **Description:**
    When the underlying filtering logic in the django–filter library encounters an unknown field type (for example, when processing a field such as `SubnetMaskField` without an override), it raises an error that includes detailed information about the internal model field (such as field name and type). An attacker may be able to craft URL query parameters that trigger these errors and cause the application to return detailed internal information.
    **Steps to trigger:**
    1. Ensure that the FilterSet is configured (or mis–configured) so that an unknown field type leads to an error (for example, with `unknown_field_behavior=RAISE`).
    2. Send a GET request with query parameters corresponding to a field that the FilterSet does not recognize.
    3. Observe the HTTP 500 error response with detailed debug information.
  - **Impact:**
    - Disclosure of internal model structure, field names, and implementation details.
    - Such information may help an attacker plan further, targeted attacks.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The library permits the configuration of `unknown_field_behavior` (e.g. to IGNORE or WARN rather than RAISE) in production environments.
    - Developers are expected to set `DEBUG=False` in production.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No safe–by–default configuration is enforced; if `RAISE` is used in production, critical internal details may be leaked.
    - No built–in mechanism exists to sanitize or generalize error responses when an unknown field error is raised.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The FilterSet is configured with `unknown_field_behavior=RAISE`.
    - The application is deployed with debugging details not properly suppressed (e.g. with `DEBUG=True` or custom error handling that returns stack traces).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/tests/test_filtering.py` and in the FilterSet generation (see `/code/django_filters/filterset.py`), if a field name declared in `Meta.fields` does not exist in the model, a TypeError is raised with a message listing the unknown field.
    - This error message may include details about the model’s fields and lookup expressions, disclosing internal structure.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Configure a public–facing view with a FilterSet that uses an unknown field (or set `unknown_field_behavior=RAISE`).
    2. With error reporting unsuppressed, issue a GET request to that view with query parameters that trigger the unknown field error.
    3. Confirm that the HTTP error response contains detailed internal information (field names, types, etc.).
    4. Remediate by setting `unknown_field_behavior` to `IGNORE` or `WARN` and ensuring production errors do not leak such details.

- **Vulnerability: Unescaped Model Field Values in Filter Widgets (XSS Vulnerability)**
  - **Description:**
    Several widgets in the django–filter package dynamically render filtering choices that are derived from model field values. In particular, the `LinkWidget` (used by various filters such as `AllValuesFilter`) builds HTML output by concatenating choice labels (obtained via database query) into anchor elements. This output is then wrapped by Django’s `mark_safe` function without any explicit HTML escaping. Consequently, if an attacker can supply a malicious value (for example, a username or other field that appears in filter dropdowns) that contains HTML or JavaScript, it will be rendered verbatim in the page.
    **Steps to trigger:**
    1. Insert a record in a model (e.g. a user record) with a field that is later used as filter input (for instance, the “username” field) containing a malicious payload such as `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`.
    2. Ensure that a filter (such as one using `AllValuesFilter`) is used on that field in a publicly accessible view.
    3. Navigate to the page containing the filter form.
    4. The filter widget will render the value without proper HTML escaping, causing the malicious JavaScript to execute in the browser of anyone viewing the page.
  - **Impact:**
    - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the affected user’s browser.
    - Possibility of session hijacking, data exfiltration, or other malicious client–side actions.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The filter widget (specifically in `LinkWidget` in `/code/django_filters/widgets.py`) uses `force_str` to convert choice labels and then marks the final constructed HTML as safe via `mark_safe`. This practice bypasses Django’s standard auto-escaping and assumes that the source data is trusted.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no sanitization or escaping applied to the choice labels before they are embedded in the rendered HTML.
    - No validation or filtering is in place to ensure that model field values used as filter choices do not contain malicious HTML or scripts.
    - A safe–by–default strategy would either escape such values or restrict their allowed character set.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The affected filter (for example, one using `AllValuesFilter`) is rendered on a publicly accessible page.
    - An attacker is able to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into a field whose value later appears in the filter form (such as via self–registration or unsanitized user input into a model).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/django_filters/widgets.py`, the `LinkWidget` class’s `render_option` method obtains the `option_label` from the provided choices and uses:
      ```python
      return self.option_string() % {
          "attrs": selected and ' class="selected"' or "",
          "query_string": url,
          "label": force_str(option_label),
      }
      ```
      Then, the final output is wrapped as “safe” using `mark_safe`.
    - The `AllValuesFilter` in `/code/django_filters/filters.py` populates its choices as a list of tuples `(value, value)` where the `value` comes directly from a model query (e.g. a list of usernames) without additional sanitization.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a test or staging environment, create a record where a model field (used in a filter) is set to a string that contains a script tag—for example, set the “username” field to `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`.
    2. Ensure that a view using (for example) `AllValuesFilter` to generate filter choices for the “username” field is publicly accessible.
    3. Access the page containing the filter form and inspect the rendered HTML of the filter widget.
    4. Verify that the malicious payload is rendered unescaped and that, when viewing the page in a browser, the injected script executes (for example, by showing an alert dialog).
    5. Remediate the issue by applying proper HTML escaping to all dynamic content (or by cleansing the data) before calling `mark_safe`.

*Note:* Developers are strongly advised to ensure that sensitive test configurations (like hardcoded secret keys) are never used in production and that all output generated from dynamic or user-controlled content (such as filter choice labels) is properly sanitized or escaped to prevent XSS and information disclosure risks.
