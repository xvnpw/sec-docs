## Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities based on the provided project files.

### Vulnerability: Hardcoded Secret Key in Test Settings

- **Description:**
    The file `/code/tests/settings.py` hardcodes the secret key as `"foobar"`.  If these test settings are mistakenly deployed to a production environment, or used as a template for production settings, an attacker can exploit this weak secret key. This allows them to forge or tamper with cryptographic signatures, such as those used for session cookies and tokens.
    **Steps to trigger:**
    1. Deploy the application using the `/code/tests/settings.py` configuration in a production or staging environment.
    2. Access a configuration endpoint or diagnostic information page of the deployed application to confirm that the active secret key is `"foobar"`.
    3. Utilize a tool or script to craft session cookies or tokens, signing them with the known secret key `"foobar"`.
    4. Send requests to the application, including the forged session cookies or tokens.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful forgery of session cookies or tokens can lead to session hijacking, granting unauthorized access to user accounts and application functionalities.
    - An attacker may be able to bypass crucial authentication and cryptographic integrity checks, potentially leading to broader system compromise.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The vulnerable secret key is located within a test settings file, intended solely for testing environments and not for production deployment.
    - Deployment guidelines and best practices assume that production configurations will override the test secret key, typically through environment variables or separate settings files.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no mechanism to prevent the accidental use of test settings in a production deployment.
    - The application lacks runtime checks to enforce the use of a strong, uniquely generated, and genuinely secret key in production environments.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be deployed in a publicly accessible or live environment, mistakenly using the test settings file which contains the hardcoded secret key. Debugging does not necessarily need to be enabled for this vulnerability to be exploited, but it might aid in confirming the active secret key.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Examination of the file `/code/tests/settings.py` reveals the following line of code:
      ```python
      SECRET_KEY = "foobar"
      ```
      This hardcoded value directly sets the `SECRET_KEY` setting. An attacker who gains knowledge of this value can use it to generate valid cryptographic signatures, undermining the security of any cryptographic processes relying on this key.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application to a staging or production-like environment, specifically ensuring that it uses the test settings file or that the secret key is not explicitly overridden.
    2. Access a diagnostic endpoint or configuration dump (if available and permissible) to programmatically verify that the application is running with the secret key set to `"foobar"`. If such an endpoint is not available, manual inspection of configuration files in the deployed environment might be necessary (though less ideal for an external attacker scenario).
    3. Employ a cryptographic tool or a custom script to generate a signed session cookie (or token) using `"foobar"` as the signing key. Tools like Python's `cryptography` library or online JWT generators can be used for this purpose.
    4. Send an HTTP request to the application, including the forged session cookie or token in the appropriate header (e.g., `Cookie` header for session cookies, `Authorization: Bearer` for JWT tokens).
    5. Observe the application's response. If the application accepts the forged cookie/token as valid and grants access to protected resources or functionalities, it confirms the vulnerability. For example, if session-based authentication is used, try accessing a page that requires login. If successful, it demonstrates that the hardcoded secret key can be exploited for unauthorized access.

### Vulnerability: Information Disclosure via Unhandled Unknown Field Types

- **Description:**
    The `django-filter` library, when encountering an unknown field type during filter processing (e.g., a custom field like `SubnetMaskField` without specific handling), may raise an error.  If the application is configured to display detailed error messages (e.g., in debug mode or with verbose error handling), these errors can inadvertently disclose internal model structure and field details to an attacker. This is triggered when a FilterSet is configured to raise an exception upon encountering unknown fields (`unknown_field_behavior=RAISE`).
    **Steps to trigger:**
    1. Configure a FilterSet to use `unknown_field_behavior=RAISE`.
    2. Identify or introduce a field in the FilterSet configuration that is not recognized by the underlying model or filter logic. This could be a typo in a field name or an intentional use of a non-existent field.
    3. Send a GET request to an endpoint that uses this FilterSet, including a query parameter corresponding to the unknown field.
    4. Observe the HTTP response. If debugging is enabled or error handling is not properly configured, the response will likely be an HTTP 500 error page containing detailed debug information, including the error message that reveals internal model field names and types.

- **Impact:**
    - Disclosure of internal application structure, specifically model field names, types, and potentially relationships.
    - This information leakage can provide valuable insights to an attacker, aiding in reconnaissance and the planning of more targeted attacks, such as exploiting specific known vulnerabilities related to disclosed field types or relationships.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The `django-filter` library offers configuration for `unknown_field_behavior`, allowing developers to choose options like `IGNORE` or `WARN` instead of `RAISE`. This flexibility allows for mitigation in production environments by avoiding raising exceptions on unknown fields.
    - Standard Django security practices recommend setting `DEBUG=False` in production environments, which generally suppresses detailed error pages and stack traces, reducing information disclosure.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The default behavior or common initial configurations might inadvertently use `unknown_field_behavior=RAISE`, especially during development, which could be mistakenly carried over to production. A safer default, such as `IGNORE` or `WARN`, would reduce the risk of information disclosure out-of-the-box.
    - There is no built-in mechanism to automatically sanitize or generalize error responses specifically for unknown field errors, ensuring that even if an error is raised, sensitive internal details are not leaked.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The FilterSet must be configured with `unknown_field_behavior=RAISE`.
    - The application must be deployed in a configuration where detailed error messages are exposed, such as with `DEBUG=True` in Django settings or through custom error handling that returns verbose exception details.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Within `/code/tests/test_filtering.py` and the FilterSet generation logic in `/code/django_filters/filterset.py`, the library's behavior when encountering an unknown field is to raise a `TypeError`.
    - This `TypeError` includes a message that explicitly lists the unknown field name and potentially related details about the model's fields and lookup expressions. For example, an error message might say: `"Cannot resolve keyword 'non_existent_field' into field. Choices are: field1, field2, ..."`.
    - This error message, when presented in an unhandled exception response, directly discloses internal model field names and structure.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a test or staging environment, configure a FilterSet in a public-facing view that either uses an explicitly unknown field or is set to `unknown_field_behavior='RAISE'`. Ensure that error reporting is not suppressed (e.g., `DEBUG=True` in Django).
    2. Construct a GET request to the view's URL, appending a query parameter that corresponds to the unknown field in the FilterSet. For example, if the unknown field is named `non_existent_field`, the query parameter would be `?non_existent_field=some_value`.
    3. Send the crafted GET request to the application.
    4. Examine the HTTP response. Confirm that the response status code is 500 (Internal Server Error) and that the response body contains detailed error information, specifically looking for error messages that list model field names or other internal details related to the filtering process.
    5. To remediate, set `unknown_field_behavior` to `IGNORE` or `WARN` in the FilterSet configuration and ensure that production environments are configured to suppress detailed error messages (e.g., `DEBUG=False` in Django). Re-run the test to confirm that the detailed information is no longer leaked in error responses.

### Vulnerability: Unescaped Model Field Values in Filter Widgets (XSS Vulnerability)

- **Description:**
    The `LinkWidget`, used by filters like `AllValuesFilter` in `django-filter`, dynamically renders filter choices based on model field values retrieved from the database. It constructs HTML anchor elements using these values as labels. Critically, these labels are incorporated into the HTML output and marked as safe using Django's `mark_safe` function *without* prior HTML escaping. If an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into a model field that is subsequently used as a filter choice label, this payload will be rendered verbatim in the HTML of the filter widget, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    **Steps to trigger:**
    1. Inject a malicious payload containing HTML or JavaScript into a model field that will be used as a filter choice. For example, if a filter uses the `username` field, insert a record with a username like `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`. This injection could occur through various means, such as self-registration forms, administrative interfaces, or even data imports if input sanitization is lacking.
    2. Ensure that a filter, such as one utilizing `AllValuesFilter` or another filter that uses `LinkWidget` to render choices, is applied to this field in a publicly accessible view.
    3. Navigate to the webpage that contains the filter form.
    4. The filter widget will render the malicious value directly into the HTML without proper escaping. When the page is loaded in a browser, the injected JavaScript will execute, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view the page containing the vulnerable filter.
    - This can lead to a range of malicious actions, including session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the webpage, data exfiltration, and other client-side attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The `LinkWidget` in `/code/django_filters/widgets.py` uses `force_str` to convert choice labels to strings and then employs `mark_safe` on the entire constructed HTML output. This `mark_safe` call explicitly tells Django *not* to escape the HTML, effectively bypassing Django's automatic HTML escaping mechanisms and assuming that the data being inserted into the HTML is already safe.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no HTML escaping or sanitization applied to the `option_label` (the model field value used as the filter choice label) *before* it is inserted into the HTML output.
    - No input validation or output encoding is in place to prevent malicious HTML or JavaScript from being stored in model fields that are subsequently used as filter choices.
    - A secure-by-default approach would involve either automatically HTML-escaping these dynamic values before inserting them into HTML or implementing a robust sanitization process to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious content.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The vulnerable filter widget (e.g., one using `AllValuesFilter` and `LinkWidget`) must be rendered on a publicly accessible webpage.
    - An attacker must be able to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into a model field whose value is later used as a choice label in the filter widget. This injection point depends on the application's data handling and input validation practices.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/django_filters/widgets.py`, the `LinkWidget` class's `render_option` method is responsible for generating the HTML for each filter choice option. It retrieves the `option_label` and uses the following snippet to construct the HTML:
      ```python
      return self.option_string() % {
          "attrs": selected and ' class="selected"' or "",
          "query_string": url,
          "label": force_str(option_label),
      }
      ```
      The `option_label`, after being converted to a string using `force_str`, is directly inserted into the HTML template string without any HTML escaping. The entire resulting string is then marked as safe using `mark_safe` in the `render` method of `LinkWidget`, bypassing Django's auto-escaping.
    - The `AllValuesFilter` in `/code/django_filters/filters.py` populates its choices directly from model query results. For instance, it might retrieve a list of usernames directly from the database. These usernames are then passed as `option_label` to the `LinkWidget` without any sanitization.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up a test or staging environment. Identify a model field that is used in a filter employing `LinkWidget` (e.g., a username field filtered using `AllValuesFilter`).
    2. Create a database record where this model field is set to a malicious string containing JavaScript, such as `<script>alert('XSS-Test');</script>`.
    3. Access the public-facing webpage where the filter form is rendered, which includes the vulnerable filter widget.
    4. Inspect the HTML source code of the filter widget in the browser. Locate the HTML for the filter options and verify that the malicious payload is rendered *unescaped*. You should see the literal `<script>alert('XSS-Test');</script>` within the HTML.
    5. View the page in a browser. Confirm that the injected JavaScript executes when the page loads. For example, an alert dialog with "XSS-Test" should appear. This confirms the XSS vulnerability.
    6. To remediate, modify the `LinkWidget` (or ideally, address this in a more general way within `django-filter` or by creating a safer widget) to properly HTML-escape the `option_label` before inserting it into the HTML.  For example, use Django's `escape` filter or `mark_safe(escape(force_str(option_label)))`. After remediation, re-run the test to ensure that the malicious script no longer executes and that the HTML is properly escaped.

---

*Note:* Developers are strongly advised to ensure that sensitive test configurations are never used in production and that all output generated from dynamic or user-controlled content is properly sanitized or escaped to prevent XSS and information disclosure risks. Specifically, for the XSS vulnerability, it's crucial to escape HTML entities in model field values before rendering them in filter widgets or anywhere in HTML output, especially when using `mark_safe`. For information disclosure, error handling should be carefully reviewed and configured to avoid leaking internal details in production environments.
