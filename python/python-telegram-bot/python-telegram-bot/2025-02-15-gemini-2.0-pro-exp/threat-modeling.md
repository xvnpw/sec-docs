# Threat Model Analysis for python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot

## Threat: [Webhook Secret Token Bypass](./threats/webhook_secret_token_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** If webhooks are used, an attacker sends crafted HTTP requests directly to the bot's webhook endpoint, bypassing Telegram's servers. They exploit a vulnerability in the library's validation of the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header, allowing them to inject fake updates. This is a direct vulnerability in how the library handles webhook security.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can send arbitrary data to the bot, potentially triggering unintended actions, injecting malicious commands, or causing a denial of service. The bot processes these fake updates as if they were legitimate, potentially leading to complete compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `telegram.ext.Application.run_webhook()` and the internal webhook handling logic within `telegram.ext.Dispatcher`. Specifically, the code that verifies the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Always* use the `secret_token` parameter when calling `Application.run_webhook()`. Ensure the secret token is a strong, randomly generated value, and stored securely.
    *   Keep the `python-telegram-bot` library updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches related to webhook handling.
    *   Regularly review the library's changelog and security advisories for any updates related to webhook security.

## Threat: [User ID Spoofing within Bot Logic](./threats/user_id_spoofing_within_bot_logic.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious message that exploits a vulnerability in how `python-telegram-bot` parses or handles user IDs *internally*. The attacker might inject a different user ID, causing the bot to believe the message originated from a different, legitimate user. This is a vulnerability *within the library's processing*, not just a general application logic issue.
*   **Impact:** The bot performs actions on behalf of the impersonated user. This could lead to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or execution of commands intended for other users. The attacker could potentially escalate privileges if they impersonate an administrator.
*   **Affected Component:** `telegram.User` object creation and handling within the `telegram.ext.Dispatcher`, `telegram.ext.Handler` subclasses (e.g., `MessageHandler`, `CommandHandler`), and any custom code that relies on `update.effective_user.id`. Specifically, vulnerabilities in parsing the `from` field of the Telegram API response *within the library*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely *exclusively* on the `telegram.User` object provided by the library for user identification. Do *not* attempt to extract or parse user IDs from message content or other sources.
    *   Validate that the library version is up-to-date and includes any patches related to user ID handling.
    *   Thoroughly review the library's source code (if necessary) to understand how user IDs are handled and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Update Object Injection](./threats/update_object_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted message containing malicious data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how `python-telegram-bot` *parses the JSON payload* from the Telegram API. This could involve injecting unexpected values into fields of the `Update`, `Message`, `User`, or other related objects, *before* the application's handlers even receive the data.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can manipulate the bot's internal state, potentially causing it to execute unintended actions, crash, or leak information. The specific impact depends on how the injected data is used by the bot's handlers, but the vulnerability originates in the library's parsing.
*   **Affected Component:** `telegram.ext.Dispatcher`, `telegram.Update.de_json()`, and the JSON parsing logic *within the library*. Any handler that processes user input (e.g., `MessageHandler`, `CommandHandler`, `CallbackQueryHandler`) is *indirectly* affected, but the root cause is in the library's parsing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on the library's built-in parsing of the `Update` object. Do *not* attempt to parse the raw JSON data directly.
    *   Keep the `python-telegram-bot` library updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches related to JSON parsing.
    *   Report any suspected parsing vulnerabilities to the library maintainers.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Bot Token (Library-Facilitated)](./threats/command_injection_via_bot_token__library-facilitated_.md)

*   **Description:**  While this often involves application logic errors, a vulnerability *within the library* could make command injection easier.  For example, if the library provided an unsafe way to construct API calls, or if it failed to properly escape user input in certain scenarios, this could facilitate command injection even with relatively careful application code.  The focus here is on a library weakness that *enables* the injection.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can perform any action that the bot is authorized to do, potentially including sending messages to other users, deleting messages, modifying group settings, or even revoking the bot's token.
*   **Affected Component:**  Any `telegram.Bot` methods that accept user input as parameters, *if* those methods have vulnerabilities in how they handle that input internally.  This is less about specific handlers and more about the underlying API call mechanisms within the `telegram.Bot` class.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `python-telegram-bot` library updated.
    *   Review the library's documentation and source code for any warnings or best practices related to constructing API calls.
    *   Favor using the library's higher-level methods (e.g., `bot.send_message(chat_id, text=...)`) over constructing raw API requests.
    *   Even when using the library's methods, *always* validate and sanitize user input before passing it to any API call.
