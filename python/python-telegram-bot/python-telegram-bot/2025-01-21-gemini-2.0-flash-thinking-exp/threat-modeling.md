# Threat Model Analysis for python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot

## Threat: [Bot Token Compromise](./threats/bot_token_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the bot's API token. This could happen through various means such as insecure storage of the token in the codebase, configuration files, or environment variables, or through phishing or social engineering attacks targeting developers. Once compromised, the attacker can fully control the bot *via the python-telegram-bot library*.

**Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the bot, send malicious messages to users *using the library's functions*, access user data the bot has access to *through the library's API interactions*, and potentially perform actions on behalf of users if the application logic allows it. This can lead to reputational damage, data breaches, and financial loss.

**Affected Component:** The `Bot` class and the `Updater` class (as the token is used to instantiate the bot).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store the bot token securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
* Restrict access to the bot token to only necessary personnel and systems.
* Avoid hardcoding the token in the application's source code.
* Regularly rotate the bot token if possible (though this can be disruptive and requires careful planning).
* Monitor bot activity for suspicious behavior that might indicate a compromised token.

## Threat: [Malicious Update Injection](./threats/malicious_update_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts and sends malicious updates to the application's webhook endpoint (if using webhooks) or exploits vulnerabilities in the polling mechanism to inject crafted updates. These updates could contain malicious commands or data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's update handling logic *within the python-telegram-bot framework*.

**Impact:** This could lead to the execution of unintended code within the application, manipulation of application data, or triggering unintended actions by the bot *through the processing of these malicious updates by the library*. In severe cases, it could lead to remote code execution on the server hosting the application.

**Affected Component:** The `Updater` class (specifically the webhook handler or the polling mechanism), `MessageHandler`, `CommandHandler`, `CallbackQueryHandler`, and any custom update handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received from Telegram updates (messages, commands, callback data).
* Use the `secret_token` provided by Telegram for webhook verification to ensure requests are genuinely from Telegram.
* Implement robust error handling for unexpected or invalid update formats.
* Avoid directly executing code based on user input without careful validation and sanitization.
* Keep the `python-telegram-bot` library updated to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [File Handling Vulnerabilities](./threats/file_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the bot handles file uploads or downloads *using the python-telegram-bot library's functions*, vulnerabilities could arise from improper file validation, storage, or access control. An attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., malware) or gain unauthorized access to stored files *through the library's file handling capabilities*.

**Impact:** Uploaded malware could compromise the server or user devices. Unauthorized access to files could lead to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** Methods for handling file uploads (`get_file`, `download_file`) and downloads (`send_document`, `send_photo`, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate file types and sizes before processing uploads.
* Store uploaded files in a secure location with restricted access permissions.
* Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal attacks.
* Implement virus scanning for uploaded files.
* Limit the size and type of files that can be uploaded.

## Threat: [Webhook Hijacking (if using webhooks without proper verification)](./threats/webhook_hijacking__if_using_webhooks_without_proper_verification_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses webhooks *configured through the python-telegram-bot library* but doesn't properly verify the authenticity of incoming requests, an attacker could send fake requests to the webhook endpoint, mimicking Telegram's updates.

**Impact:** The attacker could inject malicious updates, trigger unintended actions *that the python-telegram-bot library would process*, or potentially disrupt the bot's functionality.

**Affected Component:** The `Updater` class (webhook handler).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use the `secret_token` provided by Telegram when setting up webhooks and verify it in your webhook handler.
* Ensure your webhook endpoint is only accessible via HTTPS.

## Threat: [Reliance on Client-Side Data for Authorization](./threats/reliance_on_client-side_data_for_authorization.md)

**Description:** The application relies solely on data provided by the Telegram client (e.g., user ID from the update) for authorization decisions without server-side verification *when processing updates received by the python-telegram-bot library*. An attacker could potentially manipulate this data to impersonate other users or bypass authorization checks.

**Impact:** Attackers could perform actions on behalf of other users, access restricted resources, or manipulate data they are not authorized to access *by exploiting the application's trust in the data provided by the library*.

**Affected Component:** All handlers (`MessageHandler`, `CommandHandler`, `CallbackQueryHandler`) and any application logic that makes authorization decisions based on client-provided data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always verify user identities and permissions on the server-side.
* Do not solely rely on the user ID provided in the Telegram update for critical authorization decisions.
* Implement your own authentication and authorization mechanisms if necessary.
