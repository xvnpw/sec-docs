## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_command_injection.md)

*   **Craft Malicious Command:**
    *   Description: The attacker crafts a Telegram message that, when interpreted as a command by the bot, contains malicious instructions. This could involve using shell metacharacters or commands that the underlying operating system will execute.
    *   Likelihood: Medium (requires understanding of the bot's command structure and potential vulnerabilities in its parsing logic).
    *   Impact: High (successful command injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the bot, potentially granting full system access).
    *   Effort: Medium (requires some knowledge of command-line syntax and the bot's functionality).
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate.
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (depends on the logging and monitoring in place; malicious commands might be logged, but detecting them requires analysis).

*   **Bot Executes Unsafe System Call or Application Logic:**
    *   Description: The application code, upon receiving the malicious command, directly executes it using functions like `os.system`, `subprocess.run` without proper sanitization, or passes it to vulnerable internal logic.
    *   Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends heavily on the developer's coding practices and awareness of command injection risks).
    *   Impact: High (direct execution of malicious commands can lead to complete system compromise).
    *   Effort: N/A (this is a consequence of the previous step).
    *   Skill Level: N/A.
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (requires monitoring system calls and application behavior for anomalies).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Configuration and Storage Weaknesses -> API Token Compromise](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_configuration_and_storage_weaknesses_-_api_token_compromise.md)

*   **Access Stored API Token (e.g., insecure file storage, environment variables):**
    *   Description: The attacker gains access to the Telegram Bot API token because it is stored insecurely. This could involve:
        *   Finding the token in plain text configuration files.
        *   Accessing environment variables on a compromised server.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage mechanism itself.
    *   Likelihood: Medium (depends on the developer's security practices for storing sensitive information).
    *   Impact: High (the API token grants full control over the bot).
    *   Effort: Low to Medium (depending on the storage location and security measures in place).
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate.
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (depends on monitoring access to sensitive files or environment variables).

*   **Bot Uses Stolen Token to Control the Bot:**
    *   Description: Once the attacker has the API token, they can use the official Telegram Bot API to send commands and perform actions as if they were the legitimate bot. This includes sending messages, accessing data, and potentially interacting with other services.
    *   Likelihood: High (trivial once the token is obtained).
    *   Impact: High (full control over the bot, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized actions).
    *   Effort: Low (using the Telegram Bot API is well-documented and straightforward).
    *   Skill Level: Beginner.
    *   Detection Difficulty: High (difficult to distinguish from legitimate bot activity without sophisticated anomaly detection).
