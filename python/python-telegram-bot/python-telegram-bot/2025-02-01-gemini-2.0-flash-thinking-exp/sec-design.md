# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust, reliable, and easy-to-use Python library for developers to create Telegram bots.
  - Foster a thriving community around the library, encouraging contributions and ensuring long-term maintenance.
  - Enable developers to quickly prototype and deploy Telegram bots for various use cases.
- Business Risks:
  - Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities in the library, leading to user data breaches or bot compromises.
  - Decreased adoption if the library is perceived as insecure or difficult to use.
  - Lack of community support and maintenance if the project is not actively managed or contributions are not welcomed.
  - Legal and compliance issues if bots built with the library violate Telegram's terms of service or data privacy regulations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. Implemented: GitHub platform.
  - security control: Publicly accessible issue tracker for reporting bugs and vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub Issues.
  - security control: Open-source nature allows for community code review and scrutiny. Implemented: Open GitHub repository.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in user-developed bots due to improper use of the library or insecure coding practices.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Telegram's API security; vulnerabilities in the Telegram API are outside the library's control.
  - accepted risk: Potential for supply chain attacks if dependencies are compromised (addressed by dependency management practices, but inherent risk remains).
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement Dependency Vulnerability Scanning to monitor and update vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits of the library's codebase by security experts.
  - security control: Provide comprehensive security documentation for library users, outlining best practices for secure bot development.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The library should securely handle Telegram Bot API tokens, preventing accidental exposure in logs or code.
    - Requirement: The library should encourage users to store API tokens securely, e.g., using environment variables or secure configuration management.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The library should provide mechanisms for users to implement authorization logic within their bots to control access to bot functionalities.
    - Requirement: The library itself does not handle user authorization but should facilitate secure implementation by bot developers.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library should provide tools and guidance for users to validate and sanitize user inputs received from Telegram to prevent injection attacks.
    - Requirement: The library's internal parsing of Telegram API responses should be robust and resistant to malformed or malicious data.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: The library should utilize secure communication channels (HTTPS) for all interactions with the Telegram API.
    - Requirement: If the library provides any cryptographic functionalities (e.g., for data encryption), it should use well-vetted and secure cryptographic libraries and algorithms.

  - Library Source Code: Publicly available, but integrity and availability are critical. Unauthorized modifications or deletion could severely impact the project. Sensitivity: Medium (Integrity and Availability).
  - PyPI Package: Publicly available, but integrity is crucial. Compromised packages could lead to widespread security issues for users. Sensitivity: High (Integrity).
  - GitHub Repository: Contains code, issues, and project management data. Availability and integrity are important for project continuity. Sensitivity: Medium (Integrity and Availability).
  - API Tokens (within library code - should be minimal): If accidentally exposed, could lead to unauthorized access to Telegram Bot API. Sensitivity: High (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the target risk appetite for this project? (Assuming moderate to high, typical for open-source projects).
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements that the library needs to adhere to (e.g., data privacy regulations)? (Assuming general best practices for data handling and security).
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community? (Assuming a public disclosure process after a reasonable fix timeframe).
- Assumptions:
  - The primary goal is to provide a secure and usable library for developers.
  - Users of the library are responsible for the security of the bots they build using it.
  - The project relies on the security of underlying platforms and services like GitHub, PyPI, and Telegram API.
  - Security is a shared responsibility between the library developers and the users.
  - The project benefits from the open-source community's scrutiny and contributions to security.
