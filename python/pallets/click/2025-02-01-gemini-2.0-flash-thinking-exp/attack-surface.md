# Attack Surface Analysis for pallets/click

## Attack Surface: [1. Command Injection via Unsanitized Arguments](./attack_surfaces/1__command_injection_via_unsanitized_arguments.md)

*   **Description:**  Executing arbitrary system commands by injecting malicious code into arguments that are passed to shell commands.
*   **How Click Contributes:** `click` simplifies the process of accepting and parsing command-line arguments.  It makes user-provided input readily available to the application logic. If developers directly embed these parsed arguments into shell commands (e.g., using `subprocess` with `shell=True`) without proper sanitization, `click` facilitates the pathway for command injection by passing unsanitized user input to a vulnerable execution context.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```python
        import click
        import subprocess

        @click.command()
        @click.argument('filename')
        def process_file(filename):
            subprocess.run(f"cat {filename}", shell=True, check=True)
        ```
    *   **Attack:**  `python vulnerable_script.py "$(malicious_command)"`
    *   **Explanation:**  The attacker provides an argument like `$(malicious_command)`. Because `shell=True` is used in `subprocess.run` and the `filename` argument (parsed by `click`) is directly embedded without sanitization, the shell interprets `$(...)` as command substitution, executing `malicious_command` on the system.
*   **Impact:**  Full system compromise, arbitrary code execution, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Avoid `shell=True`:**  The primary mitigation is to avoid using `shell=True` in functions like `subprocess.run` or `os.system`. Use list-based arguments to execute commands directly without shell interpretation.
        *   **Parameterize Commands:**  Construct commands using parameterized approaches that prevent shell injection.
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  If shell execution with user input is absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all user inputs parsed by `click` before incorporating them into shell commands. Use escaping mechanisms like `shlex.quote`.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when providing input to CLI applications, especially if they involve file processing or system interactions. Avoid running applications from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Argument Bomb](./attack_surfaces/2__denial_of_service__dos__via_argument_bomb.md)

*   **Description:**  Causing resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) by providing excessively long or complex arguments that the application struggles to parse or process.
*   **How Click Contributes:** `click` is designed to efficiently parse command-line arguments, including potentially very long strings.  It provides a straightforward way to accept user-supplied data as arguments. If the application logic then processes these arguments without limits or efficient handling, `click` effectively delivers the "bomb" argument to the vulnerable processing stage.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```python
        import click

        @click.command()
        @click.argument('large_data')
        def process_data(large_data):
            # Inefficiently process 'large_data' (e.g., string operations, memory allocation)
            print(f"Data length: {len(large_data)}")
            # ... (Imagine resource-intensive operations on 'large_data') ...
        ```
    *   **Attack:** `python vulnerable_script.py "$(python -c 'print("A"*10000000)')"`
    *   **Explanation:** The attacker provides a massive string (10 million 'A's) as input via command substitution. `click` parses this argument and passes it to `process_data`. If `process_data` performs resource-intensive operations on this very large string, it can lead to a DoS by consuming excessive CPU or memory.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, system slowdown, resource exhaustion, potentially crashing the application or system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Input Validation & Limits:** Implement validation to restrict the size and complexity of arguments accepted by the CLI. Set maximum lengths for string arguments or limits on the number of items in list arguments.
        *   **Efficient Processing:** Design application logic to handle potentially large inputs gracefully. Use streaming or chunking techniques when processing large data to avoid loading everything into memory at once.
        *   **Resource Management:** Implement resource limits (e.g., memory limits, CPU time limits) for the application to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Avoid providing extremely large or complex inputs to CLI applications, especially if you suspect they might be vulnerable to DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [3. Path Traversal via File Path Arguments (using `click.Path` or `click.File`)](./attack_surfaces/3__path_traversal_via_file_path_arguments__using__click_path__or__click_file__.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing or manipulating files outside the intended directory by providing crafted file paths that bypass directory restrictions.
*   **How Click Contributes:** `click` provides convenient parameter types like `click.Path` and `click.File` specifically designed for handling file paths as command-line arguments. While these types offer features like path existence checks, they do *not* inherently prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. If developers rely solely on `click.Path` or `click.File` without implementing additional path validation and sanitization in their application logic, `click` facilitates the acceptance of malicious paths from users.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code:**
        ```python
        import click

        @click.command()
        @click.argument('filepath', type=click.Path(exists=True))
        def read_file(filepath):
            with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
                print(content)
        ```
    *   **Attack:** `python vulnerable_script.py "../../../etc/shadow"`
    *   **Explanation:** The attacker provides a path like `../../../etc/shadow`. `click.Path(exists=True)` will check if `/etc/shadow` exists (and it likely does), but it does not prevent the path from traversing outside the intended working directory. The application then opens and reads `/etc/shadow`, potentially exposing sensitive system information.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, data breach, potential for further exploitation if write operations are also involved.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Path Validation & Sanitization:**  Always validate and sanitize file paths received through `click.Path` or `click.File`. Do not rely solely on `click`'s built-in path type features for security.
        *   **Path Normalization:** Use functions like `os.path.abspath`, `os.path.realpath`, and `os.path.normpath` to normalize paths and resolve symbolic links to a canonical form.
        *   **Directory Restriction (Chroot/Jail):**  Implement checks to ensure that the resolved path is within the expected directory or a designated "jail" directory. Verify that the path does not escape the intended scope.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary file system permissions.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be extremely cautious about the file paths you provide to CLI applications, especially when dealing with sensitive data or system files. Avoid providing paths that traverse upwards (using `../`) or outside the expected working directory.

## Attack Surface: [4. Vulnerabilities in Custom `click.ParamType` Implementations](./attack_surfaces/4__vulnerabilities_in_custom__click_paramtype__implementations.md)

*   **Description:** Introducing vulnerabilities through flawed or insecure validation logic within custom parameter type classes that extend `click`'s input handling capabilities.
*   **How Click Contributes:** `click`'s extensibility allows developers to create custom `click.ParamType` classes to handle complex input validation or parsing requirements.  If these custom types are not implemented with security in mind, they can become a point of vulnerability. `click` provides the framework for custom types, but the security of these types is entirely dependent on the developer's implementation.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Vulnerable Code (Custom ParamType with insecure validation):**
        ```python
        import click

        class LimitedStringType(click.ParamType):
            name = "limited_string"

            def convert(self, value, param, ctx):
                if len(value) > 50: # Insecure length check - easily bypassed if encoding is manipulated
                    self.fail(f"String too long (max 50 chars)", param, ctx)
                # ... (Potentially other flawed validation logic) ...
                return value

        @click.command()
        @click.argument('input_string', type=LimitedStringType())
        def process_string(input_string):
            print(f"Processing: {input_string}")
        ```
    *   **Attack:**  Exploiting weaknesses in the custom validation logic. For example, if the length check is based on character count but doesn't handle multi-byte characters correctly, an attacker might bypass the length limit by using specific encodings. Or, if a regex is used for validation but is poorly written, it might allow unexpected inputs.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing intended input validation, leading to unexpected application behavior, data corruption, or other vulnerabilities that the validation was meant to prevent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if the bypassed validation protects against critical vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Secure Coding Practices in Custom Types:** Apply rigorous secure coding practices when developing custom `click.ParamType` classes. Thoroughly test and review the validation logic for potential bypasses or vulnerabilities.
            *   **Robust Validation Logic:** Use well-established and robust validation techniques. Avoid writing custom validation from scratch if possible; leverage existing, well-tested validation libraries or functions.
            *   **Input Sanitization within `convert`:** Ensure proper input sanitization and encoding handling within the `convert` method of custom `ParamType` classes to prevent encoding-related bypasses.
            *   **Unit Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit tests specifically for custom `ParamType` classes, including tests for boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and potential bypass scenarios.
        *   **Users:**
            *   This is primarily a developer-side issue. Users generally cannot directly mitigate vulnerabilities in custom parameter types. However, reporting unexpected behavior or validation bypasses to application developers is crucial for identifying and fixing these issues.
