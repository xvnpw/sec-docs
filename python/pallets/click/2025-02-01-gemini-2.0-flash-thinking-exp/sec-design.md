# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is focused on providing a Python library named `click` that simplifies the process of building command-line interfaces (CLIs). The primary business priority is to empower developers to create user-friendly and robust CLIs with minimal effort. The goal is to enhance developer productivity and improve the user experience of command-line tools built with Python.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of vulnerabilities in the `click` library itself that could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using `click`.
- Risk of developers misusing `click` and creating insecure CLIs, such as those vulnerable to command injection or insecure handling of user inputs.
- Risk of supply chain attacks targeting the `click` library distribution channels (e.g., PyPI).
- Risk of denial of service if `click` applications are not designed to handle unexpected or malicious inputs gracefully.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code review process for contributions to the `click` library. Implemented as part of the GitHub pull request workflow.
- security control: Usage of standard Python security practices within the library's codebase. Implicit in the development process.
- security control: Dependency management using `pip` and `setuptools`. Described in project documentation for installation and development.
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the Python ecosystem and underlying operating systems. Inherited from the chosen technology stack.
- accepted risk: Security of applications built using `click` is the responsibility of the application developers. Implicit understanding of library usage.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for the `click` library.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the `click` library.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using `click` to build CLIs securely.
- security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `click`.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the `click` library itself. Authentication is typically handled by the applications built using `click`.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the `click` library itself. Authorization is typically handled by the applications built using `click`.
- Input validation: `click` should provide robust mechanisms for input validation to help developers build secure CLIs. This is partially implemented through parameter types and validation features.
- Cryptography: Not a core requirement for the `click` library itself. Cryptographic operations would be handled by applications using `click` if needed. However, `click` should not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise cryptographic operations in user applications.

Build process description:
1. Developer writes code and commits it to the Code Repository (GitHub).
2. Changes to the repository trigger the CI/CD System (GitHub Actions).
3. CI/CD system sets up a Build Environment. This environment includes necessary Build Tools like Python, pip, and setuptools.
4. The Build Environment performs the build process, which includes:
    - Fetching dependencies.
    - Running linters and code formatters.
    - Running unit tests.
    - Building distribution packages (e.g., wheels, source archives).
5. Security Scanners (SAST, Dependency) are run in the Build Environment to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
6. If security checks pass and the build is successful, Build Artifacts (distribution packages) are created.
7. Build Artifacts are published to the Package Repository (PyPI) for distribution.

Security controls in build process:
- security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for code protection and access control.
- security control: Automated build process using GitHub Actions, ensuring consistent and repeatable builds.
- security control: Security scanners (SAST) integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential code vulnerabilities before release.
- security control: Dependency scanning to identify and alert on vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `click`.
- security control: Code review process enforced through pull requests before merging code changes.
- security control: Signing of packages before publishing to PyPI (if implemented, should be recommended).
- security control: Use of a dedicated and isolated build environment to minimize the risk of build environment compromise.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Secure and reliable distribution of the `click` library to developers.
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the `click` library to ensure developers can build CLIs effectively.
- Protecting applications built using `click` from vulnerabilities originating from the library itself.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of the `click` library: Sensitive, as its compromise could lead to injection of malicious code into the library and subsequently into applications using it.
- Build artifacts (distribution packages): Sensitive, as their compromise could lead to distribution of malicious versions of the library to developers.
- Developer accounts and credentials used to manage the `click` library repository and PyPI package: Highly sensitive, as their compromise could allow unauthorized modifications and releases.

Data sensitivity classification:
- Source code: Confidential, Integrity
- Build artifacts: Integrity, Availability
- Developer credentials: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
