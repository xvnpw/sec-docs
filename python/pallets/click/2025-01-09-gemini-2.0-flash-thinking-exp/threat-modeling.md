# Threat Model Analysis for pallets/click

## Threat: [Malicious Argument Injection](./threats/malicious_argument_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts command-line arguments containing special characters or sequences that, while seemingly valid to `click`'s parser, are not properly sanitized or handled by the application's subsequent logic. This allows the attacker to influence the application's behavior in unintended ways based on how `click` presents the parsed data.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server or client machine, data manipulation, unauthorized access, or denial of service depending on how the application processes the injected arguments received from `click`.

**Affected Click Component:** `click.core` (argument parsing logic), `click.option`, `click.argument`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of all arguments received from `click` *before* using them in any potentially dangerous operations.
*   **Avoid Direct Execution of User Input:** Do not directly pass `click`'s parsed output to shell commands or other execution contexts without careful sanitization.

## Threat: [Malicious Input via Prompts](./threats/malicious_input_via_prompts.md)

**Description:** When using `click.prompt()`, an attacker interacting with the command-line interface can provide malicious input that the application subsequently uses without proper sanitization. The vulnerability lies in how `click` collects and provides this input to the application.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service depending on how the application uses the prompted input received via `click`.

**Affected Click Component:** `click.prompt`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Sanitize Prompt Input:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input received from `click.prompt()` before using it in any potentially dangerous operations.
*   **Avoid Using Prompts for Sensitive Operations:** If possible, avoid using prompts for actions that could have significant security implications.
