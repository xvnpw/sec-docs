# Attack Surface Analysis for pallets/click

## Attack Surface: [Argument Injection](./attack_surfaces/argument_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Argument Injection
    *   **Description:** User-provided input used as command-line arguments is not properly sanitized or escaped before being passed to external commands or system calls.
    *   **How Click Contributes:** `click` parses command-line arguments and makes them readily available to the application. If these parsed arguments are directly used to construct and execute shell commands (e.g., using `subprocess`), it creates an injection point.
    *   **Example:** A command takes a `--filename` argument. A malicious user provides `--filename "; rm -rf /"` which, if directly passed to a shell command, could delete files.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data loss, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly in shell commands whenever possible.
        *   If executing external commands is necessary, use parameterized commands or libraries that handle escaping and quoting (e.g., `subprocess` with a list of arguments instead of a string).
        *   Sanitize user input by removing or escaping potentially harmful characters before using it in shell commands.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via File Parameters](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_file_parameters.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal via File Parameters
    *   **Description:** The application accepts file paths as command-line arguments or options without proper validation, allowing users to access or manipulate files outside the intended directory.
    *   **How Click Contributes:** `click` provides the `click.Path` type, which can help with basic path validation. However, if not configured correctly (e.g., `exists=True`, `dir_okay=False`, `resolve_path=True`), or if developers rely solely on it without further checks, path traversal vulnerabilities can occur.
    *   **Example:** A command takes an `--input-file` argument. A malicious user provides `--input-file "../../../etc/passwd"` to potentially read a sensitive system file.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to files, potential for data modification or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize `click.Path` with appropriate configurations like `exists=True`, `dir_okay=False`, `resolve_path=True`, and `canonicalize=True`.
        *   Implement additional validation to ensure the provided path is within an expected directory or adheres to a specific pattern.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided paths for critical file operations without thorough validation.

## Attack Surface: [Shell Completion Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/shell_completion_script_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Shell Completion Script Injection
    *   **Description:** Malicious code can be injected into the shell completion scripts generated by `click`, leading to arbitrary code execution when a user sources the script.
    *   **How Click Contributes:** `click` provides functionality to generate shell completion scripts for various shells. If the generation process doesn't properly sanitize or escape characters in command names, option names, or help texts, attackers could inject malicious commands.
    *   **Example:** If a command name or option help text contains backticks or other shell metacharacters, and the completion script generation doesn't escape them, a crafted script could execute arbitrary commands when sourced.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the user's machine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Be extremely cautious about using user-provided input or external data in command names, option names, or help texts that are used for generating completion scripts.
        *   Review the generated completion scripts for any unexpected or potentially malicious content.
        *   Consider disabling shell completion generation if the risk outweighs the benefit, especially in sensitive environments.
