## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Code Execution (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_code_execution__critical_node_.md)

* **Critical Node: Achieve Code Execution**
    * This represents the highest impact scenario where the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the system running the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Parameter (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_parameter__high-risk_path_.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Command Injection via Parameter**
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Shell Metacharacters in Parameter Value**
        * Description: The attacker crafts input for a `click` parameter that includes shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `&`, `|`, backticks). If the application uses this parameter value in a shell command without proper sanitization (e.g., using `os.system` or `subprocess.run(shell=True)`), the injected metacharacters will be interpreted by the shell, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
        * Example: A parameter `--name` is used in `os.system(f"process --name {name}")`. An attacker provides `--name 'test; rm -rf /'`. The shell executes `process --name test` followed by `rm -rf /`.
        * Mitigation: Avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.run`. If shell execution is necessary, carefully sanitize and quote the input. Use parameterized commands.

    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Unsanitized Parameter Value in `click.launch()`**
        * Description: The `click.launch()` function is used to open files or URLs. If an application uses this function with a `click` parameter that takes user input without proper validation or sanitization, an attacker can provide a malicious file path or URL. This could lead to the execution of a local executable or opening a malicious website.
        * Example: `click.launch(filename)` is used where `filename` is a user-provided parameter. An attacker provides `/usr/bin/malicious_script`.
        * Mitigation: Avoid using `click.launch()` with unsanitized user input. If necessary, strictly validate the input against a whitelist of allowed files or URLs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Shell Metacharacters in Parameter Value (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shell_metacharacters_in_parameter_value__high-risk_path_.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Command Injection via Parameter**
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Shell Metacharacters in Parameter Value**
        * Description: The attacker crafts input for a `click` parameter that includes shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `&`, `|`, backticks). If the application uses this parameter value in a shell command without proper sanitization (e.g., using `os.system` or `subprocess.run(shell=True)`), the injected metacharacters will be interpreted by the shell, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
        * Example: A parameter `--name` is used in `os.system(f"process --name {name}")`. An attacker provides `--name 'test; rm -rf /'`. The shell executes `process --name test` followed by `rm -rf /`.
        * Mitigation: Avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.run`. If shell execution is necessary, carefully sanitize and quote the input. Use parameterized commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsanitized Parameter Value in `click.launch()` (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsanitized_parameter_value_in__click_launch_____high-risk_path_.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Command Injection via Parameter**
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Unsanitized Parameter Value in `click.launch()`**
        * Description: The `click.launch()` function is used to open files or URLs. If an application uses this function with a `click` parameter that takes user input without proper validation or sanitization, an attacker can provide a malicious file path or URL. This could lead to the execution of a local executable or opening a malicious website.
        * Example: `click.launch(filename)` is used where `filename` is a user-provided parameter. An attacker provides `/usr/bin/malicious_script`.
        * Mitigation: Avoid using `click.launch()` with unsanitized user input. If necessary, strictly validate the input against a whitelist of allowed files or URLs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit `click.edit()` or `click.launch()` without proper sanitization (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit__click_edit____or__click_launch____without_proper_sanitization__high-risk_path_.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit `click.edit()` or `click.launch()` without proper sanitization**
    * **Attack Vector: Unsafe Usage of `click.edit()`**
        * Description: The `click.edit()` function opens a file in a text editor. If the filename is derived from user input without proper sanitization, an attacker could provide a path to a sensitive system file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`) to view or potentially modify it (depending on permissions).
        * Example: `click.edit(filename)` is used where `filename` is a user-provided parameter. An attacker provides `/etc/passwd`.
        * Mitigation: Avoid using `click.edit()` with unsanitized user input. If necessary, strictly validate the input against a whitelist of allowed files.

    * **Attack Vector: Unsafe Usage of `click.launch()` (Reiteration)**
        * Description: As described above, using `click.launch()` with unsanitized user input can lead to the execution of arbitrary local files if the attacker provides a path to an executable.
        * Example: `click.launch(url)` is used where `url` is a user-provided parameter. An attacker provides `file:///usr/bin/malicious_script`. (Note: `click.launch()` can handle file URLs).
        * Mitigation: Avoid using `click.launch()` with unsanitized user input. If necessary, strictly validate the input against a whitelist of allowed files or URLs.
