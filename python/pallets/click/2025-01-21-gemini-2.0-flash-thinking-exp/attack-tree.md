## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities -> [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Commands via Unsanitized Input](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_command_injection_vulnerabilities_-__high-risk_path__critica_97876365.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Commands via Unsanitized Input
    *   **Target:** Parameters passed to `click.command` or `click.option`.
    *   **Technique:** Inject shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `&`, `|`, `$()`) into arguments that are later used in `subprocess` calls or `os.system`.
    *   **Example:** `my_app --name "; rm -rf /"`
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Sanitize user input before passing to shell commands.
        *   Use `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` and pass arguments as a list.
        *   Avoid using `os.system` or `subprocess.call` with `shell=True`.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Parameter Types or Callbacks](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_parameter_types_or_callbacks.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Parameter Types or Callbacks
    *   **Target:** Custom types or callback functions defined using `click.ParamType` or `callback` parameter in `click.option`.
    *   **Technique:** Provide unexpected or malicious input that triggers vulnerabilities in the custom logic, leading to command execution.
    *   **Example:** A custom type that doesn't properly validate file paths, allowing path traversal and execution of arbitrary files.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/High
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly validate input within custom types and callbacks.
        *   Implement robust error handling in custom logic.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom components.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities -> [CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate File Paths in Click Options](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_path_traversal_vulnerabilities_-__critical_node__manipulate__8f663725.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulate File Paths in Click Options
    *   **Target:** `click.Path` type used for file or directory paths.
    *   **Technique:** Provide relative paths (e.g., `../../sensitive_file.txt`) to access files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Example:** `my_app --input ../../etc/passwd`
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium/High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use `click.Path(resolve_path=True)` to resolve symbolic links and canonicalize paths.
        *   Implement strict validation of file paths to ensure they are within expected boundaries.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided paths for critical file operations without validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in File Handling Logic Based on Click Input](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_file_handling_logic_based_on_click_input.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in File Handling Logic Based on Click Input
    *   **Target:** Application logic that uses file paths obtained from Click options.
    *   **Technique:** Provide malicious file paths that, when processed by the application, lead to unintended file access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Example:** Providing a path to a system configuration file that the application attempts to modify.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium/High
    *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement robust access control checks before performing file operations.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing files.
        *   Sanitize and validate file paths before using them in file system operations.
