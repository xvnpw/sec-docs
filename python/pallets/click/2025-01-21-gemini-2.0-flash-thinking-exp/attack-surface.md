# Attack Surface Analysis for pallets/click

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

* **Description:** The application uses Click-parsed arguments or options directly in shell commands without proper sanitization.
    * **How Click Contributes:** Click provides the mechanism to receive user input, and if this input is directly incorporated into shell commands without escaping or validation, it creates an entry point for command injection.
    * **Example:** A Click command takes a `--filename` option. The application executes `os.system(f"cat {filename}")`. An attacker could provide `--filename='$(evil_command)'` to execute arbitrary commands.
    * **Impact:**  Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the application. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid using `os.system` or similar functions with user-provided input:**  Prefer safer alternatives like the `subprocess` module with proper argument handling (using lists for arguments).
        * **Sanitize input before using in shell commands:** If using shell commands is unavoidable, meticulously sanitize the input using appropriate escaping techniques (e.g., `shlex.quote`).
        * **Principle of least privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation and Sanitization Issues](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_and_sanitization_issues.md)

* **Description:** The application relies on Click for basic type conversion but lacks robust validation and sanitization of user-provided arguments and options.
    * **How Click Contributes:** Click parses the input and performs basic type conversions, but it doesn't inherently sanitize input for potentially malicious content. The application developer is responsible for further validation.
    * **Example:** A Click application expects an integer for a `--count` option. A user provides a string like `"1; rm -rf /"` which Click might not flag as invalid during basic type conversion if not strictly enforced, and the application might later use this unsanitized input in a system call.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to various vulnerabilities like command injection, path traversal, or unexpected application behavior due to processing invalid data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement strict type checking:** Use Click's type options and add custom validation functions to ensure input conforms to expected formats and constraints.
        * **Sanitize user input:** Before using Click-parsed input in sensitive operations (like system calls or file operations), sanitize it to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        * **Use parameterized queries or functions:** When interacting with databases or external systems, use parameterized queries or functions to prevent injection attacks.
