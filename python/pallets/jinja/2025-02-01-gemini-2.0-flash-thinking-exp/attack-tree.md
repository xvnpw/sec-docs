## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Jinja2 Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_jinja2_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. It represents the overall objective to compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities specifically related to the Jinja2 templating engine.
*   **Risk Level:** Critical (High Impact if achieved)

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] * Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___exploit_server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary high-risk path. Server-Side Template Injection occurs when user-controlled input is embedded into a Jinja2 template and rendered, allowing attackers to inject malicious template code.
*   **Risk Level:** Critical (High Likelihood and High Impact)

    *   **2.1. [CRITICAL NODE] * Identify SSTI Vulnerable Points [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker's first step is to identify locations in the application where SSTI vulnerabilities might exist.
        *   **Risk Level:** Critical (Essential step for SSTI exploitation)

        *   **2.1.1. [CRITICAL NODE] * User-Controlled Input Directly in Template Rendering [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Description:** This is the most direct and dangerous form of SSTI. It occurs when user input is directly used as part of the template string in functions like `render_template_string`.
            *   **Attack Vectors:**
                *   **Analyze Code for `render_template_string` with User Input:**
                    *   Likelihood: Medium
                    *   Impact: High
                    *   Effort: Low
                    *   Skill Level: Medium
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
                *   **Fuzz Input Fields for Template Syntax Injection (e.g., `{{`, `}}`, `{%`, `%}`)**: 
                    *   Likelihood: High
                    *   Impact: High
                    *   Effort: Low
                    *   Skill Level: Low
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Low

    *   **2.2. [CRITICAL NODE] * Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution via SSTI [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** Once an SSTI point is identified, the attacker aims to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by crafting malicious Jinja2 payloads.
        *   **Risk Level:** Critical (Directly leads to system compromise)

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] * Exploit Code Execution for Application Compromise [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___exploit_code_execution_for_application_compromise__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** After achieving code execution via SSTI, the attacker leverages this access to further compromise the application and its environment. This path focuses on the consequences of successful SSTI.
*   **Risk Level:** Critical (High Impact - realization of compromise)

    *   **3.1. [CRITICAL NODE] * Data Exfiltration [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** A primary goal after code execution is to steal sensitive data from the application and its underlying systems.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Read Sensitive Files (e.g., configuration files, database credentials):**
                *   Likelihood: High
                *   Impact: High
                *   Effort: Low

                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            *   **Access and Exfiltrate Database Data:**
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: High
                *   Effort: Medium
                *   Skill Level: Medium
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            *   **Steal Application Secrets and API Keys:**
                *   Likelihood: High
                *   Impact: High
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Low
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] * Denial of Service (DoS) via Template Complexity [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___denial_of_service__dos__via_template_complexity__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting Jinja2's template rendering process to cause a Denial of Service. Attackers craft complex templates that consume excessive server resources.
*   **Risk Level:** High (Medium Impact, but High Likelihood and Low Effort)

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
