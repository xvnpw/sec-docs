# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a flexible and powerful template engine for Python developers.
  - Ensure high performance and efficiency in template rendering.
  - Maintain stability and reliability for production use.
  - Offer a user-friendly and easy-to-learn API.
  - Foster a strong community and provide ongoing support.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Jinja could lead to security breaches in applications that use it, such as:
    - Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) attacks.
    - Information disclosure through template errors.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by exploiting template processing.
  - Performance issues or instability could negatively impact applications relying on Jinja.
  - Lack of adoption or developer dissatisfaction could lead to project stagnation.
  - Compatibility issues with different Python versions or environments.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation is expected to be performed by the application using Jinja before passing data to templates. (Implementation: Application developer responsibility)
  - security control: Jinja aims to prevent common template injection vulnerabilities through its design and features like sandboxing (if enabled). (Implementation: Jinja core engine)
  - security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning are likely performed by the open-source community and users. (Implementation: Community driven, ad-hoc)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on application developers to properly sanitize data before using it in templates.
  - accepted risk: Potential for complex template logic to introduce unforeseen security vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security testing as part of the Jinja CI/CD pipeline, including SAST and DAST tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation and best practices for secure template development, emphasizing input sanitization and context-aware output encoding.
  - security control: Offer built-in mechanisms or guidance for sandboxing template execution environments to limit potential damage from malicious templates.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable to Jinja itself, as it is a library. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using Jinja.
  - Authorization: Not applicable to Jinja itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using Jinja to control access to templates and data.
  - Input Validation: Jinja should provide mechanisms to safely handle and escape user-provided input within templates to prevent injection attacks. However, primary input validation is the responsibility of the application using Jinja before passing data to the template engine.
  - Cryptography: Jinja itself does not directly handle cryptography. If cryptographic operations are needed within templates, they should be provided by the application and accessed through template context. Jinja should not introduce cryptographic vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For Jinja itself, the critical business process is providing a secure, reliable, and performant template engine to the Python community.
  - For applications using Jinja, critical business processes depend on the application's purpose. Examples include:
    - Rendering web pages for e-commerce platforms.
    - Generating reports for financial systems.
    - Creating configuration files for infrastructure management.
    - Generating emails for communication platforms.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Jinja itself does not store persistent data. It processes data provided to it during template rendering.
  - The sensitivity of data processed by Jinja depends entirely on the application using it. Data can range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data.
  - Examples of sensitive data that might be processed by Jinja templates:
    - User credentials.
    - Personal Identifiable Information (PII).
    - Financial transaction details.
    - Internal system configurations.
  - The primary data security concern is preventing unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure of data processed by Jinja templates, especially when used in applications handling sensitive information.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific SAST and dependency scanning tools are currently used in Jinja's CI/CD pipeline (if any)?
  - Is there a formal security incident response plan for Jinja?
  - Are there any specific guidelines or documentation for developers on how to use Jinja securely?
  - What is the process for handling and disclosing security vulnerabilities in Jinja?
