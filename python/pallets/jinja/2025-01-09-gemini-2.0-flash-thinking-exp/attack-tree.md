## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) -> Execute Arbitrary Code on Server -> Inject Malicious Code via Template Syntax -> Leverage Built-in Objects and Functions -> Access and Execute OS Commands (e.g., `os.system`, `subprocess`)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_template_injection__ssti__-_execute_arbitrary_code_on_server_-_inject_malicious__a0d4e828.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers exploit SSTI by injecting malicious Jinja code that leverages built-in Python objects and functions accessible within the template context. Specifically, they target functions like `os.system` or `subprocess` to execute operating system commands directly on the server.

**Impact:** This path leads to **critical impact** as the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code, potentially taking full control of the server.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood is **medium** as it depends on whether the application directly embeds user input into templates and if the Jinja environment allows access to dangerous built-in functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) -> Access Sensitive Information -> Access Environment Variables -> Inject Payloads to Access Environment Variables via Template Context](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_template_injection__ssti__-_access_sensitive_information_-_access_environment_va_622fbb90.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit SSTI to inject Jinja code that accesses environment variables. Environment variables often store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets.

**Impact:** This path leads to **high impact** as the attacker can gain access to sensitive credentials, potentially leading to further unauthorized access to other systems or data.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood is **medium** if environment variables are accessible within the Jinja context and user input is embedded in templates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) -> Access Sensitive Information -> Access Internal Application State -> Inject Payloads to Access Variables and Objects within the Application's Scope](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_template_injection__ssti__-_access_sensitive_information_-_access_internal_appli_46494c25.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit SSTI to inject Jinja code that accesses variables and objects within the application's scope that are passed to the template. This can expose sensitive data that is intended to be used for rendering but not directly exposed to users.

**Impact:** This path leads to **high impact** as attackers can gain access to sensitive application data, potentially including user information, business logic, or internal configurations.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood is **medium** if the application passes a wide range of internal data to the template context and user input is embedded in templates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Loading Mechanisms -> Template Injection via Filename Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Filenames or Paths -> Force the Inclusion of Unintended or Malicious Templates](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_loading_mechanisms_-_template_injection_via_filename_manipulation_-_inject_maliciou_d6aa1986.md)

**Attack Vector:** This attack exploits vulnerabilities in how the application loads Jinja templates. If the application allows user input to influence the template filename or path without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious filenames or paths. This can lead to the inclusion of arbitrary files from the server (Local File Inclusion - LFI) or even remote files if the application allows fetching templates from external sources. Maliciously crafted templates can then be executed by the Jinja engine.

**Impact:** This path leads to **high impact**, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution if a malicious template is included and rendered. It can also lead to the disclosure of sensitive information if arbitrary local files are accessed.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood is **low** as it requires a specific vulnerability in the template loading mechanism, but the potential impact makes it a high-risk path.
