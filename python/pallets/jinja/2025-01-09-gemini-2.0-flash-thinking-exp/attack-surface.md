# Attack Surface Analysis for pallets/jinja

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Jinja code into templates, which is then executed on the server.
    * **How Jinja Contributes:** Jinja's core functionality of evaluating expressions and rendering templates makes it susceptible if user input is directly embedded without sanitization.
    * **Example:** A web application takes user input for a greeting message and directly renders it using `render_template_string("Hello {{ user_input }}!", user_input=request.args.get('name'))`. An attacker could input `{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()[408]('/etc/passwd').read() }}` to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to control the server, access sensitive data, and potentially compromise the entire system.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid embedding user-provided data directly into templates.**
        * **Use parameterized templates or pre-compile templates.**
        * **Implement strict input validation and sanitization.**
        * **Consider using a sandboxed Jinja environment (though be aware of potential bypasses).**
        * **Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential damage even if SSTI occurs.**

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Template Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_template_rendering.md)

* **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the template and rendered in the user's browser.
    * **How Jinja Contributes:** If Jinja's autoescaping is disabled or bypassed, and user-provided data is rendered without proper escaping, it can lead to XSS.
    * **Example:** A user profile page renders the username using `render_template('profile.html', username=user_provided_name)`. If `user_provided_name` is `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` and autoescaping is off, the script will execute in the victim's browser.
    * **Impact:**  Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and other client-side attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Ensure Jinja's autoescaping feature is enabled globally or contextually where appropriate.**
        * **Use the `safe` filter judiciously and only when absolutely necessary for trusted content.**
        * **Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.**
        * **Sanitize user input on the server-side before rendering it in the template.**

## Attack Surface: [Security Risks in Custom Jinja Filters and Tests](./attack_surfaces/security_risks_in_custom_jinja_filters_and_tests.md)

* **Description:** Developers create custom filters and tests that introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
    * **How Jinja Contributes:** Jinja's extensibility allows for custom logic, which can be a security risk if not handled carefully.
    * **Example:** A custom filter designed to execute shell commands based on user input: `{{ user_input | execute_command }}` where `execute_command` uses `os.system` without proper sanitization.
    * **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), arbitrary file access, or other vulnerabilities depending on the filter/test's functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Thoroughly review and test all custom filters and tests for potential security flaws.**
        * **Avoid using filters or tests that directly interact with the operating system or execute external commands based on user input.**
        * **Implement proper input validation and sanitization within custom filters and tests.**
        * **Follow the principle of least privilege when designing custom functionality.**

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Jinja's Sandboxing (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_jinja's_sandboxing__if_enabled_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the restrictions imposed by Jinja's sandboxed environment.
    * **How Jinja Contributes:** While intended as a security measure, the sandbox itself can have vulnerabilities or limitations.
    * **Example:**  Exploiting weaknesses in the sandbox's restrictions on accessing built-in functions or modules to achieve code execution.
    * **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), negating the intended security benefits of the sandbox.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Jinja updated to the latest version, as security vulnerabilities in the sandbox are often patched.**
        * **Understand the limitations of Jinja's sandbox and avoid relying solely on it for security.**
        * **Implement other security measures in addition to sandboxing.**
        * **Consider alternative sandboxing solutions or template engines if Jinja's sandbox is insufficient for your security needs.**

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Template Loading](./attack_surfaces/insecure_template_loading.md)

* **Description:** The application allows users to influence the source of Jinja templates, potentially leading to the rendering of arbitrary files.
    * **How Jinja Contributes:** Jinja's ability to load templates from various sources becomes a risk if the source is user-controlled.
    * **Example:** An application allows users to specify a template path via a URL parameter, allowing an attacker to load and render sensitive server-side files.
    * **Impact:**  Information disclosure, potential code execution if the loaded file contains executable code.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid allowing users to directly specify template paths.**
        * **Use a predefined set of allowed template paths.**
        * **Implement strict access controls on template files.**
        * **Sanitize and validate any user input related to template selection (if absolutely necessary).**
