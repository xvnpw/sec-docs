# Threat Model Analysis for pallets/jinja

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code or template directives into user-controlled input that is then processed by the Jinja engine. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is achieved by crafting input that manipulates Jinja's variable resolution or control structures.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, arbitrary file access or modification on the server.
*   **Affected Jinja Component:**  The core templating engine, specifically the variable interpolation (`{{ ... }}`) and control structure (`{% ... %}`) parsing and execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid directly embedding user input into Jinja template strings.** Always pass data as context variables.
    *   **Use a sandboxed Jinja environment with restricted functionalities.**  Disable or limit access to dangerous built-in functions and filters. Libraries like `jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment` can be used.
    *   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization** on data that will be used in templates, even as context variables. Treat all user input as potentially malicious.
    *   **Regularly update Jinja to the latest version** to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Abuse of `include` and `extend` for Arbitrary File Access](./threats/abuse_of__include__and__extend__for_arbitrary_file_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate the paths used in Jinja's `include` or `extend` statements if these paths are dynamically generated based on user input without proper sanitization. This could allow them to include or extend arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This is achieved by providing crafted relative or absolute paths.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the server, potential code execution if included files contain executable code (though Jinja itself won't execute it directly, the application might).
*   **Affected Jinja Component:** The `include` and `extend` template directives and their path resolution logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid constructing file paths dynamically based on user input for `include` and `extend`.**
    *   **Use a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed paths for these directives.** Define a set of permitted template directories.
    *   **Ensure that the template directories are properly secured and only contain trusted files.**

## Threat: [Exploiting Global Functions and Filters](./threats/exploiting_global_functions_and_filters.md)

*   **Description:** If the application exposes custom global functions or filters to the Jinja environment without careful consideration of their security implications, an attacker might be able to leverage them for malicious purposes. This could involve functions that perform system calls, access databases, or interact with other sensitive resources. The attacker would use these functions within the template syntax.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the functionality of the exposed functions/filters, potentially leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or even code execution.
*   **Affected Jinja Component:** The mechanism for registering and accessing global functions and filters within the Jinja environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully review the security implications of any custom global functions or filters before exposing them.**
    *   **Avoid exposing functions that perform sensitive operations directly to the template context.**
    *   **Sanitize inputs within custom functions and filters to prevent unexpected behavior.**
