# Attack Surface Analysis for pallets/jinja

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Jinja2 syntax into user-controlled input that is then processed by the Jinja2 engine. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How Jinja Contributes:** Jinja2's powerful syntax allows for accessing and manipulating objects and functions within the Python environment. If user input is directly embedded into a template without proper sanitization, attackers can leverage this syntax.
    *   **Example:** A user provides the input `{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()[408]('ls /').read() }}` in a comment field, which, if directly rendered by Jinja2, could execute the `ls /` command on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and the ability to pivot to internal networks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input into Jinja2 templates. If absolutely necessary, treat user input as data and pass it as variables to the template.
        *   Utilize Jinja2's autoescape feature. Ensure autoescaping is enabled for all output contexts (HTML, XML, JavaScript, etc.) to prevent the interpretation of malicious code.
        *   Implement a secure sandboxed environment for template rendering. While Jinja2 offers a sandbox, it's not a foolproof solution and might require careful configuration and limitations.
        *   Use a restricted execution environment for Jinja2 rendering. Limit the available functions and objects accessible within the Jinja2 context.
        *   Regularly audit and review template code. Look for potential injection points where user input might be directly used.

## Attack Surface: [Risks Associated with Custom Filters and Tests](./attack_surfaces/risks_associated_with_custom_filters_and_tests.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses custom Jinja2 filters or tests, vulnerabilities within these custom components can introduce new attack vectors. This is directly related to how Jinja2 allows extending its functionality.
    *   **How Jinja Contributes:** Jinja2 allows developers to extend its functionality with custom filters and tests, which can introduce security flaws if not implemented carefully. The way Jinja2 integrates and executes these custom components is the contributing factor.
    *   **Example:** A custom filter that executes shell commands based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, which is then called within a Jinja2 template.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, information disclosure, or other vulnerabilities depending on the functionality of the custom filter or test.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom filters and tests for security vulnerabilities. Apply secure coding practices.
        *   Avoid executing external commands or accessing sensitive resources directly within custom filters or tests.
        *   Sanitize and validate any user input processed by custom filters or tests.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when implementing custom filters and tests. Limit their access to necessary resources.

## Attack Surface: [Security Implications of Jinja2 Extensions](./attack_surfaces/security_implications_of_jinja2_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Using Jinja2 extensions can introduce vulnerabilities if the extensions themselves are not secure or if they provide access to dangerous functionalities.
    *   **How Jinja Contributes:** Jinja2's extensibility allows for adding new features, but this also introduces the risk of relying on potentially vulnerable third-party code that Jinja2 integrates with.
    *   **Example:** An extension that allows direct access to the file system without proper authorization checks, which is then utilized within a Jinja2 template.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to SSTI, potentially leading to code execution, information disclosure, or other vulnerabilities depending on the extension's capabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully evaluate the security of any Jinja2 extensions before using them. Check for known vulnerabilities and review the extension's code.
        *   Use only trusted and well-maintained extensions.
        *   Limit the number of extensions used in the application.
        *   Configure extensions with security in mind, restricting access to sensitive functionalities if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Sandbox Escape (if using the Sandboxed Environment)](./attack_surfaces/sandbox_escape__if_using_the_sandboxed_environment_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers find ways to bypass the limitations of Jinja2's sandboxed environment and execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How Jinja Contributes:** While Jinja2 offers a sandbox, it's not a perfect security measure, and vulnerabilities in the sandbox implementation or configuration (within Jinja2 itself) can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting a weakness in the sandbox's restrictions to access built-in Python functions or modules through Jinja2's sandboxing mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**  Circumvention of security measures, potentially leading to full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Do not rely solely on Jinja2's sandbox as the primary security mechanism. Implement other security measures, such as input validation and output encoding.
        *   Keep Jinja2 updated to the latest version. Security vulnerabilities in the sandbox might be patched in newer releases.
        *   Carefully configure the sandbox environment, restricting access to potentially dangerous objects and functions.
        *   Consider using more robust sandboxing solutions if the risk is high.

## Attack Surface: [Template Loading Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/template_loading_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to influence the template loading process, it could be vulnerable to path traversal or arbitrary file inclusion.
    *   **How Jinja Contributes:** Jinja2 needs to load templates from a specified location. If the logic for determining this location is flawed and allows user influence, it becomes a Jinja-related vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` as the template name, which Jinja2 then attempts to load based on the application's flawed logic.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially leading to further exploitation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on template directories.
        *   Avoid allowing user input to directly determine template paths. Use a predefined set of templates or map user input to specific template names securely.
        *   Sanitize and validate any user input used in template path construction.
        *   Ensure that the application does not inadvertently serve arbitrary files as templates through Jinja2's template loading mechanism.

## Attack Surface: [Potential for Code Injection through `eval()` or Similar Constructs (within custom filters/extensions)](./attack_surfaces/potential_for_code_injection_through__eval____or_similar_constructs__within_custom_filtersextensions_125507a3.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might introduce `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution constructs within custom filters or extensions, creating a direct code injection vulnerability that is then triggered through Jinja.
    *   **How Jinja Contributes:** Jinja2's extensibility allows developers to create custom filters and extensions. If these extensions contain dangerous constructs like `eval()`, and Jinja2 executes them based on user input, it contributes to the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A custom filter uses `eval()` to process user-provided expressions, and this filter is called within a Jinja2 template with attacker-controlled input.
    *   **Impact:**  Direct code execution on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution constructs in custom filters or extensions. There are almost always safer alternatives.
        *   If dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization. However, this is generally discouraged due to the inherent risks.
        *   Regularly audit custom filter and extension code for the presence of such constructs.
