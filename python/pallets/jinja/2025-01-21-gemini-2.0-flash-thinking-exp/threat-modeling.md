# Threat Model Analysis for pallets/jinja

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   An attacker identifies a point where user-controlled input is directly or indirectly used within a Jinja template.
    *   The attacker crafts malicious input containing Jinja syntax (e.g., `{{ ... }}`) that, when rendered by the Jinja engine, is interpreted as code.
    *   This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server hosting the application. They might leverage built-in Jinja objects or functions to gain access to the operating system or other resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Full server compromise, allowing the attacker to read or write arbitrary files.
    *   Remote code execution, enabling the attacker to execute system commands.
    *   Data exfiltration, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information.
    *   Denial of service, potentially crashing the application or the server.
*   **Affected Jinja Component:**
    *   `Environment` class (responsible for template rendering).
    *   Template syntax parsing and evaluation (`{{ ... }}`, `{% ... %}`).
    *   Potentially global functions and filters accessible within the template context.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid passing user-controlled input directly into Jinja templates without proper sanitization and contextual escaping.
    *   Utilize Jinja's sandboxed environment (`SandboxedEnvironment`) to restrict the capabilities of the template execution environment.
    *   Implement a strict allow-list approach for allowed template constructs and variables, rather than a deny-list.
    *   Regularly audit templates for potential injection points.
    *   Consider using a templating engine with stronger security guarantees if the risk is deemed too high.

## Threat: [Security Bypass through Vulnerable Jinja Filters or Tests](./threats/security_bypass_through_vulnerable_jinja_filters_or_tests.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   An attacker identifies vulnerabilities in custom or even built-in Jinja filters or tests.
    *   They craft input that exploits these vulnerabilities to bypass security checks or introduce unintended behavior during template rendering.
    *   This could lead to information disclosure, code execution, or other security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Circumvention of intended security controls.
    *   Potential for code execution if filters are not properly secured.
    *   Information disclosure if filters leak sensitive data.
*   **Affected Jinja Component:**
    *   `filters` attribute of the `Environment` class.
    *   `tests` attribute of the `Environment` class.
    *   The implementation of individual filter and test functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test all custom Jinja filters and tests for potential security flaws.
    *   Keep Jinja and its dependencies updated to benefit from security patches that may address vulnerabilities in built-in filters or tests.
    *   Avoid creating overly permissive or complex custom filters.
    *   Consider the security implications when using third-party Jinja extensions that provide custom filters or tests.

## Threat: [Insecure Template Loading Leading to File Access](./threats/insecure_template_loading_leading_to_file_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   An attacker manipulates the template loading mechanism if the application allows user-controlled input to influence template paths or if the template loader is misconfigured.
    *   This could allow the attacker to access and render arbitrary files on the server that were not intended to be templates.
    *   If these files contain sensitive information or executable code, it can lead to significant security breaches.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure by accessing sensitive configuration files or source code.
    *   Potential for code execution if arbitrary files containing executable code are rendered as templates.
*   **Affected Jinja Component:**
    *   Template loaders (e.g., `FileSystemLoader`, `PackageLoader`).
    *   The `get_template()` method of the `Environment` class.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a secure template loader that restricts access to allowed template directories.
    *   Avoid allowing user-controlled input to directly specify template paths.
    *   Implement strict access controls on template files and directories.
    *   Sanitize and validate any user input that influences template loading.
