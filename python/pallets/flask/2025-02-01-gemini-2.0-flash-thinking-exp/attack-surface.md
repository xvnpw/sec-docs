# Attack Surface Analysis for pallets/flask

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Jinja2](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_jinja2.md)

*   **Description:**  Injecting malicious code into Jinja2 templates when user-controlled data is directly rendered without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Flask Contribution:** Flask uses Jinja2 as its default templating engine and provides functions like `render_template_string` which, if misused with unsanitized user input, directly enables SSTI vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        user_input = request.args.get('name', 'World')
        template = '<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>' # Vulnerable if 'name' comes directly from user input
        return render_template_string(template, name=user_input)
    ```
    An attacker could access `/` with a crafted `name` parameter like `/?name={{config.SECRET_KEY}}` to potentially leak the secret key or execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterize Templates:**  Avoid directly embedding user input into template strings. Pass data as variables to templates and let Jinja2 handle escaping. Use `render_template` instead of `render_template_string` with user input.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate user inputs before using them in templates, even as variables, to prevent unexpected behavior.
    *   **Autoescaping:** Ensure Jinja2's autoescaping is enabled and context-aware escaping is used where appropriate. Flask enables autoescaping by default for `.html`, `.htm`, `.xml`, and `.xhtml` extensions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal necessary permissions to limit the impact of RCE.

## Attack Surface: [Session Management Vulnerabilities (Weak Secret Key & Session Fixation)](./attack_surfaces/session_management_vulnerabilities__weak_secret_key_&_session_fixation_.md)

*   **Description:**  Weaknesses in Flask's session management, specifically related to a weak `SECRET_KEY` or improper session ID regeneration, allowing attackers to hijack user sessions.
*   **Flask Contribution:** Flask's default session mechanism relies on a `SECRET_KEY` for signing cookies. A weak or exposed `SECRET_KEY` directly undermines session security. Flask also requires developers to explicitly regenerate session IDs to prevent session fixation.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Weak Secret Key:** Using a default or easily guessable `SECRET_KEY` like `"dev"` or `"secret"`.
    *   **Session Fixation:** Not regenerating session IDs after user login, allowing an attacker to pre-set a session ID for a victim.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong `SECRET_KEY`:** Generate a strong, random, and long `SECRET_KEY`. Store it securely (environment variable, secrets management, not in code).
    *   **Key Rotation:** Periodically rotate the `SECRET_KEY`.
    *   **Session Regeneration:** Regenerate session IDs after successful authentication (e.g., using `session.regenerate()`).
    *   **Secure Session Cookies:** Ensure session cookies are configured with `httponly` and `secure` flags to prevent client-side JavaScript access and transmission over insecure channels (HTTPS required for `secure` flag to be effective).

## Attack Surface: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Running a Flask application with `debug=True` in a production environment, exposing highly sensitive debugging tools and information.
*   **Flask Contribution:** Flask's `debug=True` setting activates the Werkzeug debugger and reloader, which are intended *only* for development. In production, it exposes a dangerous interactive debugger and sensitive application details.
*   **Example:** Deploying an application with `app.run(debug=True)` or `FLASK_DEBUG=1` in a production server. Accessing an error page in this mode can reveal the debugger.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (source code, configuration, environment variables), Remote Code Execution (via debugger console), denial of service, full server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Debug Mode:** **Absolutely never** run Flask applications in production with `debug=True`. Set `debug=False` or `FLASK_DEBUG=0` in production environments.
    *   **Environment Configuration:** Use environment variables or configuration files to strictly manage debug mode settings, ensuring it's disabled for all production deployments and enabled only in controlled development/testing environments.
    *   **Production Configuration Review:** Double-check production configurations to guarantee debug mode is disabled before deployment and during maintenance.

## Attack Surface: [Blueprint Misconfiguration leading to Access Control Bypass](./attack_surfaces/blueprint_misconfiguration_leading_to_access_control_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect configuration of Flask Blueprints, specifically URL prefixing or route registration, leading to unintended access to routes or functionalities that should be protected.
*   **Flask Contribution:** Flask Blueprints are a core feature for modular application design. Misuse or misconfiguration of blueprint URL prefixes and route registrations can directly lead to unintended exposure of functionalities.
*   **Example:**
    *   Overlapping or incorrect URL prefixes in blueprints causing routes intended for administrators to be accessible to regular users.
    *   Incorrectly assuming blueprint-level access control applies to all routes within, when specific routes might be inadvertently exposed due to routing conflicts.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functionalities, privilege escalation, data breaches, business logic bypass, circumvention of intended security measures.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if sensitive functionalities are exposed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Blueprint Planning & Review:** Plan blueprint URL prefixes and route registrations meticulously to avoid overlaps and unintended exposures. Thoroughly review blueprint configurations.
    *   **Explicit Access Control:** Implement and explicitly apply access control mechanisms (e.g., decorators, middleware) to *each* route within blueprints that requires protection. Do not rely solely on blueprint-level assumptions.
    *   **Route Testing & Auditing:**  Thoroughly test and audit route access, especially across different blueprints, to ensure access control is enforced as intended and no routes are unintentionally exposed.

## Attack Surface: [Static File Directory Traversal](./attack_surfaces/static_file_directory_traversal.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfigurations in serving static files through Flask, allowing attackers to use directory traversal techniques to access files outside the intended static directory, potentially including application code or sensitive data.
*   **Flask Contribution:** Flask's `send_from_directory` function and static folder configuration are used to serve static files. Incorrect or insecure usage of `send_from_directory` without proper path sanitization can create directory traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

    app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='static')

    @app.route('/static_files/<path:filename>')
    def serve_static(filename):
        return send_from_directory(app.static_folder, filename) # Vulnerable if filename is not sanitized
    ```
    An attacker could access `/static_files/../../app.py` to attempt directory traversal and access application source code or configuration files.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (source code, configuration files, backups, sensitive data), potential for further exploitation if sensitive files are accessed.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if sensitive files are exposed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Static File Paths:** Ensure static file paths are properly configured and restricted to the intended directory. Avoid serving the entire application directory as static.
    *   **Input Sanitization & Validation (if needed):** If user input *must* be used to determine static file paths (which is generally discouraged), rigorously sanitize and validate the input to prevent directory traversal attempts. Use secure path manipulation functions.
    *   **Dedicated Web Server for Static Files:** In production, strongly consider using a dedicated web server (like Nginx or Apache) to serve static files. This provides better security, performance, and built-in protection against directory traversal in many cases. Flask should primarily handle dynamic content.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File System):** Ensure the Flask application process has minimal file system permissions, limiting the impact even if directory traversal is successful.
