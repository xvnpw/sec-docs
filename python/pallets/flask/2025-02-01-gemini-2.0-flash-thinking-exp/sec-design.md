# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python developers.
  - Enable rapid development of web applications and APIs.
  - Maintain a simple and extensible core with a focus on microframework principles.
  - Foster a vibrant and active community around the framework.
- Most important business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could impact a large number of applications built with Flask.
  - Lack of maintenance or slow security updates could lead to widespread security issues.
  - Breaking changes in the framework could disrupt existing applications and developer workflows.
  - Poor documentation or lack of community support could hinder adoption and developer productivity.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Code review process on GitHub for contributions (described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Security advisories and vulnerability reporting process (described in Flask documentation and security policy).
  - security control: Regular releases with bug fixes and security patches (visible in GitHub releases and changelog).
  - security control: Usage of Werkzeug, a robust WSGI library, for handling HTTP requests and responses (implicit in Flask architecture).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on developers to implement security best practices in their applications built with Flask.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Flask or applications built with Flask.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) of Flask codebase in CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning and management for Flask and its dependencies.
  - security control: Security focused documentation and examples for developers using Flask.
  - security control: Penetration testing or security audits of Flask framework on a regular basis.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Applications built with Flask should be able to implement various authentication mechanisms (e.g., session-based, token-based, OAuth).
    - Flask itself should not enforce any specific authentication method, providing flexibility to developers.
  - Authorization:
    - Applications built with Flask should be able to implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage access to resources.
    - Flask should provide tools and patterns to facilitate authorization implementation.
  - Input validation:
    - Applications built with Flask must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    - Flask should provide guidance and mechanisms for input validation (e.g., request parsing, form handling).
  - Cryptography:
    - Applications built with Flask may need to use cryptography for various purposes (e.g., password hashing, data encryption, secure communication).
    - Flask should integrate well with Python cryptography libraries and provide secure defaults where applicable (e.g., session management).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes:
  - Development and maintenance of the Flask framework itself.
  - Usage of Flask framework by developers to build and deploy web applications.
  - Community contributions and ecosystem growth around Flask.
- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Flask framework source code: High sensitivity - Integrity and availability are crucial to maintain trust and prevent malicious modifications. Confidentiality is less critical as it is open source.
  - Flask framework releases and packages: High sensitivity - Integrity is paramount to ensure users download and use genuine, untampered versions. Availability is also important for continuous usage.
  - Flask documentation and website: Medium sensitivity - Integrity and availability are important to provide accurate and reliable information to users.
  - User data in applications built with Flask: Sensitivity depends on the application. Flask itself does not handle user data, but applications built with it often do. Security of user data is the responsibility of application developers.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the target audience for this design document? Is it for Flask core developers, security auditors, or application developers using Flask?
  - What is the expected level of detail for threat modeling? Should it cover specific attack vectors and mitigation strategies?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements or security standards that Flask project needs to adhere to?
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported in Flask? Is there a public security policy or disclosure process?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal of Flask is to be a secure, reliable, and easy-to-use web framework for Python developers. Security is a high priority for the project.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Flask project follows secure development practices, including code review and vulnerability management. Security is primarily the responsibility of application developers using Flask.
  - DESIGN: Flask is designed as a microframework with a modular architecture, relying on external libraries for many functionalities. Deployment is typically containerized or on cloud platforms. Build process is automated using CI/CD pipelines.
