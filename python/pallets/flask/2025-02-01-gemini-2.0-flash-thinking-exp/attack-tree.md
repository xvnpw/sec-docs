## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flask Configuration Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flask_configuration_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This is a broad category encompassing vulnerabilities arising from insecure Flask application configuration. It's a critical node because misconfigurations are common and can lead to various severe attacks.
*   **High-Risk Paths within:**
    *   **Debug Mode Enabled in Production [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Information Disclosure via Debugger
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Significant
        *   **Effort:** Minimal
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:** Disable debug mode in production. Use environment variables for configuration.
    *   **Insecure Secret Key [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Session Hijacking
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical
        *   **Effort:** Moderate
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
        *   **Mitigation:** Use a strong, randomly generated secret key. Store it securely (environment variables, secrets management).
    *   **Insecure Cookie Settings [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Session Hijacking via Insecure Cookies
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical
        *   **Effort:** Minimal
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
        *   **Mitigation:** Configure cookies with `HttpOnly=True`, `Secure=True`, and `SameSite` attributes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Request Handling Vulnerabilities (Limited in Core Flask, more in extensions/application logic)](./attack_tree_paths/request_handling_vulnerabilities__limited_in_core_flask__more_in_extensionsapplication_logic_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** Denial of Service via Request Flooding (Werkzeug level, but impacts Flask) [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Attack Vector:** Denial of Service via Request Flooding
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Significant
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, use a Web Application Firewall (WAF), and consider load balancing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Jinja2 (Templating Engine) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_jinja2__templating_engine___critical_node_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Attack Vector:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Moderate to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult to Very Difficult
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid using user-controlled input directly in templates. Sanitize and escape user input if unavoidable. Use autoescaping features of Jinja2.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flask Extension Vulnerabilities (If Extensions are Used) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flask_extension_vulnerabilities__if_extensions_are_used___critical_node_.md)

        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Varies
        *   **Effort:** Moderate to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult
        *   **Mitigation:** Audit and select extensions carefully. Keep extensions updated. Monitor for security advisories.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Extension Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Flask Extensions
