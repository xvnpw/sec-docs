# Attack Tree Analysis for pallets/flask

Objective: Compromise the Flask application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Flask itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**
        *   **Critical Node: Inject malicious code into template input** (e.g., user-provided data rendered in a template)
*   **Critical Node: Leverage Flask's Debug Mode in Production**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Information Disclosure and Code Execution**
        *   **Critical Node: Access sensitive information exposed by the debugger** (e.g., environment variables, source code)
        *   **Critical Node: Execute arbitrary code through the interactive debugger console**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_templating_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents the category of attacks that target the templating engine (Jinja2 in Flask's case). If the templating engine is not used securely, it can become a major entry point for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

SSTI occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into a template that is then processed by the templating engine on the server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject malicious code into template input](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_code_into_template_input.md)

This is the specific action within the SSTI path where the attacker provides malicious input that is directly rendered by the template engine without proper sanitization or escaping. This is a common vulnerability when user-provided data is incorporated into templates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Leverage Flask's Debug Mode in Production](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_leverage_flask's_debug_mode_in_production.md)

This node represents the critical misconfiguration of running a Flask application in debug mode in a production environment. Debug mode exposes sensitive information and provides interactive debugging capabilities that can be abused by attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Information Disclosure and Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_information_disclosure_and_code_execution.md)

This path describes the consequences of running Flask in debug mode in production. The debugger exposes sensitive information and allows for arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Access sensitive information exposed by the debugger](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_access_sensitive_information_exposed_by_the_debugger.md)

When debug mode is enabled, Flask's debugger can reveal sensitive information such as environment variables, application configuration, and even source code. This information can be used to further compromise the application or its infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Execute arbitrary code through the interactive debugger console](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_execute_arbitrary_code_through_the_interactive_debugger_console.md)

Flask's debug mode includes an interactive console that allows developers to execute Python code within the application's context. If this is exposed in a production environment, an attacker can use this console to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete control.
