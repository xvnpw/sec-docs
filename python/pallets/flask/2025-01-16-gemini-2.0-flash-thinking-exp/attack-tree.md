## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Improper Route Definition (CRITICAL NODE):**
* **Description:** Flask's routing mechanism maps URLs to specific functions. If routes are defined too broadly or with insufficient constraints, attackers might access unintended functionalities or bypass authorization checks.
* **Example:** A route defined as `/user/<name>` without proper validation could allow access to sensitive information by manipulating the `name` parameter.
* **Actionable Insight:** Implement strict route definitions with specific data type constraints and thorough input validation within the route handlers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Parameter Tampering (CRITICAL NODE):**
* **Description:** Attackers can manipulate data sent to the application through URL parameters or form data. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize this input, it can lead to various vulnerabilities.
* **Example:** Modifying an `item_id` parameter in a URL to access or manipulate data belonging to another user.
* **Actionable Insight:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received through requests. Use Flask's request object to access and validate data.
**File Upload Vulnerabilities (if implemented with Flask's request object) (CRITICAL NODE):**
* **Description:** If the application allows file uploads using Flask's `request.files`, improper handling can lead to vulnerabilities.
* **Example:** Uploading malicious executable files that can be accessed and executed on the server, or uploading files that overwrite critical system files.
* **Actionable Insight:** Implement strict file type validation, size limits, and store uploaded files in a secure location outside the web root. Sanitize filenames and content. Consider using dedicated libraries for secure file handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Engine (Jinja2) Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_engine__jinja2__vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (CRITICAL NODE):**
* **Description:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into Jinja2 templates without proper escaping, attackers can inject malicious template code. This code can be executed on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
* **Example:**  A vulnerable template rendering user-provided text directly: `render_template_string('Hello, {{ user_input }}!')`. An attacker could input `{{ 7*7 }}` to execute code.
* **Actionable Insight:** Avoid directly rendering user-provided data in templates. Use Jinja2's autoescaping feature and ensure proper contextual escaping based on where the data is being used (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_session_management_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Insecure Session Storage (CRITICAL NODE):**
* **Description:** If session data is stored insecurely, attackers might be able to access or modify it. This is particularly relevant if using client-side cookies without proper security flags (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`).
* **Example:**  Storing sensitive information directly in unencrypted cookies.
* **Actionable Insight:** Use Flask's built-in secure cookie handling with the `SECRET_KEY` configuration. Ensure cookies have the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags set. Consider using server-side session storage for more sensitive data.
**Exploit Weak Session Key (CRITICAL NODE):**
* **Description:** Flask uses a secret key (`SECRET_KEY`) to sign session cookies. If this key is weak or easily guessable, attackers can forge session cookies and impersonate users.
* **Example:** Using a default or easily guessable secret key.
* **Actionable Insight:** Generate a strong, unpredictable, and unique `SECRET_KEY` for each application instance. Store it securely and rotate it periodically.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Exposure of Secret Key (CRITICAL NODE):**
* **Description:** If the `SECRET_KEY` is exposed (e.g., hardcoded in the code, stored in a public repository, or accessible through a misconfigured server), attackers can compromise session security and other security features relying on this key.
* **Actionable Insight:** Store the `SECRET_KEY` securely, preferably as an environment variable or using a dedicated secrets management solution. Never hardcode it in the application code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flask Extension Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flask_extension_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Vulnerabilities in commonly used Flask extensions (e.g., Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **SQL Injection via ORM (if using Flask-SQLAlchemy) (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Description:** If raw SQL queries are constructed using user input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious SQL code.
        * **Actionable Insight:** Regularly update Flask extensions to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Follow secure coding practices when using extensions, such as using parameterized queries with ORMs.
