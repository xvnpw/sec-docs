# Threat Model Analysis for pallets/flask

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Variable Rules](./threats/path_traversal_via_variable_rules.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates variable rules within a route (e.g., `<path:filename>`) to include path traversal sequences (like `../`). This allows them to access files or directories outside the intended scope of the application, potentially exposing sensitive information or application code.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive files, potential for arbitrary file read on the server.

**Affected Component:** `flask.app.Flask.add_url_rule`, the routing mechanism's handling of variable rules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for path variables.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided paths for file system operations.
*   Utilize Flask's `send_from_directory` helper function, which provides built-in protection against path traversal.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into a Jinja2 template, often by exploiting unsanitized user input that is directly rendered. Flask renders this template, causing the injected code to execute on the server. This could involve accessing sensitive files, executing arbitrary commands, or establishing a reverse shell.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `jinja2` module (Flask's default template engine), specifically the template rendering process where user-provided data is directly embedded without proper escaping.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Never** directly embed user input into Jinja2 templates without proper escaping.
*   Utilize Jinja2's auto-escaping feature, which is enabled by default for HTML contexts. Be mindful of contexts where auto-escaping might be disabled or insufficient (e.g., JavaScript or CSS).
*   Carefully review any custom Jinja2 filters or extensions for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Cookie Configuration](./threats/insecure_session_cookie_configuration.md)

**Description:** If the session cookie is not configured with appropriate security flags (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`), it becomes vulnerable to various client-side attacks. For example, without `HttpOnly`, JavaScript can access the cookie, making it susceptible to XSS attacks. Without `Secure`, the cookie might be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections. Without `SameSite`, it's vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, account compromise, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Affected Component:** Flask's session management mechanism, specifically the configuration of the session cookie.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Configure session cookies with the `HttpOnly` flag to prevent client-side JavaScript access.
*   Configure session cookies with the `Secure` flag to ensure transmission only over HTTPS.
*   Configure session cookies with the `SameSite` attribute (e.g., `Lax` or `Strict`) to mitigate CSRF attacks. These settings can be configured within your Flask application's configuration.

## Threat: [Weak Secret Key](./threats/weak_secret_key.md)

**Description:** Flask uses a secret key to cryptographically sign session cookies. A weak or predictable secret key makes it easier for attackers to forge session cookies, allowing them to impersonate users without knowing their actual credentials.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, potential data breaches and manipulation.

**Affected Component:** Flask's session management, specifically the signing and verification of session cookies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Generate a strong, unpredictable, and long secret key. Use cryptographically secure random number generators.
*   Store the secret key securely and avoid hardcoding it directly in the application code. Use environment variables or secure configuration management tools.
*   Rotate the secret key periodically.

## Threat: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./threats/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

**Description:** Running a Flask application in debug mode in a production environment exposes sensitive information, including the application's source code, interactive debugger, and detailed error messages. Attackers can leverage this information to understand the application's internals and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution via the debugger, easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Flask's application setup and configuration, specifically the `debug` flag.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Never** run Flask applications in debug mode in production. Ensure the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`.
*   Configure your deployment environment to explicitly disable debug mode.
