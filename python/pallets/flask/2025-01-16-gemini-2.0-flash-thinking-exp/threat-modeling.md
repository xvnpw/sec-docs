# Threat Model Analysis for pallets/flask

## Threat: [Insecure Session Cookie Configuration](./threats/insecure_session_cookie_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** If Flask's session cookies are not configured with appropriate security flags, an attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate them. The absence of the `HttpOnly` flag allows JavaScript to access the cookie, increasing the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks stealing the session. The lack of the `Secure` flag means the cookie might be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application features.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** `flask.sessions`, `flask.app.Flask.config` (session-related configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set the `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` configuration option to `True`.
        *   Set the `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` configuration option to `True`.
        *   Consider setting the `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` configuration option to `Strict` or `Lax`.

## Threat: [Weak Session Key](./threats/weak_session_key.md)

*   **Description:** Flask uses a secret key to cryptographically sign session cookies. If this key is weak, predictable, or publicly known, an attacker could forge session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users without knowing their credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data and application functionality.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** `flask.sessions`, `flask.app.Flask.secret_key`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate a strong, unpredictable, and long secret key.
        *   Store the secret key securely, outside of the application code.
        *   Rotate the secret key periodically.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

*   **Description:** If the application doesn't regenerate the session ID after a successful login, an attacker could potentially set a user's session ID before they log in. After the user authenticates, the attacker can use the pre-set session ID to gain access to the user's account.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application features.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** `flask.sessions`, session management logic within the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regenerate the session ID after successful user authentication using `session.regenerate()`.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into Jinja2 templates without proper escaping or sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious Jinja2 syntax. When the template is rendered, this injected code is executed on the server, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** `flask.templating`, Jinja2 template engine (tightly integrated with Flask).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input into templates.
        *   Use Jinja2's autoescaping feature.
        *   Use appropriate escaping filters for different contexts.

## Threat: [Werkzeug Debugger Pin Exploitation](./threats/werkzeug_debugger_pin_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** When the Werkzeug debugger is enabled (typically in debug mode), it requires a PIN for access. If an attacker can obtain the information used to generate this PIN, they can calculate it and gain access to the debugger, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
    *   **Affected Flask Component:** `werkzeug.debug` (part of the Pallets project and used by Flask's debug mode).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** run Flask applications with `debug=True` in production environments.
        *   Restrict access to development servers.
