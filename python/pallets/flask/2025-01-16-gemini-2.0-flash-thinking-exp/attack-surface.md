# Attack Surface Analysis for pallets/flask

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template directives, which is then executed on the server when the template is rendered.
    *   **How Flask Contributes:** Flask uses Jinja2 as its default templating engine. If user-provided data is directly embedded into template rendering without proper sanitization, it can lead to SSTI.
    *   **Example:** A Flask route renders a template using user input: `render_template_string('Hello {{ user.name }}', user=user_input)`. If `user_input` contains `{{config.from_mapping(os=__import__('os')).os.popen('id').read()}}`, it could execute the `id` command on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to gain full control of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly render user-provided data in templates using `render_template_string` without strict sanitization.**
        *   **Use parameterized templates and pass data as variables.**
        *   **Restrict the use of powerful Jinja2 features if absolutely necessary.**
        *   **Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful injections.**

## Attack Surface: [Incorrectly Configured Routes Leading to Unintended Access](./attack_surfaces/incorrectly_configured_routes_leading_to_unintended_access.md)

*   **Description:**  Route definitions are too broad or permissive, allowing access to functionalities or data that should be restricted.
    *   **How Flask Contributes:** Flask's routing system relies on developers defining URL patterns. Overly generic patterns or lack of proper authorization checks within route handlers can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/admin/<path:resource>` without proper authentication could allow access to any file or directory under the `/admin` path.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of data, or execution of administrative functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Define specific and restrictive route patterns.**
        *   **Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., using Flask-Login or similar libraries).**
        *   **Avoid using overly broad path converters like `<path:>` unless absolutely necessary and with strict validation.**
        *   **Regularly review and audit route configurations.**

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Debug Mode in Production](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_debug_mode_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Running a Flask application with `debug=True` in a production environment exposes sensitive information and an interactive debugger.
    *   **How Flask Contributes:** Flask's built-in debugger is activated by setting `app.debug = True`. This is intended for development but should never be enabled in production.
    *   **Example:** With debug mode enabled, error pages will display stack traces, source code snippets, and potentially environment variables, revealing internal application details. The interactive debugger allows arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise through remote code execution via the debugger, exposure of sensitive application data and configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure `app.debug = False` in production environments.**
        *   **Configure a proper logging system for production error handling.**
        *   **Use environment variables or configuration files to manage the debug setting.**

## Attack Surface: [Session Fixation](./attack_surfaces/session_fixation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into using a specific session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after they log in.
    *   **How Flask Contributes:** Flask's default session management uses signed cookies. If the application doesn't regenerate the session ID upon successful login, it's vulnerable to session fixation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a user a link with a specific session ID. If the user logs in using that link, the attacker can then use the same session ID to access the user's account.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regenerate the session ID upon successful login (e.g., using `session.regenerate()`).**
        *   **Set the `secure` and `httponly` flags on session cookies.**
        *   **Consider using server-side session storage for enhanced security.**

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Template Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_template_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Flask Contributes:** If user-provided data is rendered in templates without proper escaping, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Jinja2 provides autoescaping, but it might not be enabled for all contexts or can be bypassed.
    *   **Example:** A Flask route displays a user's comment: `render_template('view_comment.html', comment=user_input)`. If `user_input` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the script will execute in the victim's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Stealing user credentials, session hijacking, defacement of websites, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure autoescaping is enabled in Jinja2 templates.**
        *   **Use the `safe` filter with caution and only when absolutely necessary for trusted content.**
        *   **Sanitize user input before rendering it in templates.**
        *   **Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.**

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cookie Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cookie_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Session cookies or other application cookies are not properly secured, making them vulnerable to interception or manipulation.
    *   **How Flask Contributes:** Flask's default session handling uses signed cookies. If the `secure` and `httponly` flags are not set, or if the secret key is weak, cookies can be compromised.
    *   **Example:** A session cookie without the `secure` flag can be intercepted over an insecure HTTP connection. A cookie without the `httponly` flag can be accessed by JavaScript, making it vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access, theft of sensitive information stored in cookies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Set the `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` flags in the Flask application configuration.**
        *   **Use HTTPS to encrypt communication and protect cookies in transit.**
        *   **Generate a strong and unpredictable secret key for signing cookies.**
        *   **Consider setting the `samesite` attribute for cookies to prevent CSRF attacks.**
