## High and Critical Flask-Specific Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Flask Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** | An attacker injects malicious code into user-controlled data that is directly embedded into Jinja2 templates without proper escaping. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server. | Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service. | `flask.render_template_string`, `jinja2.Environment.from_string` | **Critical** | **Never directly embed user-provided data into templates without proper escaping.** Use Jinja2's automatic escaping features for HTML context. Consider using a sandboxed template environment if user-provided templates are absolutely necessary (highly discouraged). Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI. |
| **Weak Session Secret Key Vulnerability** | An attacker discovers or guesses the Flask application's secret key used for signing session cookies. This allows them to forge session cookies and impersonate legitimate users. | Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities, potential privilege escalation. | `flask.Flask.secret_key`, `flask.sessions` | **Critical** | **Generate a strong, unpredictable, and long secret key.** Store it securely (e.g., environment variables, dedicated secrets management). Rotate the secret key periodically. Consider using a more robust session management system if the built-in Flask sessions are insufficient for your security needs. |
| **Insecure Session Cookie Attributes** | An attacker intercepts or manipulates session cookies due to missing or improperly configured cookie attributes (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`). | Session hijacking, account takeover. | `flask.Flask.config` (session cookie settings) | High | **Configure session cookie attributes appropriately.** Set `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` to `True`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` to `True` (in production), and `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to `Lax` or `Strict` based on your application's needs. |
| **Debug Mode Enabled in Production** | An attacker accesses the Flask application running with `debug=True` in a production environment. This exposes sensitive information (source code, environment variables) and allows arbitrary code execution via the interactive debugger. | Remote code execution, full server compromise, information disclosure, denial of service. | `flask.Flask.run(debug=True)` | **Critical** | **Ensure `debug=False` in production deployments.** Use environment variables or configuration files to manage the debug setting. Implement proper logging and monitoring for production environments. |
| **Session Fixation** | An attacker tricks a user into using a session ID that the attacker controls. After the user authenticates, the attacker can use the fixed session ID to impersonate the user. | Account takeover. | `flask.sessions` | High | Regenerate the session ID upon successful login. Ensure the session cookie is properly configured with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. |
