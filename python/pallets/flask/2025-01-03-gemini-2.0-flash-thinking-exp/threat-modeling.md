# Threat Model Analysis for pallets/flask

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection_(ssti).md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into a Jinja2 template, which is then executed on the server by Flask. This occurs when user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, allowing manipulation of template syntax for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full server compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jinja2 template engine (integrated with Flask), specifically the template rendering process within Flask.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly embedding user-provided data into Jinja2 templates.
        *   Utilize Jinja2's autoescaping feature to automatically escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   If dynamic template generation is necessary, use a safe templating context and carefully control the variables passed to the template.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for template rendering if untrusted input is unavoidable.

## Threat: [Insecure Secret Key Management](./threats/insecure_secret_key_management.md)

*   **Description:** The Flask secret key is used to sign session cookies and other security-sensitive data managed by Flask. If this key is weak, predictable, or exposed, attackers can forge session cookies, impersonate users, and potentially decrypt sensitive information handled by Flask's security features.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, privilege escalation, unauthorized access to user accounts and data managed through Flask's session mechanism.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flask's session management (`flask.sessions`), specifically the `SECRET_KEY` configuration variable within the Flask application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate a strong, unpredictable, and cryptographically secure secret key.
        *   Store the secret key securely, preferably in environment variables or a dedicated configuration file that is not part of the version control system.
        *   Avoid hardcoding the secret key in the application code.
        *   Rotate the secret key periodically.

## Threat: [Exposure of Debug Mode in Production](./threats/exposure_of_debug_mode_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Running a Flask application in debug mode in a production environment exposes sensitive information directly through Flask's built-in development server and error handling. This includes the application's source code, configuration details, and an interactive debugger, which attackers can leverage for reconnaissance and exploitation.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential remote code execution through the debugger provided by Flask, easier identification of vulnerabilities in the Flask application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flask's application configuration, specifically the `FLASK_DEBUG` environment variable or `app.debug` setting within the Flask application instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure debug mode is disabled in production environments by setting `FLASK_DEBUG=0` or `app.debug = False`.
        *   Implement proper logging and error handling mechanisms within the Flask application for production.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into authenticating with a session ID that the attacker controls, exploiting Flask's session management. This can happen if the Flask application doesn't regenerate the session ID after successful login, allowing the attacker to impersonate the legitimate user.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities within the Flask application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flask's session management (`flask.sessions`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regenerate the session ID upon successful login and other significant privilege changes within the Flask application.
        *   Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies managed by Flask to prevent client-side script access and transmission over insecure connections.
