# Threat Model Analysis for pallets/flask

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection](./threats/route_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters within the URL. Flask's routing mechanism allows for dynamic parameters, and if these are not properly validated, attackers can inject malicious input to access unintended resources or trigger unexpected application behavior. This could involve path traversal or injecting commands.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

**Affected Flask Component:** `flask.Flask.route`, `flask.request.view_args`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all route parameters.
* Avoid directly using route parameters in file system operations or other sensitive actions without thorough checks.
* Utilize type converters in route definitions to enforce expected data types.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Cookie Configuration](./threats/insecure_session_cookie_configuration.md)

**Description:** Flask uses signed cookies for session management. If the `SECRET_KEY` configured within the `flask.Flask` application is weak or compromised, attackers can forge session cookies and impersonate legitimate users. Additionally, if the `secure` and `httponly` flags are not properly set for the session cookie by Flask's session management, it can be vulnerable to interception or client-side scripting attacks.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.

**Affected Flask Component:** `flask.session`, `flask.Flask.secret_key`, Flask's cookie setting mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use a strong, randomly generated `SECRET_KEY` and store it securely (e.g., environment variables).
* Configure session cookie flags (`httponly=True`, `secure=True` in production) appropriately, either through Flask configuration or directly when setting the cookie.

## Threat: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./threats/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

**Description:** Running a Flask application with `debug=True` configures the `flask.Flask` application to expose an interactive debugger in the browser when an error occurs. Attackers can exploit this debugger to execute arbitrary code on the server, access sensitive information, and potentially gain full control of the application.

**Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.

**Affected Flask Component:** `flask.Flask`, `debug` configuration parameter.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never** run Flask applications with `debug=True` in production environments. Ensure `app.debug = False` or the `FLASK_DEBUG=0` environment variable is set.
* Implement proper logging and error reporting mechanisms for production.

## Threat: [Blueprint Route Conflicts and Overlapping](./threats/blueprint_route_conflicts_and_overlapping.md)

**Description:** When using Flask Blueprints to structure an application, developers might unintentionally define routes that overlap or conflict within the `flask.Blueprint` instances or when registering them with the main `flask.Flask` application. An attacker could exploit this by accessing a route intended for a different blueprint, potentially bypassing security checks or accessing unintended functionality.

**Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, potential security bypasses, access to unintended resources or functionalities.

**Affected Flask Component:** `flask.Blueprint`, `flask.Flask.register_blueprint`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully plan and manage route definitions within blueprints.
* Use unique prefixes or subdomains for blueprints to avoid naming collisions.
* Thoroughly test route configurations to identify and resolve any conflicts. Flask provides tools to inspect the registered routes.

## Threat: [Incorrect HTTP Method Handling](./threats/incorrect_http_method_handling.md)

**Description:** Developers using the `@app.route()` decorator or `add_url_rule()` on the `flask.Flask` application might not correctly restrict the allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for specific routes. An attacker could leverage this by using an unintended method to perform actions they shouldn't be able to, such as modifying data via a GET request if the route handler doesn't properly validate the method.

**Impact:** Data modification, unauthorized actions, potential security breaches.

**Affected Flask Component:** `flask.Flask.route`, `methods` argument in route definition.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Explicitly define the allowed HTTP methods for each route using the `methods` argument in the `@app.route()` decorator.
* Implement proper handling for each allowed method and reject requests with other methods.
