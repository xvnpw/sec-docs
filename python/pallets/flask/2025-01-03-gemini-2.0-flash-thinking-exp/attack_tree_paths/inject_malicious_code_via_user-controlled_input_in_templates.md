## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Code via User-Controlled Input in Templates (Flask)

**Attack Tree Path:** Inject malicious code via user-controlled input in templates

**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Context:** This attack path targets Flask applications that utilize Jinja2 templating engine and directly render user-supplied data within templates without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

* **Nature:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). This occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into template directives that are then executed by the templating engine on the server.
* **Root Cause:** Failure to properly sanitize or escape user-controlled input before embedding it within a template that is subsequently rendered. The templating engine interprets the malicious input as code rather than plain text.
* **Affected Component:** The Jinja2 templating engine within the Flask application.
* **Specific Weakness:** The ability of Jinja2 to execute arbitrary Python code through its template syntax when not handled carefully.

**2. Attack Vector:**

* **User-Controlled Input:** The attacker leverages any input field or parameter that is directly incorporated into a template. This could include:
    * Form fields (text boxes, dropdowns, etc.)
    * URL parameters (GET requests)
    * Request body data (POST requests)
    * HTTP headers (less common but possible)
* **Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a payload containing Jinja2 template syntax that, when rendered, executes arbitrary Python code on the server. Common techniques include:
    * **Accessing built-in functions:**  Using syntax like `{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[2].__subclasses__()[40]('/etc/passwd').read() }}` to access and execute system commands.
    * **Manipulating objects:** Accessing and modifying object attributes or calling methods.
    * **Information disclosure:** Extracting sensitive information from the application's environment, configuration, or internal objects.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The most severe outcome, where the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Flask application.

**3. Attack Flow:**

1. **Identification of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker identifies an input field or parameter that is reflected in the application's response and potentially rendered through a template.
2. **Payload Injection:** The attacker submits a malicious payload containing Jinja2 template syntax within the identified input.
3. **Server-Side Processing:** The Flask application receives the request and processes the input.
4. **Template Rendering:** The application uses the Jinja2 templating engine to render the template, including the attacker's injected payload.
5. **Code Execution:** The templating engine interprets the malicious payload as code and executes it on the server.
6. **Impact:** The attacker achieves their objective, which could range from information disclosure to full server compromise.

**4. Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

* **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive data like environment variables, configuration details, database credentials, or internal application data.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to:
    * **Data breaches:** Stealing sensitive user data or application data.
    * **System compromise:** Taking full control of the server, installing malware, or using it as a stepping stone for further attacks.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the application or the server.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining access to other systems or resources within the network.
* **Application Manipulation:** Modifying application data, logic, or behavior.
* **Account Takeover:** Potentially gaining access to other user accounts.

**5. Why Flask Applications are Susceptible:**

* **Default Jinja2 Behavior:** Jinja2, by default, allows the execution of expressions within templates. This power, while useful for dynamic content generation, becomes a vulnerability when user input is directly incorporated without proper sanitization.
* **Developer Oversight:** Developers might not be fully aware of the risks associated with directly rendering user-supplied data in templates.
* **Complex Templates:** In complex applications, it can be challenging to track all instances where user input is used within templates.
* **Use of `render_template_string`:**  While powerful for dynamic template generation, `render_template_string` is particularly vulnerable if the template string itself is derived from user input.

**6. Real-World Examples (Illustrative):**

* **Simple Greeting:**
    * Vulnerable Code: `render_template_string("Hello, {{ name }}!", name=request.args.get('name'))`
    * Attack Payload: `{{ 7*7 }}` (evaluates to 49) or `{{ config.items() }}` (discloses Flask configuration)
* **Dynamic File Inclusion (Dangerous):**
    * Vulnerable Code: `render_template_string("You selected file: {{ filename }}", filename=request.args.get('file'))`
    * Attack Payload: `{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[40]('app.py').read() }}` (attempts to read the application's source code)

**7. Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Avoid Rendering User-Controlled Input Directly in Templates:** This is the most effective approach. If possible, avoid directly embedding user input into template directives.
* **Use Escaping:**
    * **Automatic Escaping:** Configure Jinja2's autoescaping feature to escape HTML characters by default. This prevents the interpretation of HTML tags but may not be sufficient for SSTI.
    * **Manual Escaping:** Use Jinja2's escaping filters (e.g., `|e`, `|escape`) explicitly for user-controlled data within templates.
* **Sandboxing (Limited Effectiveness):** While Jinja2 offers a sandbox mode, it can be bypassed. Relying solely on sandboxing is not recommended as a primary security measure.
* **Templating Language Choice (Consider Alternatives):** If the application's requirements allow, consider using a templating language with more restrictive features or one that automatically escapes all output. However, for existing Flask applications, this is often not a practical solution.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelist Approach:** Define a strict set of allowed characters or formats for user input.
    * **Sanitize Input:** Remove or encode potentially dangerous characters or patterns before using the input in templates.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the Flask application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful RCE attack.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While CSP won't prevent SSTI, it can help mitigate some of the consequences by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct thorough security assessments to identify potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
* **Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools:** Utilize tools that can automatically detect potential SSTI vulnerabilities in the codebase.
* **Keep Flask and Jinja2 Up-to-Date:** Ensure you are using the latest versions of Flask and Jinja2 to benefit from security patches.

**8. Testing and Detection:**

* **Manual Testing:**
    * **Fuzzing:** Inject various characters and Jinja2 syntax into input fields to see if the application interprets them as code.
    * **Payload Crafting:** Attempt to execute simple expressions like `{{ 7*7 }}` or access basic objects like `{{ config }}`.
    * **Error Analysis:** Observe error messages for clues about template rendering and potential vulnerabilities.
* **Automated Testing:**
    * **Security Scanners:** Utilize web application security scanners that include checks for SSTI vulnerabilities.
    * **Specialized SSTI Tools:** Employ tools specifically designed to detect and exploit SSTI vulnerabilities.
* **Code Review:** Carefully review the codebase, paying close attention to how user input is handled and used within templates.

**9. Specific Flask Considerations:**

* **`render_template_string` Usage:** Be extremely cautious when using `render_template_string`, especially if the template string itself originates from user input.
* **Custom Filters and Tests:** If you have implemented custom Jinja2 filters or tests, ensure they do not introduce new vulnerabilities.
* **Configuration Settings:** Review Flask's configuration settings, particularly those related to template loading and rendering.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject malicious code via user-controlled input in templates" attack path is a **high-risk vulnerability** in Flask applications that can lead to severe consequences, including information disclosure and remote code execution. Developers must prioritize secure templating practices by avoiding direct rendering of user input, implementing proper escaping mechanisms, and conducting thorough security testing. Understanding the mechanics of SSTI and its potential impact is crucial for building secure Flask applications. By adopting the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this dangerous attack vector.
