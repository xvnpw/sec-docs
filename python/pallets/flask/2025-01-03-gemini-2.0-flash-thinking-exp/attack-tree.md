## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flask-Specific Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flask-specific_vulnerabilities_[critical_node].md)

**Exploit Flask-Specific Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This represents the overall goal of targeting vulnerabilities inherent to the Flask framework itself, as opposed to general web application vulnerabilities. Success in exploiting these vulnerabilities often leads to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Engine (Jinja2) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_engine_(jinja2)_vulnerabilities_[critical_node].md)

**Exploit Template Engine (Jinja2) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Flask's reliance on Jinja2 for templating introduces the risk of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). This node signifies the attacker's focus on exploiting weaknesses within the template rendering process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection_(ssti)_[critical_node,_high-risk_path].md)

**Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * SSTI occurs when user-provided input is directly embedded into a template without proper sanitization. Attackers can inject malicious code within the template syntax, which is then executed on the server by the template engine.

    * **Inject malicious code via user-controlled input in templates [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * Attackers leverage Jinja2's syntax (e.g., `{{ ... }}` for expressions, `{% ... %}` for statements) to execute arbitrary Python code.
        * This can involve accessing internal objects and methods of the application to gain control over the server.
        * The impact is typically Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to fully compromise the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities:**
    * This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the Flask application processes incoming requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization_[critical_node,_high-risk_path].md)

**Insecure Deserialization [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * Insecure deserialization happens when the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation. Attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.

    * **Inject malicious serialized objects into the application's request [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * Flask's session management or other components might use deserialization.
        * Attackers can craft malicious payloads that, upon deserialization, lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_session_management_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities:**
    * This category focuses on weaknesses in how Flask manages user sessions, typically through cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Cookie Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/session_cookie_manipulation_[critical_node,_high-risk_path].md)

**Session Cookie Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * Flask uses signed cookies for session management. If the secret key used to sign these cookies is weak, predictable, or compromised, attackers can forge or tamper with session cookies.

    * **Tamper with the Flask session cookie to gain unauthorized access [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * If the secret key is known, attackers can create valid session cookies for any user.
        * This allows them to impersonate users, bypass authentication, and gain unauthorized access to the application's functionalities and data.
        * Attackers might modify user roles, permissions, or other session data to escalate privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Debug Mode in Production [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_debug_mode_in_production_[critical_node,_high-risk_path].md)

**Exploit Debug Mode in Production [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * Running a Flask application with debug mode enabled in a production environment is a severe security misconfiguration.

    * **Access debug information and potentially execute arbitrary code [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * When `FLASK_DEBUG=True`, the Werkzeug debugger is active. This debugger provides an interactive console that can be accessed through the browser in case of an error.
        * Attackers can utilize this debugger to execute arbitrary Python commands on the server, leading to immediate Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        * Debug mode also leaks sensitive information through stack traces and environment variables, which can aid further attacks.
