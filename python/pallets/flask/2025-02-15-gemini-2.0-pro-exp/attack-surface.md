# Attack Surface Analysis for pallets/flask

## Attack Surface: [Weak Session Secret Key](./attack_surfaces/weak_session_secret_key.md)

*   **Description:** Flask uses a secret key to cryptographically sign session cookies, preventing tampering. A weak, default, or exposed key allows attackers to forge valid session cookies.
*   **How Flask Contributes:** Flask's built-in session management *relies entirely* on the security of the `SECRET_KEY`. The framework provides the mechanism; the developer is responsible for the key's strength and security. This is a *direct* Flask responsibility.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers the `SECRET_KEY` is "changeme". They generate a signed cookie with `user_id=1` (admin), gaining administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Complete account takeover, including administrative accounts. Data breach, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Generate a Strong Key:** Use `os.urandom(24)` (or better) for a cryptographically secure random key.
    *   **Secure Storage:** *Never* hardcode the key. Use environment variables, a secrets management service (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or a config file *outside* the repository.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate the secret key.
    *   **Never Use Defaults:** Absolutely avoid example keys from documentation.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** User input is directly concatenated into a template string *before* rendering, allowing injection of Jinja2 syntax, executed on the server.
*   **How Flask Contributes:** Flask uses Jinja2 for templating. While Jinja2 is secure *when used correctly*, Flask's integration means developers must be aware of SSTI. The vulnerability is in *how* Jinja2 is used *within* Flask â€“ a direct consequence of Flask's design.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    # VULNERABLE!
    @app.route("/unsafe")
    def unsafe():
        name = request.args.get('name')
        template = "<h1>Hello " + name + "!</h1>"
        return render_template_string(template)
    ```
    `/unsafe?name={{7*7}}` results in "Hello 49!", proving code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) on the server. Complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use `render_template`:** Always use `render_template` (or `render_template_string` with a *pre-defined* string) and pass user input as *context variables*, *never* directly into the template string.
        ```python
        # Safe
        @app.route("/safe")
        def safe():
            name = request.args.get('name')
            return render_template('hello.html', name=name)
        ```
        (`hello.html`: `<h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>`)
    *   **Avoid String Concatenation:** Never build templates by concatenating user input with template code.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Templates (Autoescaping Bypassed or Disabled)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_templates__autoescaping_bypassed_or_disabled_.md)

*   **Description:** User data is rendered in a Jinja2 template without proper escaping, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser.
*   **How Flask Contributes:** Flask relies on Jinja2's autoescaping. The vulnerability arises when autoescaping is disabled, bypassed (`| safe`), or an outdated Jinja2 is used.  This is directly tied to Flask's choice of templating engine and its default configuration.
*   **Example:**
    ```html
    <!-- VULNERABLE! -->
    <p>Comment: {{ comment | safe }}</p>
    ```
    An attacker submits `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement, phishing, malware distribution, data theft (from the victim's browser).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Autoescaping Enabled:** This is the primary defense. Jinja2's autoescaping is on by default in Flask. Do *not* disable it.
    *   **Avoid `| safe`:** Use `| safe` *extremely* sparingly, and *only* after thorough sanitization with a library like Bleach.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP for defense-in-depth.
    *   **Update Jinja2:** Keep Jinja2 updated.

## Attack Surface: [Information Leakage in Error Messages (Debug Mode)](./attack_surfaces/information_leakage_in_error_messages__debug_mode_.md)

*    **Description:** Flask's debug mode provides detailed error messages, including stack traces and environment variables, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*    **How Flask Contributes:** Flask's debug mode is a *built-in feature* intended for development. It is the developer's responsibility to disable it in production, but the feature itself and its potential for information leakage are directly part of Flask.
*   **Example:** An unhandled exception in production with debug mode on reveals database credentials and file structure.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (credentials, configuration, code), aiding further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Debug Mode in Production:** `app.debug = False` or `app.run(debug=False)`. Use environment variables (e.g., `FLASK_ENV=production`).
    *   **Custom Error Handlers:** Use `@app.errorhandler` to show generic messages to users, logging details securely.
    *   **Log Management:** Configure logging to capture details without exposing them to users.

## Attack Surface: [URL Traversal / Path Manipulation (using `send_from_directory` incorrectly)](./attack_surfaces/url_traversal__path_manipulation__using__send_from_directory__incorrectly_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers manipulate URL paths to access files outside the intended directory, even when using Flask's `send_from_directory` if it is misconfigured or if the base directory is not properly secured.
* **How Flask Contributes:** While `send_from_directory` *aims* to be secure, it's a Flask-provided function, and its security depends on correct usage *within the Flask application*. The potential for misuse is directly related to Flask's API.
* **Example:** If the base directory for `send_from_directory` is set too broadly (e.g., `/`), or if symbolic links are not handled correctly, an attacker might still be able to traverse outside the intended area.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files; information disclosure.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Base Directory Selection:** Choose a *very specific* and restricted base directory for `send_from_directory`. Avoid using root directories or directories with sensitive files.
    * **Sanitize Filenames (Even with `send_from_directory`):** While `send_from_directory` provides *some* protection, it's still good practice to sanitize the filename to remove any potentially dangerous characters.
    * **Disable Symbolic Links (If Possible):** If you don't need symbolic links, disable them within the served directory to prevent attackers from using them to bypass restrictions.
    * **Regularly Audit:** Review your file serving configuration to ensure it remains secure.
