# Threat Model Analysis for dmlc/gluon-cv

## Threat: [Malicious Pre-trained Model Injection](./threats/malicious_pre-trained_model_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker replaces a legitimate pre-trained model provided or used by GluonCV with a malicious one. This could happen if the application directly uses models from GluonCV's `model_zoo` without verification or if the application's model loading process is vulnerable. The attacker could embed backdoors or biases into the model.

**Impact:** The application could produce incorrect or manipulated outputs, leading to data breaches, system compromise (if the model execution allows for code injection within GluonCV or its underlying framework), or misleading information presented to users.

**Affected GluonCV Component:** `model_zoo` module (for downloading pre-trained models), model loading functions within specific model implementations in GluonCV.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only download pre-trained models from trusted and verified sources, even within GluonCV's `model_zoo`.
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures) for downloaded model files, especially those obtained through GluonCV's functionalities.
*   Consider retraining models from scratch on trusted datasets if the application's security requirements are very high and reliance on pre-trained models is a concern.
*   Implement input and output validation to detect anomalies in model behavior that might indicate a compromised model.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on GluonCV Packages](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_gluoncv_packages.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the official GluonCV package on a distribution platform (e.g., PyPI) and injects malicious code directly into the library.

**Impact:** Potentially widespread compromise of applications using the affected version of GluonCV, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.

**Affected GluonCV Component:** The entire GluonCV library as distributed through official channels.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded GluonCV packages using checksums or signatures provided by the GluonCV project.
*   Use trusted package repositories and avoid installing from untrusted or third-party sources.
*   Employ software composition analysis tools to monitor dependencies for unexpected changes or known vulnerabilities in the specific version of GluonCV being used.
*   Pin specific versions of GluonCV in your project's requirements to avoid automatically upgrading to a compromised version.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within GluonCV Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_gluoncv_itself.md)

**Description:**  Undiscovered bugs or security vulnerabilities exist within the GluonCV library's code. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers if they can interact with the vulnerable parts of the library through the application.

**Impact:**  Can lead to a wide range of issues, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability within GluonCV's code.

**Affected GluonCV Component:** Any module or function within the GluonCV library containing the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities in GluonCV by monitoring security advisories and the project's issue tracker.
*   Regularly update GluonCV to the latest versions, which often include patches for known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input from triggering potential vulnerabilities within GluonCV's processing logic.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on your application code to identify potential interactions with vulnerable parts of GluonCV.
