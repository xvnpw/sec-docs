## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Model Loading Vulnerabilities leading to Python Code Execution via Pickle Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_model_loading_vulnerabilities_leading_to_python_code_execution_via_pickle_d_38ea5dad.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker uploads a seemingly legitimate model file through a user input mechanism (e.g., file upload). This model file is actually a malicious pickle file containing embedded Python code. When the application loads this model using `pickle.load` or a similar function without proper sanitization, the embedded code is executed, granting the attacker control over the application.
- Critical Nodes Involved:
    - Supply Malicious Model via User Input: The initial point of entry where the malicious model is introduced.
    - Malicious Model Contains Exploitable Code: The state where the model is crafted to contain malicious code.
    - Python Code Execution via Pickle Deserialization: The specific vulnerability that allows the attacker's code to run.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Data Input Processing Vulnerabilities leading to Image/Video Decoding Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_data_input_processing_vulnerabilities_leading_to_imagevideo_decoding_vulner_09215807.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker provides a specially crafted image or video file as input to the application. This file exploits a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow) in the image or video decoding library used by GluonCV (or its dependencies like OpenCV). Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- Critical Nodes Involved:
    - Exploit Image/Video Decoding Vulnerabilities: The specific vulnerability in the decoding process that is exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Dependencies of GluonCV by Identifying and Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploit_dependencies_of_gluoncv_by_identifying_and_exploiting_known_vulnerabilities.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in one of GluonCV's dependencies (e.g., MXNet, NumPy). They then craft an input or trigger a specific application functionality that utilizes the vulnerable dependency in a way that triggers the vulnerability, leading to code execution or other malicious outcomes.
- Critical Nodes Involved:
    - Identify Vulnerable Dependencies: The crucial step of discovering vulnerable dependencies.
    - Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies: The point where the known vulnerability is actively exploited.
    - Trigger Vulnerability via GluonCV Functionality: The application's code path that interacts with the vulnerable dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Exploit Dependencies of GluonCV by Supplying Malicious Dependencies via Dependency Confusion Attack](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_exploit_dependencies_of_gluoncv_by_supplying_malicious_dependencies_via_dependency__2b439dd7.md)

- Attack Vector: An attacker leverages the dependency resolution mechanism of package managers (like pip). They create a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency used by the application and upload it to a public repository. When the application's dependency manager tries to install or update dependencies, it might mistakenly download and install the malicious package from the public repository instead of the legitimate internal one.
- Critical Nodes Involved:
    - Dependency Confusion Attack: The specific technique used to inject the malicious dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 5: Exploit Misconfigurations in GluonCV Usage through Insecure Model Loading Practices](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5_exploit_misconfigurations_in_gluoncv_usage_through_insecure_model_loading_practices.md)

- Attack Vector: Developers implement insecure model loading practices, such as directly loading models from untrusted URLs without proper verification or using insecure deserialization methods on models from untrusted sources. An attacker can then provide a malicious model URL or a malicious model file that, when loaded, compromises the application.
- Critical Nodes Involved:
    - Use Insecure Model Loading Practices: The insecure coding practice that creates the vulnerability.
