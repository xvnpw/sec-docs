# Attack Surface Analysis for dmlc/gluon-cv

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Pre-trained Models](./attack_surfaces/malicious_pre-trained_models.md)

* **Attack Surface: Malicious Pre-trained Models**
    * **Description:** The application loads and uses pre-trained models from external sources or user uploads. These models could be intentionally crafted to contain malicious code or trigger vulnerabilities in the underlying deep learning framework.
    * **How GluonCV Contributes:** GluonCV provides functionalities to load pre-trained models from various sources (e.g., model zoo, local files). If the source is untrusted or the loading process is not secure, it directly introduces the risk of loading a malicious model through GluonCV's mechanisms.
    * **Example:** A user uploads a seemingly legitimate object detection model. However, the model's architecture or weights are designed to exploit a deserialization vulnerability in MXNet (the underlying framework), triggered by GluonCV's model loading process, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, or compromise of the application's infrastructure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Verify the integrity and source of pre-trained models.** Use trusted and reputable sources for model downloads.
        * **Implement checksum verification for downloaded models.**
        * **Consider using a sandboxed environment to load and inspect untrusted models before deployment.**
        * **Regularly update MXNet and GluonCV to patch known vulnerabilities.**
        * **Implement strict access controls on model files and directories.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Image/Video Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_imagevideo_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Surface: Exploitation of Image/Video Processing Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** GluonCV relies on underlying libraries (like OpenCV, Pillow) for image and video decoding and manipulation. These libraries might have vulnerabilities that can be triggered by processing maliciously crafted image or video files.
    * **How GluonCV Contributes:** GluonCV utilizes these libraries internally for tasks like image loading, resizing, and preprocessing. When the application uses GluonCV to process user-supplied images or videos, it directly utilizes these potentially vulnerable libraries.
    * **Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted PNG image that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the version of Pillow used by GluonCV. This vulnerability is triggered during GluonCV's image loading or preprocessing steps, leading to a crash or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep the underlying image and video processing libraries (OpenCV, Pillow, etc.) updated to the latest versions.**
        * **Implement strict input validation and sanitization for image and video files *before* passing them to GluonCV functions.** Check file headers, sizes, and formats.
        * **Consider using a sandboxed environment for image/video processing performed by GluonCV, especially for user-uploaded content.**
        * **Implement resource limits for image/video processing within GluonCV to prevent excessive resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Custom Layers or Operators](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_custom_layers_or_operators.md)

* **Attack Surface: Exploiting Custom Layers or Operators**
    * **Description:** If the application allows users or developers to define and integrate custom neural network layers or operators within the GluonCV framework, these custom components could contain vulnerabilities or malicious code.
    * **How GluonCV Contributes:** GluonCV provides mechanisms to extend its functionality with custom layers and operators. If the application uses these GluonCV features to integrate untrusted or poorly vetted custom code, it directly introduces a significant risk.
    * **Example:** A developer introduces a custom layer that, when invoked by GluonCV during model execution, performs an unsafe operation on user-provided input, leading to a buffer overflow or arbitrary code execution within the GluonCV processing pipeline.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Thoroughly review and test all custom layers and operators before deployment.**
        * **Implement strict coding standards and security best practices for custom components intended for use with GluonCV.**
        * **Consider using a sandboxed environment for developing and testing custom components before integrating them with GluonCV in a production environment.**
        * **Limit the ability to introduce custom code in production environments if possible.
