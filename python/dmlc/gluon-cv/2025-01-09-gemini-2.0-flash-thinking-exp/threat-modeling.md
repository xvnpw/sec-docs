## Threat: [Malicious Model Injection from Untrusted Source](./threats/malicious_model_injection_from_untrusted_source.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Model Injection from Untrusted Source
    * **Description:** An attacker could replace a legitimate pre-trained model with a malicious one by exploiting vulnerabilities in how GluonCV loads models. This could involve weaknesses in the `gluoncv.model_zoo` or the model loading functions that don't properly verify the integrity or origin of the model file. The attacker might compromise the hosting server of the intended model or trick the user into providing a malicious file that GluonCV's loading mechanisms accept without sufficient checks.
    * **Impact:** The malicious model, when loaded and used by GluonCV, could perform unintended actions such as:
        * **Remote Code Execution:** Vulnerabilities in GluonCV's model loading process or within its model processing could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        * **Data Exfiltration:** The model could be designed to send processed data or sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server during the inference process facilitated by GluonCV.
        * **Denial of Service:** The model could be crafted to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, GPU) during inference using GluonCV's functionalities, leading to application crashes or unresponsiveness.
    * **Affected GluonCV Component:** `gluoncv.model_zoo` (when loading pre-trained models), functions involved in model loading from file paths or URLs (e.g., within specific model definitions, potentially the underlying MXNet integration within GluonCV).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Verify Model Integrity:** Implement strong verification mechanisms (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for models loaded through `gluoncv.model_zoo` or custom loading functions.
        * **Secure Model Loading:** Ensure GluonCV's internal model loading functions perform robust checks to prevent the loading of malicious files. This might involve validating file formats and internal structures.
        * **Restrict Model Sources:** If possible, limit the sources from which GluonCV can load models to trusted locations.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Model Parameters or Configuration](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_model_parameters_or_configuration.md)

* **Deserialization of Untrusted Model Parameters or Configuration:**
    * **Description:** GluonCV might internally use deserialization (e.g., via pickle or similar mechanisms within MXNet integration) to load model parameters or configurations. If these serialized data structures originate from untrusted sources and GluonCV doesn't adequately sanitize or validate them during deserialization, an attacker could embed malicious code within the serialized data that gets executed when loaded by GluonCV.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Remote Code Execution:**  Executing arbitrary code on the server due to insecure deserialization within GluonCV's model loading or configuration handling.
    * **Affected GluonCV Component:** Functions within GluonCV responsible for loading and saving models or configurations, particularly those interacting with MXNet's serialization functionalities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:**  Ensure that GluonCV only deserializes model parameters or configurations from trusted and verified sources.
        * **Secure Deserialization Practices:** If GluonCV's internal mechanisms rely on deserialization, ensure that it's done securely, potentially by using safer serialization formats or implementing strict validation of the deserialized data before use. This might require contributing to or forking GluonCV to implement such changes.
