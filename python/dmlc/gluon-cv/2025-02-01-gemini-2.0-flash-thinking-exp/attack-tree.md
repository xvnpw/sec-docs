## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using GluonCV [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_gluoncv__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal. Success means the attacker achieves unauthorized access, control, or disruption of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in GluonCV Library [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_gluoncv_library__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in GluonCV code itself.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in MXNet, the underlying deep learning framework.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in other Python packages that GluonCV depends on (e.g., image processing libraries, networking libraries).
    * Impact: Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data breaches, or complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Malicious Model Injection/Loading [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__malicious_model_injectionloading__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **Target Internal/Private Model Storage [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * Gaining unauthorized access to internal model repositories (e.g., network shares, cloud storage, databases).
            * Exploiting weak access controls, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities in storage systems.
            * Using stolen credentials or social engineering to access model storage.
        * **Exploit Model Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * Crafting malicious model files that exploit vulnerabilities in the model loading/deserialization process (e.g., using pickle vulnerabilities in Python or MXNet).
            * Triggering buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, or other memory corruption issues during model loading.
    * Impact: Allows the attacker to replace legitimate models with backdoored or malicious models, leading to manipulated application behavior, data theft, or further system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Data Poisoning via GluonCV Input [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__data_poisoning_via_gluoncv_input__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **Exploit Image/Video Processing Vulnerabilities (in underlying libraries used by GluonCV) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * Crafting malicious images or videos that exploit vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs) in image/video decoding libraries like OpenCV, Pillow, or FFmpeg.
            * Triggering code execution or DoS by providing specially crafted input data.
    * Impact: Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or manipulation of model predictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Vulnerabilities in GluonCV Code or Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_gluoncv_code_or_dependencies__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in MXNet (Backend Framework) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * Targeting known vulnerabilities in MXNet, the deep learning framework that GluonCV relies on.
            * Exploiting memory corruption bugs, insecure deserialization flaws, or other vulnerabilities in MXNet.
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in other GluonCV Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in other Python packages used by GluonCV (e.g., libraries for image processing, networking, or utilities).
            * Using automated vulnerability scanners to find vulnerable dependencies.
    * Impact: Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Misconfiguration or Improper Usage of GluonCV in Application [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_misconfiguration_or_improper_usage_of_gluoncv_in_application__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **Insufficient Input Validation in Application Code [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Application Passes Untrusted Input Directly to GluonCV Functions [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

                * Allowing malicious input to reach vulnerable image/video processing libraries or model loading routines.
        * **Overly Permissive Permissions for GluonCV Components [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

                * Running GluonCV processes or the application itself with unnecessary high privileges (e.g., root or administrator).
                * Increasing the impact of successful exploits by allowing attackers to gain broader system access.
            * **Weak Access Control to Model Storage or Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * Failing to implement proper access controls to model files, configuration files, or other sensitive resources used by GluonCV.
                * Allowing unauthorized modification or access to critical components.
    * Impact: Can lead to data poisoning, application malfunction, privilege escalation, or system compromise.

                * Targeting individuals with access to critical systems, code repositories, or deployment environments.
    * Impact: Gaining access to developer/operator accounts can provide broad access to systems, code, data, and deployment pipelines, leading to significant compromise.
