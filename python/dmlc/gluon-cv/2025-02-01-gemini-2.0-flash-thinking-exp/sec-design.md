# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a comprehensive, high-performance, and user-friendly open-source toolkit for computer vision tasks.
  - Facilitate research and development in computer vision by offering readily available and reproducible implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms.
  - Foster a collaborative community around computer vision and deep learning.
- Business Risks:
  - Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or instability in the toolkit, leading to decreased user trust and adoption.
  - Reduced community contribution and slower development if the project is perceived as insecure or difficult to contribute to.
  - Supply chain risks arising from compromised dependencies, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the toolkit and user environments.
  - Legal and compliance risks if the toolkit or its components violate licensing terms or data privacy regulations (though less relevant for the toolkit itself, more for its applications).

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Review - The project is open source, allowing for community review of the code, which can help identify potential vulnerabilities. Implemented through GitHub repository visibility and contribution model.
  - security control: GitHub Security Features - GitHub provides automated security scanning features, such as dependency vulnerability scanning, which are likely enabled for the repository. Implemented by GitHub platform.
  - security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) -  Likely performed implicitly by the community and maintainers through dependency management and awareness of known vulnerabilities in used libraries. Implemented by community and maintainers.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Contributions - Security fixes and vulnerability identification largely depend on the efforts of the open-source community, which can lead to delays in addressing security issues.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Dependencies - The project relies on external libraries (dependencies) which may contain vulnerabilities that are not immediately known or patched.
  - accepted risk: Lack of Formal Security Audits - As an open-source project, dedicated and frequent professional security audits might not be performed due to resource constraints.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Automated Security Scanning in CI/CD - Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
  - security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning and Management - Implement a robust dependency management process that includes regular scanning for known vulnerabilities and automated updates to patched versions. Tools like Dependabot or similar can be used.
  - security control: Security Code Review Guidelines for Contributors - Establish and document security best practices and guidelines for code contributions to educate contributors and improve the overall security posture of the codebase.
  - security control: Security Incident Response Plan - Define a basic security incident response plan to handle reported vulnerabilities, including disclosure process and patching strategy.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the toolkit itself as it is a library. However, if the project includes associated web services (e.g., documentation website, model repository), authentication would be required for administrative access.
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, not directly applicable to the toolkit. Authorization would be relevant for managing access to associated infrastructure and resources.
  - Input Validation: Crucial for the toolkit, especially in model loading and data processing components. Implement robust input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like adversarial attacks, data poisoning, or unexpected behavior due to malformed inputs. This should be applied to data formats, model parameters, and any user-provided input that influences toolkit behavior.
  - Cryptography: May be relevant for secure storage or distribution of pre-trained models, especially if there are concerns about integrity or confidentiality. Consider using cryptographic signatures to ensure model integrity and potentially encryption for sensitive model data if applicable.
