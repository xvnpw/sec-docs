# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dmlc/gluon-cv

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verified Model Loading with GluonCV API](./mitigation_strategies/verified_model_loading_with_gluoncv_api.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Trusted Source:** Use only models from the official GluonCV Model Zoo (`gluoncv.model_zoo`) or a pre-approved, secured internal repository that mirrors the Model Zoo's structure and provides checksums.
2.  **Checksum Verification (Integrated):**  Instead of manual checksum calculation, leverage `gluon-cv`'s (potential, future) built-in mechanisms for checksum verification, *if and when they become available*.  This would ideally be part of the `gluoncv.model_zoo.get_model` function or a related utility.  *Until then, continue with the manual checksum verification described previously, but design your code to be easily adaptable to a future GluonCV-provided solution.*
3.  **Pre-trained Model Loading:** Use `gluoncv.model_zoo.get_model(model_name, pretrained=True, root=...)` to load pre-trained models.  The `root` parameter should point to a *secure, local directory* where downloaded models are stored.  *Do not* load models directly from the internet on every run.
4. **Error Handling:** Wrap the model loading call in a `try-except` block to handle potential errors, such as:
    *   `FileNotFoundError`: If the model file is not found.
    *   `RuntimeError`: If there's an issue loading the model (e.g., checksum mismatch, corrupted file).
    *   Other exceptions specific to the underlying framework (MXNet/PyTorch).
    In the `except` block, log the error, prevent further processing, and enter a safe state.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Model Substitution (Severity: Critical):**  Loading a backdoored model.
    *   **Model Tampering (Severity: High):**  Using a modified, potentially harmful model.
    *   **Untrusted Model Source (Severity: High):**  Using models from unverified locations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Model Substitution:** Risk reduced to *Very Low* (assuming GluonCV's future checksum verification is robust).
    *   **Model Tampering:** Risk reduced to *Low*.
    *   **Untrusted Model Source:** Risk mitigated by policy (using only trusted sources) and enforced by the loading mechanism.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `gluoncv.model_zoo.get_model` is used for loading pre-trained models.
    *   The `root` parameter is set to a local directory.
    *   Basic `try-except` error handling is in place.
    *   *Manual* checksum verification (as described previously) is implemented *outside* of the `gluon-cv` API calls.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Reliance on a *future*, hypothetical GluonCV-provided checksum verification feature.  The current implementation uses a manual workaround.
    *   More comprehensive error handling, specifically checking for `RuntimeError` and other potential exceptions during model loading.

## Mitigation Strategy: [GluonCV-Specific Input Preprocessing and Validation](./mitigation_strategies/gluoncv-specific_input_preprocessing_and_validation.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Use GluonCV Transforms:**  *Always* use the `gluoncv.data.transforms` module (and specifically, the `presets` submodules like `gluoncv.data.transforms.presets.yolo`, `gluoncv.data.transforms.presets.ssd`, etc.) to preprocess input data.  These transforms are designed to handle the specific input requirements of each model in the Model Zoo.  *Do not* implement custom preprocessing logic unless absolutely necessary and thoroughly vetted.
2.  **Preset Selection:** Choose the correct preset transform based on the model you are using.  The GluonCV documentation clearly indicates which preset to use with each model.
3.  **Input Type Handling:** Ensure your input data (images, videos) is in the correct format (e.g., NumPy array, MXNet NDArray, PyTorch Tensor) *before* passing it to the GluonCV transforms.  The transforms expect specific input types.
4.  **Validation *Before* Transform:**  Before applying the GluonCV transforms, perform basic validation:
    *   Check that the input is a valid image or video (using libraries like Pillow or OpenCV, but *before* any GluonCV-specific code).
    *   Check the data type and dimensions (using NumPy or the underlying framework's functions).
5. **Validation *After* Transform (Optional, but Recommended):** After applying the GluonCV transforms, you can *optionally* perform additional checks:
    * Verify that the transformed data has the expected shape and data type. This can help catch subtle errors in your input or in the transform application.
6. **Error Handling:** Wrap the preprocessing and transform calls in `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Adversarial Input (Severity: Medium):**  Subtly crafted inputs designed to cause misclassification.
    *   **Unexpected Model Behavior (Severity: Low):**  Input that doesn't match the model's expectations.
    *   **Preprocessing Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom preprocessing code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Adversarial Input:** Risk reduced to *Low-Medium*.  Using the correct presets makes it harder to craft effective adversarial examples.
    *   **Unexpected Model Behavior:** Risk reduced to *Very Low*.
    *   **Preprocessing Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced to *Very Low* by relying on GluonCV's well-tested transforms.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `gluoncv.data.transforms.presets.yolo.transform_test` is used for preprocessing.
    *   Basic input type checking (NumPy array) is performed before the transform.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No validation *after* applying the GluonCV transform.
    *   The validation logic is not consistently applied across all input endpoints.
    *   No comprehensive error handling around the transform calls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Handling of GluonCV Outputs](./mitigation_strategies/safe_handling_of_gluoncv_outputs.md)

**Description:**
1. **Output Type Awareness:** Understand the data types and structures returned by the GluonCV model's `forward` pass (or equivalent inference method). This will typically be MXNet NDArrays or PyTorch Tensors.
2. **Bounds Checking:** If the model output represents bounding boxes, class probabilities, or other numerical values, perform bounds checking to ensure the values are within expected ranges. For example:
    * Bounding box coordinates should be within the image dimensions.
    * Class probabilities should be between 0 and 1.
3. **Data Type Conversion (Careful):** If you need to convert the output data to a different format (e.g., from float32 to int), do so carefully, handling potential overflow or underflow issues.
4. **Sanitization (If Displaying/Storing):** If you are displaying the model's output (e.g., drawing bounding boxes on an image) or storing it in a database, sanitize the output to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting if displaying results in a web application). This is less directly related to GluonCV, but important for the overall application security.
5. **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors during output processing (e.g., unexpected data types, out-of-bounds values).

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Unexpected Model Output (Severity: Low):** The model might produce unexpected output due to internal errors or adversarial input.
    * **Data Type Errors (Severity: Low):** Incorrect handling of data types can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
    * **Injection Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium to High):** If the output is used in other parts of the application without proper sanitization.

* **Impact:**
    * **Unexpected Model Output:** Risk reduced to *Very Low* with bounds checking.
    * **Data Type Errors:** Risk reduced to *Very Low* with careful data type handling.
    * **Injection Vulnerabilities:** Risk depends on the specific vulnerability and how the output is used, but sanitization is crucial.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Basic conversion of model output to NumPy arrays.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * No bounds checking on bounding box coordinates or class probabilities.
    * No sanitization of output before displaying it (assuming the application has a visualization component).
    * No error handling during output processing.
