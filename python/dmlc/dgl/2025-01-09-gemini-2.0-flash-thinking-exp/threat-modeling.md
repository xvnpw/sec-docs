# Threat Model Analysis for dmlc/dgl

## Threat: [Malicious Package Installation](./threats/malicious_package_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Package Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker might create a fake DGL package or compromise the official distribution channel to trick users into installing a malicious version of DGL. This malicious package could contain backdoors or other harmful code.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service as the attacker gains control upon installation.
    *   **Affected DGL Component:**  The entire DGL installation process, affecting all modules and functionalities if the core library is compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always install DGL from the official PyPI repository using `pip install dgl`.
        *   Verify the package integrity using checksums or signatures if available.
        *   Use a virtual environment to isolate DGL installations.
        *   Employ dependency scanning tools to detect potentially malicious packages.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Malicious Graph Data](./threats/deserialization_of_malicious_graph_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Malicious Graph Data
    *   **Description:** If an application loads graph data from untrusted sources using DGL's saving/loading functions (e.g., `dgl.save_graphs`, `dgl.load_graphs`), an attacker could craft malicious graph data containing serialized objects that execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the application or server.
    *   **Affected DGL Component:**  `dgl.save_graphs`, `dgl.load_graphs`, and potentially underlying serialization libraries used by DGL (like `pickle`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid loading graph data from untrusted sources.
        *   If loading from untrusted sources is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON or protocol buffers and implementing custom loading logic instead of relying on default DGL saving/loading with potentially unsafe serialization.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Message Passing Functions](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_message_passing_functions.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Message Passing Functions
    *   **Description:** DGL allows users to define custom message passing functions. If these functions are not carefully implemented, they might contain vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, or logic errors that an attacker could exploit.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom function.
    *   **Affected DGL Component:**  User-defined message passing functions within the `dgl.nn.pytorch.conv` or similar modules, and the underlying execution engine of DGL.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom message passing functions for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing these functions.
        *   Avoid using unsafe functions or operations within custom message passing logic.
