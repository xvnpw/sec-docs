# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Facilitate and accelerate research and development in the field of graph neural networks.
  - Promote widespread adoption of Deep Graph Library (DGL) as a leading framework for graph-based deep learning.
  - Foster a vibrant and active community around DGL, encouraging contributions and support.
  - Ensure the reliability, stability, and performance of DGL for diverse applications.
  - Maintain the integrity and security of DGL to build and sustain user trust.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in DGL could lead to misuse, data breaches in user applications, and reputational damage, hindering adoption.
  - Lack of community engagement and contributions could slow down development and limit the library's growth and capabilities.
  - Performance bottlenecks or instability could discourage users and lead to the adoption of alternative frameworks.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting DGL's dependencies could compromise the library and its users.
  - Poor documentation or usability could create a barrier to entry and limit adoption by a wider audience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Open-source nature allows for community review and scrutiny of the code. Implemented in: Open Source License.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by DGL.
  - accepted risk: Risk of undiscovered security vulnerabilities within the DGL codebase itself.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce unforeseen security issues if not properly vetted.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Integrate static code analysis (SAST) tools into the development pipeline to proactively detect potential security flaws in the code.
  - security control: Establish a process for regular security audits, potentially through community contributions or dedicated security reviews.
  - security control: Define and enforce a secure release process, including code signing and checksum generation for released artifacts.
  - security control: Create a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to facilitate responsible reporting and timely patching of security issues.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the DGL library itself, as it is a software library and not a service requiring user authentication. However, authentication might be relevant for any associated services like documentation websites or community forums.
  - Authorization: Authorization is not a primary concern for the core DGL library. Access control is typically managed by the user's environment where DGL is deployed and used.
  - Input Validation: DGL must implement robust input validation for all user-provided data, such as graph structures, node features, and model parameters. This is crucial to prevent various vulnerabilities, including injection attacks and denial-of-service. Input validation should be applied at API boundaries and internal function calls where user-controlled data is processed.
  - Cryptography: While DGL itself may not directly implement cryptographic algorithms, it might rely on underlying libraries that use cryptography. If DGL handles or processes any sensitive data (e.g., in example code or utilities), ensure appropriate cryptographic measures are used for data protection in transit and at rest, according to the sensitivity of the data.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the DGL library.
  - Ensuring the availability and reliability of DGL for users.
  - Protecting the reputation of the DGL project and community.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - DGL itself does not directly handle sensitive user data. However, user applications built with DGL may process sensitive data. The integrity of DGL is crucial to prevent potential data breaches or manipulation in user applications. Compromised DGL library could lead to indirect data security risks for its users. The sensitivity of data handled by user applications depends on their specific use cases and is outside the direct control of the DGL project itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the current process for managing and patching vulnerabilities in DGL dependencies?
  - Are there any existing security audits or penetration testing performed on DGL?
  - What is the process for users to report security vulnerabilities in DGL?
  - Are there any specific security certifications or compliance requirements for DGL?
- Assumptions:
  - DGL is primarily used as an open-source library and not as a hosted service.
  - Security is a growing concern for the DGL project, and there is a willingness to improve security posture.
  - The DGL community is open to adopting recommended security controls and practices.
  - The primary deployment model for DGL is through package managers like pip and conda.
