## Mitigation Strategy: [Schema Enforcement for DGL Graph Data](./mitigation_strategies/schema_enforcement_for_dgl_graph_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define a strict schema for graph data that will be processed by DGL. This schema should be aligned with DGL's graph representation and expected data types for node and edge features.
    2.  Before creating DGL graphs from input data (e.g., using `dgl.graph`, `dgl.heterograph`), validate the input data against the defined schema.
    3.  Ensure that node and edge features are in formats compatible with DGL's tensor operations and graph algorithms.
    4.  Reject any input data that does not conform to the schema before it is used to construct a DGL graph.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unexpected Graph Structures causing errors in DGL operations (Severity: Medium)
    *   Exploitation of potential vulnerabilities in DGL's graph construction or parsing (Severity: Medium)
    *   Data incompatibility leading to incorrect results from DGL models or algorithms (Severity: Low)
*   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of errors and potential vulnerabilities arising from malformed graph data processed by DGL. Ensures data consistency for DGL operations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Assume not implemented yet in the project's DGL graph creation process)
*   **Missing Implementation:** Needs to be implemented in the data preprocessing steps, specifically before using DGL functions to create graph objects from raw data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Size Limits on DGL Graphs](./mitigation_strategies/size_limits_on_dgl_graphs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Determine the maximum acceptable size (number of nodes, edges, features) for graphs that your DGL application will process, considering resource constraints and performance requirements.
    2.  Implement checks *before* or *during* DGL graph creation to verify if the graph size exceeds these limits. This can be done by checking the number of nodes and edges before calling `dgl.graph` or `dgl.heterograph`.
    3.  If a graph exceeds the limits, prevent its creation in DGL and handle the situation gracefully (e.g., return an error, skip processing).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**

    *   Potential buffer overflows or memory issues in DGL or underlying libraries when handling very large graphs (Severity: Medium)
    *   Performance degradation of DGL operations due to graph size (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion and potential vulnerabilities related to DGL's handling of large graphs. Improves DGL application stability and performance.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented (Assume some basic size considerations are in place, but not explicit limits enforced during DGL graph creation)
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to implement explicit size checks before or during DGL graph creation, setting limits based on resource availability and performance testing with DGL.

    1.  Define valid ranges and data types for all node and edge features that will be used in DGL graphs and processed by DGL algorithms or models.
    2.  Before assigning features to DGL graph nodes or edges (e.g., using `g.ndata['feat'] = ...`, `g.edata['feat'] = ...`), validate that the feature values fall within the defined valid ranges and are of the correct data type for DGL.
    3.  Reject or sanitize feature values that are outside the valid ranges or of incorrect types before they are used in DGL graphs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify DGL graph features that are derived from user inputs or external data sources that might contain untrusted content.
    2.  Apply appropriate encoding and sanitization techniques to these inputs *before* they are assigned as features to DGL graph nodes or edges.
    3.  For text features that will be used in DGL (e.g., for node classification based on text attributes), sanitize them to prevent injection attacks if these features are later used in other contexts (e.g., displayed in a UI).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection vulnerabilities if DGL graph features are later used in contexts susceptible to injection (Severity: Medium to High, depending on usage context)
    *   Data integrity issues if unsanitized user inputs corrupt DGL graph features (Severity: Low)
*   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of injection vulnerabilities arising from user-derived data used as DGL graph features. Improves data quality within DGL graphs.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Assume not implemented yet for features specifically used in DGL graphs)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Model Signing/Verification for DGL Models](./mitigation_strategies/model_signingverification_for_dgl_models.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement a model signing process specifically for DGL models. When a DGL model is trained and saved, digitally sign it using a cryptographic key.
    2.  Before loading a DGL model (using `dgl.load_graphs` or PyTorch loading mechanisms) for inference or further training, verify its signature using the corresponding public key.
    3.  Reject loading DGL models with invalid signatures to prevent the use of tampered or malicious models in DGL applications.
