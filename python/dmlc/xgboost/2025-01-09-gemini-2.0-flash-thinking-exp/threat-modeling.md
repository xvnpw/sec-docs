# Threat Model Analysis for dmlc/xgboost

## Threat: [Malicious Model Loading](./threats/malicious_model_loading.md)

**Description:** An attacker could replace a legitimate, expected model file on the server or during transit with a crafted malicious model. When the application attempts to load this model using XGBoost's model loading function, the malicious code embedded within the model could be executed, or the model could be designed to provide consistently incorrect or biased predictions.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the application, data corruption due to incorrect predictions, manipulation of application behavior leading to financial loss or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** XGBoost model loading functions (e.g., `xgb.Booster(model_file=...)`, `xgb.load_model(...)`), potentially the prediction API if the model manipulates outputs.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic hashes) for model files before loading.
* Store model files in secure locations with restricted access.
* Regularly scan model storage for unauthorized modifications.
* Implement input validation on data used for prediction to detect anomalies that might indicate model manipulation attempts.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Malicious Input](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_malicious_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft specific input data that, when processed by the XGBoost prediction API, causes excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) or triggers computationally expensive operations within the library, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation for legitimate users, potential for infrastructure costs to increase due to resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** XGBoost prediction functions (e.g., `booster.predict()`), input data processing within the application as it interacts with XGBoost.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation and sanitization to reject malformed or excessively large inputs before they reach XGBoost.
* Set resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory) for prediction requests.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent a single attacker from overwhelming the prediction service.
* Monitor resource usage of the prediction service and implement alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in XGBoost Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_xgboost_library.md)

**Description:** Like any software, XGBoost might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the library to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, or cause a denial of service.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, information disclosure, application crash, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the XGBoost library code itself.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the XGBoost library updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to XGBoost.
* Implement a process for quickly patching or mitigating newly discovered vulnerabilities.
* Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's use of XGBoost.
