## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise data source (database, API, etc.) -> Inject Malicious Training Samples -> Exploit Training Phase:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_data_source__database__api__etc___-_inject_malicious_training_samples_-_exploit_training__1756cab1.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker successfully breaches the data source used for training the XGBoost model. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the database, API, or other systems providing the training data. Once inside, the attacker injects malicious data samples designed to skew the model's learning process, leading to biased or incorrect predictions in the deployed application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify data in storage -> Poison Existing Training Samples -> Exploit Training Phase:](./attack_tree_paths/modify_data_in_storage_-_poison_existing_training_samples_-_exploit_training_phase.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location where training data is kept (e.g., a database, file system). Instead of injecting new data, they subtly modify existing training samples. This "data poisoning" can be harder to detect than outright injection and can lead to the model learning subtle biases or vulnerabilities that the attacker can later exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain access to model storage/deployment location -> Replace Model with Malicious Version -> Exploit Model Artifacts:](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_model_storagedeployment_location_-_replace_model_with_malicious_version_-_exploit_mod_f6aa8b31.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the system or storage location where the trained XGBoost model is stored and accessed by the application. They replace the legitimate model file with a malicious version they have crafted. This gives the attacker complete control over the model's behavior, allowing them to manipulate predictions or potentially execute arbitrary code if the model loading process is vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Generate inputs designed to cause misclassification or trigger vulnerabilities -> Craft Adversarial Inputs -> Exploit Prediction Phase:](./attack_tree_paths/generate_inputs_designed_to_cause_misclassification_or_trigger_vulnerabilities_-_craft_adversarial_i_59f54abc.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts specific input data (adversarial examples) that are designed to fool the deployed XGBoost model. These inputs might appear normal but contain subtle perturbations that exploit the model's decision boundaries, causing it to make incorrect predictions. This can be achieved through manual analysis of the model or by using automated tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Control input features used for prediction -> Inject Malicious Features at Prediction Time -> Exploit Prediction Phase:](./attack_tree_paths/control_input_features_used_for_prediction_-_inject_malicious_features_at_prediction_time_-_exploit__5c19ac69.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker gains control over the input features that are fed to the XGBoost model at prediction time. This could be through compromising external data sources, exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's input handling mechanisms, or by directly manipulating user-provided input if not properly sanitized. By controlling these features, the attacker can force the model to make specific predictions that benefit them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit insecure loading of untrusted model files -> Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities -> Exploit XGBoost Library Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_loading_of_untrusted_model_files_-_exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_-_exploi_b95f258b.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application loads XGBoost model files from untrusted sources without proper security checks. An attacker provides a maliciously crafted model file. When the application attempts to load this file using functions like `xgb.Booster(model_file)`, a deserialization vulnerability in the XGBoost library is triggered. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
