# Attack Surface Analysis for dmlc/xgboost

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Malicious Model Files](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_malicious_model_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a tampered or maliciously crafted XGBoost model file that, when loaded by the application, executes arbitrary code or causes other harm.
    *   **How XGBoost Contributes:** XGBoost models are often serialized (e.g., using pickle in Python) for storage and later loading. The deserialization process, handled directly by XGBoost's loading mechanisms, can be exploited if the model file is untrusted.
    *   **Example:** An attacker replaces a legitimate model file with a malicious one that, upon being loaded by the application using `xgboost.Booster(model_file='malicious_model.bin')` or similar, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, complete compromise of the application or server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never load XGBoost model files from untrusted sources.**
        *   Implement strong integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic signatures) on model files before loading them.
        *   Store model files in secure locations with restricted access.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats if possible (though XGBoost's native format is efficient).
        *   Regularly scan model storage for unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in XGBoost Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_xgboost_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in libraries that XGBoost directly depends on (e.g., specific versions of NumPy or SciPy with known flaws) are exploited during XGBoost operations.
    *   **How XGBoost Contributes:** XGBoost relies on these libraries for core functionalities like numerical computations and data handling. If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, XGBoost's usage can trigger them.
    *   **Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability in a specific version of NumPy is triggered when XGBoost processes a particular data structure using that vulnerable NumPy function.
    *   **Impact:** Range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep XGBoost and its direct dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.
        *   Regularly scan the project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security auditing tools.
        *   Follow security advisories for XGBoost and its dependencies and apply patches promptly.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Objective Functions or Evaluation Metrics](./attack_surfaces/custom_objective_functions_or_evaluation_metrics.md)

*   **Description:** If the application utilizes custom objective functions or evaluation metrics provided to XGBoost, vulnerabilities within this custom code can be exploited during XGBoost's execution.
    *   **How XGBoost Contributes:** XGBoost directly executes the provided custom functions during the training or evaluation process. If these functions contain security flaws, XGBoost's execution of them becomes the attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A custom objective function contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code that is executed within the XGBoost training process, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or system resources.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service within the XGBoost training or evaluation context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing users to provide arbitrary code for objective functions or evaluation metrics if possible.
        *   If custom code is necessary, implement strict sandboxing and input validation for these functions.
        *   Thoroughly review and test any custom objective functions or evaluation metrics for security vulnerabilities before deploying them with XGBoost.
