# Threat Model Analysis for dmlc/xgboost

## Threat: [Training Data Poisoning](./threats/training_data_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the data sources used for training the XGBoost model. They inject malicious data points or modify existing data to introduce bias or cause the model to learn incorrect patterns. This could be done by compromising data pipelines, databases, or data collection processes.
*   **Impact:** The trained model becomes inaccurate, biased, or performs actions favorable to the attacker. This can lead to incorrect predictions, misclassification, or system manipulation depending on the application's use of the model. For example, a fraud detection system could be trained to miss fraudulent transactions.
*   **XGBoost Component Affected:** Training Module (specifically data loading and processing stages before training algorithms like `xgboost.train` or scikit-learn API wrappers).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust data validation and sanitization at data ingestion points.
    *   Use trusted and verified data sources.
    *   Monitor data pipelines for anomalies and unauthorized modifications.
    *   Employ data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for training datasets.
    *   Consider using anomaly detection techniques on training data to identify potential poisoning attempts.

## Threat: [Exploiting XGBoost Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_xgboost_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the XGBoost library itself or its dependencies (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, pandas). This could be through crafted input data, malicious model files, or by triggering specific code paths in vulnerable versions of XGBoost.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, or other security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Full system compromise is possible in severe cases.
*   **XGBoost Component Affected:** Core XGBoost Library (various modules depending on the vulnerability, could be in parsing, training, or inference code).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible), High (for other vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep XGBoost library and all its dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
    *   Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for XGBoost and its dependencies.
    *   Perform security testing and code reviews of the application and its XGBoost integration.
    *   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent exploitation through crafted inputs.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of XGBoost Models](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_xgboost_models.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into a serialized XGBoost model file. If the application loads and deserializes this tampered model without proper validation, the malicious code can be executed during the deserialization process.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise, data breaches, and other severe security consequences.
*   **XGBoost Component Affected:** Model Serialization/Deserialization (`xgboost.Booster.save_model`, `xgboost.Booster.load_model` or pickle/joblib if used indirectly).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only load XGBoost models from trusted and verified sources.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures, checksums) for serialized model files to detect tampering.
    *   Avoid deserializing models from untrusted or external sources if possible.
    *   If deserialization from external sources is necessary, implement robust validation and sandboxing during the process.
    *   Regularly audit model storage and access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of model files.
