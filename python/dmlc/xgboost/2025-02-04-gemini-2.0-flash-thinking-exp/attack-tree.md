## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XGBoost Library Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xgboost_library_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting weaknesses directly within the XGBoost library's code.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution or denial of service.
    *   Requires in-depth knowledge of XGBoost internals or discovery of publicly known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Injecting malicious code into the application's process via XGBoost.
    *   Aiming for full system compromise or control over the application.
    *   Often involves exploiting memory safety issues or insecure deserialization practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Flaws (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafting malicious model files or configuration data that, when deserialized by XGBoost, execute arbitrary code.
    *   Leveraging vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries or improper handling of deserialization processes within XGBoost.
    *   Can be triggered by loading a malicious model file provided by an attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflowmemory_corruption__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Providing specially crafted input data to XGBoost that causes a buffer overflow or memory corruption in its C++ core.
    *   Exploiting memory safety vulnerabilities in XGBoost's data processing or algorithm implementations.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to code execution, denial of service, or system instability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Input Data to XGBoost (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_input_data_to_xgboost__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafting malicious or adversarial input data to influence XGBoost's predictions in a way that benefits the attacker.
    *   Exploiting the model's inherent vulnerabilities to input manipulation.
    *   Can bypass intended application logic or cause incorrect and potentially harmful actions based on flawed predictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Adversarial Examples (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/adversarial_examples__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Subtly modifying input features to cause XGBoost to make incorrect predictions.
    *   Exploiting the model's sensitivity to specific input perturbations.
    *   Can be used for evasion (avoiding detection) or targeted manipulation of predictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Evasion Attacks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/evasion_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafting inputs designed to evade detection by a classification model (e.g., spam filter, fraud detection).
    *   Making malicious inputs appear benign to the model, allowing them to bypass security measures.
    *   Often involves understanding the model's decision boundaries and feature importance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Targeted Attacks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/targeted_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafting inputs to force XGBoost to make a specific, attacker-desired prediction.
    *   Manipulating the model's output to trigger specific actions within the application logic.
    *   Requires more precise control over input features to achieve a targeted outcome.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of XGBoost (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_xgboost__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting vulnerabilities in libraries that XGBoost relies upon (e.g., `libstdc++`, `OpenMP`).
    *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application.
    *   Dependency vulnerabilities can be easier to find and exploit if dependencies are outdated or unpatched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Focusing on exploiting specific vulnerabilities within XGBoost's dependencies.
    *   Leveraging publicly available exploits or developing new exploits for known dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to code execution, denial of service, or other forms of compromise depending on the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Directly exploiting identified vulnerabilities in XGBoost's dependencies.
    *   Using readily available exploits or crafting custom exploits.
    *   Impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, but can be severe.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Model (Model Poisoning/Replacement) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_model__model_poisoningreplacement___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Replacing the legitimate XGBoost model used by the application with a malicious model controlled by the attacker.
    *   Requires the application to load models from an insecure source or lack proper model validation.
    *   Allows the attacker to completely control the model's behavior and potentially the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Model Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_model_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Injecting a malicious model into the application's model loading process.
    *   Bypassing any model validation or integrity checks in place.
    *   Can be achieved if the application loads models from untrusted sources or lacks proper security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Backdoored Model (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/backdoored_model__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Replacing the legitimate model with a model that appears normal but contains a hidden backdoor.
    *   The backdoored model behaves as expected under normal inputs but can be triggered to perform malicious actions with specific, attacker-controlled inputs.
    *   Difficult to detect without specific backdoor detection techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trojaned Model (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/trojaned_model__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Replacing the legitimate model with a model that has been modified to perform malicious actions alongside its intended functionality.
    *   The trojaned model performs its normal tasks but also executes malicious code or actions in the background.
    *   Can be used for data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or other malicious purposes.
