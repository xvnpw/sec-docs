# Attack Surface Analysis for dmlc/xgboost

## Attack Surface: [Training Data Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/training_data_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker intentionally introduces malicious data points into the training dataset to manipulate the model's behavior, causing incorrect predictions or biased outcomes.
*   **How XGBoost Contributes:** XGBoost's complexity and sensitivity to training data make it susceptible to subtle poisoning attacks that are difficult to detect.  The iterative nature of gradient boosting *amplifies* the impact of poisoned data, making it a *direct* XGBoost concern. Small changes in data can lead to significant changes in tree structure and split points.
*   **Example:** An attacker adds fraudulent transactions labeled as legitimate to a fraud detection model's training data, causing the model to misclassify future fraudulent transactions.
*   **Impact:**  Compromised model accuracy, leading to incorrect decisions, financial losses, reputational damage, or security breaches.  Targeted misclassifications can be particularly damaging.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Provenance and Auditing:**  Maintain a clear record of data sources and implement rigorous auditing procedures.
    *   **Data Sanitization and Validation:**  Strict input validation and sanitization *before* training. Check for data type consistency, range limits, and outlier detection.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Use anomaly detection techniques to identify and remove potentially malicious data points.
    *   **Robust Training Techniques:** Explore robust loss functions (e.g., Huber loss).
    *   **Differential Privacy:**  Consider using differential privacy techniques during training (trade-off with accuracy).
    *   **Regular Retraining:**  Retrain frequently with fresh, validated data.
    *   **Ensemble Methods:** Use multiple models trained on different subsets of the data.

## Attack Surface: [Adversarial Examples (Evasion Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/adversarial_examples__evasion_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker crafts small, often imperceptible, perturbations to legitimate input data at inference time, causing the model to misclassify the input.
*   **How XGBoost Contributes:** The tree-based structure and decision boundaries of XGBoost models are *directly* exploitable by specific adversarial attack techniques.  Attackers can leverage the gradient information (even though it's not directly exposed like in neural networks) to find optimal perturbations that flip decision paths within the trees. This is a *direct* consequence of XGBoost's algorithm.
*   **Example:**  An attacker slightly modifies the pixel values of an image to cause an image recognition model (built with XGBoost) to misclassify it.
*   **Impact:**  Bypassing security systems, incorrect classifications, manipulation of application behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Adversarial Training:**  Train the model on a dataset that includes adversarial examples.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Can help detect *some* adversarial examples, but not a complete solution.
    *   **Feature Squeezing:**  Reduce the dimensionality or complexity of the input space.
    *   **Ensemble Methods:**  Use multiple models and check for consistency.
    *   **Gradient Masking/Regularization:** Techniques to make gradient estimation harder for attackers.

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Model Loading (Model Deserialization)](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_model_loading__model_deserialization_.md)

*   **Description:**  Loading an XGBoost model from an untrusted source can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **How XGBoost Contributes:** XGBoost's reliance on serialization formats like pickle (or similar) for model persistence is the *direct* cause of this vulnerability.  The deserialization process itself, as implemented by XGBoost (or its underlying libraries), is the attack vector.
*   **Example:**  An attacker uploads a malicious model file.  When loaded, it executes arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Load Untrusted Models:**  Only load models from trusted, authenticated, and verified sources.
    *   **Secure Model Repository:**  Use a secure repository with access controls and integrity checks.
    *   **Digital Signatures:**  Digitally sign models and verify the signature before loading.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Load and execute models in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Safer Serialization (If Possible):** Explore alternative serialization formats (may impact compatibility).
