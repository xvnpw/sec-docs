# Threat Model Analysis for dmlc/xgboost

## Threat: [Malicious Model Substitution](./threats/malicious_model_substitution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate XGBoost model file (e.g., `.bin`, `.json`, `.ubj`) with a crafted malicious model.  The malicious model is designed to produce incorrect predictions, potentially favoring the attacker, or to cause a denial of service. This threat directly targets the model file loaded by XGBoost.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Incorrect predictions leading to financial losses, incorrect business decisions, or compromised system behavior.
        *   Potential for denial-of-service if the malicious model is designed to consume excessive resources.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected XGBoost Component:** `Booster.load_model()` (and related loading functions like `load_rabit_checkpoint` if used), file system access (but the *core* threat is the substitution of the file *read by* XGBoost).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) to verify the model's integrity before loading. Compare against a securely stored, known-good hash.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Sign the model file with a private key; verify the signature with the corresponding public key before loading.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store the model in a secure location with restricted access (e.g., access-controlled cloud storage, secure file system with strict permissions).
        *   **Least Privilege:** The application should have read-only access to the model file.
        *   **Immutable Infrastructure:** If possible, use immutable infrastructure where the model file is part of a read-only image.

## Threat: [Model Poisoning (Training Data Poisoning)](./threats/model_poisoning__training_data_poisoning_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the training data *before* model creation. They inject carefully crafted data points that subtly alter the model's behavior, causing it to make incorrect predictions in specific, attacker-chosen scenarios. This directly impacts the resulting XGBoost model.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Incorrect predictions for specific inputs, potentially leading to targeted attacks or biased outcomes.
        *   Undermined model accuracy and reliability.
        *   Difficult to detect without careful monitoring and analysis.
    *   **Affected XGBoost Component:** The entire training process (data preprocessing, feature engineering, `xgboost.train()`, `DMatrix` creation).  This affects the *creation* of the XGBoost model.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Provenance and Integrity:** Maintain a verifiable audit trail of the training data's origin and transformations. Use strong integrity checks (hashing).
        *   **Data Sanitization and Validation:** Rigorously sanitize and validate training data. Use anomaly detection, outlier removal, and input validation techniques.
        *   **Secure Training Environment:** Train models in a secure, isolated environment with restricted access.
        *   **Adversarial Training:** Explore adversarial training techniques to improve model robustness against poisoned data.
        *   **Model Monitoring (Post-Deployment):** Continuously monitor model performance for unexpected behavior that might indicate poisoning.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted input data designed to cause the XGBoost model to consume excessive CPU or memory during prediction. This could involve inputs that trigger deep tree traversal or other computationally expensive operations *within the XGBoost prediction logic*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial-of-service (DoS) for the application.
        *   System instability.
        *   Potential for cascading failures.
    *   **Affected XGBoost Component:** `Booster.predict()` (and related prediction functions), internal tree traversal logic. This is a direct attack on the *runtime behavior* of XGBoost.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate and sanitize all input data. Enforce limits on feature values, ranges, and the number of features.  This is crucial to prevent triggering worst-case performance within XGBoost.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set resource limits (CPU time, memory) on the process running the XGBoost model.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for prediction calls.
        *   **Load Testing:** Perform thorough load testing with various input scenarios to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Threat: [Exploitation of XGBoost Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_xgboost_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the XGBoost library itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, code injection, or deserialization vulnerability). This is a direct attack on the XGBoost code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application.
        *   System compromise.
        *   Data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected XGBoost Component:** Potentially any part of the XGBoost library, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep XGBoost Updated:** Regularly update the XGBoost library to the latest version. This is the *primary* defense.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and track dependencies, including XGBoost, and alert on known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the least necessary privileges.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider running the model prediction component in a sandboxed environment (e.g., containerization, virtual machine).
