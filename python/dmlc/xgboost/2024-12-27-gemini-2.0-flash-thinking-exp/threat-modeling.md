## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving XGBoost

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected XGBoost Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Data Poisoning** | An attacker injects or modifies training data to manipulate the model's behavior. This could involve adding fake data points, altering existing ones, or changing labels. | The trained model will be biased or inaccurate, leading to incorrect predictions and potentially harmful outcomes depending on the application's purpose. | **Training API (e.g., `xgboost.train`, `Booster.update`)**, **Data loading functions (e.g., `DMatrix` constructor)** | High | - **Data Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict checks on training data for anomalies, inconsistencies, and malicious patterns before feeding it to XGBoost. - **Data Provenance Tracking:** Maintain a clear audit trail of data sources and transformations. - **Regular Model Evaluation:** Continuously monitor model performance on a held-out, trusted dataset to detect deviations. - **Input Sanitization for Prediction:** Sanitize and validate input data used for predictions to prevent manipulation that could exploit model vulnerabilities trained on poisoned data. |
| **Model Tampering** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to a trained XGBoost model file and modifies its parameters or structure. | The modified model will produce incorrect or biased predictions, potentially leading to application malfunction or exploitation. In severe cases, the model could be altered to cause denial of service. | **Model Saving/Loading functions (e.g., `Booster.save_model`, `xgboost.Booster`)**, **Serialized model file format (`.model`)** | High | - **Secure Model Storage:** Store trained models in secure locations with appropriate access controls (e.g., file system permissions, encryption at rest). - **Model Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of loaded models (e.g., using cryptographic hashes or digital signatures). - **Model Signing:** Digitally sign trained models to ensure their authenticity and prevent unauthorized modifications. - **Regular Model Auditing:** Periodically review and audit trained models for unexpected changes or anomalies. |
| **Model Substitution (Spoofing)** | An attacker replaces a legitimate trained XGBoost model with a malicious one. | The application will use the attacker's model, leading to potentially harmful or unintended consequences. This could range from incorrect predictions to the execution of malicious code if the loading process is vulnerable. | **Model Loading functions (e.g., `xgboost.Booster`)**, **Model storage locations** | High | - **Secure Model Storage:** As above. - **Model Integrity Checks:** As above. - **Model Signing:** As above. - **Centralized Model Management:** Implement a secure and controlled process for managing and deploying models. |
| **Code Execution through Model Loading (Deserialization Vulnerability)** | In a highly unlikely scenario, a vulnerability in the model loading process could be exploited by a specially crafted model file to execute arbitrary code on the server. | Complete compromise of the server hosting the application. The attacker gains full control over the system. | **Model Loading functions (e.g., `xgboost.Booster`)**, **Serialization/Deserialization mechanisms within XGBoost** | Critical | - **Trustworthy Model Sources:** Only load models from trusted and verified sources. - **Sandboxing:** If possible, run the XGBoost prediction process in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities. - **Regular Updates:** Keep XGBoost updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. - **Input Sanitization for Model Loading (if applicable):** While less common, if there are any configurable aspects during model loading, sanitize those inputs. |
