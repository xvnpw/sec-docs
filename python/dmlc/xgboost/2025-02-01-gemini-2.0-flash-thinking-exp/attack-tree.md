## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XGBoost Library Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xgboost_library_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting inherent bugs or weaknesses within the XGBoost library itself.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Exploit Specific Functionality (e.g., Tree Parsing, Feature Handling) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** Targeting specific parts of XGBoost's code, like how it parses decision trees or handles features, to trigger vulnerabilities.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Achieve Code Execution or Denial of Service [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The ultimate goal of exploiting library vulnerabilities.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Full system compromise (RCE), Service disruption (DoS).
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** Gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Complete control over the application and server, data breaches, system takeover.
        *   **Examples:** Buffer Overflow Exploitation, Integer Overflow Exploitation, Deserialization Vulnerabilities (less direct in core XGBoost, but possible in extensions).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** Making the application or XGBoost service unavailable.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Service disruption, loss of availability, business impact.
        *   **Examples:** Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory), Crashing the XGBoost process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_deserialization_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the process of loading and deserializing XGBoost models, especially when models come from untrusted sources.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Application Loads Model from User Upload [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The application allows users to upload XGBoost models.
        *   **Risk:**  If model deserialization is vulnerable, malicious users can upload crafted models to exploit the application.
    *   **Pickle Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using Pickle for model persistence) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** Using Python's `pickle` library to load XGBoost models from files. `pickle` is known to be insecure when loading data from untrusted sources.
        *   **Risk:**  Attackers can craft malicious pickled models that execute arbitrary code when loaded by the application.
    *   **Achieve Code Execution or Model Manipulation [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The goals of exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **Potential Impact:**
            *   **Code Execution via Deserialization [CRITICAL]:**  RCE through malicious model loading.
            *   **Model Corruption/Backdooring [CRITICAL]:**  Altering the model's behavior for malicious purposes, leading to incorrect predictions, security bypasses, or backdoors.
