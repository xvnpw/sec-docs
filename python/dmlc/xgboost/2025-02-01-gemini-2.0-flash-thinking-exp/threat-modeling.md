# Threat Model Analysis for dmlc/xgboost

## Threat: [Model Poisoning (Training Data Tampering)](./threats/model_poisoning__training_data_tampering_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious or biased data into the training dataset before the XGBoost model is trained. This can be done by compromising data sources or manipulating training data. The attacker aims to skew the model's learning process to produce desired malicious outcomes during prediction, such as misclassifying specific inputs or biasing predictions in a certain direction.

**Impact:** Compromised model accuracy, biased predictions leading to incorrect or harmful application behavior, potential for targeted misclassification, undermining the application's intended functionality and trustworthiness.

**XGBoost Component Affected:** Training Module (data loading and processing stages).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for training data.
* Establish secure data pipelines and access controls for training data sources.
* Monitor training data sources for anomalies and unexpected changes.
* Use data integrity checks (e.g., checksums) to verify data authenticity.

## Threat: [Input Data Tampering (Prediction Time)](./threats/input_data_tampering__prediction_time_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the input features provided to the XGBoost model at prediction time. This can be achieved by intercepting API requests or modifying user inputs. The attacker crafts malicious input data to force the model to produce a specific, attacker-desired prediction, potentially bypassing security controls or gaining unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Bypassing intended application logic and security controls, gaining unauthorized access to resources or functionalities, triggering unintended actions based on manipulated predictions, potentially leading to financial loss or system compromise.

**XGBoost Component Affected:** Prediction Module (input data processing stage).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for prediction inputs.
* Use schema validation to ensure input data conforms to expected formats.
* Apply rate limiting and input size restrictions to prevent abuse.
* Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to prediction endpoints.

## Threat: [Model Parameter Tampering (Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities)](./threats/model_parameter_tampering__serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the process of serializing and deserializing XGBoost models. If model files are stored insecurely or loaded from untrusted sources, an attacker can replace a legitimate model file with a malicious one. This malicious model can contain backdoors, altered prediction logic, or trigger vulnerabilities during deserialization, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Compromised model integrity leading to unpredictable or malicious model behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution if deserialization vulnerabilities are exploited, data breaches, system compromise, and loss of control over the application's ML functionality.

**XGBoost Component Affected:** Model Serialization/Deserialization functions (`save_model`, `load_model`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely store serialized model files with appropriate access controls.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures, checksums) for serialized model files.
* Load models only from trusted sources and secure storage locations.
* Regularly update XGBoost library to patch potential serialization/deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Model Deserialization Bomb](./threats/model_deserialization_bomb.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted serialized XGBoost model file. When the application attempts to load this model, it triggers excessive resource consumption (memory, CPU) due to the way the malicious model is structured. This can lead to a denial of service, making the application unavailable.

**Impact:** Application crash, service unavailability, resource exhaustion on the server attempting to load the malicious model, potentially requiring system restart and recovery efforts.

**XGBoost Component Affected:** Model Deserialization functions (`load_model`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Load models only from trusted sources and secure storage locations.
* Implement size limits for serialized model files to prevent excessively large models from being loaded.
* Implement resource limits (e.g., memory allocation limits) during model deserialization.

## Threat: [Native Code Vulnerabilities in XGBoost (C++ Core)](./threats/native_code_vulnerabilities_in_xgboost__c++_core_.md)

**Description:** XGBoost's core is written in C++, which is susceptible to memory safety vulnerabilities. Undiscovered vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or use-after-free might exist in XGBoost's native code. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running XGBoost, potentially gaining full system control.

**Impact:** System compromise, arbitrary code execution on the server running XGBoost, data breaches, complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**XGBoost Component Affected:** XGBoost C++ Core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep XGBoost library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
* Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for XGBoost.
* Employ robust input validation and sanitization to prevent unexpected data from reaching the native code.
