### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Deserialization KeyError due to Missing Currency Field

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload intended for deserialization using `djmoney.serializers.Deserializer`.
    2. This payload targets a Django model that utilizes `MoneyField`.
    3. The crafted JSON omits the expected currency field associated with a `MoneyField` within the `fields` section of the JSON object. For example, if there is a `MoneyField` named `amount`, the corresponding currency field `amount_currency` is intentionally missing from the JSON.
    4. When `Deserializer` processes this payload, it attempts to access the currency value using `obj["fields"][get_currency_field_name(field_name, field)]` within the loop handling `MoneyField` deserialization.
    5. Because the currency field is missing in `obj["fields"]`, a `KeyError` exception is raised during deserialization.

* Impact:
    - Application instability: The `KeyError` during deserialization can lead to uncaught exceptions, potentially halting the deserialization process and disrupting application functionality that relies on data deserialization.
    - Data integrity issues: If deserialization fails due to this error, data might not be processed or loaded correctly, leading to inconsistent application state and potential data integrity problems.
    - Unexpected behavior: Services or functionalities dependent on deserializing data in this format will fail, leading to unpredictable application behavior from an external attacker perspective.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly accesses the currency field from the `obj["fields"]` dictionary without checking for key existence, leading to the vulnerability.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: Before accessing `obj["fields"][get_currency_field_name(field_name, field)]`, the code should check if the currency field key exists in the `obj["fields"]` dictionary.
    - Error handling: Implement proper error handling to catch the potential `KeyError` exception. Instead of crashing or halting deserialization, the deserializer should gracefully handle the missing currency field, possibly by logging an error, skipping the problematic field, or using a default currency if appropriate for the application's logic (though default currency might not always be secure depending on context).

* Preconditions:
    - The application must be using `djmoney.serializers.Deserializer` to deserialize data from an external source (e.g., processing data from API requests, file uploads, or external data feeds).
    - The data being deserialized must potentially contain `MoneyField` instances.
    - An attacker must have control over the JSON payload that is being deserialized.

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    File: /code/djmoney/serializers.py
    Content:
    ...
    def Deserializer(stream_or_string, **options):  # noqa
        ...
        for obj in json.loads(stream_or_string):
            ...
            for field_name, field_value in obj["fields"].items():
                ...
                field = Model._meta.get_field(field_name)
                if isinstance(field, MoneyField) and field_value is not None:
                    money_fields[field_name] = Money(
                        field_value, obj["fields"][get_currency_field_name(field_name, field)] # Potential KeyError here
                    )
                ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability exists in the line where `Money` object is instantiated within the `Deserializer` function.
    - `obj["fields"][get_currency_field_name(field_name, field)]` attempts to retrieve the currency code from the `obj["fields"]` dictionary using the key generated by `get_currency_field_name`.
    - If the attacker crafts a JSON payload where the currency field (e.g., `amount_currency`) is deliberately omitted from the `fields` dictionary, accessing it directly using `obj["fields"][...]` will result in a `KeyError`.
    - There is no check to ensure the currency field key exists in `obj["fields"]` before attempting to access it.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a Django model (`TestModel`) with a `MoneyField`.
    2. Create a view or management command that uses `djmoney.serializers.Deserializer` to deserialize JSON data into instances of `TestModel`. This simulates a scenario where the application processes external data.
    3. Construct a malicious JSON payload as a string. This payload should represent a serialized `TestModel` instance, including the amount for the `MoneyField`, but crucially, **omit** the corresponding currency field.
        ```json
        [
          {
            "model": "testapp.testmodel",
            "pk": 1,
            "fields": {
              "money": "10.00"
            }
          }
        ]
        ```
        In this example, if the `MoneyField` in `TestModel` is named `money`, then `money_currency` field is missing.
    4. Feed this malicious JSON payload to the deserialization function in your test view or command.
    5. Assert that a `DeserializationError` is raised, and that the cause of the `DeserializationError` is indeed a `KeyError` originating from the `Deserializer` attempting to access the missing currency field.
