### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities, detailing their descriptions, impacts, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and security test cases.

#### 1. Deserialization KeyError due to Missing Currency Field

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload intended for deserialization using `djmoney.serializers.Deserializer`.
    2. This payload targets a Django model that utilizes `MoneyField`.
    3. The crafted JSON omits the expected currency field associated with a `MoneyField` within the `fields` section of the JSON object. For example, if there is a `MoneyField` named `amount`, the corresponding currency field `amount_currency` is intentionally missing from the JSON.
    4. When `Deserializer` processes this payload, it attempts to access the currency value using `obj["fields"][get_currency_field_name(field_name, field)]` within the loop handling `MoneyField` deserialization.
    5. Because the currency field is missing in `obj["fields"]`, a `KeyError` exception is raised during deserialization.

* **Impact:**
    - Application instability: The `KeyError` during deserialization can lead to uncaught exceptions, potentially halting the deserialization process and disrupting application functionality that relies on data deserialization.
    - Data integrity issues: If deserialization fails due to this error, data might not be processed or loaded correctly, leading to inconsistent application state and potential data integrity problems.
    - Unexpected behavior: Services or functionalities dependent on deserializing data in this format will fail, leading to unpredictable application behavior from an external attacker perspective.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly accesses the currency field from the `obj["fields"]` dictionary without checking for key existence, leading to the vulnerability.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation: Before accessing `obj["fields"][get_currency_field_name(field_name, field)]`, the code should check if the currency field key exists in the `obj["fields"]` dictionary.
    - Error handling: Implement proper error handling to catch the potential `KeyError` exception. Instead of crashing or halting deserialization, the deserializer should gracefully handle the missing currency field, possibly by logging an error, skipping the problematic field, or using a default currency if appropriate for the application's logic (though default currency might not always be secure depending on context).

* **Preconditions:**
    - The application must be using `djmoney.serializers.Deserializer` to deserialize data from an external source (e.g., processing data from API requests, file uploads, or external data feeds).
    - The data being deserialized must potentially contain `MoneyField` instances.
    - An attacker must have control over the JSON payload that is being deserialized.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```python
    File: /code/djmoney/serializers.py
    Content:
    ...
    def Deserializer(stream_or_string, **options):  # noqa
        ...
        for obj in json.loads(stream_or_string):
            ...
            for field_name, field_value in obj["fields"].items():
                ...
                field = Model._meta.get_field(field_name)
                if isinstance(field, MoneyField) and field_value is not None:
                    money_fields[field_name] = Money(
                        field_value, obj["fields"][get_currency_field_name(field_name, field)] # Potential KeyError here
                    )
                ...
    ```
    - The vulnerability exists in the line where `Money` object is instantiated within the `Deserializer` function.
    - `obj["fields"][get_currency_field_name(field_name, field)]` attempts to retrieve the currency code from the `obj["fields"]` dictionary using the key generated by `get_currency_field_name`.
    - If the attacker crafts a JSON payload where the currency field (e.g., `amount_currency`) is deliberately omitted from the `fields` dictionary, accessing it directly using `obj["fields"][...]` will result in a `KeyError`.
    - There is no check to ensure the currency field key exists in `obj["fields"]` before attempting to access it.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prepare a Django model (`TestModel`) with a `MoneyField`.
    2. Create a view or management command that uses `djmoney.serializers.Deserializer` to deserialize JSON data into instances of `TestModel`. This simulates a scenario where the application processes external data.
    3. Construct a malicious JSON payload as a string. This payload should represent a serialized `TestModel` instance, including the amount for the `MoneyField`, but crucially, **omit** the corresponding currency field.
        ```json
        [
          {
            "model": "testapp.testmodel",
            "pk": 1,
            "fields": {
              "money": "10.00"
            }
          }
        ]
        ```
        In this example, if the `MoneyField` in `TestModel` is named `money`, then `money_currency` field is missing.
    4. Feed this malicious JSON payload to the deserialization function in your test view or command.
    5. Assert that a `DeserializationError` is raised, and that the cause of the `DeserializationError` is indeed a `KeyError` originating from the `Deserializer` attempting to access the missing currency field.

    ```python
    # File: /code/tests/test_deserialization_keyerror.py
    import pytest
    from django.core.serializers.base import DeserializationError
    from djmoney.serializers import Deserializer
    from djmoney.models.fields import MoneyField
    from tests.testapp.models import ModelWithVanillaMoneyField # Or create a new test model

    pytestmark = pytest.mark.django_db

    def test_deserialization_keyerror():
        malicious_json_payload = """
        [
          {
            "model": "testapp.modelwithvanillamoneyfield",
            "pk": 1,
            "fields": {
              "money": "10.00"
            }
          }
        ]
        """
        with pytest.raises(DeserializationError) as exc_info:
            list(Deserializer(malicious_json_payload))

        assert isinstance(exc_info.value.args[0], KeyError)
        assert "money_currency" in str(exc_info.value.args[0]) # Check if the KeyError is due to missing currency field
    ```

#### 2. Potential SSRF via Exchange Rate URL Misconfiguration

* **Description:**
  An attacker who can influence the external exchange‐rate URL settings (for example, via environment variable or misconfiguration of the FIXER or OpenExchangeRates backend URL) may force the backend to use an attacker‑controlled target. In this scenario the `update_rates` method (invoked by a management command or a mis‑exposed endpoint) builds a URL from the configured settings and, without verifying that the URL’s host is from an allowed external domain, performs an HTTP request using Python’s `urlopen` with a custom SSL context. An attacker who sets the URL to an internal or malicious host may trigger SSRF (Server‑Side Request Forgery).

* **Impact:**
  - The application may be induced to make HTTP requests to internal systems or attacker‑controlled endpoints, which could reveal sensitive internal network information or allow further lateral attacks.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The code creates an SSL context using certifi’s trusted CA bundle. This ensures that any HTTPS requests verify certificates properly—but it does not restrict which external URLs may be contacted.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
  - No explicit validation or whitelisting is performed on the URL (e.g. `FIXER_URL` or `OPEN_EXCHANGE_RATES_URL`) before use. A robust mitigation would involve checking that the URL belongs to a known-good host and scheme, or otherwise restricting external requests.

* **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to influence the Django settings (for example via environment variable injection or mis‑configuration) so that the exchange backend URL is changed to an attacker‑controlled or internal host.
  - In addition, either the `update_rates` (or similar) management function must be callable (or indirectly triggered via a mis‑exposed endpoint) from an external source.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In **djmoney/contrib/exchange/backends/base.py**, the method `get_response(**params)` builds the request URL as follows:
    - `self.get_url(**params)` is called, which merges GET parameters into the base URL (set via settings).
    - The code then creates a request with a fixed User-Agent and an SSL context with certifi’s CA bundle, and finally calls `urlopen(request, context=context)` without checking that the host portion of the URL is safe.

* **Security Test Case:**
  - In a test or staging environment, set (for example) the environment variable `FIXER_URL` (or `OPEN_EXCHANGE_RATES_URL`) to a URL under the attacker's control or an internal IP (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:80`).
  - Ensure the application uses the affected backend (by having an appropriate access key, etc.).
  - Then trigger the update mechanism by running the management command (or by invoking the `update_rates` function if it is callable via an exposed interface).
  - Verify via logging or network monitoring that the request is being sent to the misconfigured URL.
  - If so, the risk of SSRF is confirmed and mitigation (URL validation/whitelisting) is needed.


#### 3. Unvalidated “backend” Parameter in Exchange Management Commands

* **Description:**
  The management commands for updating or clearing exchange rates allow a “backend” parameter. In the commands (for example, in **djmoney/contrib/exchange/management/commands/update_rates.py**), the code uses Django’s `import_string(options["backend"])` to retrieve the backend class without validating that the supplied import path is among an approved list. If an attacker (or an untrusted user) is able to invoke such a command—and if the application’s process exposes management commands (for example, via a web‑exposed administrative interface or remote command execution vulnerability)—then by supplying a malicious module path the attacker might force the application to import and instantiate an unexpected or dangerous object.

* **Impact:**
  - This may lead to arbitrary code execution or arbitrary function calls if the supplied backend reference is not restricted.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The code assumes that these management commands are only executed by trusted administrators via the CLI. No additional input validation or restrictions on the “backend” parameter are applied.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input validation (or whitelisting) for the “backend” parameter is missing. An attacker‐controlled input (or mis‑configuration that exposes the command) should be rejected or constrained to a list of allowed backend module paths.
  - Additionally, ensuring that management commands cannot be triggered by an external attacker (for example, by not exposing administrative interfaces over the public Internet) is essential but not enforced in the code.

* **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to invoke the management command (or a web‑service wrapper around it) and supply a custom “backend” parameter.
  - Mis‑configured deployment (exposing management functionality externally) is required.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In **djmoney/contrib/exchange/management/commands/update_rates.py**, the code does:
    ```
    backend = import_string(options["backend"])()
    ```
    Here, the command‐line parameter “backend” (which defaults to a setting value) is not validated. A similar pattern is found in the clear_rates command. No restrictions are applied on the string used for import.

* **Security Test Case:**
  - In a controlled environment where management commands are exposed (or via a simulated exploit), invoke the `update_rates` command supplying a malicious import path for the “backend” parameter (for example, a module or function that executes a benign test command such as printing a marker or executing an OS command).
  - Observe whether the custom backend is instantiated and whether its behavior can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
  - If the imported module is not limited to a safe list, then this confirms a critical risk that must be mitigated by whitelisting allowed backend paths.
