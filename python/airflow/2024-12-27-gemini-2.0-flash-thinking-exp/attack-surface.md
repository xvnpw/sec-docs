## Key Attack Surface List (High & Critical, Directly Involving Airflow)

Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces introduced by Apache Airflow, focusing on elements with high or critical severity that directly involve Airflow's functionalities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated Access to Webserver Metadata
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information about DAGs, tasks, connections, variables, and infrastructure is exposed through the Airflow webserver without requiring authentication.
    *   **How Airflow Contributes:** The default configuration of Airflow might not enforce authentication, or authentication might be improperly configured, allowing anonymous access to the web UI and API endpoints.
    *   **Example:** An attacker can browse the Airflow web UI without logging in and view connection details containing database credentials or API keys. They can also use the unauthenticated API to list all DAGs and their configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, business logic, and infrastructure details. This can lead to further attacks on connected systems, data breaches, or manipulation of workflows.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Authentication: Configure a strong authentication mechanism for the Airflow webserver (e.g., using Flask-AppBuilder's built-in authentication, integration with LDAP/OAuth, or using a reverse proxy with authentication).
        *   Enforce HTTPS: Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the webserver, protecting credentials during login.
        *   Review Default Configurations: Avoid using default credentials and review all security-related configuration options.

*   **Attack Surface:** DAG Parsing and Arbitrary Code Execution
    *   **Description:** The Airflow scheduler parses DAG files (typically Python). If an attacker can introduce or modify a malicious DAG file, the scheduler might execute arbitrary code on the scheduler host during the parsing process.
    *   **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow's core functionality relies on dynamically parsing and executing Python code defined in DAG files. This inherent capability creates a risk if the source of DAGs is not trusted or if access controls are weak.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with write access to the DAGs folder can create a DAG file that executes system commands upon parsing, potentially granting them shell access to the scheduler host.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the scheduler host, potentially leading to control over the entire Airflow deployment and access to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict DAG Folder Access: Implement strict access controls on the DAGs folder, allowing only authorized personnel to modify or add DAG files.
        *   Code Review for DAGs: Implement a code review process for all DAGs before they are deployed to production to identify and prevent malicious code.
        *   Consider DAG Serialization: Explore options for serializing DAGs to reduce the risk of arbitrary code execution during parsing (though this has limitations).
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run the scheduler process with the minimum necessary privileges.

*   **Attack Surface:** Execution of Untrusted Code on Workers
    *   **Description:** Airflow workers execute the tasks defined in DAGs. If an attacker can modify DAG definitions, they can introduce tasks that execute arbitrary code on the worker nodes.
    *   **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow's fundamental purpose is to execute user-defined code through tasks. This inherent functionality presents a risk if DAGs are not treated as trusted code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a DAG to include a PythonOperator that executes a reverse shell command on a worker node, granting them remote access.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of worker nodes, potentially leading to data breaches, resource hijacking, or further attacks on connected systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure DAG Development and Deployment: Implement secure development practices for DAGs, including code reviews and version control.
        *   Restrict DAG Modification Access: Control who can modify DAGs in production environments.
        *   Use Secure Task Execution Environments: Consider using containerization (e.g., Docker) for task execution to isolate tasks and limit the impact of a compromised task.
        *   Implement Resource Limits: Configure resource limits for tasks to prevent resource exhaustion on worker nodes.
        *   Monitor Task Execution: Implement monitoring to detect unusual or malicious activity during task execution.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in DAG Source Code
    *   **Description:** DAG source code, accessible through the web UI, might contain sensitive information like credentials, API keys, or internal business logic.
    *   **How Airflow Contributes:** The Airflow webserver, by default, allows users with appropriate permissions to view the source code of DAG files.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes database credentials directly into a DAG file. An attacker with access to the web UI can view the DAG source and retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems and data breaches. Understanding of business logic can aid in further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid Hardcoding Secrets: Never hardcode sensitive information in DAG files. Use Airflow Connections, Variables, or a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Restrict DAG Source Code Access: Implement granular access controls to limit who can view DAG source code in the web UI.
        *   Regularly Scan DAGs for Secrets: Use automated tools to scan DAG files for accidentally committed secrets.
