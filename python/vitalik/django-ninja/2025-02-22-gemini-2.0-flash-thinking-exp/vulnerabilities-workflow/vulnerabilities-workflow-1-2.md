- **Vulnerability Name:** CSRF Protection Misconfiguration Vulnerability  
  **Description:**  
  - The NinjaAPI class (in `ninja/main.py`) accepts a `csrf` parameter that defaults to False.  
  - When the API is deployed with cookie‑ or session‑based authentication, the corresponding security class (e.g. `APIKeyCookie` in `ninja/security/apikey.py`) calls Django’s CSRF middleware only if its internal `csrf` flag is set to True.  
  - An attacker can induce a state‑changing action by luring an authenticated user to a malicious webpage that automatically submits a forged request—because by default no CSRF token is verified.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Unauthorized state‑changing requests (such as modifying user data or triggering transactions) can be executed in the context of an unsuspecting user’s session.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The framework’s documentation and sample code explicitly warn that CSRF protection is disabled by default and show how to enable it (by setting `csrf=True` or decorating views appropriately).  
  - A deprecation warning is issued in `ninja/main.py` when the `csrf` argument is used, alerting developers that CSRF is now handled via the auth mechanism—but without enforcing a secure default.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No runtime enforcement exists to automatically enable CSRF protection when cookie‑based authentication is used.  
  - A more secure default (or a production‑time warning) would help prevent inadvertent deployment with CSRF disabled.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The API is publicly accessible and deployed using the default `csrf=False` setting while relying on cookie‑ or session‑based authentication.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `ninja/main.py`, the NinjaAPI constructor sets `self.csrf = csrf` (defaulting to False) and only issues a deprecation warning rather than forcing secure behavior.  
  - In `ninja/security/apikey.py`, the `APIKeyCookie` class’s `_get_key()` method calls `check_csrf(request)` only if its internal `csrf` flag is True—meaning that with default settings no CSRF check is performed.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - **Step 1:** Deploy an instance of the API using default settings (with `csrf=False`) and configure it to use cookie‑based authentication (e.g. through the `APIKeyCookie` mechanism).  
  - **Step 2:** As an attacker, craft a malicious HTML page (using a hidden form or JavaScript) that automatically submits a state‑changing request (e.g. a POST) to one of the API endpoints.  
  - **Step 3:** Lure a logged‑in user to visit the malicious page so that the browser automatically includes the session cookie.  
  - **Expected Outcome:** The forged request is accepted and processed because the API does not require or verify a CSRF token.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Debug Mode Information Disclosure Vulnerability  
  **Description:**  
  - When Django’s `DEBUG` setting is left enabled, unhandled exceptions trigger error responses that include detailed tracebacks.  
  - Attackers can deliberately send malformed or invalid input to API endpoints to trigger exceptions.  
  - The full traceback—including file paths, code snippets, and configuration information—is returned in the HTTP response.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Sensitive internal details (such as source code layout, installed modules, and framework configuration) are disclosed, aiding further targeted attacks.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - Best practices documented by Django and reinforced by test files specify that `DEBUG` must be set to False in production.  
  - The default exception handler (in `ninja/errors.py`) sanitizes error output only when `DEBUG` is False.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no safe‑by‑default mode; the framework relies entirely on the developer to set `DEBUG=False` in production.  
  - An additional safeguard or runtime warning when detailed error output is detected in a production setting is missing.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The API instance is deployed with Django’s `DEBUG=True`, and an attacker is able to trigger an unhandled exception on a public endpoint.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `ninja/errors.py`, the `_default_exception()` function returns the full traceback (via `traceback.format_exc()`) as plain text when `settings.DEBUG` is True.  
  - The helper function `debug_server_url_reimport()` in `ninja/main.py` is used to detect development‑mode re‐imports but does not mitigate the exposure of sensitive error details.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - **Step 1:** Deploy the API with `DEBUG=True` (mimicking a production misconfiguration).  
  - **Step 2:** Identify an endpoint and send a request with invalid JSON or deliberately malformed data to trigger an exception.  
  - **Step 3:** Capture the HTTP response and inspect its body to verify that it contains a detailed traceback with internal file paths and configuration details.  
  - **Expected Outcome:** The response discloses the complete traceback, confirming the information disclosure vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insufficient Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints Vulnerability  
  **Description:**  
  - Throttling classes are available within the framework (such as `AnonRateThrottle`, `AuthRateThrottle`, and `UserRateThrottle` defined in `ninja/throttling.py`); however, if developers do not explicitly configure throttle limits on sensitive endpoints (for instance, those validating API keys), then no rate limiting is enforced.  
  - This lack of default protections allows attackers to script rapid, repeated authentication attempts (brute‑forcing credentials) with minimal delay.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Attackers might guess valid API keys or credentials by exploiting the absence of conservative rate limits, leading to unauthorized access.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The framework provides robust, configurable throttle classes and includes tests that demonstrate their functionality when explicitly applied.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no secure‑by‑default throttle configuration for authentication endpoints; if developers overlook specifying throttle objects (leaving the throttle attribute as NOT_SET), the endpoints remain open to rapid repeated requests.  
  - A default conservative rate limit (e.g. a few attempts per minute per IP) would mitigate brute‑force risks.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The API is publicly accessible on endpoints that use API Key (or other sensitive) authentication, and no explicit throttling is configured—thus the default (NOT_SET) throttle is in effect.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `ninja/throttling.py`, the `SimpleRateThrottle` class’s `allow_request()` method checks the request history stored in the cache. When no throttle is attached (or the developer leaves throttle as NOT_SET), there is no enforcement to limit the rate of incoming requests.  
  - Test modules illustrate that when explicit throttle objects are not provided, the API processes authentication requests without delays or rate limits.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - **Step 1:** Create and deploy an API endpoint that uses API Key–based authentication, ensuring that no throttle object is configured (i.e. throttle remains as NOT_SET).  
  - **Step 2:** Using an automated script, send a large number of authentication requests with incorrect API keys from one or more IP addresses.  
  - **Step 3:** Observe that the API processes every request immediately with no throttling (i.e. no HTTP 429 status responses).  
  - **Expected Outcome:** The absence of default rate limiting allows rapid repeated requests, facilitating brute‑force attacks.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Public Exposure of OpenAPI Documentation Vulnerability  
  **Description:**  
  - By default, the NinjaAPI instance (see `ninja/main.py`) is configured with `docs_url` set to “/docs” and `openapi_url` set to “/openapi.json”.  
  - The OpenAPI specification and interactive documentation are then added to Django’s URL configuration (see `ninja/openapi/urls.py`) without any authentication or access restrictions.  
  - An unauthenticated attacker can directly access these endpoints to retrieve detailed information on the API’s routes, parameters, and models.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Full exposure of the API’s internal structure can enable attackers to map out endpoints and craft more sophisticated, targeted attacks; it also simplifies automated vulnerability scanning.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The framework supports disabling these documentation endpoints by setting `docs_url=None` and/or `openapi_url=None`, and it provides the option to wrap the endpoints using an authentication decorator (see documentation examples).  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Out‑of‑the‑box, documentation endpoints remain enabled and are publicly accessible, leaving the API fully documented without any access control.  
  - A secure‑by‑default behavior (such as restricting access in production) would considerably reduce the attack surface.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The API instance is deployed with the default configuration where `docs_url` and `openapi_url` are enabled and not protected by any authentication or authorization mechanism.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `ninja/main.py`, the constructor sets default values for `docs_url` ("/docs") and `openapi_url` ("/openapi.json").  
  - In `ninja/openapi/urls.py`, these endpoints are automatically added to the URL configuration without any built‑in safeguards.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - **Step 1:** Deploy the API using the default configuration (i.e. with `docs_url` and `openapi_url` enabled).  
  - **Step 2:** From an external, unauthenticated network, access the endpoints “/docs” and “/openapi.json” using a web browser or a HTTP client.  
  - **Step 3:** Verify that the full OpenAPI specification is disclosed, revealing endpoints, parameter definitions, and even default values.  
  - **Expected Outcome:** The API documentation is accessible without any form of authentication, thereby confirming the vulnerability.
