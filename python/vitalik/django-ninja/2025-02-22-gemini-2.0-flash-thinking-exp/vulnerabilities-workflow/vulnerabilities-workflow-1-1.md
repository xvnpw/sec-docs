### Vulnerability 1

- Vulnerability name: CSRF vulnerability with cookie-based authentication and disabled CSRF protection.
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious website containing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.
    2. A user authenticates to a Django Ninja application that uses cookie-based authentication (e.g., Django sessions, APIKeyCookie). This results in the application setting a session cookie in the user's browser.
    3. The developer of the Django Ninja application, either unknowingly or intentionally, disables CSRF protection. This can be done by setting `csrf=False` during `NinjaAPI` initialization.
    4. While the user is logged into the Django Ninja application and their session cookie is active, they visit the attacker's malicious website in the same browser.
    5. The malicious website, without the user's awareness, sends a cross-site request to the Django Ninja application. This request is designed to perform an action, such as modifying data or executing administrative functions, that the attacker intends. The browser automatically includes the Django Ninja application's session cookie with this cross-site request.
    6. Because CSRF protection is disabled in the Django Ninja application (due to `csrf=False`), the application does not perform standard CSRF token validation to verify the request's origin.
    7. The Django Ninja application only verifies the presence of a valid session cookie. Since the browser automatically sent the session cookie, the application considers the request to be authenticated.
    8. The Django Ninja application processes the attacker's malicious request as if it were a legitimate user action, leading to the execution of unauthorized actions.
    9. The attacker successfully performs actions on behalf of the logged-in user, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or unintended operations within the application.
- Impact:
    - Account Takeover: An attacker could change user passwords or email addresses, gaining control over user accounts.
    - Data Manipulation: Critical data could be modified, deleted, or corrupted, leading to data integrity issues or loss.
    - Unauthorized Transactions: Users might be unknowingly made to perform actions like financial transactions or data transfers.
    - Privilege Escalation: If an administrative account is targeted, attackers could gain complete control over the Django Ninja application and its data.
- Vulnerability rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Django Ninja framework has an automatic CSRF protection mechanism. When cookie-based authentication methods like `APIKeyCookie`, `SessionAuth`, or `django_auth` are used, CSRF protection is automatically enabled by default. This default behavior is implemented in the `NinjaAPI` constructor in `ninja/main.py` and documented in `/code/docs/docs/reference/csrf.md` and `/code/docs/docs/whatsnew_v1.md`.
    - The `APIKeyCookie` security class in `ninja/security/apikey.py`, which is the base for `SessionAuth` and `SessionAuthSuperUser` in `ninja/security/session.py`, includes CSRF checks by default. The `__init__` method of `APIKeyCookie` sets `self.csrf = csrf` with a default value of `True`, and the `_get_key` method calls `check_csrf(request)` if `self.csrf` is True.
- Missing mitigations:
    - No explicit runtime warning for intentional CSRF disabling: If a developer explicitly sets `csrf=False` in `NinjaAPI` constructor while also using cookie-based authentication, there is no runtime warning or error raised to highlight the security implications. This lack of immediate feedback might lead to unintentional exposure to CSRF attacks if developers are not fully aware of the risks of disabling CSRF in such setups.
    - Documentation prominence and stronger warning: While CSRF protection is documented, the documentation could be improved by:
        - Placing a more prominent warning in the CSRF documentation section about the risks of disabling CSRF, specifically when using cookie-based authentication.
        - Adding a strong recommendation against disabling CSRF unless for very specific use-cases (like public APIs with non-browser clients only) and with a clear understanding of the security consequences.
        - Including guidance on alternative approaches if developers believe they have reasons to disable CSRF, encouraging them to reconsider or implement other security measures.
- Preconditions:
    - Cookie-based Authentication in Use: The Django Ninja application must be configured to use a cookie-based authentication mechanism (e.g., Django sessions, `APIKeyCookie`, `SessionAuth`).
    - CSRF Protection Explicitly Disabled: The `NinjaAPI` constructor must be initialized with `csrf=False`.
    - Active User Session: A user must be logged into the Django Ninja application, possessing a valid session cookie in their browser.
    - User Interaction with External Malicious Content: The logged-in user must visit a website or interact with content controlled by the attacker (e.g., through a link in an email or visiting a malicious site) that is designed to execute a CSRF attack against the Django Ninja application.
- Source code analysis:
    - `ninja/main.py`:
        - The `NinjaAPI` class constructor handles the `csrf` argument. It automatically enables CSRF protection if `auth` is provided and `csrf` is not explicitly set to `False`.
        ```python
        def __init__(
            self,
            *,
            ...,
            csrf: bool = False,
            auth: Optional[Union[Sequence[Callable], Callable, NOT_SET_TYPE]] = NOT_SET,
            ...
        ):
            ...
            if auth is not NOT_SET and not csrf: # auto csrf
                self.csrf = True
            else:
                self.csrf = csrf
            ...
        ```
    - `ninja/security/apikey.py`:
        - The `APIKeyCookie` class initializes `csrf` to `True` by default and uses the `check_csrf` utility function to validate CSRF tokens if `csrf` is enabled.
        ```python
        class APIKeyCookie(APIKeyBase, ABC):
            openapi_in: str = "cookie"

            def __init__(self, csrf: bool = True) -> None:
                self.csrf = csrf
                super().__init__()

            def _get_key(self, request: HttpRequest) -> Optional[str]:
                if self.csrf:
                    error_response = check_csrf(request)
                    if error_response:
                        raise HttpError(403, "CSRF check Failed")
                return request.COOKIES.get(self.param_name)
        ```
    - `ninja/utils.py`:
        - The `check_csrf` function leverages Django's `CsrfViewMiddleware` to perform CSRF validation.
        ```python
        def check_csrf(
            request: HttpRequest, callback: Callable = _no_view
        ) -> Optional[HttpResponseForbidden]:
            mware = CsrfViewMiddleware(lambda x: HttpResponseForbidden())  # pragma: no cover
            request.csrf_processing_done = False  # type: ignore
            mware.process_request(request)
            return mware.process_view(request, callback, (), {})
        ```
    - `docs/docs/reference/csrf.md` and `docs/docs/whatsnew_v1.md`:
        - Documentation confirms the default CSRF protection behavior and provides information on how to configure and use CSRF protection in Django Ninja.
- Security test case:
    1. Set up a vulnerable Django Ninja API application:
        - Define a Django Ninja API endpoint that is protected with cookie-based authentication. For instance, use `APIKeyCookie` or Django's session authentication (`django_auth`).
        - Initialize the `NinjaAPI` instance with CSRF protection explicitly disabled: `api = NinjaAPI(csrf=False, auth=...)`.
        - Create a POST endpoint, for example `/api/change_email/`, that modifies a user-related attribute (like email). This endpoint should be protected by the configured cookie-based authentication.
    2. Develop a malicious HTML website for CSRF attack:
        - Create an HTML file (can be hosted locally or on a separate server).
        - In the HTML body, include a form that automatically submits a POST request to the `/api/change_email/` endpoint of the Django Ninja application upon page load (using JavaScript for auto-submission).
        - The form should include a field (e.g., `new_email`) with a value chosen by the attacker to demonstrate the exploit.
        ```html
        <html>
        <head>
            <title>CSRF Attack</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>CSRF Attack!</h1>
            <form id="csrf-form" action="http://your-django-ninja-app.com/api/change_email/" method="POST">
                <input type="hidden" name="new_email" value="attacker@example.com">
            </form>
            <script>
                document.getElementById('csrf-form').submit();
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
        - Replace `http://your-django-ninja-app.com/api/change_email/` with the actual URL of your vulnerable endpoint.
    3. Authenticate as a user:
        - Open a web browser and log in to the Django Ninja application with valid user credentials. This establishes a session and stores the session cookie in the browser.
    4. Access the malicious website:
        - In the same browser session where you are logged into the Django Ninja application, navigate to the malicious HTML file you created.
    5. Observe the successful CSRF exploit:
        - Upon loading the malicious HTML page, the embedded form will automatically submit a POST request to the Django Ninja application's `/api/change_email/` endpoint.
        - Verify that the email address associated with the logged-in user in the Django Ninja application has been changed to `attacker@example.com`. This confirms the CSRF attack was successful because the application processed the unauthorized request due to the disabled CSRF protection and the presence of the valid session cookie.
