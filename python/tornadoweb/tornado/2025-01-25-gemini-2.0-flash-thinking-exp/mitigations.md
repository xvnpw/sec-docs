## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Proper Error Handling in Asynchronous Operations](./mitigation_strategies/implement_proper_error_handling_in_asynchronous_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all asynchronous operations in your Tornado application (functions using `async` and `await` within Tornado handlers and background tasks).
    2.  Wrap each `await` call and the entire body of asynchronous Tornado functions within `try...except` blocks.
    3.  Within the `except` block, log the exception details thoroughly, including traceback information, for debugging and security auditing using Tornado's logging facilities.
    4.  Implement graceful error handling within Tornado handlers. Instead of crashing or exposing raw error messages, return user-friendly error responses using `tornado.web.RequestHandler.write_error` or redirect to custom error pages rendered by Tornado templates.
    5.  Consider using Tornado's error handling mechanisms within `tornado.web.Application` to customize global error responses.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unhandled Exception Denial of Service (High):**  If asynchronous operations within Tornado handlers or background tasks fail without handling, the application might crash or become unresponsive, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Information Leakage (Medium):** Unhandled exceptions in Tornado applications can expose sensitive debugging information, stack traces, or internal application details to attackers through Tornado's default error pages or logging.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unhandled Exception Denial of Service (High):** High risk reduction. Prevents Tornado application crashes due to asynchronous errors.
    *   **Information Leakage (Medium):** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the chance of exposing sensitive information through Tornado's error handling mechanisms.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Error logging is in place in API handlers using Tornado's logger, but not consistently applied to all background tasks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to review and add `try...except` blocks to all asynchronous Tornado functions, especially background tasks and WebSocket handlers.  Customize `tornado.web.Application` error handling for more user-friendly and secure error pages.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Timeouts for Asynchronous Operations](./mitigation_strategies/set_timeouts_for_asynchronous_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all asynchronous operations within your Tornado application that involve external resources or potentially long-running tasks (e.g., API calls, database queries using Tornado's asynchronous database clients, external service interactions).
    2.  For each such operation, use Tornado's `tornado.gen.with_timeout` or `asyncio.wait_for` within Tornado handlers and background tasks to set a maximum execution time.
    3.  Choose timeout values that are reasonable for the expected operation duration but short enough to prevent resource exhaustion within the Tornado application.
    4.  Handle `tornado.gen.TimeoutError` or `asyncio.TimeoutError` exceptions gracefully within Tornado handlers, logging the timeout event using Tornado's logger and returning an appropriate error response to the user using `tornado.web.RequestHandler.write_error`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Asynchronous Operation Denial of Service (High):**  Malicious or slow external services can cause asynchronous operations within Tornado to hang indefinitely, consuming server resources and leading to denial of service of the Tornado application.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium):**  Unbounded asynchronous operations in Tornado can exhaust server resources like threads, connections, or memory managed by the Tornado application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Asynchronous Operation Denial of Service (High):** High risk reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion and Tornado application unresponsiveness due to slow or hanging asynchronous tasks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium):** Medium risk reduction. Limits resource consumption by long-running operations within the Tornado application.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Timeouts are set for database queries in the main application logic using SQLAlchemy's timeout features, but not directly using Tornado's timeout mechanisms.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement timeouts using `tornado.gen.with_timeout` or `asyncio.wait_for` for external API calls made by background tasks and WebSocket connections within Tornado. Review and adjust existing database query timeouts for optimal values, considering Tornado's asynchronous nature.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate WebSocket Origin using `tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler.check_origin`](./mitigation_strategies/validate_websocket_origin_using__tornado_websocket_websockethandler_check_origin_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  In your Tornado WebSocket handler class, override the `check_origin(self, origin)` method provided by `tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler`.
    2.  Inside `check_origin`, retrieve the `origin` header from the incoming WebSocket handshake request.
    3.  Compare the `origin` header against a whitelist of allowed origins (domains or schemes).
    4.  Return `True` from `check_origin` if the origin is in the whitelist, and `False` otherwise to reject the WebSocket connection using Tornado's WebSocket handling.
    5.  Configure the whitelist of allowed origins based on your application's deployment environment and trusted domains, accessible within your Tornado application configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (High):**  Attackers can initiate WebSocket connections from malicious websites to your Tornado application, potentially bypassing CORS and performing actions on behalf of legitimate users through the Tornado WebSocket endpoint.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (High):** High risk reduction. Effectively prevents unauthorized WebSocket connections to the Tornado application from untrusted origins.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Origin checking is implemented in the main WebSocket handler, using `tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler.check_origin` and a hardcoded list of allowed origins.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Externalize the allowed origins list to a Tornado application configuration file or environment variable for easier management and deployment across different environments. Implement more robust origin validation logic within `check_origin`, potentially using regular expressions or domain matching libraries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Auto-Escaping in Tornado Templates](./mitigation_strategies/use_auto-escaping_in_tornado_templates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When using Tornado's built-in template engine, ensure that auto-escaping is enabled. This is the default behavior in Tornado templates.
    2.  Verify the template settings in your `tornado.web.Application` configuration to confirm auto-escaping is active.
    3.  Understand that Tornado's default auto-escaping mechanism is HTML escaping, which is crucial for preventing XSS.
    4.  If you need to output raw HTML in specific cases within Tornado templates, use the `{% raw %}` block *sparingly* and only for trusted content. Be extremely cautious when using `{% raw %}`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):**  Without auto-escaping in Tornado templates, user-provided data rendered in templates can be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript code, leading to XSS vulnerabilities within the Tornado application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):** High risk reduction. Auto-escaping in Tornado templates is a fundamental defense against XSS vulnerabilities in Tornado applications.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Auto-escaping is enabled in Tornado templates by default and confirmed to be active in the application's Tornado configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Regularly review Tornado templates to ensure that auto-escaping is consistently applied and that `{% raw %}` is used only when absolutely necessary and for trusted content. Conduct template security audits specific to Tornado templates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Request Size Limits using `tornado.web.Application.settings`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_request_size_limits_using__tornado_web_application_settings_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  In your `tornado.web.Application` settings dictionary, configure `max_body_size` to limit the maximum allowed size of request bodies (e.g., POST data, file uploads) that Tornado will accept.
    2.  Choose a `max_body_size` value in your Tornado configuration that is appropriate for your application's expected request sizes but small enough to prevent excessively large requests from overwhelming the Tornado application.
    3.  When a request exceeds `max_body_size`, Tornado will automatically return a 413 Request Entity Too Large error. Customize the error handling for this status code within your Tornado application if needed to provide a user-friendly message using `tornado.web.RequestHandler.write_error`.
    4.  Consider also setting `max_header_size` in `tornado.web.Application.settings` to limit the size of request headers handled by Tornado, although `max_body_size` is typically more relevant for denial-of-service attacks targeting Tornado.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Request Body Denial of Service (Medium):**  Attackers can send excessively large requests to the Tornado application to exhaust server resources (bandwidth, memory, processing time) and cause denial of service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Request Body Denial of Service (Medium):** Medium risk reduction. Limits the impact of large request attacks on the Tornado application by preventing resource exhaustion.

*   **Currently Implemented:** `max_body_size` is set in the `tornado.web.Application` settings to 10MB.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Review and potentially adjust the `max_body_size` value in the Tornado application configuration based on application requirements and resource constraints. Consider implementing different size limits for different Tornado endpoints if needed (though this might require custom request handling logic).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debug Mode in Production Tornado Applications](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debug_mode_in_production_tornado_applications.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Ensure that Tornado's debug mode (`debug=True` in `tornado.web.Application`) is explicitly disabled when deploying your Tornado application to production environments.
    2.  Set `debug=False` or omit the `debug` setting entirely in your production `tornado.web.Application` configuration.
    3.  Debug mode in Tornado exposes sensitive information like stack traces and allows automatic reloading of code on changes, which is insecure and inefficient for production.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Leakage (Medium):** Tornado's debug mode can expose sensitive debugging information, source code paths, and internal application details to attackers through error pages and logging.
    *   **Unintended Code Execution/Configuration Changes (Low):** While less direct, debug mode's auto-reloading and other development features could potentially be exploited in misconfigured production environments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Leakage (Medium):** Medium risk reduction. Prevents exposure of sensitive debugging information from the Tornado application in production.
    *   **Unintended Code Execution/Configuration Changes (Low):** Low risk reduction. Reduces potential attack surface related to debug features in production Tornado applications.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Debug mode is disabled in the production Tornado application configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Regularly verify that debug mode remains disabled in all production deployments of the Tornado application. Include this check in deployment checklists and automated configuration validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Tornado and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_tornado_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for regularly monitoring for security advisories and updates related to the Tornado framework and its dependencies.
    2.  Use dependency management tools (like `pip` with `requirements.txt` or `poetry`) to track and update Tornado and its dependencies.
    3.  Apply security patches and updates to Tornado and its dependencies promptly to address known vulnerabilities.
    4.  Test your Tornado application thoroughly after applying updates to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Tornado Vulnerabilities (High):** Outdated versions of Tornado may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Tornado Vulnerabilities (High):** High risk reduction.  Staying up-to-date with Tornado updates is crucial for mitigating known vulnerabilities in the framework itself.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  There is a process for updating dependencies, but it's not strictly regular or automated for security updates specifically for Tornado.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement automated checks for Tornado security advisories and integrate regular Tornado and dependency updates into the development and maintenance cycle. Consider using tools that specifically scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
