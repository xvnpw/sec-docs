Okay, let's create a design document for the Tornado web framework, suitable for later threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library.  It's designed for handling long-lived connections (like WebSockets) and high network traffic.  It's often used for real-time applications, APIs, and services that require high concurrency.  The business priorities and goals that Tornado addresses are:

*   Scalability:  Handling a large number of concurrent connections efficiently. This is crucial for applications with many users or devices connected simultaneously.
*   Performance:  Minimizing latency and maximizing throughput for fast response times.  This is important for real-time applications and user experience.
*   Real-time Capabilities:  Supporting persistent connections for bidirectional communication between clients and servers. This enables features like live updates, chat, and streaming.
*   Developer Productivity: Providing a relatively simple and easy-to-use framework for building asynchronous applications.
*   Open Source: Being freely available and community-supported, reducing development costs and fostering collaboration.

Based on these priorities, the most important business risks are:

*   Denial of Service (DoS):  The ability to handle a large number of connections makes Tornado applications potential targets for DoS attacks.  If the application isn't properly configured or protected, attackers could overwhelm it with requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   Data Breaches:  If security vulnerabilities exist in the application or its dependencies, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   Application Downtime:  Any bugs or errors in the application code could lead to crashes or instability, resulting in downtime and disruption of service.
*   Resource Exhaustion:  Improperly managed asynchronous operations or memory leaks could lead to resource exhaustion, impacting performance and stability.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the Tornado application or Tornado itself could be exploited by attackers.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls and accepted risks, based on the Tornado documentation and common practices:

*   security control: Input Validation: Tornado provides mechanisms for handling user input, but it's the developer's responsibility to validate and sanitize all input to prevent common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. (Described in Tornado documentation and best practices for web development).
*   security control: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Tornado includes built-in support for CSRF protection via the `xsrf_cookies` setting and the `xsrf_form_html()` method. (Described in Tornado documentation: [https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/security.html](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/security.html)).
*   security control: Secure Cookies: Tornado allows setting secure cookie attributes (e.g., `secure`, `httponly`, `samesite`) to protect cookies from being intercepted or manipulated. (Described in Tornado documentation).
*   security control: Output Encoding: Developers are responsible for properly encoding output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Tornado provides some helper functions, but secure coding practices are essential. (Described in Tornado documentation and best practices for web development).
*   security control: Asynchronous Security Considerations: Tornado's asynchronous nature introduces specific security considerations. Developers must be careful to avoid race conditions and ensure that asynchronous operations are handled securely. (Described in Tornado documentation and best practices for asynchronous programming).
*   accepted risk: Limited Built-in Authentication/Authorization: Tornado provides basic building blocks, but developers often need to implement custom authentication and authorization mechanisms or integrate with external libraries/services.
*   accepted risk: Dependency Management: Tornado relies on external libraries (e.g., `asyncio`).  Developers are responsible for keeping these dependencies up-to-date and addressing any security vulnerabilities in them.
*   accepted risk: Deployment Security: Tornado itself doesn't dictate deployment security.  Secure deployment practices (e.g., using HTTPS, firewalls, secure server configurations) are the responsibility of the deployer.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, potentially using established libraries like `PyJWT` for JSON Web Tokens or integrating with an external identity provider.
*   security control: Enforce HTTPS to encrypt all communication between clients and the server.
*   security control: Implement rate limiting and other DoS protection measures to mitigate the risk of attacks.
*   security control: Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
*   security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks.
*   security control: Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that fetched resources haven't been tampered with.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All endpoints that access sensitive data or perform sensitive actions MUST require authentication.
    *   Authentication mechanisms MUST use strong, industry-standard algorithms and protocols (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing, JWT with secure signing).
    *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) SHOULD be considered for high-security applications.
*   Authorization:
    *   Access to resources and functionality MUST be controlled based on user roles and permissions (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC).
    *   Authorization checks MUST be performed on every request, not just at the initial login.
    *   The principle of least privilege MUST be followed, granting users only the minimum necessary access.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input MUST be validated against a strict whitelist of allowed characters and formats.
    *   Input validation MUST be performed on both the client-side (for user experience) and the server-side (for security).
    *   Input validation rules MUST be centralized and reusable.
*   Cryptography:
    *   All sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit.
    *   Strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms MUST be used (e.g., AES-256 for symmetric encryption, RSA or ECC for asymmetric encryption).
    *   Cryptographic keys MUST be managed securely, using a key management system or hardware security module (HSM) where appropriate.
    *   Avoid using deprecated or weak cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1).

6.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Git Repository Access Control: Restricting access to the Git repository to authorized developers.
*   security control: CI Environment Security: Securing the CI environment itself (e.g., using strong authentication, limiting access).
*   security control: Automated Tests: Running unit and integration tests to catch bugs and regressions.
*   security control: SAST Scanning: Using a SAST scanner to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Dependency Scanning: Scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities (this could be part of the SAST process or a separate step).
*   security control: Secure Docker Build: Using a minimal base image, avoiding running the container as root, and following other Docker security best practices.
*   security control: Container Registry Authentication: Using secure credentials to access the container registry.
*   security control: Image Signing: Signing Docker images to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT
