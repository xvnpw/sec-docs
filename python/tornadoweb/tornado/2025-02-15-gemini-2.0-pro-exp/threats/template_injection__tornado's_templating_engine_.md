Okay, here's a deep analysis of the Template Injection threat in Tornado applications, following the structure you requested:

# Deep Analysis: Template Injection in Tornado

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Template Injection" threat within the context of a Tornado web application.  This includes:

*   Understanding the root causes and attack vectors.
*   Identifying specific vulnerable code patterns.
*   Evaluating the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Providing actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this vulnerability.
*   Going beyond the basic description to explore edge cases and less obvious attack scenarios.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on template injection vulnerabilities arising from the use of Tornado's built-in templating engine (`tornado.template`).  It covers:

*   Vulnerabilities related to `tornado.template.Template`.
*   Vulnerabilities related to `RequestHandler.render` and `RequestHandler.render_string`.
*   Scenarios where auto-escaping is enabled, disabled, or bypassed.
*   The interaction between template injection and other security mechanisms like CSP.
*   The analysis *does not* cover vulnerabilities in third-party templating engines that *might* be used with Tornado (e.g., Jinja2).  It assumes the built-in engine is in use.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:** Examining the Tornado source code (specifically `tornado.template` and related request handler methods) to understand the template rendering process and identify potential injection points.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Constructing proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to demonstrate the vulnerability in various scenarios.
*   **Mitigation Testing:**  Evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies by attempting to bypass them.
*   **Literature Review:**  Consulting existing security research and documentation on template injection vulnerabilities in general and within Tornado specifically.
*   **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Using the findings to refine the existing threat model entry, making it more precise and actionable.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Template Injection Threat

### 2.1 Root Causes and Attack Vectors

The root cause of template injection is the **unsafe inclusion of user-supplied data within the template rendering process**.  This can occur in two primary ways:

*   **Dynamic Template Name Construction:**  An attacker can control (fully or partially) the name of the template file being loaded.  This allows them to potentially load arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, or even specially crafted "templates" that contain malicious code.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable):**

        ```python
        class VulnerableHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
            def get(self):
                template_name = self.get_argument("template", "default")
                self.render(f"{template_name}.html")
        ```

        An attacker could provide `?template=../../etc/passwd` (although this would likely result in a file read, not code execution, it demonstrates the principle).  A more dangerous payload might be `?template=malicious` where `malicious.html` contains template directives.

*   **Direct Injection into Template Content:**  User-supplied data is directly embedded within the template content *without* proper escaping or sanitization.  Even if the template name itself is static, the attacker can inject template directives.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable - Autoescape Disabled):**

        ```python
        class VulnerableHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
            def get(self):
                user_input = self.get_argument("name")
                self.render_string("Hello, {{ name }}", name=user_input, autoescape=None)
        ```
        An attacker could provide `?name={{ 7*7 }}`.  With autoescape disabled, this would result in "Hello, 49" being rendered, demonstrating code execution within the template.  A more malicious payload could access internal objects and methods.

    *   **Example (Vulnerable - Autoescape Bypassed):**

        ```python
        class VulnerableHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
            def get(self):
                user_input = self.get_argument("name")
                # Incorrect use of raw - should be around the ENTIRE expression
                self.render_string("Hello, {% raw name %}", name=user_input)
        ```
        The `{% raw %}` tag is misused here. It only prevents escaping of the literal string "name", not the *value* of the `name` variable.  The same attack as above (`?name={{ 7*7 }}`) would still work.

### 2.2. Proof-of-Concept Exploits

Let's expand on the examples above with more dangerous payloads:

*   **Dynamic Template Name (File Inclusion):**  As mentioned, `?template=../../etc/passwd` could lead to sensitive file disclosure.

*   **Direct Injection (Code Execution - Autoescape Disabled):**

    *   `?name={{ handler.settings }}`:  This could expose application settings, potentially including secret keys.
    *   `?name={{ self.application.ui_modules }}`:  Access UI modules.
    *   `?name={{ __import__('os').system('ls -l') }}`:  Execute arbitrary shell commands (highly dangerous).  This demonstrates full server compromise.
    *   `?name={{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() }}`: List all subclasses of `object`, potentially revealing internal classes and their methods. This is useful for reconnaissance.

*   **Direct Injection (Code Execution - Autoescape Bypassed):**  The same payloads as above would work if `{% raw %}` is misused.

### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations:

*   **Avoid using user-supplied data to construct template names:** This is the **most effective** mitigation for the dynamic template name vulnerability.  If template names are hardcoded or derived from a trusted source (e.g., a database lookup based on an ID, *not* a user-provided string), this attack vector is eliminated.

*   **Ensure auto-escaping is enabled (it is by default):** This is **crucial** for preventing direct injection.  Tornado's auto-escaping mechanism automatically HTML-encodes output, preventing the interpretation of user input as template directives.  However, it's important to understand its limitations:
    *   It only escapes HTML.  If you're embedding user input in a JavaScript context within a template, you need additional escaping (e.g., using `json_encode`).
    *   It can be bypassed (intentionally or unintentionally), as shown in the vulnerable examples.

*   **If disabling auto-escaping, use `{% raw ... %}` and manually escape user data:**  `{% raw %}` is **not a security mechanism on its own**. It simply prevents auto-escaping for the enclosed content.  It *must* be combined with manual escaping using functions like `tornado.escape.xhtml_escape` (or `tornado.escape.json_encode` for JSON contexts).  The key is to apply the escaping to the *variable itself*, not just wrap the variable name in `{% raw %}`.

    *   **Correct Usage:**

        ```python
        user_input = self.get_argument("name")
        escaped_input = tornado.escape.xhtml_escape(user_input)
        self.render_string("Hello, {% raw escaped_input %}", escaped_input=escaped_input, autoescape=None)
        ```

*   **Use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP):**  CSP can act as a **defense-in-depth** mechanism.  While it won't prevent template injection itself, it can limit the impact of a successful exploit.  For example, a strict CSP could prevent the execution of inline JavaScript injected through the template, or prevent the loading of external resources.  A CSP that disallows `unsafe-inline` and restricts `script-src` to trusted sources is highly recommended.  However, CSP is complex to configure correctly and should not be relied upon as the *sole* defense.

### 2.4 Edge Cases and Less Obvious Scenarios

*   **UI Modules:**  Tornado's UI Modules (`tornado.web.UIModule`) can also be vulnerable to template injection if they render templates using user-supplied data without proper escaping.  The same principles apply.

*   **Template Inheritance:**  If a base template is vulnerable, all templates that inherit from it will also be vulnerable.

*   **Custom Template Loaders:**  If you're using a custom template loader, you need to ensure that it doesn't introduce any vulnerabilities (e.g., by allowing the loading of templates from untrusted locations).

*   **Indirect Data Flow:**  The user input might not be directly passed to `render` or `render_string`.  It could be stored in a database and later retrieved and used in a template.  This makes the vulnerability harder to spot during code review.  Data flow analysis is crucial.

*  **Whitespace and Comments:** Attackers might try to bypass simple input filters by using whitespace or comments within the template directives. For example:
    ```
    {{/*comment*/7*7}}
    {{ 7 * 7 }}
    ```
    Tornado's template engine correctly handles these, but it's a good reminder to be aware of such techniques.

### 2.5 Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Never construct template names from user input.** Use a whitelist of allowed template names or a safe lookup mechanism.
2.  **Keep auto-escaping enabled (the default) unless you have a very specific and well-understood reason to disable it.**
3.  **If you *must* disable auto-escaping, always manually escape user data using the appropriate escaping function (`xhtml_escape`, `json_encode`, etc.) before passing it to the template.**  Apply the escaping to the *value* of the variable, not just the variable name.
4.  **Use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of potential exploits.**
5.  **Regularly review your code for potential template injection vulnerabilities, paying close attention to how user input is used in template rendering.**
6.  **Use a static analysis tool that can detect template injection vulnerabilities.**
7.  **Conduct penetration testing to identify and exploit any remaining vulnerabilities.**
8.  **Educate developers about template injection and secure coding practices.**
9. **Consider using template sandboxing techniques if you absolutely must render templates from untrusted sources.** (This is a more advanced technique and requires careful consideration.)
10. **Keep Tornado and its dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.**

### 2.6 Threat Model Refinement

The original threat model entry can be refined as follows:

*   **Threat:** Template Injection (Tornado's Templating Engine)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides input that is used to construct a template name or is directly injected into a template without proper escaping. If auto-escaping is disabled, bypassed (e.g., incorrect use of `{% raw %}`), or insufficient for the context (e.g., JavaScript), the attacker can inject arbitrary template code, which can lead to server-side code execution. This can occur through direct user input, or indirectly through data stored and later retrieved.
    *   **Impact:** Server-side code execution, complete server compromise, sensitive data disclosure, file system access.
    *   **Affected Tornado Component:** `tornado.template.Template`, `RequestHandler.render`, `RequestHandler.render_string`, `UIModule` (if rendering templates with user input).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Avoid using user-supplied data to construct template names. Use a whitelist or safe lookup.
        *   **Primary:** Ensure auto-escaping is enabled (it is by default).
        *   **Conditional (If auto-escaping is disabled):** Use `{% raw ... %}` *only* in conjunction with manual escaping using `tornado.escape.xhtml_escape` (for HTML) or `tornado.escape.json_encode` (for JavaScript/JSON). Apply escaping to the *variable's value*.
        *   **Defense-in-Depth:** Use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of successful exploits (e.g., prevent inline script execution).
        *   **Other:** Regularly review code, use static analysis tools, conduct penetration testing, and educate developers.
    * **Example Vulnerable Code:** (Include the vulnerable code examples from above).
    * **Example Exploits:** (Include the PoC exploit examples from above).
    * **Related Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - if template injection is used to inject JavaScript into the rendered HTML.

This refined entry provides more detail, clarifies the conditions for vulnerability, and offers more specific mitigation advice. It also highlights the importance of defense-in-depth and ongoing security practices.
