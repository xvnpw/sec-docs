# Threat Model Analysis for tornadoweb/tornado

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Asynchronous Handlers](./threats/race_conditions_in_asynchronous_handlers.md)

**Description:** An attacker might send concurrent requests that interact with shared resources within a Tornado handler without proper synchronization. This can lead to unpredictable behavior where the order of operations matters, allowing the attacker to manipulate data or bypass security checks. For example, an attacker might try to purchase an item with insufficient funds by sending multiple purchase requests simultaneously, hoping one goes through before the balance is updated.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**Affected Tornado Component:** Asynchronous Request Handling (specifically within user-defined `RequestHandler` methods and asynchronous operations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement proper locking mechanisms (e.g., `asyncio.Lock`, `threading.Lock`) when accessing shared resources within asynchronous handlers.
*   Use atomic operations where possible.
*   Carefully design asynchronous workflows to avoid dependencies on the order of execution.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Event Loop Saturation](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_event_loop_saturation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send a large number of requests or initiate many long-polling connections that consume significant resources within Tornado's I/O event loop. This can overwhelm the event loop, preventing it from processing legitimate requests and effectively causing a denial of service. For example, an attacker might open thousands of WebSocket connections and keep them idle, consuming server resources.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, degraded performance for legitimate users.

**Affected Tornado Component:** `tornado.ioloop.IOLoop` (the core event loop).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement rate limiting on incoming requests.
*   Set connection limits.
*   Implement timeouts for long-polling connections.
*   Use a reverse proxy with DoS protection capabilities.
*   Monitor server resource usage and implement alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [WebSocket Injection](./threats/websocket_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker connected via WebSocket could send malicious messages containing code (e.g., JavaScript) that is then interpreted and executed by other connected clients or the server itself if not properly handled. For example, an attacker might send a message containing `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` which, if not sanitized, could be executed in the browsers of other connected users.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) within the WebSocket context, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions on behalf of other users.

**Affected Tornado Component:** `tornado.websocket` module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Sanitize and escape all data received from WebSocket messages before displaying it to other users.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts.
*   Treat WebSocket messages as untrusted input.

## Threat: [WebSocket Connection Hijacking](./threats/websocket_connection_hijacking.md)

**Description:** If the initial WebSocket handshake or subsequent communication is not properly secured (e.g., using TLS/WSS), an attacker on the network could potentially intercept the connection and impersonate either the client or the server. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on communication or send malicious messages.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized access, manipulation of data exchanged over the WebSocket.

**Affected Tornado Component:** `tornado.websocket` module, underlying network communication.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always use secure WebSockets (WSS) over TLS.
*   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for WebSocket connections.
*   Ensure the server and client enforce TLS correctly.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** If user-controlled data is directly embedded into Tornado templates without proper escaping or sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious template code that is executed on the server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server. For example, if a user can control part of a template string like `{{ user_input }}`, they might inject `{{ 7*7 }}` or more dangerous code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach.

**Affected Tornado Component:** `tornado.template` module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid directly embedding user-controlled data into templates.
*   Use Tornado's automatic escaping features for template variables.
*   If dynamic template generation is necessary, use a safe templating language or carefully sanitize user input.

## Threat: [Exposure of Debug Information in Production](./threats/exposure_of_debug_information_in_production.md)

**Description:** If the Tornado application is run with `debug=True` in a production environment, it exposes sensitive information such as stack traces, the ability to execute arbitrary code through the web interface (via `/_debug/pprof`), and other internal details. An attacker could leverage this information to understand the application's internals and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, remote code execution, easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Tornado Component:** Application configuration, specifically the `debug` setting.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure `debug=False` is set in production environments.
*   Implement proper logging and error handling that does not expose sensitive information.
