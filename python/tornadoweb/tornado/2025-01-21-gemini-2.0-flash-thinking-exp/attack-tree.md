# Attack Tree Analysis for tornadoweb/tornado

Objective: Compromise the Tornado application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Tornado framework itself (focusing on high-risk areas).

## Attack Tree Path: [Event Loop Blocking/Starvation (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/event_loop_blockingstarvation__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Send malicious requests that consume excessive resources in the event loop.
* **Description:** An attacker sends requests designed to tie up the Tornado event loop, preventing it from processing other requests. This can be achieved through computationally intensive tasks, slow I/O operations, or by exploiting inefficiencies in request handlers.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Denial of Service)
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [WebSocket Resource Exhaustion (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/websocket_resource_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Open a large number of WebSocket connections to overwhelm server resources.
* **Description:** The attacker establishes numerous WebSocket connections to the server, consuming resources like memory, file descriptors, and processing power. This can lead to the server becoming unresponsive or crashing.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Denial of Service)
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious code into template variables to execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Description:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, an attacker can inject template language code that, when rendered, executes arbitrary commands on the server.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Remote Code Execution)
* **Effort:** Medium to High
* **Skill Level:** Medium to High
* **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Debug Mode (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_debug_mode__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Access sensitive information or execute arbitrary code through an unintentionally enabled debug mode.
* **Description:** If Tornado's debug mode is enabled in a production environment, it can expose sensitive information like environment variables, application secrets, and potentially provide interfaces for executing arbitrary code.
* **Likelihood:** Low
* **Impact:** High (Information Disclosure, Remote Code Execution)
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Built-in CSRF Protection (requires manual implementation) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_built-in_csrf_protection__requires_manual_implementation___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Perform Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks if not explicitly implemented.
* **Description:** If the application doesn't implement CSRF protection, an attacker can trick a user's browser into making unintended requests to the application while the user is authenticated. This can lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
* **Likelihood:** High
* **Impact:** Medium (Unauthorized Actions)
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
