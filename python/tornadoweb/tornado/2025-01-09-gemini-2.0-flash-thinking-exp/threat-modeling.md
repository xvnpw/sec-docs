# Threat Model Analysis for tornadoweb/tornado

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Asynchronous Handlers](./threats/race_conditions_in_asynchronous_handlers.md)

**Description:** An attacker might send concurrent requests that exploit shared mutable state within a Tornado handler. Due to the asynchronous nature, the order of operations might become unpredictable, leading to unintended modifications or inconsistencies in the data.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for unauthorized data access or modification depending on the affected data.

**Affected Component:** `tornado.web.RequestHandler` (specifically, handlers that manage shared state and perform asynchronous operations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, mutexes) when accessing shared mutable state within handlers.
*   Design handlers to be stateless or minimize shared state.
*   Use atomic operations where possible.
*   Carefully review asynchronous code for potential race conditions.

## Threat: [Deadlocks due to Improper Asynchronous Operations](./threats/deadlocks_due_to_improper_asynchronous_operations.md)

**Description:** An attacker might trigger a sequence of asynchronous operations that result in a deadlock, where multiple tasks are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to complete. This can be achieved by carefully crafting requests that exploit dependencies between asynchronous calls.

**Impact:** Application hangs, becomes unresponsive, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `tornado.ioloop.IOLoop`, `tornado.gen`, `async`/`await` constructs within handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid circular dependencies in asynchronous operations.
*   Implement timeouts for asynchronous operations to prevent indefinite blocking.
*   Carefully design asynchronous workflows and test for potential deadlocks.
*   Use debugging tools to identify and resolve deadlock situations.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Asynchronous Tasks](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_unbounded_asynchronous_tasks.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send numerous requests that trigger the creation of a large number of asynchronous tasks (e.g., spawning many connections, initiating many background processes) without proper limits. This can overwhelm server resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors).

**Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, server instability.

**Affected Component:** `tornado.gen`, `tornado.concurrent`, any part of the application that spawns asynchronous tasks in response to requests.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement rate limiting on incoming requests.
*   Set limits on the number of concurrent asynchronous tasks.
*   Use task queues with bounded size.
*   Implement proper resource management and cleanup for asynchronous tasks.

## Threat: [WebSocket Injection (Command Injection via WebSockets)](./threats/websocket_injection__command_injection_via_websockets_.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends malicious data through a WebSocket connection that is not properly sanitized or validated by the server. The server-side application then processes this data, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the server.

**Affected Component:** `tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler` (specifically, the methods that handle incoming WebSocket messages).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data received over WebSockets.
*   Avoid directly executing commands based on WebSocket input.
*   Use parameterized queries or safe APIs when interacting with databases or other systems.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to the application's processes.

## Threat: [WebSocket Denial of Service](./threats/websocket_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of WebSocket connections or sends a flood of messages through existing connections, overwhelming the server's resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability.

**Affected Component:** `tornado.websocket` module, the WebSocket connection handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement rate limiting on WebSocket connections and messages.
*   Set limits on the number of concurrent WebSocket connections per client.
*   Implement connection timeouts.
*   Use appropriate infrastructure to handle a large number of concurrent connections.

## Threat: [Lack of Proper WebSocket Authentication/Authorization](./threats/lack_of_proper_websocket_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Description:** An attacker can establish a WebSocket connection without proper authentication or authorization checks, allowing them to access and interact with WebSocket endpoints that should be restricted.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application functionality, data breaches, potential for malicious actions.

**Affected Component:** `tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler`, application-level authentication and authorization logic for WebSocket connections.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust authentication mechanisms for WebSocket connections (e.g., using session cookies, JWTs, or custom authentication headers).
*   Enforce authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can access specific WebSocket endpoints and perform certain actions.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** If user-controlled data is directly embedded into Tornado templates without proper escaping, an attacker can inject malicious template code that is then executed on the server during template rendering.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the server.

**Affected Component:** `tornado.template` module, specifically when rendering templates with user-provided data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always use proper escaping when rendering user-provided data in templates.
*   Avoid allowing users to directly control template code or file paths.
*   Consider using a template engine that automatically escapes output by default.

## Threat: [Insecure Cookie Attributes](./threats/insecure_cookie_attributes.md)

**Description:** If Tornado's cookie settings are not configured securely (e.g., missing `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags), cookies might be vulnerable to client-side scripting attacks (XSS) or interception over insecure connections.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, exposure of sensitive information stored in cookies.

**Affected Component:** `tornado.web.RequestHandler` (methods for setting cookies).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always set the `HttpOnly` flag for session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access.
*   Set the `Secure` flag for session cookies to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.
*   Consider using the `SameSite` attribute to mitigate CSRF attacks.

## Threat: [Predictable Session IDs](./threats/predictable_session_ids.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on Tornado's basic session handling without customization, or if a custom session implementation uses a weak random number generator, session IDs might be predictable, allowing an attacker to guess valid session IDs and hijack user sessions.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Affected Component:** Tornado's session management (if used) or custom session implementation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Use a cryptographically secure random number generator for generating session IDs.
*   Implement proper session invalidation mechanisms.
*   Consider using a well-vetted session management library.

## Threat: [Running in Debug Mode in Production](./threats/running_in_debug_mode_in_production.md)

**Description:** Leaving Tornado's debug mode enabled in a production environment exposes sensitive information (e.g., stack traces, auto-reloading) and can introduce security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution through debugging tools.

**Affected Component:** Tornado application configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure debug mode is disabled in production deployments.
*   Use environment variables or configuration files to manage debug settings.
