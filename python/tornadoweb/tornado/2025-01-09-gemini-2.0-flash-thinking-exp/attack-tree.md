## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on manipulating HTTP requests to bypass security measures and exploit application logic.
  * CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Security Measures via Request Manipulation
    Attackers modify request headers or arguments to circumvent authentication, authorization, or other security controls.
    * CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application Logic based on injected headers
      Attackers inject malicious data into HTTP headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, `Host`) to trick the application into making incorrect decisions, such as bypassing IP restrictions or routing requests to unintended locations.
    * CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application Logic based on injected arguments
      Attackers inject malicious data into URL parameters or POST data to exploit vulnerabilities like command injection (executing arbitrary commands on the server) or SQL injection (manipulating database queries).

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service through Request Flooding](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service_through_request_flooding.md)

This path aims to make the application unavailable by overwhelming it with a large number of requests.
  * CRITICAL NODE: Overwhelm Tornado's event loop with a large number of requests
    Attackers send a high volume of HTTP requests to the Tornado server, exceeding its capacity to handle them. This can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), making the application unresponsive to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

This path involves exploiting insecurely configured settings of the Tornado application.
  * CRITICAL NODE: Leverage Insecure Configuration Options
    Attackers exploit misconfigured settings that expose sensitive information or create security loopholes.
    * CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Debug Mode Enabled in Production
      Leaving debug mode enabled in a production environment exposes sensitive information like source code, internal state, and allows execution of arbitrary code through debug endpoints.
    * CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Insecure Cookie Settings
      Missing `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies make them vulnerable to client-side scripting attacks (XSS) and man-in-the-middle attacks, respectively. Weak cookie encryption allows attackers to forge session cookies.
  * CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Default `cookie_secret`
    If the default `cookie_secret` is used, attackers can easily forge or decrypt session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Tornado Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tornado_core_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on exploiting known vulnerabilities within the Tornado framework itself.
  * CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Known Tornado Vulnerabilities
    Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Tornado being used by the application. These vulnerabilities can range from denial of service to remote code execution.
