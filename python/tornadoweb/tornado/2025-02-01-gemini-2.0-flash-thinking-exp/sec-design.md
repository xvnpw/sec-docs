# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a high-performance, scalable web server and asynchronous networking library.
  - Enable development of real-time web applications, long polling, WebSockets, and other applications requiring long-lived connections.
  - Offer a flexible and easy-to-use framework for building web applications in Python.
  - Maintain an active and supportive open-source community.

- Business Risks:
  - Performance bottlenecks under high load could impact application availability and user experience.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the web server or framework could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or other security incidents.
  - Lack of community support or slow response to security issues could deter adoption and impact user trust.
  - Compatibility issues with evolving Python versions or dependencies could require significant maintenance effort.
  - Misuse of asynchronous features could lead to complex code and potential concurrency bugs.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: TLS/SSL support for HTTPS to encrypt communication. Implemented in `tornado.httpserver` and configurable via `ssl_options`.
  - security control: Input validation and sanitization are expected to be implemented by application developers using Tornado. Documented in Tornado documentation regarding request handling.
  - security control: Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) is the responsibility of the application developer using Tornado. Guidance and tools might be available in the documentation or community resources.
  - security control: Cookie security attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) can be configured to mitigate cookie-based attacks. Implemented in `tornado.web.RequestHandler.set_cookie`.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Security of applications built on top of Tornado is primarily the responsibility of the application developers. Tornado provides tools and features, but secure application design and implementation are crucial.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on application developers to implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service attacks if applications are not designed to handle resource exhaustion or malicious requests.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security testing in the CI/CD pipeline, including Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
  - security control: Regularly perform dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Tornado and applications built on it.
  - security control: Encourage and provide guidelines for developers to follow secure coding practices, including input validation, output encoding, and secure session management.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and request throttling to mitigate denial-of-service attacks. This could be implemented at the application level or using a reverse proxy/load balancer.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in Tornado and applications built on it.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Applications built with Tornado should implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
    - Support for various authentication methods should be considered, such as username/password, multi-factor authentication, OAuth 2.0, and API keys, depending on the application requirements.
    - Tornado should provide mechanisms to integrate with existing authentication systems or libraries.
  - Authorization:
    - Applications should implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage user access to resources and functionalities.
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) should be considered based on application complexity.
    - Tornado should provide mechanisms to enforce authorization policies within request handlers.
  - Input Validation:
    - All user inputs, including HTTP headers, query parameters, request body, and file uploads, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side.
    - Tornado applications should utilize input validation libraries and frameworks to simplify and standardize validation processes.
  - Cryptography:
    - Sensitive data at rest and in transit must be protected using strong encryption algorithms.
    - HTTPS should be enforced for all communication involving sensitive data.
    - Secure storage of cryptographic keys and secrets is essential.
    - Tornado applications should leverage secure cryptographic libraries for encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Serving web applications and APIs to end-users and other systems.
  - Handling real-time communication via WebSockets for interactive applications.
  - Providing asynchronous networking capabilities for high-performance applications.
  - Ensuring availability and performance of web services built on Tornado.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Application data: Data processed and stored by applications built on Tornado. Sensitivity depends on the specific application (e.g., user data, financial transactions, personal information).
  - User session data: Data related to user sessions, potentially including authentication tokens or session identifiers. Sensitivity is high as compromise can lead to unauthorized access.
  - Application configuration data: Configuration settings for Tornado applications, potentially including database credentials or API keys. Sensitivity is high as compromise can lead to system compromise.
  - Logs: Application and server logs, potentially containing sensitive information depending on logging practices. Sensitivity depends on the content of logs.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific types of applications being built using Tornado in the target context? (e.g., real-time chat, API server, web dashboard). This would help to refine security requirements and risk assessment.
  - What is the expected scale and performance requirements for Tornado deployments? This will influence deployment architecture and security controls (e.g., DDoS protection).
  - What are the compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that the applications built on Tornado need to adhere to? This will dictate specific security controls and data protection measures.
  - What existing security infrastructure and tools are already in place in the target environment? This will help to integrate recommended security controls effectively.

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to build and deploy high-performance, scalable web applications and services. Security is a significant concern, but performance and availability are also critical.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is considered important, but the current focus might be more on functionality and development speed. There are basic security controls in place (TLS), but more comprehensive security measures are needed. Application developers are expected to handle application-level security.
  - DESIGN: Tornado is deployed in a typical web application architecture, likely behind a reverse proxy/load balancer, with database and cache systems. The build process involves standard CI/CD practices, but security checks might not be fully integrated yet.
