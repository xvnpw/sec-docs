# Attack Surface Analysis for tornadoweb/tornado

## Attack Surface: [Asynchronous Request Flooding (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/asynchronous_request_flooding__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the server by sending a large volume of asynchronous requests that consume resources without quickly completing, leading to service disruption.
*   **Tornado Contribution:** Tornado's non-blocking I/O and asynchronous nature, while efficient, can make it easier for attackers to initiate and maintain a high volume of concurrent requests, potentially exhausting server resources.
*   **Example:** An attacker scripts a botnet to send thousands of requests to a Tornado application endpoint that triggers a resource-intensive operation. The server becomes overloaded and unable to handle legitimate user requests.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, financial losses due to downtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement request rate limiting at the application level or using a reverse proxy.
    *   Set limits on resources consumed by each request (e.g., database connections, API timeouts).
    *   Implement request prioritization and load balancing.
    *   Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions in Asynchronous Handlers](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_in_asynchronous_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**  Concurrent asynchronous requests interact with shared application state in an unsynchronized manner, leading to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Tornado Contribution:** Tornado's asynchronous programming model encourages concurrency, increasing the likelihood of race conditions if developers are not careful about managing shared state and synchronization.
*   **Example:** Two concurrent requests attempt to update a user's account balance. Due to a race condition, the final balance might be incorrect, leading to financial discrepancies or unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, security bypasses (e.g., unauthorized access).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize shared mutable state within asynchronous handlers.
    *   Use synchronization primitives like locks (`asyncio.Lock`, `threading.Lock`) or atomic operations.
    *   Employ database transactions for atomic operations.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews and concurrency testing.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template variables that are not properly sanitized, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server when the template is rendered.
*   **Tornado Contribution:** If using Tornado's built-in template engine (`tornado.template`) and directly embedding user-provided data into templates without proper escaping, it becomes vulnerable to SSTI.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious code like `{{ system('rm -rf /') }}` into a user-controlled template variable. If rendered without escaping, the code executes on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always escape user-provided data before embedding it into templates using Tornado's escaping mechanisms.
    *   Consider template sandboxing (with caution).
    *   Validate and sanitize user input before template rendering.
    *   Run the Tornado application with minimal privileges.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Static File Serving](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_static_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URLs to access files outside the intended static file directory when using `tornado.web.StaticFileHandler`.
*   **Tornado Contribution:** Improper configuration of `tornado.web.StaticFileHandler` without sufficient restrictions on the `path` argument can allow directory traversal.
*   **Example:** A `StaticFileHandler` is configured for `/static/`. An attacker crafts a URL like `/static/../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, source code disclosure, configuration file access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict the `path` argument of `StaticFileHandler` to the intended static file directory.
    *   Sanitize and validate user-provided paths or filenames.
    *   Apply principle of least privilege to file system permissions for the Tornado process.
    *   Conduct regular security audits of `StaticFileHandler` configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Route Matching](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_route_matching.md)

*   **Description:** Complex and vulnerable regular expressions in route definitions can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption during route matching, leading to DoS.
*   **Tornado Contribution:** Tornado's routing uses regular expressions for URL matching. Vulnerable regex patterns can be exploited for ReDoS.
*   **Example:** A route uses a vulnerable regex like `r"^(a+)+$"`. An attacker sends a URL like `/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!` causing excessive CPU usage during route matching.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Design route regular expressions to be efficient and avoid ReDoS-vulnerable patterns.
    *   Test regular expressions for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   Limit regex complexity and consider simpler routing methods.
    *   Implement request timeouts.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Injection (XSS via WebSockets)](./attack_surfaces/websocket_injection__xss_via_websockets_.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious payloads injected into WebSocket messages are not properly sanitized and are reflected back to other clients, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Tornado Contribution:**  Unsanitized WebSocket handlers in Tornado applications can become a vector for XSS if messages are not validated and escaped.
*   **Example:** In a chat application, an attacker sends a WebSocket message with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If broadcasted unsanitized, other clients' browsers will execute the script.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), session hijacking, malicious actions performed on behalf of users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received from WebSocket clients.
    *   Encode or escape data before sending it back to WebSocket clients, using context-aware escaping.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   Regularly audit WebSocket handlers for injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Debug Mode in Production](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_debug_mode_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving Tornado's debug mode enabled in production environments exposes sensitive information and potentially allows remote code execution.
*   **Tornado Contribution:** Tornado has a debug mode that is intended for development but must be disabled in production.
*   **Example:** Debug mode is left enabled in production. Attackers access debug endpoints, view stack traces, application state, or potentially use debugging tools to execute code.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, remote code execution, full server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable debug mode in production deployments.** Ensure `debug=False` is set in `tornado.web.Application` settings for production.
    *   Implement proper configuration management to ensure debug mode is consistently disabled in production environments.
    *   Regularly review application configuration to verify debug mode is disabled.
