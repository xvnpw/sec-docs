# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tornadoweb/tornado

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Tornado's Auto-escaping Template Engine](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_tornado's_auto-escaping_template_engine.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all template rendering locations:** Review your Tornado application code and identify all places where you are rendering templates using `tornado.template.Template.generate()` or `tornado.web.RequestHandler.render()`, `render_string()`. 
    2.  **Ensure variables are rendered within template tags:**  Verify that all dynamic data intended for display in HTML is being passed to the template and rendered using template tags like `{{ variable }}`.
    3.  **Avoid manual HTML string construction:**  Refrain from manually concatenating strings to build HTML output, especially when including user-provided data. This bypasses auto-escaping.
    4.  **Review template code:**  Inspect your template files (`.html` or similar) to confirm that dynamic content is consistently rendered using template tags and not directly embedded as plain text.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (High Severity):**  Mitigates reflected XSS by automatically encoding output, preventing injected scripts from being executed in the user's browser.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of stored XSS if data is escaped upon output, even if it wasn't sanitized on input. However, input sanitization is still crucial for robust protection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Reflected (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of reflected XSS by default.
    *   **XSS - Stored (Medium Impact):** Provides a layer of defense against stored XSS, but not a complete solution.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Yes, Globally Implemented:** Tornado's auto-escaping is enabled by default for all templates rendered using `RequestHandler.render()` and `render_string()` throughout the application. This is a framework-level feature.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **None:** Auto-escaping is a default feature. However, developers need to be aware of it and avoid bypassing it by manually constructing HTML strings. Continuous code review is needed to ensure adherence.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) via Tornado Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__via_tornado_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define your CSP policy:**  Determine the appropriate CSP directives for your application. Start with a restrictive policy and gradually relax it as needed. Key directives include `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, `connect-src`, `frame-ancestors`, etc.  For example: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://trusted-cdn.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:;`
    2.  **Configure CSP header in Tornado:**  Implement a custom `RequestHandler` method (e.g., `set_default_headers()`) or middleware to add the `Content-Security-Policy` header to all responses.  This leverages Tornado's request handling mechanism to set headers.
    3.  **Test your CSP policy:**  Thoroughly test your CSP policy in a staging environment. Use browser developer tools to identify and resolve any CSP violations.  Start with `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header to monitor violations without blocking content initially.
    4.  **Deploy CSP policy:**  Once tested and refined, deploy the CSP policy by setting the `Content-Security-Policy` header in production.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected and Stored (High Severity):**  CSP significantly reduces the impact of both reflected and stored XSS attacks by limiting the attacker's ability to execute injected scripts, even if they bypass other defenses.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):**  `frame-ancestors` directive can mitigate clickjacking attacks by controlling where your application can be framed.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks (Low to Medium Severity):**  Can limit the impact of certain data injection attacks by restricting allowed sources for resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Reflected and Stored (High Impact):**  Provides a strong defense-in-depth layer against XSS.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Impact):**  Effectively mitigates clickjacking when `frame-ancestors` is properly configured.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks (Low to Medium Impact):**  Reduces the attack surface for certain injection attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** A basic CSP header is set in the base `RequestHandler` in `app/base_handler.py`, but it is very permissive (`default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data:;`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Refine CSP Policy:** The current CSP policy needs to be significantly tightened. Remove `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` where possible.  Specifically, `script-src` and `style-src` should be reviewed and made more restrictive.
    *   **Report-URI/report-to:** Implement CSP reporting using `report-uri` or `report-to` directives to monitor and analyze CSP violations in production.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Tornado's Built-in CSRF Protection](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tornado's_built-in_csrf_protection.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set `xsrf_cookies` to `True`:** In your Tornado application settings dictionary, ensure that `xsrf_cookies` is set to `True`. This enables CSRF protection globally using Tornado's built-in mechanism.
    2.  **Use `@tornado.web.authenticated` decorator:** Apply the `@tornado.web.authenticated` decorator to all `RequestHandler` methods that handle state-changing operations (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE requests). This decorator, provided by Tornado, automatically checks for a valid CSRF token.
    3.  **Include `{% raw xsrf_form_html() %}` in forms:** In your HTML templates for forms that submit data via POST, include the `{% raw xsrf_form_html() %}` template tag within the `<form>` element. This Tornado template tag injects a hidden input field containing the CSRF token.
    4.  **Handle CSRF token in AJAX requests:** For AJAX requests that modify server-side state, retrieve the CSRF token from the `_xsrf` cookie (set by Tornado) using JavaScript and include it in the request headers (e.g., `X-XSRFToken`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High Severity):**  Protects against CSRF attacks by ensuring that state-changing requests originate from legitimate user actions within your application and not from malicious cross-site requests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF (High Impact):** Effectively mitigates CSRF attacks when properly implemented across the application using Tornado's features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** `xsrf_cookies` is set to `True` in `config/settings.py`. The `@tornado.web.authenticated` decorator is used in some handlers, but not consistently across all state-changing operations. `{% raw xsrf_form_html() %}` is used in some forms, but not all. AJAX CSRF handling is not consistently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent `@tornado.web.authenticated` Usage:**  Thoroughly review all `RequestHandler` methods that handle POST, PUT, DELETE requests and ensure the `@tornado.web.authenticated` decorator is applied to all of them.
    *   **`{% raw xsrf_form_html() %}` in all Forms:**  Ensure that `{% raw xsrf_form_html() %}` is included in all HTML forms that submit data via POST.
    *   **AJAX CSRF Token Handling:** Implement consistent CSRF token handling for all AJAX requests that modify server-side state, leveraging the `_xsrf` cookie set by Tornado. Create a JavaScript utility function to retrieve the `_xsrf` cookie and set the `X-XSRFToken` header for AJAX requests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Origin Validation for WebSocket Connections in Tornado Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/origin_validation_for_websocket_connections_in_tornado_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement `open()` method in WebSocket handler:**  Ensure your Tornado WebSocket handler class has an `open()` method, which is the entry point for WebSocket connections in Tornado.
    2.  **Retrieve `Origin` header:** Inside the `open()` method, access the `Origin` header from the `self.request.headers` dictionary, which is Tornado's way of providing request information.
    3.  **Whitelist allowed origins:** Create a list or set of allowed origins for your WebSocket connections. This should include the expected origin(s) of your application.
    4.  **Validate `Origin` header:** Compare the `Origin` header value with your whitelist of allowed origins.
    5.  **Reject invalid origins:** If the `Origin` header is not in the whitelist, close the WebSocket connection using `self.close()` and log the rejected connection attempt. `self.close()` is the Tornado method for closing WebSocket connections.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (Medium Severity):** Prevents malicious websites from establishing WebSocket connections to your application on behalf of unsuspecting users, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (Medium Impact):** Effectively mitigates cross-site WebSocket hijacking by ensuring connections originate from trusted origins, leveraging Tornado's WebSocket handling.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Origin validation is not currently implemented in any WebSocket handlers in the project. WebSocket connections are accepted from any origin.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Implement Origin Validation in WebSocket Handlers:**  Modify all Tornado WebSocket handler classes to include origin validation in their `open()` methods as described above. Define a whitelist of allowed origins in the application configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Secure Session Cookies via Tornado `cookie_settings`](./mitigation_strategies/configure_secure_session_cookies_via_tornado__cookie_settings_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `cookie_settings` in application settings:** In your Tornado application settings dictionary, configure the `cookie_settings` dictionary. This is Tornado's mechanism for setting cookie attributes.
    2.  **Set `httponly=True`:** Add or modify the `httponly` key within `cookie_settings` and set it to `True`. This will instruct Tornado to add the `HttpOnly` flag to session cookies it sets.
    3.  **Set `secure=True`:** Add or modify the `secure` key within `cookie_settings` and set it to `True`. This will instruct Tornado to add the `Secure` flag to session cookies, ensuring they are only transmitted over HTTPS.
    4.  **Ensure HTTPS is enforced:** Verify that your application is configured to enforce HTTPS for all communication, as the `secure` flag is only effective over HTTPS.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Hijacking via XSS (Medium Severity):** `HttpOnly` flag prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing session cookies, mitigating session hijacking through XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Session Hijacking via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Medium Severity):** `Secure` flag prevents session cookies from being transmitted over insecure HTTP connections, protecting against MitM attacks on non-HTTPS connections.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking via XSS (Medium Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of session hijacking via XSS.
    *   **Session Hijacking via MitM (Medium Impact):**  Effectively mitigates session hijacking via MitM attacks when HTTPS is enforced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** `secure=True` is set in `cookie_settings` in `config/settings.py`. However, `httponly=True` is missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Enable `httponly=True`:** Add `httponly=True` to the `cookie_settings` in `config/settings.py` to enable the `HttpOnly` flag for session cookies managed by Tornado.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Rate Limiting (Leveraging Tornado's Asynchronous Nature)](./mitigation_strategies/request_rate_limiting__leveraging_tornado's_asynchronous_nature_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a rate limiting mechanism:** Select a rate limiting approach. Options include:
        *   **Middleware:** Implement custom middleware to intercept requests and apply rate limiting logic within Tornado's middleware framework.
        *   **Decorator:** Create a decorator that can be applied to individual `RequestHandler` methods to enforce rate limits, utilizing Tornado's decorator capabilities.
        *   **Third-party libraries:** Utilize existing Tornado rate limiting libraries designed for asynchronous environments.
    2.  **Define rate limits:** Determine appropriate rate limits for different endpoints or user roles. Consider factors like request frequency, resource consumption, and expected user behavior.
    3.  **Implement rate limiting logic:** Implement the chosen rate limiting mechanism, ensuring it's compatible with Tornado's asynchronous request handling. This typically involves:
        *   **Identifying clients:**  Use IP addresses, user IDs, or API keys to identify clients.
        *   **Tracking request counts:**  Maintain counters for each client within a time window (e.g., using in-memory dictionaries, Redis, Memcached), ensuring thread-safety if needed in a multi-process Tornado setup.
        *   **Enforcing limits:**  Check the request count for each client before processing a request. If the limit is exceeded, return a 429 Too Many Requests error response using Tornado's `set_status` and `finish` methods.
        4.  **Customize error response:**  Provide a clear and informative 429 error response to clients when rate limits are exceeded, potentially including information about retry-after time, using Tornado's response handling.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):**  Limits the rate of requests, making brute-force attacks (e.g., password guessing, resource exhaustion) significantly less effective.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Application-Level Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Protects against application-level DoS attacks that attempt to overwhelm the server with a high volume of legitimate-looking requests. Tornado's asynchronous nature helps in handling many connections, but rate limiting is still crucial.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS - Brute-Force Attacks (High Impact):**  Effectively mitigates brute-force attacks.
    *   **DoS - Application-Level Attacks (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the impact of application-level DoS attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented:** Request rate limiting is not currently implemented anywhere in the application. There are no mechanisms to limit the number of requests from a single IP or user.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Implement Global Rate Limiting Middleware:** Implement a middleware component within Tornado's middleware framework that applies rate limiting to all or critical endpoints based on IP address.
    *   **Endpoint-Specific Rate Limiting:**  Consider implementing more granular rate limiting for specific endpoints that are more resource-intensive or prone to abuse, potentially using decorators on Tornado `RequestHandler` methods.
