### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded SECRET_KEY in Dockerfile

- Description:
    1. An attacker obtains the `standalone/Dockerfile` from the project's public repository.
    2. The attacker inspects the Dockerfile and finds the line setting `DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY` to `foo`.
    3. The attacker realizes that any django-helpdesk instance deployed using this Dockerfile will use the insecure, hardcoded SECRET_KEY `foo`.
    4. The attacker can leverage this known SECRET_KEY to compromise instances, potentially gaining unauthorized access and control.

- Impact:
    Critical. A hardcoded SECRET_KEY allows an attacker to bypass security measures that rely on the secrecy of this key. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking: An attacker can forge session cookies to impersonate legitimate users, including administrators.
    - CSRF bypass: If CSRF protection is enabled but not fully secure (e.g., missing `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` flag allowing JavaScript access to the token and XSS attack possible), the attacker can forge CSRF tokens to perform actions on behalf of users.
    - Data manipulation and unauthorized access: With administrative access gained through session hijacking, attackers can access, modify, or delete sensitive data, and alter the application's configuration.
    - Potential cryptographic attacks: If the SECRET_KEY is used for cryptographic operations beyond session and CSRF token signing (less likely but possible depending on application's design), it could lead to more severe exploits.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The provided `standalone/Dockerfile` directly introduces this vulnerability by hardcoding the SECRET_KEY. There is no mitigation within the Dockerfile or the provided project files.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Remove the hardcoded SECRET_KEY from the Dockerfile:** The `DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY=foo` line should be removed.
    - **Generate SECRET_KEY dynamically:** The SECRET_KEY should be generated randomly at container startup. This can be achieved in the `entrypoint.sh` script.
    - **Utilize environment variables:** The Dockerfile and `entrypoint.sh` should be modified to expect the `DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY` to be passed as an environment variable during container runtime, rather than being set during image build time.
    - **Documentation update:** The documentation for standalone deployment needs to be updated to explicitly warn users against using the default Dockerfile in production and guide them on how to properly set a strong, unique SECRET_KEY.

- Preconditions:
    - A django-helpdesk instance is deployed using the provided `standalone/Dockerfile` without modifying the SECRET_KEY configuration.
    - The deployed instance is publicly accessible to potential attackers.
    - The attacker has access to the project's `standalone/Dockerfile` (which is publicly available in the GitHub repository).

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/standalone/Dockerfile`
    - Line: `RUN DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY=foo python3 standalone/manage.py collectstatic`

    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.11-slim-bullseye
    LABEL src=https://github.com/django-helpdesk/django-helpdesk
    RUN apt-get update
    RUN apt-get install -yqq \
       postgresql-common \
       postgresql-client \
       cron \
       git
    COPY . /opt/
    RUN pip3 install -r /opt/django-helpdesk/requirements.txt
    RUN pip3 install -r /opt/django-helpdesk/standalone/requirements.txt
    WORKDIR /opt/django-helpdesk
    RUN pip3 install -e .
    RUN DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY=foo python3 standalone/manage.py collectstatic  <-- Vulnerable line
    RUN echo "* * * * * root . /etc/env && /usr/local/bin/python3 /opt/django-helpdesk/standalone/manage.py get_email >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1" > /etc/crontab
    RUN chmod 0644 /etc/crontab
    ENTRYPOINT sh /opt/django-helpdesk/standalone/entrypoint.sh
    ```
    - The `RUN DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY=foo ...` command executes during the Docker image build process.
    - This command sets the environment variable `DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY` to the value `foo`.
    - The subsequent `collectstatic` command, and any Django application run from this image, will use this hardcoded `SECRET_KEY`.
    - Docker image layers preserve environment variables set during build, making this SECRET_KEY persistent within the image.

- Security test case:
    1. **Build the Docker image:**
       ```bash
       docker build -f standalone/Dockerfile -t test-helpdesk .
       ```
    2. **Run a container in interactive mode and access the Django shell:**
       ```bash
       docker run -it test-helpdesk /bin/bash
       ```
    3. **Inside the container's shell, start a Python shell within the Django project:**
       ```bash
       python3 standalone/manage.py shell
       ```
    4. **Retrieve and print the `SECRET_KEY` from Django settings:**
       ```python
       from django.conf import settings
       print(settings.SECRET_KEY)
       exit()
       ```
    5. **Verify the SECRET_KEY:** Observe that the output in the shell is indeed `foo`, confirming the hardcoded insecure SECRET_KEY.
    6. **(Optional but Recommended) Demonstrate Session Hijacking (Conceptual Test):**
        - In a real-world scenario, with `SECRET_KEY='foo'`, an attacker could attempt to analyze how Django signs session cookies. While not trivial to immediately exploit, a known SECRET_KEY significantly reduces the security of Django's session management and CSRF protection. A full proof of concept would involve crafting a forged session cookie using the known `SECRET_KEY` and attempting to authenticate as another user. However, for the purpose of this test case, confirming the hardcoded key is sufficient to demonstrate the critical vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates that the `standalone/Dockerfile` indeed results in a Django instance with a publicly known, insecure `SECRET_KEY`, confirming the critical vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure SECRET_KEY and POSTGRES_PASSWORD Generation and Storage in `setup.sh`

- Description:
    1. An attacker obtains the `standalone/setup.sh` script from the project's public repository.
    2. The attacker inspects the `setup.sh` and finds that it uses `mcookie` to generate `DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in the `docker.env` file.
    3. The attacker understands that `mcookie` is intended for temporary magic cookies and not for generating cryptographically secure secrets.
    4. The attacker realizes that instances deployed using `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose-dev.yml` with the default `setup.sh` will use secrets generated by `mcookie`, which are predictable and insecure.
    5. Additionally, the attacker notes that these secrets are stored in `docker.env`, a file that might be inadvertently exposed or accessed if the container is compromised.
    6. The attacker can potentially exploit the weak `SECRET_KEY` for session hijacking, CSRF bypass, and other attacks (as described in the "Hardcoded SECRET_KEY" vulnerability). The weak `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` could be used to gain unauthorized access to the database.

- Impact:
    Critical. The use of `mcookie` for generating `SECRET_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and storing them in `docker.env` leads to several critical security risks:
    - **Predictable Secrets:** `mcookie` is not designed for cryptographic security, making the generated secrets predictable and weak.
    - **Compromised SECRET_KEY:** A weak `SECRET_KEY` allows attackers to perform session hijacking, CSRF bypass, and potentially other cryptographic attacks.
    - **Compromised Database Credentials:** A weak `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` can allow unauthorized database access, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    - **Exposed Secrets in `docker.env`:** Storing secrets in a file like `docker.env` increases the risk of accidental exposure or compromise if the container or file system is accessed by an attacker.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The `standalone/setup.sh` script directly introduces this vulnerability by using `mcookie` and storing secrets in `docker.env`. There is no mitigation within the script or the provided project files.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Use cryptographically secure random secret generation:** Replace `mcookie` with a cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 32` or Python's `secrets` module) for generating both `DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
    - **Avoid storing secrets in `docker.env`:**  Instead of writing secrets to `docker.env`, generate them directly as environment variables within `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose-dev.yml` or rely on external secret management solutions. For local development, consider using `.env` files that are not committed to the repository.
    - **Documentation update:** Update the documentation to strongly advise users against using `setup.sh` in production and guide them on securely generating and managing `SECRET_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Emphasize the importance of strong, unique secrets and secure secret storage.

- Preconditions:
    - A django-helpdesk instance is deployed using `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose-dev.yml` and the default `standalone/setup.sh` script is executed.
    - The deployed instance is publicly accessible to potential attackers.
    - The attacker has access to the project's `standalone/setup.sh` script (which is publicly available in the GitHub repository).

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/standalone/setup.sh`
    - Lines:
      ```bash
      echo "DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY="$(mcookie) >> docker.env
      echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD="$(mcookie) >> docker.env
      ```

    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh

    # if docker.env does not exist create it from the template
    if [ ! -f docker.env ]; then
        cp docker.env.template docker.env
        echo "DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY="$(mcookie) >> docker.env  <-- Vulnerable line 1
        echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD="$(mcookie) >> docker.env           <-- Vulnerable line 2
    fi
    ```
    - The `setup.sh` script checks if `docker.env` exists. If not, it copies `docker.env.template` to `docker.env`.
    - It then appends `DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to `docker.env`, generating their values using the `mcookie` command.
    - `mcookie` is intended for generating magic cookies for X11 authentication and is not a cryptographically secure random number generator.
    - The generated secrets are then stored in plain text within the `docker.env` file.

- Security test case:
    1. **Run `setup.sh` script:**
       ```bash
       cd standalone/
       sh setup.sh
       ```
    2. **Inspect `docker.env` file:**
       ```bash
       cat docker.env
       ```
    3. **Verify SECRET_KEY and POSTGRES_PASSWORD:** Observe the values of `DJANGO_HELPDESK_SECRET_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `docker.env`.
    4. **Repeat step 1 and 2 multiple times:** Run `setup.sh` again and inspect `docker.env`. Notice that `mcookie` might generate predictable or less random secrets compared to cryptographically secure methods. (Note: `mcookie`'s output might not be *completely* static, but it's not cryptographically strong).
    5. **Demonstrate predictability (Conceptual):**  In a real-world scenario, an attacker could research `mcookie`'s algorithm and potentially predict the generated secrets, especially if they know the system's state or timing when `mcookie` was executed. While not easily demonstrated in a simple test case, the inherent weakness of `mcookie` for secret generation is the core vulnerability.
    6. **Demonstrate persistent storage in `docker.env`:** The secrets remain in `docker.env` even after multiple executions of `setup.sh`, highlighting the risk of persistent storage in a file that might be inadvertently exposed.

This test case demonstrates that `standalone/setup.sh` uses an insecure method (`mcookie`) to generate `SECRET_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and stores them in a plain text file (`docker.env`), confirming the critical vulnerability related to weak secret generation and storage.

- Vulnerability Name: Inconsistent Access Control in `can_access_ticket`

- Description:
    1. An attacker analyzes the `helpdesk/user.py` file, specifically the `HelpdeskUser` class and the `can_access_ticket` method.
    2. The attacker notices that `can_access_ticket` grants access if *any* of the following conditions are met:
        - `self.can_access_queue(ticket.queue)`: User can access the ticket's queue.
        - `self.has_full_access()`: User has full access (superuser, staff, or `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` is True).
        - `(ticket.assigned_to and user.id == ticket.assigned_to.id)`: User is assigned to the ticket.
    3. The attacker recognizes that if `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` is set to True, then `self.has_full_access()` becomes True for *any* authenticated user.
    4. The attacker realizes that by simply being logged in, a non-staff user can bypass queue-level permissions and potentially access *any* ticket in the system if `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` is enabled.
    5. The attacker understands that this configuration may not be intended, as it effectively nullifies per-queue staff permissions for ticket access if `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` is enabled.

- Impact:
    High. Inconsistent access control can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive ticket information. Specifically:
    - **Unauthorized Ticket Access:** Non-staff users, intended to only access their own tickets or public tickets, may gain access to tickets in queues they are not meant to access if `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` is True.
    - **Data Breach Potential:** If tickets contain sensitive information, unauthorized access by non-staff users could lead to data breaches.
    - **Circumvention of Intended Security Policy:** The intended per-queue permission model can be undermined, leading to a weaker security posture than expected.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The current implementation of `can_access_ticket` in `helpdesk/user.py`, combined with the setting `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE`, creates this vulnerability. There is no mitigation in the provided code.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Re-evaluate the logic in `can_access_ticket`:**  The `has_full_access()` check, when `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` is True, should likely be removed or refined to ensure it doesn't bypass intended queue-level permissions for ticket access. If non-staff users are to be granted broader access, it should be clearly defined and controlled, not an unintended side-effect of a setting meant for ticket *updates*.
    - **Clarify `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` setting's purpose and implications in documentation:** The documentation for this setting should explicitly state that setting it to True will grant *all* authenticated users "full access" to tickets, potentially bypassing per-queue access controls. This will help administrators make informed decisions about this setting.
    - **Consider separating settings for ticket updates and ticket access:** If the intent of `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` is only to allow non-staff users to update *their own* tickets or public tickets, a more granular access control mechanism should be implemented, separating permissions for ticket updates from general ticket access.

- Preconditions:
    - `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` is set to True in `helpdesk/settings.py` or Django settings.
    - An attacker has a valid user account for the django-helpdesk instance.
    - Per-queue staff permissions are intended to restrict ticket access based on queue membership.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/helpdesk/user.py`
    - Function: `HelpdeskUser.can_access_ticket(self, ticket)`

    ```python
    def can_access_ticket(self, ticket):
        """Check to see if the user has permission to access
            a ticket. If not then deny access."""
        user = self.user
        if self.can_access_queue(ticket.queue):
            return True
        elif self.has_full_access() or \  <-- Vulnerable condition
                (ticket.assigned_to and user.id == ticket.assigned_to.id):
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def has_full_access(self):
        return self.user.is_superuser or self.user.is_staff \
            or helpdesk_settings.HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE  <-- Setting causing vulnerability
    ```

    - The `can_access_ticket` method checks for three conditions. The second condition, `self.has_full_access()`, directly depends on the `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` setting.
    - If `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE` is True, `has_full_access()` will return True for any authenticated user, regardless of their staff status or queue permissions.
    - This bypasses the intended queue-based access control, as any logged-in user can then pass the `elif self.has_full_access()` condition in `can_access_ticket` and gain access to tickets, even if they are not part of the ticket's queue and are not assigned to the ticket.

- Security test case:
    1. **Set `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE = True` in `helpdesk/settings.py` or Django settings.**
    2. **Create two queues:** "Queue A" and "Queue B".
    3. **Enable per-queue staff permissions:** Set `HELPDESK_ENABLE_PER_QUEUE_STAFF_PERMISSION = True`.
    4. **Create two users:** "staff_queue_a" (staff, with permission to "Queue A") and "non_staff_user" (non-staff, no queue permissions).
    5. **Create a ticket in "Queue B".**
    6. **Log in as "non_staff_user".**
    7. **Attempt to access the ticket in "Queue B" directly via URL (e.g., `/helpdesk/tickets/<ticket_id>/`).**
    8. **Expected Result:**
        - With the vulnerability: "non_staff_user" *can* access the ticket because `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE = True` grants them "full access", bypassing queue permissions.
        - Without the vulnerability (or with mitigation): "non_staff_user" should *not* be able to access the ticket because they do not have permission to "Queue B" and are not assigned to the ticket. They should be redirected to login page or see 404/403 error, depending on view protection and settings.

This test case will demonstrate that setting `HELPDESK_ALLOW_NON_STAFF_TICKET_UPDATE = True` indeed allows non-staff users to access tickets outside of their permitted queues, confirming the inconsistent access control vulnerability.
