## High and Critical Scikit-learn Specific Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Scikit-learn Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Model Replacement** | An attacker substitutes a legitimately trained scikit-learn model with a maliciously crafted one. This could be done by compromising model storage or exploiting vulnerabilities in model loading mechanisms within the application. | The application uses a compromised model, leading to incorrect predictions, biased outputs, or actions that benefit the attacker (e.g., misclassifying malicious activity). | Model persistence mechanisms (e.g., `joblib.dump`, `pickle.dump`), model loading functions (e.g., `joblib.load`, `pickle.load`). | Critical | * **Secure Model Storage:** Implement strong access controls and integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) on model files. Use encryption at rest. * **Model Provenance Tracking:** Maintain a record of how models were trained, by whom, and when. * **Secure Model Loading:** Implement checks to verify the source and integrity of loaded models. |
| **Model Corruption** | An attacker modifies a legitimate, saved scikit-learn model file, altering its parameters or structure. This could be achieved through unauthorized access to model storage or by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems handling model files. | The application uses a corrupted model, leading to unpredictable and potentially harmful outcomes. | Model persistence mechanisms (e.g., `joblib.dump`, `pickle.dump`). | High | * **Secure Model Storage:** (Same as Malicious Model Replacement) * **Integrity Checks:** Use cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of loaded models before use. * **Read-Only Model Loading:** Load models in a read-only manner to prevent accidental or malicious modification during runtime. |
| **Resource Exhaustion during Training** | An attacker provides a large or maliciously crafted dataset that consumes excessive computational resources (CPU, memory, time) during model training using scikit-learn functions, leading to a denial of service. | Inability to train new models or update existing ones, impacting application functionality and availability. | Model training functions across various modules (e.g., `fit` method). | High | * **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, time) for training processes. * **Input Validation for Training Data:** Validate the size and characteristics of training data before processing. * **Asynchronous Training:** Perform training in the background to avoid blocking the main application thread. * **Rate Limiting for Training Requests:** If training is triggered by external requests, implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. |
| **Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability** | An attacker provides a maliciously crafted pickled scikit-learn model file. When this file is loaded using `pickle.load` or `joblib.load`, it can execute arbitrary code on the system. | Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. | `sklearn.externals.joblib.load`, `pickle.load` (when used directly with scikit-learn objects). | Critical | * **Avoid Loading Pickled Models from Untrusted Sources:**  **This is the most critical mitigation.** Only load models from trusted and verified sources. * **Consider Alternative Serialization Methods:** Explore safer serialization formats if possible. * **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Isolate the application and its dependencies in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential code execution. * **Code Review:** Carefully review any code that loads pickled data. |
| **Adversarial Attacks during Inference** | An attacker crafts specific input data (adversarial examples) designed to fool a trained scikit-learn model into making incorrect predictions when using scikit-learn's prediction functions. | The application makes incorrect predictions based on manipulated input, potentially leading to security breaches, financial loss, or other negative consequences depending on the application's purpose. | Model prediction/inference functions across various modules (e.g., `predict`, `predict_proba`, `transform` methods). | High | * **Adversarial Training:** Train models with adversarial examples to make them more robust. * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize input data before feeding it to the model. Implement checks for unusual patterns or values. * **Anomaly Detection on Input Data:** Detect and flag potentially adversarial inputs before they reach the model. * **Model Ensembling:** Combine predictions from multiple models to increase robustness. |
| **Untrusted Code Execution via Custom Estimators/Transformers** | If the application allows users to provide custom scikit-learn estimators or transformers (e.g., through plugins or configuration), a malicious user could provide code that executes arbitrary commands when the model is trained or used by scikit-learn. | Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. |  Any component that allows loading or executing user-provided code as part of the scikit-learn pipeline (e.g., custom estimators, transformers). | Critical | * **Avoid Executing Untrusted Code:**  Do not allow the execution of arbitrary code provided by users within the scikit-learn pipeline. * **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Isolate the execution of custom components in a sandboxed environment. * **Code Review and Static Analysis:** If custom components are necessary, implement rigorous code review and static analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities. * **Limited Functionality for Custom Components:** Restrict the capabilities of custom components to prevent malicious actions. |
