### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving stripe-python

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `stripe-python` library:

*   **Threat:** Hardcoded API Keys
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the application's source code can directly extract the Stripe API keys if they are hardcoded within the codebase where `stripe-python` is used.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Stripe account, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions such as creating fraudulent charges, accessing sensitive customer data, and modifying account settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of API Keys in Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker gaining access to the application's server or configuration files can retrieve the Stripe API keys if they are stored insecurely and used to initialize `stripe-python`.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to hardcoded API keys, leading to full compromise of the Stripe account and potential unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Exposure of API Keys in Logs or Error Messages
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to application logs can find Stripe API keys if they are inadvertently logged during interactions with `stripe-python`.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Stripe account, allowing unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Unverified Stripe Webhooks
    *   **Description:** An attacker can send forged webhook events to the application if the application does not properly verify the authenticity of the webhook requests using `stripe.Webhook.construct_event`.
    *   **Impact:** Triggering unintended actions within the application based on the forged webhook data, such as granting unauthorized access or manipulating data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `stripe-python` Library
    *   **Description:** The `stripe-python` library itself might contain security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit if the application uses a vulnerable version.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or other security compromises within the application interacting with Stripe.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `stripe-python` Dependencies
    *   **Description:** `stripe-python` relies on other Python packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect the security of the application's interaction with Stripe through `stripe-python`.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities in `stripe-python` itself, potentially leading to various security compromises.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
