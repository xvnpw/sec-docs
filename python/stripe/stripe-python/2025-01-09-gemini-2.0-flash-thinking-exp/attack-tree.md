## Attack Tree Path: [Webhook Manipulation due to Insufficient Verification](./attack_tree_paths/webhook_manipulation_due_to_insufficient_verification.md)

**High-Risk Path: Webhook Manipulation due to Insufficient Verification**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts and sends malicious or forged Stripe webhook events to the application's webhook endpoint.
*   **Mechanism:** This is possible if the application does not properly verify the signature of incoming webhook events using the signing secret provided by Stripe. Without proper verification, the application cannot distinguish legitimate events from fake ones.
*   **Potential Impact:** Depending on the application's logic, successful manipulation can lead to:
    *   Falsely marking orders as paid, granting unauthorized access to services or goods.
    *   Triggering incorrect data updates or state changes within the application.
    *   Potentially executing malicious code if the application processes webhook data without proper validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Stripe Python Library Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_stripe_python_library_usage.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Weaknesses in Stripe Python Library Usage**

*   **Attack Vectors:** This critical node encompasses attacks that directly target how the `stripe-python` library is used, primarily focusing on the compromise of API credentials and exploiting outdated library versions.
*   **Significance:** Successful exploitation at this node often grants the attacker significant control over the application's interaction with Stripe.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Stripe API Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_stripe_api_credentials.md)

**Critical Node: Compromise Stripe API Credentials**

*   **Attack Vectors:** This critical node represents the successful acquisition of the application's Stripe API keys by an attacker.
*   **Significance:**  Compromised API keys grant the attacker the ability to:
    *   Make arbitrary API calls to Stripe on behalf of the application.
    *   Access and potentially modify sensitive data within the Stripe account (e.g., customer details, payment information).
    *   Initiate fraudulent transactions, refunds, or other actions that can lead to financial loss and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of API Keys in Source Code or Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_api_keys_in_source_code_or_configuration.md)

**High-Risk Path: Compromise Stripe API Credentials -> Exposure of API Keys in Source Code or Configuration**

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers unintentionally embed Stripe API keys directly within the application's source code, configuration files, or commit them to version control systems.
*   **Mechanism:** Attackers can find these exposed keys by:
    *   Directly examining the application's codebase if they gain access.
    *   Scanning public code repositories (e.g., GitHub) for patterns resembling API keys.
    *   Analyzing configuration files that are inadvertently exposed.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Immediate and critical, granting full access to the Stripe account associated with the exposed keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of API Keys in Logs or Error Messages](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_api_keys_in_logs_or_error_messages.md)

**High-Risk Path: Compromise Stripe API Credentials -> Exposure of API Keys in Logs or Error Messages**

*   **Attack Vector:** Stripe API keys are unintentionally included in application logs, error messages, or debugging outputs.
*   **Mechanism:** This can happen if logging is not configured to redact sensitive information, or if developers inadvertently log API request details. Attackers can access these leaked keys by:
    *   Gaining access to the application's log files.
    *   Monitoring error reporting systems.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities that expose debugging information.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Immediate and critical, granting full access to the Stripe account associated with the exposed keys.
