# Threat Model Analysis for stripe/stripe-python

## Threat: [Exposure of Stripe Secret API Keys](./threats/exposure_of_stripe_secret_api_keys.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's Stripe secret API keys due to vulnerabilities or insecure practices related to how the application handles or stores these keys in conjunction with `stripe-python`. This could involve finding keys hardcoded where `stripe-python` is initialized, exposed in configuration files used by the application with `stripe-python`, or leaked from the environment where `stripe-python` is running. With these keys, the attacker can directly interact with the Stripe API as the application.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive customer data (including payment information), creation of fraudulent charges, modification or deletion of customer or payment information, potential financial loss for the application owner and their customers, reputational damage.
*   **Affected `stripe-python` Component:** The initial configuration of the `stripe` module where the API key is set (e.g., `stripe.api_key = "sk_..."`). All subsequent API calls using this configuration are affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never hardcode API keys directly in the application code where `stripe-python` is used.**
    *   **Utilize environment variables or secure secret management systems to provide API keys to the `stripe` module.**
    *   **Ensure configuration files containing API keys are securely stored and accessed with appropriate permissions.**
    *   **Implement robust logging practices to prevent accidental logging of API keys used by `stripe-python`.**
    *   **Regularly rotate API keys used with `stripe-python`.**
    *   **Utilize Stripe's restricted API keys with specific permissions whenever possible, limiting the scope of potential damage if a key used by `stripe-python` is compromised.**

## Threat: [Webhook Forgery and Exploitation](./threats/webhook_forgery_and_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends malicious webhook events to the application's webhook endpoint, bypassing Stripe's legitimate webhook delivery mechanism. This threat directly involves the application's failure to properly use `stripe-python`'s webhook verification tools. Without verifying the signature using `stripe.Webhook.construct_event()`, the application trusts potentially forged data.
*   **Impact:** Manipulation of application state (e.g., marking payments as successful when they failed), unauthorized access to features triggered by webhooks, potential for financial loss or data corruption based on how the application processes unverified webhook data received and potentially processed using `stripe-python` for further actions.
*   **Affected `stripe-python` Component:** The `stripe.Webhook.construct_event()` function, specifically the failure to use it correctly or at all.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always verify the signature of incoming Stripe webhooks using the `stripe.Webhook.construct_event()` function and your webhook signing secret.**
    *   **Securely store and manage your webhook signing secret, which is used with `stripe-python` for verification.**
    *   **Implement robust validation of the data within the webhook payload *after* successful signature verification using `stripe-python`'s tools.**

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `stripe-python` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__stripe-python__library.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability exists within the `stripe-python` library itself. This could be a bug that allows for remote code execution, information disclosure, or other malicious activities if exploited by an attacker interacting with the application in a way that triggers the vulnerable code within `stripe-python`.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, unauthorized access to data handled by or accessible through `stripe-python`, denial of service affecting features relying on `stripe-python`, and other severe security breaches.
*   **Affected `stripe-python` Component:** Any part of the `stripe-python` library depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep the `stripe-python` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.**
    *   **Monitor security advisories and release notes for the `stripe-python` library.**
    *   **Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the library.**

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `stripe-python`'s Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__stripe-python_'s_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the third-party libraries that `stripe-python` depends on (e.g., `requests`). These vulnerabilities could be exploited indirectly through the `stripe-python` library if the application's interaction with `stripe-python` triggers the vulnerable code in the underlying dependency.
*   **Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities in `stripe-python` itself, this could lead to application compromise, data breaches, or denial of service affecting features utilizing `stripe-python`.
*   **Affected `stripe-python` Component:** Indirectly affects the entire library as it relies on its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update the `stripe-python` library, which often includes updates to its dependencies.**
    *   **Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.**
    *   **Consider using a virtual environment to manage dependencies and isolate the project.**

## Threat: [Installation of Malicious `stripe-python` Package](./threats/installation_of_malicious__stripe-python__package.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks the developer or system into installing a malicious package disguised as the legitimate `stripe-python` library. This involves compromising the installation process or using typosquatting techniques. If a malicious package is installed instead of the official `stripe-python`, it can intercept or manipulate interactions with the Stripe API.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application's environment, potentially leading to the theft of API keys used by the application with Stripe, manipulation of API calls made through what is believed to be `stripe-python`, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected `stripe-python` Component:** The installation process itself, replacing the legitimate `stripe` module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always install packages from trusted sources like the official Python Package Index (PyPI).**
    *   **Double-check the package name for typos before installation (`pip install stripe`).**
    *   **Use tools like `pip check` or vulnerability scanners to verify the integrity of installed packages.**
    *   **Consider using a dependency management tool with security features.**
