    * **Secure Configuration Management:** If using configuration files, encrypt them at rest and implement strict access controls. Avoid storing plaintext credentials.
    * **Regular Key Rotation:** Implement a policy for regularly rotating Stripe API keys to limit the window of opportunity for attackers if a key is compromised.
    * **Auditing and Monitoring:**  Implement logging and monitoring of access to secrets to detect unauthorized access attempts.

* **Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Granular Permissions:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to access Stripe API keys. Avoid granting broad access to all developers or systems.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement RBAC to manage access to secrets based on roles and responsibilities.
    * **Separate Keys for Different Environments:**  Use separate Stripe API keys for development, staging, and production environments to limit the impact of a compromise in a non-production environment.
    * **Restrict API Key Capabilities:**  Utilize restricted API keys provided by Stripe to limit the actions that can be performed with a specific key. This can significantly reduce the impact of a compromised key.

**Detection Strategies:**

Even with strong preventative measures, it's crucial to have detection mechanisms in place:

* **Stripe API Usage Monitoring:**  Monitor Stripe API usage for unusual activity, such as:
    * **Unexpected API calls:**  Calls to endpoints that are not normally used by the application.
    * **High volume of requests:**  An unusually large number of API requests.
    * **Requests from unfamiliar IP addresses:**  API calls originating from unexpected locations.
    * **Failed authentication attempts:**  A sudden increase in failed authentication attempts.
* **Logging and Alerting:**  Implement comprehensive logging of application activity, including access to secrets. Set up alerts for suspicious events.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Utilize anomaly detection tools to identify deviations from normal API usage patterns.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the application and infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
