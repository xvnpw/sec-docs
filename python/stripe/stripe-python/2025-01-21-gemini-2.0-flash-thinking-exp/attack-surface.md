# Attack Surface Analysis for stripe/stripe-python

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Stripe Secret API Keys](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_stripe_secret_api_keys.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized access to the application's Stripe Secret API keys, allowing attackers to perform any action the application can on the Stripe account.

**How `stripe-python` Contributes:** The library requires the Secret API key for authentication and authorization when making API calls to Stripe. If this key is exposed, the library becomes the tool through which an attacker can interact with Stripe.

**Example:** A developer hardcodes the Secret API key directly into the application's source code. An attacker gains access to the codebase and retrieves the key. They can then use `stripe-python` (or any other Stripe library/tool) with this key to create charges, refund payments, or access sensitive customer data.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Stripe account, financial loss, data breaches, reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never hardcode API keys.**
* **Use secure environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).**
* **Restrict API key permissions using Stripe's restricted keys feature to limit the scope of potential damage.**
* **Regularly rotate API keys.**
* **Implement code scanning tools to detect accidentally committed secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Stripe API Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_stripe_api_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application and Stripe's API, potentially stealing API keys or sensitive data.

**How `stripe-python` Contributes:** While `stripe-python` defaults to HTTPS, if the underlying infrastructure or application logic doesn't enforce HTTPS or if there are certificate validation issues, the communication channel can be vulnerable. The library is the conduit for this communication.

**Example:** An application running on a server with misconfigured TLS settings allows an attacker on the same network to intercept the HTTPS connection when `stripe-python` sends payment information to Stripe. The attacker could potentially steal the Secret API key being used in the request headers.

**Impact:** Exposure of API keys, sensitive customer data (payment information, PII), ability to manipulate transactions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Ensure HTTPS is enforced at all levels of the application and infrastructure.**
* **Verify TLS certificate validity.**
* **Avoid custom certificate handling unless absolutely necessary and done correctly.**
* **Use the latest version of `stripe-python` which enforces secure connections.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `stripe-python` or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__stripe-python__or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the `stripe-python` library itself or in the third-party libraries it depends on.

**How `stripe-python` Contributes:** By including `stripe-python` in the application's dependencies, the application becomes susceptible to any vulnerabilities present in the library or its dependencies.

**Example:** A known security flaw is discovered in the `requests` library (a dependency of `stripe-python`). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the application's interaction with `stripe-python`, potentially gaining remote code execution.

**Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly update `stripe-python` to the latest stable version.**
* **Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and address vulnerabilities in `stripe-python`'s dependencies.**
* **Monitor security advisories for `stripe-python` and its dependencies.
