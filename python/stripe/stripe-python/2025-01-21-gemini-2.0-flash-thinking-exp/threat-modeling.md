# Threat Model Analysis for stripe/stripe-python

## Threat: [Hardcoded Stripe Secret Key](./threats/hardcoded_stripe_secret_key.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's source code and finds the Stripe secret key directly embedded in the code where `stripe-python` is initialized (e.g., `stripe.api_key = 'sk_...'`). They can then use the `stripe-python` library with this key to make arbitrary API calls to Stripe on behalf of the application.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Stripe account, allowing the attacker to create charges, access customer data, modify account settings, and potentially perform fraudulent activities.

**Affected Component:** `stripe-python`'s initialization (`stripe.api_key`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never hardcode API keys in the application code.
* Initialize `stripe.api_key` using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Stripe Secret Key Used by stripe-python](./threats/insecure_storage_of_stripe_secret_key_used_by_stripe-python.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the server or environment where the application is running and retrieves the Stripe secret key that is used to configure `stripe-python` from insecurely stored configuration files or environment variables (which are then used to set `stripe.api_key`).

**Impact:** Similar to hardcoding, full compromise of the Stripe account, leading to unauthorized actions and potential financial loss through the use of `stripe-python`.

**Affected Component:** `stripe-python`'s initialization (`stripe.api_key`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure methods for storing environment variables or configuration data that are used to initialize `stripe-python`.
* Implement proper file system permissions to restrict access to configuration files.
* Consider using a dedicated secrets management system.
* Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest.

## Threat: [Insufficient Webhook Verification Using `stripe-python.Webhook.construct_event`](./threats/insufficient_webhook_verification_using__stripe-python_webhook_construct_event_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Stripe webhooks, an attacker can send malicious or fabricated webhook events to the application's webhook endpoint if the application doesn't properly verify the webhook signature using the `stripe.Webhook.construct_event` method provided by `stripe-python`.

**Impact:** Attackers can trigger unintended application behavior, manipulate data within the application's database, or potentially gain unauthorized access depending on how the webhook data processed by the application after (incorrectly) using `stripe-python`'s verification.

**Affected Component:** `stripe-python`'s `stripe.Webhook.construct_event` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always verify the signature of incoming Stripe webhook events using the webhook signing secret and the `stripe.Webhook.construct_event` method.
* Store the webhook signing secret securely.

## Threat: [Using Outdated `stripe-python` Library with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/using_outdated__stripe-python__library_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The application uses an older version of the `stripe-python` library that contains known security vulnerabilities within the library itself.

**Impact:** Exposure to known vulnerabilities within `stripe-python` that attackers can exploit to compromise the application's interaction with Stripe.

**Affected Component:** The entire `stripe-python` library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `stripe-python` library to the latest stable version.
* Monitor security advisories and release notes for the `stripe-python` library.
* Implement a dependency management system to track and update library versions.
