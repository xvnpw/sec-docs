# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `stripe-python`, provides a Python client library for interacting with the Stripe API.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify integration with the Stripe API for Python developers.
  - Enable developers to easily build applications that utilize Stripe's payment processing and other financial services.
  - Maintain a reliable and up-to-date library that reflects the latest Stripe API features.
  - Foster a strong developer community around Stripe and its Python integration.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to unauthorized access to Stripe accounts or sensitive financial data.
  - Library instability or bugs could disrupt critical business processes for users relying on Stripe.
  - Poor documentation or difficult usability could hinder adoption and developer satisfaction.
  - Failure to keep the library updated with Stripe API changes could lead to compatibility issues and developer frustration.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: HTTPS is enforced for all communication with the Stripe API. (Implemented by Stripe API and underlying HTTP client in Python).
  - security control: API keys are used for authentication with the Stripe API. (Managed by Stripe and used by developers in their applications).
  - security control: Stripe's API follows security best practices, including rate limiting, input validation, and access controls. (Implemented by Stripe API).
  - security control: The library code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and security audits. (Implemented by project maintainers by using GitHub).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Users are responsible for securely managing their Stripe API keys and preventing unauthorized access.
  - accepted risk: The security of the Stripe API itself is outside the scope of this library and is the responsibility of Stripe.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the library.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - recommended security control: Provide clear documentation and guidance to developers on secure API key management practices, including recommendations for environment variables or secure configuration management.
  - recommended security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) into the development process to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Implement a process for regularly updating dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The library must securely handle Stripe API keys for authentication.
    - Requirement: The library should not store API keys directly in code.
    - Requirement: The library should encourage users to use secure methods for API key management, such as environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The library must correctly implement Stripe's authorization model, ensuring that API requests are made with the appropriate permissions based on the API key used.
    - Requirement: The library should not grant users permissions beyond what is necessary to interact with the Stripe API.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library should perform basic input validation to prevent common injection attacks and ensure data integrity before sending requests to the Stripe API.
    - Requirement: The library should rely on Stripe's API for comprehensive input validation and error handling.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: The library must use HTTPS for all communication with the Stripe API to ensure data confidentiality and integrity in transit.
    - Requirement: The library should not implement custom cryptography unless absolutely necessary and after thorough security review. Rely on well-established and vetted cryptographic libraries provided by Python and the underlying operating system.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure integration with Stripe API for payment processing and financial operations by users of the library.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the `stripe-python` library as a critical tool for developers.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Stripe API Keys: High sensitivity. Unauthorized access can lead to financial loss and data breaches.
  - Potentially sensitive data passed through the library to the Stripe API (e.g., customer data, transaction details): Medium to High sensitivity, depending on the application and data being processed.
  - Source code of the `stripe-python` library: Low to Medium sensitivity. Publicly available but integrity is important to prevent malicious modifications.
