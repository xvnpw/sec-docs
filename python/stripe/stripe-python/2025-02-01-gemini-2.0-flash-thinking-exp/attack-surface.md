# Attack Surface Analysis for stripe/stripe-python

## Attack Surface: [Stripe API Key Exposure](./attack_surfaces/stripe_api_key_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental or intentional disclosure of Stripe API keys, particularly secret keys, which grant broad access to your Stripe account. This is a critical vulnerability when using `stripe-python` as it relies on these keys for authentication.
*   **Stripe-Python Contribution:** `stripe-python` *requires* API keys to be configured for authentication to interact with the Stripe API.  While the library itself doesn't expose keys, its fundamental requirement for API keys makes insecure key management a direct attack surface when using `stripe-python`.
*   **Example:**
    *   A developer using `stripe-python` hardcodes the Stripe secret key directly into a Python file, which is then exposed.
    *   When configuring `stripe-python`, the secret key is stored in an insecure environment variable accessible to unauthorized users.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of your Stripe account, potentially leading to:
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive customer and financial data managed through Stripe.
    *   Fraudulent transactions and significant financial losses processed via Stripe.
    *   Reputational damage and legal liabilities due to data breaches and financial fraud related to Stripe operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never hardcode API keys** in code used with `stripe-python`.
    *   **Utilize secure secrets management systems** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, cloud provider secret services) to store and manage API keys used by `stripe-python`.
    *   **Restrict access to environments and systems** where API keys for `stripe-python` are stored.
    *   **Employ restricted API keys** with the principle of least privilege when configuring `stripe-python`.
    *   **Implement regular API key rotation** for keys used with `stripe-python`.
    *   **Scan code and configuration files** for accidentally exposed API keys before committing changes when working with `stripe-python` integrations.
    *   **Never expose secret keys in client-side code** when using `stripe-python` in backend systems.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Key Scoping/Permissions](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_key_scopingpermissions.md)

*   **Description:** Using overly permissive Stripe API keys (like secret keys) with `stripe-python` when restricted keys with narrower permissions would be more secure. This increases the potential damage if a key used by `stripe-python` is compromised.
*   **Stripe-Python Contribution:** `stripe-python` can be configured with any type of Stripe API key. The library itself does not enforce key scoping.  The risk arises directly from the *application's* choice of API key used in conjunction with `stripe-python`.
*   **Example:**
    *   An application uses the secret key for all `stripe-python` operations, even for tasks that could be performed with a restricted key (e.g., creating charges only).
    *   If this secret key, used throughout the `stripe-python` integration, is compromised, the impact is far greater than if a restricted key with limited permissions had been used.
*   **Impact:** If an API key used by `stripe-python` is compromised, the attacker gains broader access and can perform more actions than necessary within your Stripe account, potentially leading to greater damage, including unauthorized data access and wider fraudulent activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Always configure `stripe-python` with the most restricted API key possible for each specific task.
    *   **Utilize Stripe's restricted keys feature** to create keys with granular permissions (e.g., read-only access, create charges only, etc.) and use these with `stripe-python` where appropriate.
    *   **Carefully review the required permissions** for each part of your application's Stripe integration that uses `stripe-python` and choose the most restrictive suitable key type.
    *   **Regularly audit API key usage** in your `stripe-python` integrations to ensure keys are scoped correctly and not overly permissive.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Stripe API Interactions](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_stripe_api_interactions.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentionally exposing sensitive information obtained from the Stripe API when using `stripe-python`, due to insecure handling of API responses or excessive data retrieval.
*   **Stripe-Python Contribution:** `stripe-python` is the mechanism used to interact with the Stripe API and retrieve data.  If the application using `stripe-python` doesn't handle this retrieved data securely, information disclosure vulnerabilities arise directly from the data accessed via `stripe-python`.
*   **Example:**
    *   An application using `stripe-python` retrieves full customer objects from Stripe when only the customer ID is needed. The full object, containing PII and payment details obtained via `stripe-python`, is then logged insecurely.
    *   Error messages from `stripe-python` or the Stripe API, containing sensitive details from Stripe interactions, are displayed directly to users or logged in an insecure manner.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive customer data (PII, payment information, transaction history) retrieved via `stripe-python`, potentially leading to:
    *   Privacy violations and regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) due to mishandling data accessed through `stripe-python`.
    *   Reputational damage and loss of customer trust stemming from data breaches involving Stripe data accessed via `stripe-python`.
    *   Increased risk of identity theft or fraud against customers whose data was exposed through insecure `stripe-python` usage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Data Retrieval):** When using `stripe-python`, only retrieve the minimum necessary data from the Stripe API. Use API parameters to filter and limit the data returned by `stripe-python`.
    *   **Secure Logging Practices:** Avoid logging sensitive data from Stripe API responses obtained via `stripe-python`. If logging is necessary, redact or mask sensitive fields before logging data retrieved by `stripe-python`.
    *   **Sanitize and Filter API Responses:** Before displaying or processing data from Stripe API responses obtained via `stripe-python`, carefully sanitize and filter it to remove any sensitive or unnecessary information.
    *   **Avoid Direct Exposure of Raw API Responses:** Never directly expose raw Stripe API responses obtained through `stripe-python` to users. Transform and present data in a user-friendly and secure manner.
    *   **Implement proper error handling:** Avoid displaying verbose error messages to users that might reveal sensitive information from Stripe API interactions via `stripe-python`.

## Attack Surface: [Webhook Security Issues (If Webhooks are Used)](./attack_surfaces/webhook_security_issues__if_webhooks_are_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to handling Stripe webhooks when using `stripe-python`, including improper verification and insecure webhook handlers.
*   **Stripe-Python Contribution:** `stripe-python` provides essential utilities for verifying webhook signatures.  The application's responsibility is to *correctly use* these `stripe-python` utilities and implement secure webhook handlers. Failure to properly utilize `stripe-python`'s verification features directly leads to this attack surface.
*   **Example:**
    *   An application's webhook handler, intended to use `stripe-python` for verification, fails to correctly implement signature verification, allowing attackers to send forged webhook events.
    *   Even with `stripe-python`'s verification, the webhook handler logic itself has vulnerabilities, such as blindly trusting webhook data without validation after (or even before) using `stripe-python` for signature checks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application state manipulation and data corruption due to processing forged webhooks that bypass `stripe-python`'s intended security measures or application logic.
    *   Bypassing payment processing or other critical business logic if webhook handling, even with `stripe-python` verification, is flawed.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Verify Webhook Signatures:**  Utilize `stripe-python`'s webhook signature verification utilities *correctly and consistently* to ensure webhook events are genuinely from Stripe and haven't been tampered with.
    *   **Secure Webhook Handler Logic:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* data received from webhooks, even after signature verification using `stripe-python`. Implement robust error handling and security checks within webhook handlers.
    *   **Secure Webhook Endpoint:** Ensure the webhook endpoint is properly secured (e.g., HTTPS, appropriate network security) in conjunction with secure webhook handling using `stripe-python`.
    *   **Test Webhook Handling Thoroughly:**  Rigorous testing of webhook handling logic, including signature verification using `stripe-python`, error conditions, and malicious webhook payloads, is crucial.
