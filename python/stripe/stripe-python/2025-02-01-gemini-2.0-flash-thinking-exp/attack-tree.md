## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] 2. Exploit Misconfiguration of stripe-python or Application Integration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__2__exploit_misconfiguration_of_stripe-python_or_application_integration__high-ris_fe5d3e9f.md)

*   **General Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses arising from improper setup, configuration, or integration of `stripe-python` and the application environment. This often involves human error in deployment and configuration.

    *   **Impact:** Can range from API key compromise leading to full Stripe account control, to application state manipulation, financial fraud, and data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] 2.1. Insecure API Key Management [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__2_1__insecure_api_key_management__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **General Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to Stripe API Secret Keys due to insecure storage, handling, or exposure. Secret Keys grant broad access to Stripe account operations.

    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of Stripe account, including ability to:
        *   Access all financial data (transactions, customers, balances).
        *   Initiate payments and refunds.
        *   Modify account settings and configurations.
        *   Potentially exfiltrate customer data.

    *   **2.1.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Hardcoded API Keys in Source Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker finds Secret API keys directly embedded within the application's source code. This could be in configuration files, Python files, or any other code repository.
        *   **How:**
            *   Directly inspecting source code if publicly accessible (e.g., open-source projects with accidental key commits).
            *   Gaining access to source code through other vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection, insecure server).
            *   Compromising developer machines or build systems where source code is stored.

    *   **2.1.2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exposed API Keys in Version Control Systems [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Secret API keys are accidentally committed to version control history (e.g., Git repositories), even if later removed from the current codebase.
        *   **How:**
            *   Publicly accessible repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) if keys are committed and the repository is public or becomes public due to misconfiguration.
            *   Compromised private repositories if attacker gains access to the version control system.
            *   Using Git history analysis tools to find previously committed secrets even if removed from the latest commit.

    *   **2.1.3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Storage of API Keys [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Secret API keys are stored in plain text or weakly protected configuration files on the application server or infrastructure.
        *   **How:**
            *   Gaining unauthorized access to the server through vulnerabilities (e.g., server misconfiguration, remote code execution).
            *   Exploiting local file inclusion vulnerabilities in the application to read configuration files.
            *   Compromising infrastructure components where configuration files are stored (e.g., cloud storage buckets with weak permissions).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] 2.2. Insecure Webhook Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__2_2__insecure_webhook_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **General Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application receives and processes Stripe webhook events. Webhooks are used by Stripe to notify the application about events like successful payments, failed charges, etc.

    *   **Impact:** Application state manipulation, financial fraud (e.g., marking payments as successful when they are not), data corruption, denial of service.

    *   **2.2.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Lack of Webhook Signature Verification [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Application does not verify the signature of webhook events sent by Stripe. This allows an attacker to forge webhook events and send malicious payloads to the webhook endpoint.
        *   **How:**
            *   Attacker crafts fake webhook requests that mimic legitimate Stripe events.
            *   Sends these forged requests to the application's webhook endpoint.
            *   Since signature verification is missing, the application processes these forged events as if they were genuine, leading to unintended actions based on the attacker's crafted data.
            *   Example: Forging a `payment_intent.succeeded` event to trick the application into granting access to paid features without actual payment.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] 3. Exploit Application Logic Flaws in Stripe Integration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node__3__exploit_application_logic_flaws_in_stripe_integration__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **General Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the application's code that interacts with `stripe-python` and the Stripe API. This arises from developer errors in implementing payment flows, data validation, and business logic related to Stripe.

    *   **Impact:** Financial loss, revenue leakage, unauthorized access to paid features, data breaches, business logic bypasses.

    *   **3.1. [CRITICAL NODE] Payment Manipulation Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **General Attack Vector:** Manipulating payment amounts, currencies, or payment flow logic to pay less than intended or bypass payments entirely.

        *   **3.1.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Price Tampering [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker modifies the price of goods or services before the payment is processed by Stripe. This usually happens if price calculations or validation are done client-side or are not properly enforced server-side.
            *   **How:**
                *   Intercepting and modifying API requests sent from the client-side to the server-side that contain price information.
                *   Manipulating client-side code (if price calculations are done in JavaScript) to send a lower price to the server.
                *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in server-side code that handles price parameters, allowing injection of lower price values.
                *   Example: Changing the price of an item in browser's developer tools before submitting a purchase request.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [CRITICAL NODE] 4. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies of stripe-python [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical_node__4__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies_of_stripe-python__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **General Attack Vector:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that `stripe-python` depends on.  `stripe-python` relies on libraries like `requests` and `urllib3`, which if vulnerable, can indirectly compromise applications using `stripe-python`.

    *   **Impact:** Can range from denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency.

    *   **4.1. [CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerable Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **General Attack Vector:** Using versions of `stripe-python` dependencies that contain known security vulnerabilities.

        *   **4.1.1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Known Vulnerabilities in Dependency Libraries [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) in libraries like `requests`, `urllib3`, or others used by `stripe-python`.
            *   **How:**
                *   Identifying vulnerable dependency versions used by the application (e.g., through dependency scanning tools or by checking `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile.lock`).
                *   Exploiting the specific vulnerability in the identified dependency. This could involve sending specially crafted requests, exploiting deserialization flaws, or other attack methods depending on the vulnerability.
                *   Example: If `requests` has a known vulnerability allowing remote code execution, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability in an application using `stripe-python` if that application uses a vulnerable version of `requests` (even indirectly through `stripe-python`).
