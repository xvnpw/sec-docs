# Threat Model Analysis for stripe/stripe-python

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** Attacker exploits a known security vulnerability present in the `stripe-python` library itself or in one of its direct dependencies (e.g., the `requests` library). This is possible if the application uses an outdated version of `stripe-python` containing known vulnerabilities. Exploitation could involve sending specially crafted requests or data that trigger the vulnerability.
* **Impact:**
    * Remote code execution on the server hosting the application.
    * Denial of service, making the application unavailable.
    * Information disclosure, potentially including sensitive data handled by the application or even Stripe API keys if the vulnerability allows for it.
    * Full server compromise, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the application server.
* **Affected Component:** `stripe-python` library, its dependencies.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regularly update `stripe-python` to the latest stable version.** Stripe and the open-source community actively patch vulnerabilities.
    * **Implement automated dependency scanning and monitoring.** Use tools like `pip audit` or dedicated dependency vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in `stripe-python` and its dependencies.
    * **Subscribe to security advisories for `stripe-python` and its dependencies.** Stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and promptly apply updates.
    * **Consider using virtual environments to isolate project dependencies.** This helps manage and update dependencies more effectively.

## Threat: [Webhook Forgery due to Improper Verification](./threats/webhook_forgery_due_to_improper_verification.md)

* **Description:** Attacker crafts and sends forged webhook requests to the application's webhook endpoint, impersonating Stripe. This is possible if the application either fails to implement webhook signature verification using `stripe-python`'s utilities correctly, or bypasses the verification process entirely. The attacker can manipulate the webhook payload to trigger actions within the application as if they were legitimate Stripe events.
* **Impact:**
    * Manipulation of application state, leading to incorrect data or business logic execution.
    * Fraudulent transaction processing, potentially allowing attackers to receive goods or services without payment or trigger refunds improperly.
    * Bypassing intended payment workflows or security controls within the application.
    * Unauthorized access to features or functionalities triggered by webhook events.
* **Affected Component:** `stripe-python`'s `stripe.Webhook.construct_event` function (if used incorrectly or omitted), application's webhook handling logic.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Always implement webhook signature verification using `stripe-python`'s `stripe.Webhook.construct_event` function.** This function is designed to securely verify the authenticity of Stripe webhooks.
    * **Ensure the webhook signing secret is securely stored and never exposed in code or logs.** Treat it with the same level of security as your API secret key.
    * **Carefully handle exceptions raised by `stripe.Webhook.construct_event`.** If verification fails, reject the webhook request immediately and do not process the event.
    * **Validate the `event` object returned by `stripe.Webhook.construct_event`** to ensure it is of the expected type and contains valid data before processing it.
    * **Implement idempotency in webhook handlers.** This prevents processing the same webhook event multiple times, even if a forged webhook is somehow processed or a legitimate webhook is resent.
