# Attack Surface Analysis for stripe/stripe-python

## Attack Surface: [Secret Key Exposure](./attack_surfaces/secret_key_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Stripe secret API key (`sk_...`).
*   **How `stripe-python` Contributes:** The library *requires* the secret key to perform actions on behalf of the Stripe account. The library is the *mechanism* through which the key is used, making its secure handling paramount.  The library itself doesn't *introduce* the vulnerability in the sense of having a bug, but it's the tool that *uses* the key.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits the secret key to a public GitHub repository.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Stripe account. An attacker can make charges, issue refunds, access all customer data, and change account settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never hardcode the secret key in the application code.**
    *   Use environment variables, ensuring they are securely configured (restricted permissions, encryption where possible).
    *   Employ a dedicated secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager).
    *   Rotate API keys regularly (Stripe dashboard allows this).
    *   Implement strict access controls on the server and development environments.
    *   Use `.gitignore` (or equivalent) to prevent accidental commits of configuration files.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews, focusing on secure key handling.
    *   Use automated code scanning tools to detect exposed secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Webhook Signature Verification Failure](./attack_surfaces/webhook_signature_verification_failure.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to verify the cryptographic signature of incoming webhook requests from Stripe.
*   **How `stripe-python` Contributes:** The library provides the `stripe.Webhook.construct_event()` function *specifically* for verifying webhook signatures.  Failure to *use* this function correctly (or at all) is the direct cause of the vulnerability.  This is a *direct* involvement because the library provides the *intended secure mechanism*, and the vulnerability arises from *not using it*.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a forged webhook request claiming a payment was successful, and the application doesn't verify the signature, leading to fulfillment of an order without actual payment.
*   **Impact:**  Fraudulent transactions, data inconsistencies, potential financial loss. The attacker can simulate any webhook event.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use `stripe.Webhook.construct_event()` to verify the signature of *every* incoming webhook request.** This is the *only* reliable way to ensure the request originated from Stripe.
    *   Obtain the webhook signing secret from the Stripe dashboard (webhook endpoint settings).
    *   Handle exceptions raised by `construct_event()` appropriately (log the error, reject the request).  Do *not* process the webhook if signature verification fails.
    *   Implement a mechanism to prevent replay attacks (e.g., checking timestamps or using nonces, as provided by Stripe's webhook event structure).

## Attack Surface: [Using Outdated `stripe-python` Versions](./attack_surfaces/using_outdated__stripe-python__versions.md)

*   **Description:**  Using an old version of the library that contains known security vulnerabilities or lacks important security features.
*   **How `stripe-python` Contributes:**  The vulnerability exists *within* the outdated library code itself. Newer versions often include security patches. This is a *direct* involvement because the vulnerable code *is* the `stripe-python` library.
*   **Example:**  A vulnerability is discovered in an older version of `stripe-python` that allows an attacker to bypass certain security checks.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from data exposure to complete account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update the `stripe-python` library to the latest stable version.**
    *   Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `pip`, `Poetry`) to track and manage dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories and release notes for the `stripe-python` library.
    *   Consider using automated dependency update tools (e.g., Dependabot).
