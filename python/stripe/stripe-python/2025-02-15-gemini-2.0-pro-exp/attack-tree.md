## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Manipulate API Requests](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_manipulate_api_requests.md)

*   **Critical Node 1.1: Tamper with Price (Client-Side)**

    *   **Likelihood:** High. This is a very common vulnerability in web applications that handle payments.  Developers often mistakenly trust client-side input, making it easy to exploit.
    *   **Impact:** High.  An attacker can purchase goods or services at drastically reduced prices, potentially causing significant financial loss to the application owner.  This can also lead to reputational damage.
    *   **Effort:** Low.  Basic browser developer tools are sufficient to modify client-side JavaScript or intercept and modify HTTP requests.  No specialized tools or deep technical knowledge are required.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.  Anyone with basic web development knowledge can understand how to manipulate client-side values.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  While the fraudulent transactions themselves will be visible in Stripe's dashboard, identifying the root cause (client-side tampering) might require deeper investigation of logs and code.  Without proper logging and monitoring, it can be difficult to pinpoint.

*   **Explanation:** This attack path focuses on the attacker's ability to modify the price of a product or service *before* it's sent to the server for processing by the `stripe-python` library.  The vulnerability lies in the application's trust in client-side data.  The `stripe-python` library itself is functioning as intended; it's the application's insecure use of the library that creates the problem.  For example, a hidden HTML input field containing the price, or a JavaScript variable that's easily modified, can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Misuse Legitimate Library Features](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_misuse_legitimate_library_features.md)

*   **Critical Node 3.2: Capture Legitimate API Keys (exposed in code/config)**

    *   **Likelihood:** Medium. While developers are generally aware of the risks, mistakes happen.  Keys can be accidentally committed to public repositories, left in configuration files, or exposed through server misconfigurations.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Possession of the secret API key grants the attacker full control over the Stripe account. They can issue refunds, create charges, access customer data, and potentially transfer funds to their own accounts.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  The effort depends on *where* the keys are exposed.  If they're in a public repository, it's trivial.  If they're on a compromised server, it might require more effort to gain access.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.  Finding exposed keys in public repositories is easy.  Exploiting server vulnerabilities to obtain keys requires more skill.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High.  Unless there's specific monitoring for API key usage from unauthorized locations or unusual activity, this can go unnoticed for a long time.  Stripe's dashboard might show unusual activity, but attributing it to stolen keys requires investigation.

*   **Explanation:** This attack path relies on the attacker obtaining the application's Stripe API keys.  Once the attacker has the secret key, they can use the `stripe-python` library (or any other Stripe SDK) to perform any action as if they were the legitimate account owner.  This is a classic example of a "keys to the kingdom" scenario. The vulnerability isn't in the library itself, but in how the application handles its secrets.  This could involve:
    *   Hardcoding keys in the source code.
    *   Storing keys in unencrypted configuration files.
    *   Committing keys to a public Git repository.
    *   Exposing keys through server misconfigurations (e.g., directory listing enabled).
    *   Using weak or default passwords for services that store the keys.

The key takeaway is that these two paths represent the most significant and likely avenues for an attacker to exploit a system using `stripe-python`.  Protecting against these requires a combination of secure coding practices, proper key management, and robust input validation.
