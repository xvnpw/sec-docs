# Threat Model Analysis for stripe/stripe-python

## Threat: [Forged Webhook Events](./threats/forged_webhook_events.md)

*   **Threat:** Forged Webhook Events
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted HTTP requests to the application's Stripe webhook endpoint, mimicking legitimate webhook events from Stripe.  If the application doesn't verify the webhook signature, the attacker can trigger unauthorized actions (e.g., marking orders as paid, creating fraudulent refunds).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data corruption (e.g., incorrect order statuses, fraudulent transactions).
        *   Financial loss.
        *   Potential for further attacks by exploiting the application's webhook handling logic.
    *   **Affected Component:** `stripe.Webhook.construct_event` (and the application's webhook handling logic in general).  The vulnerability exists if this function is *not* used or is used incorrectly.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** verify webhook signatures using `stripe.Webhook.construct_event(payload, sig_header, endpoint_secret)`.  This is the *primary* defense.
        *   Obtain the `endpoint_secret` from the Stripe Dashboard (Webhook settings).
        *   Handle potential exceptions raised by `construct_event` (e.g., `stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError`).
        *   Implement idempotency checks to prevent duplicate processing of the same webhook event (using the `Event` object's ID).
        *   Secure the webhook endpoint with appropriate network security measures (e.g., firewall rules, IP whitelisting if possible).
        *   Log all webhook events (including failed verification attempts) for auditing and debugging.

## Threat: [Double Charging Customers via Idempotency Key Misuse](./threats/double_charging_customers_via_idempotency_key_misuse.md)

*   **Threat:**  Double Charging Customers via Idempotency Key Misuse
    *   **Description:**  The application attempts to charge a customer but encounters a network error or timeout.  Without proper idempotency key handling, a retry of the same charge request might result in the customer being charged twice.  Alternatively, the application might *incorrectly* reuse the same idempotency key for different charges.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Customer dissatisfaction and chargebacks.
        *   Financial loss (due to refunds and fees).
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Any `stripe-python` function that creates charges (e.g., `stripe.Charge.create`) or performs other idempotent operations. The `idempotency_key` parameter is the key element.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always** use idempotency keys for sensitive operations like creating charges, creating customers, or initiating payouts.
        *   Generate a *unique* idempotency key for each *distinct* request.  A common approach is to use a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).
        *   Store the idempotency key and its associated request details (e.g., in a database) to track the status of the request.
        *   If a request fails, check if an idempotency key was used and if a corresponding record exists.  If so, you can safely retry the request *with the same idempotency key*.
        *   Do *not* reuse idempotency keys for different requests.
        *   Understand Stripe's idempotency key behavior (keys are valid for 24 hours).

## Threat: [Using an Outdated `stripe-python` Version](./threats/using_an_outdated__stripe-python__version.md)

*   **Threat:**  Using an Outdated `stripe-python` Version
    *   **Description:** The application uses an old version of the `stripe-python` library that contains known vulnerabilities or lacks important security updates. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or the Stripe account.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Vulnerability to known exploits.
        *   Potential for data breaches or financial loss.
        *   Non-compliance with PCI DSS (if handling card data).
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `stripe-python` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `stripe-python` library to the latest version using `pip install --upgrade stripe`.
        *   Monitor Stripe's security advisories and release notes for any vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency management tools (e.g., `pip`, `poetry`, `requirements.txt`) to track and manage library versions.
        *   Automate dependency updates as part of the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using Dependabot or similar tools).
        *   Test the application thoroughly after updating dependencies.
