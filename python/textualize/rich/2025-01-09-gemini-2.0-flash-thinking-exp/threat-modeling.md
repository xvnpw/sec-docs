# Threat Model Analysis for textualize/rich

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input with excessively complex or deeply nested formatting structures that consume significant CPU or memory resources *during the `rich` rendering process*. This can lead to the application becoming slow or unresponsive due to the computational burden placed on `rich` itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application slowdown or complete unavailability.
        *   Increased resource consumption on the server directly attributable to `rich` processing.
    *   **Affected Rich Component:**
        *   `rich.console.Console` class, particularly the rendering engine responsible for processing and displaying formatted output.
        *   Parsing logic for handling nested styles and complex formatting within `rich`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement timeouts specifically for `rich` rendering operations to prevent indefinite processing of malicious input.
        *   Set limits on the complexity of formatting allowed in user input or data processed by `rich` to prevent overly demanding rendering tasks.
        *   Monitor resource usage and identify potential spikes directly correlated with `rich` processing to detect and mitigate DoS attempts.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Output in Web Context](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_output_in_web_context.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `rich` to format data that is subsequently rendered in a web browser *without proper escaping of `rich`'s output*, an attacker could inject malicious `rich` formatting (especially hyperlinks or custom styles) that results in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to sanitize the output produced by `rich` before embedding it in the web page.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Account compromise of users viewing the malicious output.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Data theft from users interacting with the malicious output.
        *   Malware injection into the browsers of users viewing the malicious output.
    *   **Affected Rich Component:**
        *   `rich.console.Console` class, specifically the methods that generate output containing links or styled text that can be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript if not properly escaped.
        *   The rendering logic within `rich` that produces output containing potentially active content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucially, always perform context-aware output escaping on the data generated by `rich` before embedding it into HTML.** This typically involves HTML-encoding characters that have special meaning in HTML (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`).
        *   Avoid directly embedding raw `rich` output into HTML without explicit and rigorous sanitization.
        *   Implement and enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities, even if escaping is missed.
