# Attack Surface Analysis for textualize/rich

## Attack Surface: [Terminal Escape Sequence Injection](./attack_surfaces/terminal_escape_sequence_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted strings containing terminal escape sequences can manipulate the terminal's behavior, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    *   **How Rich Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rich`'s core functionality involves generating output with terminal escape sequences for styling and formatting. If user-provided input is directly rendered by `rich` without sanitization, attackers can inject their own malicious escape sequences.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        from rich import print
        user_input = "\x1b]2;Malicious Title\x07"  # Sets the terminal title
        print(f"User provided: {user_input}")
        ```
        If `user_input` comes from an untrusted source, this could change the terminal title unexpectedly. More dangerous sequences could execute commands.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine (if the terminal and system allow).
        *   Denial of service by flooding the terminal with output or changing its settings to be unusable.
        *   Information disclosure by manipulating the terminal to display misleading information or reveal hidden data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the capabilities of the terminal and the attacker's goal).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize any user-provided input before passing it to `rich` for rendering. This involves removing or escaping potentially harmful terminal escape sequences. Look for libraries designed to strip ANSI escape codes.
        *   **Avoid Direct Rendering of Untrusted Input:** If possible, avoid directly rendering untrusted input with `rich`. Instead, process the input and only render safe, pre-defined elements.

## Attack Surface: [File Path Injection via `rich.syntax.Syntax`](./attack_surfaces/file_path_injection_via__rich_syntax_syntax_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `rich.syntax.Syntax` to display code from files and allows users to specify the file path, a malicious user could provide paths to sensitive files.
    *   **How Rich Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rich.syntax.Syntax` directly reads and displays the content of files specified by a path. Without proper validation, this can be exploited.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        from rich.console import Console
        from rich.syntax import Syntax

        console = Console()
        file_path = input("Enter file path to display: ") # Imagine this comes from a web form
        syntax = Syntax(file_path, "python", theme="monokai", line_numbers=True)
        console.print(syntax)
        ```
        If a user enters `/etc/passwd`, the content of that file could be displayed.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive files containing configuration details, credentials, or other confidential information could be exposed.
        *   **Path Traversal:** While `rich` doesn't directly execute files, displaying the content of arbitrary files can be a stepping stone for other attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on the sensitivity of the data accessible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate user-provided file paths. Use whitelisting to only allow access to specific directories or files.
        *   **Sandboxing:** If displaying code from user-provided paths is necessary, consider running the code responsible for displaying the syntax in a sandboxed environment with limited file system access.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to access files.
