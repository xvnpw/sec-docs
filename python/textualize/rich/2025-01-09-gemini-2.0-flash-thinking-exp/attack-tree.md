# Attack Tree Analysis for textualize/rich

Objective: To compromise an application utilizing the `textualize/rich` library by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses within Rich itself, leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **HIGH RISK PATH** - Exploit Malicious Input for RCE/Major Impact
    *   **CRITICAL NODE** - Inject Malicious Control Characters
        *   **HIGH RISK NODE** - Terminal Command Injection (Potentially RCE - High Severity)
*   **HIGH RISK PATH** - Exploit Application Integration for Major Impact
    *   **CRITICAL NODE** - Unsanitized Input Passed to Rich
    *   **HIGH RISK NODE** - Insecure Handling of Rich Output

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Input for RCE/Major Impact](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_input_for_rcemajor_impact.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on attackers leveraging malicious input, specifically control characters, to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other severe compromises. The core idea is to inject sequences that the terminal emulator interprets as commands or that bypass security measures, leading to unauthorized actions.

**CRITICAL NODE - Inject Malicious Control Characters:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject ANSI escape codes or other control sequences into the input processed by Rich.
*   **Potential Impact:** While basic control characters might only cause UI manipulation, carefully crafted sequences can potentially exploit vulnerabilities in terminal emulators to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Why Critical:** This is a direct way to interact with the underlying system through the terminal. Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise.

    *   **HIGH RISK NODE - Terminal Command Injection (Potentially RCE - High Severity):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Specific control sequences, if interpreted by the terminal emulator as commands, can be injected to execute arbitrary commands on the server or client.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Full control over the system where the application is running. This allows the attacker to steal data, install malware, or disrupt operations.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Although the likelihood might be lower due to the need for specific terminal vulnerabilities, the impact of successful RCE is catastrophic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Integration for Major Impact](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_integration_for_major_impact.md)

**Description:** This path highlights vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates and uses the `rich` library. The focus is on weaknesses in how the application handles input and output related to Rich.

**CRITICAL NODE - Unsanitized Input Passed to Rich:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided or external data before passing it to Rich. This allows attackers to inject malicious control characters, markup, or other harmful content.
*   **Potential Impact:** Depending on the injected payload, this can lead to UI manipulation, information disclosure, denial of service, or even remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities (like terminal command injection).
*   **Why Critical:** This is a fundamental security flaw. Unsanitized input is a primary entry point for many types of attacks.

**HIGH RISK NODE - Insecure Handling of Rich Output:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application processes the output generated by Rich in an insecure manner. A prime example is directly using Rich output in system commands or other sensitive operations without proper validation.
*   **Potential Impact:** This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Directly using untrusted output in system commands is a well-known and highly dangerous vulnerability.
