# Threat Model Analysis for textualize/rich

## Threat: [Malicious Formatting String Injection](./threats/malicious_formatting_string_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts input strings containing special `rich` markup or control sequences and injects them into data that the application subsequently renders using `rich`. This could be through user input fields, database records, or external data sources. The attacker aims to manipulate the output or cause unintended behavior.

**Impact:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS):  Excessively complex or deeply nested formatting could consume significant CPU and memory resources, leading to application slowdowns or crashes.
*   Information Disclosure:  Malicious formatting could be used to manipulate the output in a way that reveals sensitive information that would otherwise be hidden or formatted differently.
*   Terminal Manipulation:  While `rich` aims to abstract terminal control, vulnerabilities or specific combinations of markup could potentially be exploited to inject terminal escape sequences, leading to unexpected changes in the user's terminal (e.g., clearing the screen, changing colors persistently).

**Affected Component:**
*   `rich.console.Console` (specifically the `print` and related methods)
*   `rich.text.Text` (when manipulating text objects directly)
*   `rich.style.Style` (when injecting malicious style definitions)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize any user-provided input or external data before passing it to `rich`. This might involve escaping or stripping potentially dangerous `rich` markup tags.
*   **Output Validation:** If feasible, validate the output generated by `rich` before displaying it to the user to detect and prevent malicious formatting from being rendered.
*   **Restrict Formatting Options:** If the application doesn't require the full range of `rich`'s formatting capabilities, consider limiting the allowed markup or using a safer subset.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Terminal Output (Conceptual):** While not a standard web CSP, think about the context of where the `rich` output is displayed. If it's being piped to another system or displayed in a controlled environment, consider the security implications.

## Threat: [Terminal Escape Sequence Injection via `rich`](./threats/terminal_escape_sequence_injection_via__rich_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits potential vulnerabilities in `rich`'s handling of certain input or its interaction with the underlying terminal to inject raw terminal escape sequences. This could bypass `rich`'s intended abstraction layer.

**Impact:**
*   Arbitrary Command Execution (Low Probability, but possible in edge cases): In highly specific and unlikely scenarios, vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited to inject escape sequences that trigger command execution within the user's terminal.
*   Terminal Hijacking/Spoofing: Malicious escape sequences could be used to alter the appearance of the terminal, potentially tricking users into performing unintended actions or revealing sensitive information. This could involve changing the prompt, displaying misleading information, or even capturing keystrokes (though the latter is less likely through `rich` itself).
*   Denial of Service (Terminal Level): Certain escape sequences can cause the terminal to become unresponsive or crash, effectively denying the user access to their terminal session.

**Affected Component:**
*   `rich.console.Console` (specifically the methods that write directly to the terminal buffer)
*   Potentially lower-level components within `rich` that handle terminal interaction.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep `rich` Updated:** Regularly update the `rich` library to benefit from security patches that address potential escape sequence injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Be Aware of Terminal Capabilities:** Understand the capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of the target terminals where the application will be used. Different terminals interpret escape sequences differently.
*   **Consider Sandboxing or Controlled Environments:** If the application's output is critical or handles sensitive information, consider running it in a sandboxed environment or a controlled terminal environment to limit the impact of potential terminal manipulation.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through `rich` Output](./threats/information_disclosure_through__rich__output.md)

**Description:** The application inadvertently includes sensitive information in the data that is passed to `rich` for formatting and display. This information is then exposed in the output, potentially to unauthorized users or systems.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, personal information, or internal system details.

**Affected Component:** The core rendering process within `rich`, potentially involving various modules depending on how the sensitive data is formatted and displayed.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Careful Data Handling:** Ensure that sensitive data is not included in the strings or data structures passed to `rich` for rendering unless absolutely necessary and with appropriate safeguards.
*   **Redaction or Masking:** Implement mechanisms to redact or mask sensitive information before it is passed to `rich`.
*   **Review Output:** Regularly review the application's output logs and displays to identify any potential information disclosure issues.
*   **Contextual Security:** Consider the context in which the `rich` output is being displayed. Is it going to a secure log file, a user's terminal, or a public web interface? Apply appropriate security measures based on the context.
