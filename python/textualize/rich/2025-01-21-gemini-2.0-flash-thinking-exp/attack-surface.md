# Attack Surface Analysis for textualize/rich

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized User Input in Rich Formatting](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_user_input_in_rich_formatting.md)

*   **Description:**  When user-provided data is directly incorporated into `rich` formatting strings without proper sanitization, malicious users can inject ANSI escape sequences or other formatting codes.
    *   **How Rich Contributes:** `rich` interprets and renders ANSI escape sequences for styling and terminal manipulation. This functionality becomes a vulnerability when the input source is untrusted.
    *   **Example:** An application takes user input for a message and displays it using `rich.print(f"[bold]{user_input}[/bold]")`. A malicious user enters `"\x1b[31mThis is red text\x1b[0m"` as input, causing the output to be red, or potentially more harmful escape sequences.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Terminal manipulation (clearing screen, cursor movement).
        *   Denial of Service (freezing or crashing the terminal).
        *   Information disclosure (potentially revealing terminal environment details).
        *   Spoofing or deception through manipulated output.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize user input before using it in `rich` formatting. This involves stripping or escaping ANSI escape sequences and other potentially harmful formatting codes. Libraries like `bleach` (though primarily for HTML) or custom regular expressions can be used.
        *   **Avoid Direct Interpolation:**  Avoid directly embedding user input into f-strings or `.format()` calls used with `rich`. If necessary, ensure thorough sanitization.

## Attack Surface: [Displaying Untrusted External Data](./attack_surfaces/displaying_untrusted_external_data.md)

*   **Description:** When data from external sources (APIs, files, databases) is displayed using `rich` without sanitization, it might contain malicious ANSI escape sequences or formatting codes.
    *   **How Rich Contributes:** `rich` renders the content it receives, including any embedded formatting codes. If the source is untrusted, this can lead to exploitation.
    *   **Example:** An application fetches log data from a remote server and displays it using `rich`. A compromised server injects malicious ANSI escape sequences into the log entries, potentially disrupting the user's terminal.
    *   **Impact:** Same as "Unsanitized User Input in Rich Formatting" (terminal manipulation, DoS, information disclosure, spoofing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize data retrieved from external sources before displaying it with `rich`.
        *   **Content Security Policies (Internal):** If the external source is within your control, implement measures to prevent the injection of malicious formatting at the source.
        *   **Consider Alternative Display Methods:** For highly untrusted data, consider displaying it in a plain text format or using a more controlled rendering mechanism.

## Attack Surface: [Rich's Handling of File Paths in `File` Renderable](./attack_surfaces/rich's_handling_of_file_paths_in__file__renderable.md)

*   **Description:** If user-controlled input is used to specify file paths for rendering using `rich.File`, it can lead to local file inclusion vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Rich Contributes:** `rich.File` is designed to display the contents of files. If the path is not validated, attackers can specify paths to sensitive files.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to view file contents using a command like `view_file <filename>`. The application uses `rich.print(File(filename))`. A malicious user provides a path like `/etc/passwd`, potentially exposing sensitive system information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Local File Inclusion (LFI): Access to sensitive files on the server or client machine.
        *   Information Disclosure.
        *   Potential for further exploitation depending on the content of the exposed files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Path Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided file paths. Use whitelisting of allowed directories or filenames.
        *   **Avoid Direct User Input for File Paths:**  If possible, avoid allowing users to directly specify file paths. Use predefined options or identifiers that map to safe file locations.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to access files.
