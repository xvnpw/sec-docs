# Attack Surface Analysis for textualize/rich

## Attack Surface: [Terminal Escape Sequence Injection](./attack_surfaces/terminal_escape_sequence_injection.md)

*Description:* Attackers inject malicious terminal escape sequences into input that `rich` then renders, allowing them to manipulate the terminal's display, potentially leading to spoofing, data exfiltration (in rare cases with specific terminal emulators), or denial of service.
*How `rich` Contributes:* `rich` uses escape sequences for formatting. If input isn't sanitized, `rich` will pass these sequences to the terminal.
*Example:* An attacker provides input like `"\x1b[2J"` (clear screen) or `"\x1b[1;31m"` (set text color to red) within a string that `rich` is supposed to display as plain text.  More complex sequences could attempt to move the cursor and overwrite existing text.
*Impact:*  Visual disruption, potential spoofing of displayed information, possible denial of service (by clearing the screen repeatedly or causing the terminal to malfunction), and in very rare cases with vulnerable terminals, limited data exfiltration or command execution.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developer:** *Strictly* sanitize and escape all user-supplied input *before* passing it to any `rich` rendering function.  Use a dedicated library for escaping terminal escape sequences if necessary; do *not* rely on general-purpose HTML escaping. Prefer using `rich`'s structured objects (like `Table`, `Tree`) over manually constructing strings with escape codes.
    *   **User:** Use a reputable and up-to-date terminal emulator.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution (Extremely Unlikely)](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution__extremely_unlikely_.md)

*Description:*  A highly unlikely scenario where a vulnerability in `rich` (or a very unusual interaction with a specific terminal emulator) allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code through specially crafted input. This would require a significant flaw in `rich`'s internal handling of input or escape sequences.
*How `rich` Contributes:*  This would only be possible if `rich` incorrectly interpreted input as executable code or had a vulnerability that allowed escape sequences to trigger arbitrary code execution in the terminal.
*Example:*  This is highly theoretical.  It would likely involve a complex and carefully crafted escape sequence exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in `rich` or a very specific terminal emulator.
*Impact:*  Complete system compromise.  The attacker could gain full control of the application and potentially the underlying system.
*Risk Severity:* Critical (but extremely low probability)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developer:**  Keep `rich` and its dependencies updated.  Rigorously sanitize all input (even though this is unlikely to be the direct vector).  Follow secure coding practices in general.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are crucial.
    *   **User:** Use a reputable and up-to-date terminal emulator.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities (If `rich` uses vulnerable dependency for critical task)](./attack_surfaces/dependency-related_vulnerabilities__if__rich__uses_vulnerable_dependency_for_critical_task_.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities in `rich`'s dependencies, *specifically if those dependencies are used by `rich` in a way that exposes the vulnerability*, could be exploited, indirectly affecting the security of the application. This is only included if the vulnerable dependency is directly involved in a critical `rich` function (e.g., parsing user input).
*How `rich` Contributes:* `rich` relies on these external libraries and *uses them in its core functionality*.
*Example:* A vulnerability in `pygments` that is triggered *when `rich` uses it to highlight attacker-controlled code snippets* could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  (This is distinct from a general `pygments` vulnerability that isn't triggered by `rich`'s usage.)
*Impact:* Varies depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
*Risk Severity:* Potentially High to Critical (depending on the dependency and how `rich` uses it).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developer:** Regularly update `rich` and *all* of its dependencies to the latest versions. Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `pip-audit`, `safety`) to identify and track known vulnerabilities.  Pay *particular* attention to vulnerabilities in dependencies that `rich` uses for input processing or formatting. Consider using a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
    * **User:** No direct user mitigation.
