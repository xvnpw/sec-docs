# Threat Model Analysis for textualize/rich

## Threat: [Threat 1: Denial of Service via Excessive Table Generation](./threats/threat_1_denial_of_service_via_excessive_table_generation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input that causes the application to generate extremely large or deeply nested tables using `rich.table.Table`.  This could consume excessive server resources (CPU and memory) during the table rendering process. The attacker is exploiting the application's willingness to create tables based on potentially unbounded user input.  `rich`'s table rendering is the direct cause of the resource consumption.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) on the server. The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected Rich Component:** `rich.table.Table`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement strict limits on the number of rows, columns, and nesting levels allowed in tables generated from user input.  This is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Set resource limits (e.g., memory limits, timeouts) on the server-side process that renders the tables.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from submitting a large number of requests that trigger table generation.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Undiscovered Vulnerability in `rich` (Potentially Critical)](./threats/threat_2_undiscovered_vulnerability_in__rich___potentially_critical_.md)

*   **Description:** `rich`, like any software, may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities.  An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities. While the exact nature is unknown, a vulnerability *within* `rich` itself could be directly exploited.
*   **Impact:** Unknown; could range from information disclosure to denial of service, or *potentially* even remote code execution (though RCE is less likely in the typical usage scenario, it cannot be entirely ruled out without knowing the specific vulnerability). The impact depends entirely on the nature of the undiscovered bug.
*   **Affected Rich Component:** Any component within `rich`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Unknown (Potentially Critical, High) -  We must assume the worst-case scenario until a vulnerability is discovered and analyzed.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `rich` Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of `rich` to receive security patches. This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow the `rich` project on GitHub to be notified of any security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to automatically scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Denial of Service via Excessive Progress Bar Updates](./threats/threat_3_denial_of_service_via_excessive_progress_bar_updates.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input that controls the update frequency or total steps of a `rich.progress.Progress` bar. If the application updates the progress bar too frequently or with an extremely large number of steps, and this update process is directly tied to `rich`'s rendering, it could consume excessive CPU resources.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) on the server.
*   **Affected Rich Component:** `rich.progress.Progress`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and limit the parameters that control the progress bar's behavior (e.g., total steps, update frequency).
    *   **Throttling:** Implement throttling to limit the rate at which the progress bar is updated, regardless of the input. For example, update the bar at most once per second.
    *   **Asynchronous Updates:** If possible, update the progress bar asynchronously to avoid blocking the main application thread. This helps prevent the DoS from completely halting the application.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Resource Exhaustion via `rich.live.Live`](./threats/threat_4_resource_exhaustion_via__rich_live_live_.md)

*   **Description:** If `rich.live.Live` is used to display rapidly updating content based on user input without proper controls, an attacker could provide input that causes excessive updates, consuming server resources (CPU, memory). The rapid updates, directly handled by `rich.live.Live`, are the source of the resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Affected Rich Component:** `rich.live.Live`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which the `Live` display is updated, regardless of the input. This is crucial.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and limit the size and complexity of the data being displayed.
    *   **Throttling:** Implement server-side throttling to control the update frequency, providing an additional layer of protection.
