## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Whitelisting for `rich` Markup](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_whitelisting_for__rich__markup.md)

**1. Input Sanitization and Whitelisting for `rich` Markup**

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization and Whitelisting for `rich` Markup.

*   **Description:**
    1.  *Identify `rich` Input Points:* Pinpoint all locations in your code where data (especially user-supplied or untrusted data) is passed to `rich` functions that interpret markup.  This includes, but is not limited to: `Console.print()`, `Text()`, `Markdown()`, `Panel()`, and any custom classes or functions that utilize `rich`'s rendering engine.
    2.  *Define a Strict Whitelist:* Create a very specific list (whitelist) of allowed `rich` markup tags and attributes.  This whitelist should be as restrictive as possible, containing *only* the absolutely essential tags for your application's needs.  For example: `['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'color=red', 'color=blue']`.  *Explicitly exclude* any tags that could allow for arbitrary code execution, escape sequences, or complex styling that isn't strictly required.
    3.  *Implement a `rich`-Specific Sanitizer:* Before passing *any* input to `rich`, use a dedicated sanitization function or library.  While general-purpose HTML sanitizers (like `bleach`) *can* be used, they *must* be configured specifically for the `rich` whitelist.  A custom sanitizer tailored to `rich`'s markup syntax might be necessary for maximum security.  The sanitizer should:
        *   Remove all tags and attributes *not* present in the whitelist.
        *   Properly escape any special characters *within* allowed tags to prevent them from being misinterpreted as markup.  This is crucial, as `rich`'s markup syntax might differ from standard HTML.
        *   Handle nested markup carefully, potentially limiting the nesting depth to prevent resource exhaustion.
    4.  *Context-Aware Sanitization:* If different parts of your application require different levels of `rich` markup, implement *separate* sanitization rules for each context.  For example, user comments might allow limited formatting, while log messages might disallow all markup.
    5.  *Testing with `rich`-Specific Payloads:* Thoroughly test the sanitization logic with a wide range of inputs, including specifically crafted payloads designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities in `rich`'s markup parsing.  This is *different* from general HTML/XSS testing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   *Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) via Console Markup:* (Severity: **Critical**) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious control sequences or escape codes that could lead to arbitrary code execution *through* `rich`'s rendering engine.
    *   *Log Spoofing/Injection (via `rich` formatting):* (Severity: **High**) - Reduces the risk of attackers injecting misleading log entries by manipulating the *formatting* of log messages rendered by `rich`.
    *   *Information Disclosure (Indirect, via `rich` styling):* (Severity: **Medium**) - By limiting the available markup, it reduces the potential for attackers to use styling (colors, emphasis) to subtly leak information or mislead users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   *ACE:* Risk reduction: **Very High** (near elimination if implemented correctly and comprehensively).
    *   *Log Spoofing/Injection:* Risk reduction: **High** (specifically for injection via `rich` formatting).
    *   *Information Disclosure:* Risk reduction: **Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `UserInputHandler.sanitize_rich_input()` function uses a custom sanitizer with a predefined whitelist for user-provided text displayed with `rich.panel.Panel`. Found in `modules/user_input.py`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Log formatting in `modules/logging.py` uses `rich.console.Console` to style log output, but does *not* sanitize user-provided data before applying formatting. This is a critical vulnerability.
    *   Example: The error reporting module (`modules/errors.py`) uses `rich.traceback.Traceback` to display exceptions, and input sanitization is inconsistent.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Input and Output Length Limits (Specifically for `rich`)](./mitigation_strategies/input_and_output_length_limits__specifically_for__rich__.md)

**2. Input and Output Length Limits (Specifically for `rich`)**

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Impose Strict Input and Output Length Limits for `rich`-Processed Data.

*   **Description:**
    1.  *Identify `rich` Processing Points:* Determine all locations where user input or data from external sources is processed by `rich` for rendering.
    2.  *Define Input Length Limits (Pre-`rich`):* Establish reasonable maximum lengths for input strings *before* they are passed to `rich`. These limits should be based on the expected data and application requirements, and they should be as short as is practical.  Consider different limits for different input fields or contexts.
    3.  *Enforce Input Limits (Pre-`rich`):* Before passing any input to `rich`, rigorously check its length. If it exceeds the limit:
        *   Reject the input entirely (with a clear error message).
        *   Truncate the input to the maximum allowed length (and inform the user, if appropriate).
    4.  *Define Output Length Limits (Post-`rich`):* Determine a maximum size for the output *generated by `rich`*. This could be based on the number of characters, lines, or bytes in the rendered output. This is *distinct* from the input length.
    5.  *Enforce Output Limits (Post-`rich`):* *After* `rich` has processed the input and generated the output, check the size of the resulting output. If it exceeds the limit:
        *   Truncate the output (and clearly indicate this to the user, perhaps with a "Show More" option if feasible).
        *   Consider alternative rendering strategies (e.g., pagination, lazy loading) for very large outputs that are legitimately expected.
    6.  *Limit Nested `rich` Markup Depth:* Specifically limit the depth of nested `rich` markup allowed. Deeply nested markup can lead to exponential growth in output size, even with relatively short input. This might require custom parsing of the input *before* passing it to `rich`, potentially rejecting input with excessive nesting.
    7.  *`rich`-Specific Testing:* Test with inputs of varying lengths, including very long inputs and *deeply nested `rich` markup*, to ensure the limits are enforced correctly and that `rich` itself doesn't introduce unexpected behavior.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   *Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Targeting `rich`):* (Severity: **High**) - Prevents attackers from consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, terminal buffer) by providing overly long or complex inputs *specifically designed to exploit `rich`'s rendering capabilities*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   *DoS:* Risk reduction: **High** (specifically for DoS attacks leveraging `rich`).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Input fields in the user profile editor (`forms/profile.py`) have character limits enforced, and these limits are checked *before* the data is passed to `rich` for display.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: The search results display (`modules/search.py`), which uses `rich` to format results, does not currently limit the length of the displayed snippets, potentially leading to DoS if search results contain very long text.
    *   Example: There are no output size limits for `rich`-generated tables in `modules/data_display.py`.  Large datasets could cause excessive resource consumption.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Log Handling with `rich` Formatting](./mitigation_strategies/secure_log_handling_with__rich__formatting.md)

**3. Secure Log Handling with `rich` Formatting**

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Log Handling with `rich` Formatting (Sanitization and Separation).

*   **Description:**
    1.  *Identify Log Inputs for `rich`:* Determine all sources of data that are included in log messages that are *subsequently formatted using `rich`*. This is crucial if any part of the log message includes user-provided input or data from untrusted sources.
    2.  *Escape *Before* `rich` Formatting:* Before passing *any* data to `rich` functions for log formatting, *always* escape special characters that could be interpreted as `rich` markup or control sequences. Use a dedicated escaping function (e.g., `html.escape()`, but be aware of `rich`'s specific syntax) or a sanitization library configured specifically for `rich`'s allowed markup (if any formatting is desired in logs).  This escaping must happen *before* any `rich` processing.
    3.  *Separate Logging and `rich` Formatting:* Use a robust logging library (e.g., Python's `logging` module) to handle the core logging process (writing to files, sending to remote servers, etc.). Apply `rich` formatting *only* for displaying logs to the console or a specific, controlled output, *not* for the primary logging mechanism. This separation is critical.
    4.  *Structured Logging with `rich` for Display Only:* Ideally, use structured logging (e.g., JSON format) to store log data. This makes logs easier to parse and analyze, and it significantly reduces the risk of misinterpreting malicious input. Apply `rich` formatting *only* for the *display* of these structured logs, *never* for their storage.
    5.  *Testing with `rich`-Specific Injection Attempts:* Include tests that specifically attempt to inject malicious `rich` markup or control sequences into log messages to verify the effectiveness of the sanitization and separation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   *Log Spoofing/Injection (via `rich` formatting):* (Severity: **High**) - Prevents attackers from injecting misleading or malicious content into log files *by manipulating the `rich` formatting applied to log messages*. This is distinct from general log injection; it focuses on the `rich` aspect.
    *   *Information Disclosure (Indirect, via `rich` in logs):* (Severity: **Medium**) - Reduces the risk of sensitive information being inadvertently leaked through log messages due to `rich` styling (e.g., highlighting certain data).

*   **Impact:**
    *   *Log Spoofing/Injection:* Risk reduction: **High** (specifically for injection through `rich` formatting).
    *   *Information Disclosure:* Risk reduction: **Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: The application uses Python's `logging` module to write logs to files, and `rich` is used *only* for console output.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Log messages that include user input are *not* consistently escaped *before* being passed to `rich` for console formatting. This is a critical vulnerability that needs to be addressed in `modules/logging.py` and any other modules that generate logs displayed with `rich`.
    *   Example: The application does not use structured logging; it uses plain text logs, even for the underlying log data. This makes it harder to analyze and potentially more vulnerable to injection, even with `rich` formatting applied only for display.
