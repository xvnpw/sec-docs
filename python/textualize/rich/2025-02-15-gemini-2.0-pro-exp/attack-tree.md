# Attack Tree Analysis for textualize/rich

Objective: To cause a Denial of Service (DoS) in an application utilizing the `textualize/rich` library by manipulating its input or exploiting vulnerabilities in its rendering or parsing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_resource_exhaustion__critical_.md)

This is a critical area because it represents a common and easily exploitable class of vulnerabilities. Applications using `rich` *must* have robust defenses against resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Excessive Console Output](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_excessive_console_output.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides input that causes `rich` to generate a very large amount of output to the console. This overwhelms the terminal, the application's output handling, or logging mechanisms, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Example:** A very long string, deeply nested `rich` objects (e.g., a Table with thousands of rows and columns), or repeated calls to `rich` printing functions with large amounts of data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Excessive Memory Usage](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_excessive_memory_usage.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts input that causes `rich` to consume a large amount of memory. This can lead to an out-of-memory (OOM) error, crashing the application. This might involve deeply nested `rich` objects or very long strings with complex formatting.
*   **Example:**  A deeply nested structure of `rich` objects (e.g., Panels within Panels within Tables, etc., with many levels of nesting), or a very long string with many style changes.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Crash via Input [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_crash_via_input__critical_.md)

This category is critical because crashes can lead to DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Fuzzing Rich Objects](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_fuzzing_rich_objects.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses fuzzing techniques to send a large number of randomly generated or mutated `rich` objects (e.g., `Table`, `Panel`, `Text`, `Console`) to the application. The goal is to find inputs that cause `rich` to crash due to unexpected internal states or unhandled exceptions.
*   **Example:** Using a fuzzer to generate random combinations of `rich` object properties, including invalid or out-of-range values.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
