## Attack Tree Path: [1.  ==>[1.0] Exploit Input Handling in Rich==>**](./attack_tree_paths/1___==_1_0__exploit_input_handling_in_rich==.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how the application handles user-provided input when using the `rich` library. This is a broad category encompassing markup injection and data injection issues.
*   **Risk Level:** High
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Prioritize input sanitization and validation for all user-controlled data before using it with `rich`.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.  **[1.1] Rich Markup Injection**](./attack_tree_paths/2____1_1__rich_markup_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious `rich` markup into the application's input, which is then rendered by `rich` without proper sanitization. This can lead to various impacts, from Denial of Service to output manipulation.
*   **Risk Level:** High
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Implement strict input sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful `rich` markup from user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.  ==>[1.1.2] Output Manipulation / Misleading Information==>**](./attack_tree_paths/3___==_1_1_2__output_manipulation__misleading_information==.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting the manipulation of displayed information by injecting `rich` markup. Attackers aim to alter the intended output to mislead users, hide critical information, or misrepresent data.
*   **Risk Level:** High
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Sanitize input to prevent markup injection that could alter the meaning or presentation of critical information. Context-aware output validation can also help detect manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.  ==>[1.1.2.a] Inject markup to alter displayed information (e.g., hide critical warnings, misrepresent data)==>**](./attack_tree_paths/4___==_1_1_2_a__inject_markup_to_alter_displayed_information__e_g___hide_critical_warnings__misrepre_00a92ba9.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** A specific instance of output manipulation where the attacker's goal is to directly change the displayed information, for example, by hiding warnings, altering numerical data, or changing status indicators.
*   **Risk Level:** High
*   **Attack Details:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Moderate (Misinformation, User Error)
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Novice
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Output monitoring, context-aware checks)
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Robust input sanitization, and potentially output validation to ensure critical information is displayed as intended and not altered by injected markup.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.  ==>[2.0] Exploit Rich's Dependencies (Supply Chain Attack - Less Direct, but Relevant)==>**](./attack_tree_paths/5___==_2_0__exploit_rich's_dependencies__supply_chain_attack_-_less_direct__but_relevant_==.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by the `rich` library. This is a supply chain attack vector, where the application is indirectly compromised through a vulnerability in a third-party library.
*   **Risk Level:** Medium to High (Impact can be very high)
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Rigorous dependency management, including regular updates, vulnerability scanning, and potentially supply chain security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [6.  ==>[2.1] Compromise a Rich Dependency==>**](./attack_tree_paths/6___==_2_1__compromise_a_rich_dependency==.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting the compromise of a dependency of `rich`. This could be through exploiting known vulnerabilities or, in more sophisticated attacks, through supply chain poisoning.
*   **Risk Level:** Medium to High (Impact can be very high)
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Proactive dependency management, vulnerability monitoring, and considering measures to verify the integrity of dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [7.  ==>**[2.1.1] Exploit known vulnerabilities in Rich's dependencies**==>**](./attack_tree_paths/7___==_2_1_1__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_rich's_dependencies==.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in `rich`'s dependencies, such as `pygments` or `commonmark.py`. This is often achieved by targeting applications that use outdated versions of these dependencies.
*   **Risk Level:** High (if dependencies are not updated)
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Maintain up-to-date dependencies. Implement automated dependency scanning and update processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [8.  ==>**[2.1.1.a] Identify and exploit outdated or vulnerable versions of Rich's dependencies**==>**](./attack_tree_paths/8___==_2_1_1_a__identify_and_exploit_outdated_or_vulnerable_versions_of_rich's_dependencies==.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The specific action of identifying and exploiting outdated and vulnerable versions of `rich`'s dependencies. This is a common and relatively easy attack if dependency management is neglected.
*   **Risk Level:** High (if dependencies are not updated)
*   **Attack Details:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium (Outdated dependencies are common)
    *   Impact: Moderate to Critical (Depends on vulnerability, RCE possible)
    *   Effort: Low (Public exploits may exist)
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate (Depending on exploit complexity)
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy (Vulnerability scanners)
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Regularly update dependencies, use vulnerability scanners, and implement a robust patch management process.

## Attack Tree Path: [9.  ==>**[3.0] Exploit Misconfiguration or Misuse of Rich in the Application**==>**](./attack_tree_paths/9___==_3_0__exploit_misconfiguration_or_misuse_of_rich_in_the_application==.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect configuration or improper usage of the `rich` library within the application's code. This often involves developers unintentionally creating security gaps through misuse.
*   **Risk Level:** High
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Developer education on secure `rich` usage, code reviews to identify misconfigurations, and clear security guidelines for using `rich`.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. ==>**[3.1] Expose Rich output directly to untrusted users without sanitization**==>**](./attack_tree_paths/10__==_3_1__expose_rich_output_directly_to_untrusted_users_without_sanitization==.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Directly rendering user-controlled input using `rich` without any sanitization or escaping. This is a common and easily exploitable mistake that leads to markup injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Level:** Very High
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  **Absolutely avoid directly rendering unsanitized user input with `rich`.** Implement mandatory input sanitization for all user-provided content.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. ==>**[3.1.a] Application directly renders user-controlled input using Rich without proper escaping or validation**==>**](./attack_tree_paths/11__==_3_1_a__application_directly_renders_user-controlled_input_using_rich_without_proper_escaping__49baae52.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The most specific and critical action: the application code directly takes user input and passes it to `rich` for rendering without any form of security processing.
*   **Risk Level:** Very High
*   **Attack Details:**
    *   Likelihood: High (Common developer mistake)
    *   Impact: Moderate to Significant (Markup injection vulnerabilities)
    *   Effort: Minimal (No special effort needed by attacker)
    *   Skill Level: Novice
    *   Detection Difficulty: Easy (Code review, security testing)
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Mandatory input sanitization. Code reviews specifically targeting `rich` usage and input handling. Automated security testing for markup injection vulnerabilities.
