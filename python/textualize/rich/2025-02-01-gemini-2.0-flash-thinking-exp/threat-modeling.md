# Threat Model Analysis for textualize/rich

## Threat: [Terminal Escape Sequence Injection](./threats/terminal_escape_sequence_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious ANSI escape sequences into input that is rendered by `rich`. This can be done by providing crafted strings as user input or by manipulating data sources displayed using `rich`. The attacker aims to control the terminal's behavior beyond intended formatting, potentially leading to deceptive or harmful outcomes.

**Impact:**
*   Screen manipulation (clearing, overwriting, misleading output, hiding critical information)
*   Social engineering attacks by crafting deceptive output to trick users into actions (e.g., running malicious commands, disclosing credentials).
*   Denial of service by flooding the terminal with escape sequences, making it unusable.
*   In rare cases, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in specific terminal emulators through crafted escape sequences.

**Affected Rich Component:**  `Console` class, rendering engine, any function displaying user-controlled input (e.g., `print`, `log`, `console.print`, `console.markup`). Specifically, the handling of strings passed to these functions that might contain escape sequences.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly Sanitize User Input:**  Implement robust sanitization of all user-provided input or external data sources before rendering with `rich`. This should include stripping or escaping ANSI escape sequences. Use well-vetted libraries or functions designed for this purpose.
*   **Control Rich Markup Usage:** If using `rich`'s markup language, carefully control and validate the allowed markup tags and attributes, especially when dealing with untrusted input.  Prefer programmatic construction of rich output over allowing arbitrary markup from users.
*   **Content Security Policy (Conceptual for Terminal Output):**  Define and enforce a policy for the types of content and formatting allowed in terminal output, particularly when displaying potentially untrusted data. Limit the use of complex or potentially dangerous formatting features when handling external input.
*   **Regularly Update Rich:** Keep the `rich` library updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches or improvements that might address input handling vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Audits and Testing:** For applications with high security requirements, conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on input handling and the potential for escape sequence injection when using `rich`.
