# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is focused on providing a Python library named `rich` that enhances the visual output of text in terminal environments. The primary business goal is to improve developer experience and productivity by making terminal output more readable, informative, and visually appealing.

Business Priorities:
- Enhance developer productivity and user experience.
- Maintain a high-quality, well-documented, and easy-to-use library.
- Foster a strong open-source community around the library.

Business Risks:
- Supply chain vulnerabilities: If the library or its dependencies are compromised, it could affect projects that depend on it.
- Security vulnerabilities in the library itself could be exploited by malicious actors, although the direct impact is likely to be low as it's primarily a development tool.
- Reputation damage if the library is perceived as unreliable or insecure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: GitHub repository hosting with standard GitHub security features (access control, audit logs). Implemented by: GitHub platform.
- security control: Open-source development model with public code review. Implemented by: GitHub and community contributions.
- security control: PyPI package distribution with standard PyPI security features (package signing, malware scanning). Implemented by: PyPI platform.
- accepted risk: Reliance on open-source dependencies.
- accepted risk: Public accessibility of the source code.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential security flaws in the code.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Follow secure coding practices and guidelines during development.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable as `rich` is a library and does not handle user authentication.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable as `rich` is a library and does not handle user authorization.
- Input Validation: While `rich` primarily generates output, it does accept input to format. Input validation should be considered to prevent unexpected behavior or errors, especially when handling user-provided data to be formatted. Implemented in: `rich` library code.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable as `rich` does not handle sensitive data or require cryptographic operations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Maintaining the quality and security of the `rich` library to ensure developer trust and continued adoption.
- Efficient and secure distribution of the library to developers via PyPI.

Data to Protect:
- Source code of the `rich` library: Sensitivity - Public (open-source), but integrity and availability are important.
- Build artifacts (packages): Sensitivity - Public, but integrity is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks.
- PyPI publishing credentials: Sensitivity - High, must be kept secret to prevent unauthorized package updates.

Data Sensitivity:
- Publicly available open-source code and packages. The main concern is the integrity and availability of the code and packages, and preventing unauthorized modifications or malicious insertions.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended scope of threat modeling? Is it focused on the library itself, the build and release process, or the usage of the library in other projects?
- Are there any specific security concerns or past incidents related to the `rich` library or similar projects?
- What is the risk appetite of the organization or users relying on the `rich` library? (e.g., startup vs. Fortune 500).

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a valuable tool for the Python developer community, and security is important for maintaining trust and reputation.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Standard open-source security practices are followed. The main security risks are related to supply chain vulnerabilities and potential code flaws.
- DESIGN: The library is distributed via PyPI and used by developers in their local environments. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions.
