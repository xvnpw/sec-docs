## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Controlled Input Rendered by Rich](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-controlled_input_rendered_by_rich.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User-Controlled Input Rendered by Rich
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Rich Input Points:**  Locate all places in your application code where user-provided data is directly passed to `rich` rendering functions such as `console.print()`, `console.log()`, or when rendering Markdown content using `rich`.
    2.  **Choose Sanitization Method for Rich:** Select a sanitization technique specifically aimed at mitigating risks within `rich`'s rendering context. This primarily involves handling ANSI escape codes and potentially other formatting characters that `rich` interprets. Options include:
        *   **ANSI Escape Code Stripping:**  Use regular expressions (e.g., Python's `re` module) to remove ANSI escape codes from user input *before* passing it to `rich`. This prevents users from manipulating terminal output formatting through `rich`.
        *   **Character Whitelisting/Blacklisting (for Rich Context):**  If finer control is needed, implement whitelisting or blacklisting of specific characters relevant to `rich`'s formatting, beyond just ANSI codes.
    3.  **Implement Rich Sanitization Function:** Create a dedicated function that takes user input as a string and applies the chosen sanitization method *specifically for use with `rich`*. This function should be called before any user input is rendered by `rich`.
    4.  **Apply Rich Sanitization Before Rendering:**  In your code, ensure that the rich sanitization function is consistently applied to user input *immediately before* it is passed to any `rich` rendering function.
    5.  **Testing with Rich Rendering:**  Thoroughly test the sanitization function in conjunction with `rich` rendering. Verify that malicious ANSI escape codes and other potentially harmful formatting attempts are effectively neutralized when displayed using `rich`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **ANSI Escape Code Injection via Rich (High Severity):** Malicious users inject ANSI escape codes that are interpreted by `rich` to manipulate terminal output. This can lead to denial-of-service (resource exhaustion during rendering), misleading displays generated by `rich`, or potentially exploiting vulnerabilities if `rich` or the terminal emulator has parsing flaws.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion via Long Strings in Rich Rendering (Medium Severity):**  Extremely long strings, when processed by `rich` for rendering, can consume excessive resources, leading to slowdowns or denial-of-service specifically during `rich`'s rendering process.
    *   **Cosmetic Output Manipulation via Rich (Low Severity):** Users inject formatting codes that `rich` interprets to alter the intended appearance of output displayed by `rich`, causing confusion or misrepresentation within the `rich` output.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **ANSI Escape Code Injection via Rich:**  Significantly reduces risk. Effective sanitization tailored for `rich` eliminates the ability to inject malicious formatting codes that `rich` would interpret.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion via Long Strings in Rich Rendering:**  Reduces risk if combined with input length limits applied *before* passing to `rich`. Sanitization alone might not prevent resource exhaustion if `rich` still processes very long, but *safe*, strings.
    *   **Cosmetic Output Manipulation via Rich:**  Eliminates or greatly reduces the ability to manipulate output appearance specifically through formatting codes that `rich` would render.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:**  Basic string escaping is implemented in the application's logging module *before* logging, which might indirectly sanitize some input that could be rendered by `rich` if logs are displayed in the terminal. However, this is not specifically designed for `rich`'s rendering context.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Areas:**  Dedicated sanitization specifically for `rich` rendering is missing. User input displayed directly in the terminal interface using `rich` during interactive sessions is not sanitized with `rich` in mind. Markdown rendering of user-provided descriptions in help messages, when using `rich` for display, also lacks sanitization tailored for `rich`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Rich Features Used with User Input](./mitigation_strategies/control_rich_features_used_with_user_input.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Rich Features Used with User Input
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Rich Feature Usage with User Data:** Identify all instances in your application where `rich` features like rendering file links, clickable URLs, or Markdown are used to display user-controlled data.
    2.  **Assess Rich Feature Necessity for User Input:** Determine if these specific `rich` features are genuinely necessary and beneficial when displaying user-provided content. If they are not essential for the user experience in these contexts, consider disabling them for user-provided content rendered by `rich`.
    3.  **Implement Rich Feature Restriction:** If certain `rich` features are deemed necessary for user input display, implement controls within your `rich` usage to restrict their potential misuse:
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Rich Features:** Configure `rich`'s rendering context to explicitly disable features like file links or clickable URLs when rendering user input if they are not required. Consult `rich`'s documentation for options to control feature rendering.
        *   **Parameter Validation for Rich Features:** If specific `rich` features are used with user input, validate and sanitize the parameters *passed to those `rich` features*. For example, if using `rich` to render file links based on user input:
            *   **File Links in Rich:** Validate that file paths provided by users, when used in `rich`'s file link rendering, are within expected directories and do not allow access to sensitive system files. Implement path canonicalization *before* passing paths to `rich`'s file link rendering.
            *   **URLs in Rich:** If `rich` is used to render URLs from user input as clickable links, validate URL schemes (allow only `http` and `https`) *before* `rich` renders them. Potentially use a URL safelist to restrict allowed domains that `rich` will render as clickable links.
    4.  **Safe Markdown Rendering with Rich (if applicable):** If you render user-provided content as Markdown using `rich`, and this is a necessary feature, investigate if `rich` offers any "safe mode" or options to limit potentially risky Markdown features during rendering. If not, consider using a separate Markdown sanitization library *before* passing the sanitized Markdown to `rich` for rendering.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Link Injection via Rich (Medium Severity):** Users could inject file links that `rich` renders, potentially pointing to sensitive local files. While `rich` itself doesn't execute these links, if the application or users interact with these rendered links in an unsafe way, it could lead to information disclosure (threat is indirect via `rich`'s rendering).
    *   **Malicious URL Injection via Rich (Medium Severity):** Users could inject malicious URLs that `rich` renders as clickable links. If users click these links, it could lead to phishing attacks or redirection to harmful websites (threat is indirect, via user interaction with `rich`'s output).
    *   **Markdown Injection via Rich (Low to Medium Severity):**  While `rich`'s Markdown rendering is generally considered safer than browser-based rendering, malicious Markdown input, when rendered by `rich`, could still be used for cosmetic manipulation of the terminal output or, in less likely scenarios, to exploit potential parsing vulnerabilities within `rich`'s Markdown rendering engine.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious File Link Injection via Rich:**  Significantly reduces risk by preventing or validating file links rendered by `rich`, limiting potential for indirect information disclosure.
    *   **Malicious URL Injection via Rich:**  Reduces risk of phishing and malicious redirection by validating URL schemes and potentially using URL safelists *before* `rich` renders URLs as clickable links.
    *   **Markdown Injection via Rich:**  Reduces risk of cosmetic manipulation and potential parser vulnerabilities in `rich`'s Markdown rendering by disabling or sanitizing Markdown features *before* rendering with `rich`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:**  Clickable URLs are generally disabled in application logs displayed in the terminal, which are often rendered using `rich`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Areas:** File links are currently rendered by `rich` without validation in certain debug output sections. Markdown rendering in help messages, when displayed using `rich`, does not have specific feature restrictions or sanitization beyond general input sanitization, and no specific controls on `rich`'s Markdown rendering features are in place.
