# Attack Surface Analysis for textualize/rich

## Attack Surface: [1. Rich Text Markup Injection](./attack_surfaces/1__rich_text_markup_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerability arising from parsing and rendering user-controlled input as rich text markup (Rich markup, Markdown, BBCode) without proper sanitization. Malicious markup can be injected to cause significant unintended behavior.
*   **How Rich Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rich`'s core functionality is to interpret and render rich text markup. If user input is directly passed to `rich`'s rendering functions without sanitization, it becomes highly susceptible to markup injection attacks.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Scenario:** A critical system monitoring application uses `rich` to display alerts and system status based on data that includes user-provided descriptions. User input is directly rendered using `rich.print()`.
    *   **Malicious Input:** An attacker injects data containing: `[blink][bold][red]CRITICAL ALERT:[/red][/bold][/blink] System compromised. [link=https://fake-admin-login.example.com]Login here to resolve![/link]`
    *   **Rendered Output:** `rich` renders this, displaying a highly alarming, blinking, bold, red "CRITICAL ALERT" with a link to a phishing login page, potentially misleading administrators and causing them to compromise credentials.  More complex markup could cause resource exhaustion leading to DoS of the monitoring system display.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High Severity Misinformation/Social Engineering:**  Malicious markup can be used to inject misleading or false information into critical displays, leading to incorrect decisions or social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing links in alerts).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injecting excessively complex or deeply nested markup can consume significant processing resources, leading to performance degradation or application crashes in critical systems relying on `rich` for output.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Implement robust sanitization of all user-provided input *before* it is passed to `rich` for rendering. This should include removing or escaping *all* potentially harmful markup tags and attributes.  Assume all user input is untrusted.
    *   **Markup Allowlisting (Strict):**  If rich text formatting is necessary for user input, define a *very strict* allowlist of permitted markup tags and attributes. Only render markup that strictly conforms to this allowlist.  Reject or escape anything outside the allowlist.
    *   **Contextual Output Encoding:**  Consider encoding user input for safe display within `rich` contexts, even if some formatting is lost. Prioritize security over rich formatting for untrusted input.
    *   **Security Audits of Input Handling:** Regularly audit the code paths where user input is processed and rendered by `rich` to ensure sanitization and validation are effective and consistently applied.

## Attack Surface: [2. Denial of Service via Excessive Output Generation](./attack_surfaces/2__denial_of_service_via_excessive_output_generation.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker can manipulate input to cause `rich` to generate an extremely large volume of output, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service, especially in server-side applications or resource-constrained environments.
*   **How Rich Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rich` is designed to create visually rich and potentially verbose output. Uncontrolled or maliciously crafted input can exploit `rich`'s output generation capabilities to create massive output streams.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Scenario:** A server-side application uses `rich` to log and display detailed processing information based on user requests.
    *   **Malicious Input:** An attacker crafts a request that triggers the application to process a very large dataset or enter an infinite loop in output generation logic when using `rich` to display progress or results.
    *   **Result:** `rich` attempts to render an extremely large amount of output to the server's console or logs. This can lead to:
        *   **Server Resource Exhaustion:**  Excessive CPU and memory usage on the server due to output generation and handling.
        *   **Application Slowdown/Unresponsiveness:** The application becomes slow or unresponsive due to resource contention.
        *   **Log Flooding:**  Logs become flooded with massive output, making it difficult to analyze legitimate events and potentially filling up disk space.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High Severity Denial of Service (DoS):**  Application or server becomes unavailable or severely degraded due to resource exhaustion caused by excessive `rich` output generation.
    *   **Operational Disruption:**  Log flooding and performance degradation can disrupt normal operations and monitoring.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (in server-side and resource-constrained scenarios)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Volume Limiting (Critical):** Implement strict limits on the volume of output generated by `rich`, especially when processing user-controlled input.  Set maximum output line counts or character limits. Truncate or summarize output if limits are exceeded.
    *   **Paging and Buffering:**  For potentially large outputs, implement paging or buffering mechanisms to avoid generating and displaying the entire output at once. Display output in manageable chunks.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Input Validation:**  Implement rate limiting on user requests that trigger `rich` output generation. Validate user input to prevent requests that could lead to excessive output.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:** Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) related to `rich` output generation. Implement throttling mechanisms to limit output generation if resource usage exceeds safe thresholds.
    *   **Asynchronous Output Generation:**  Consider offloading `rich` output generation to asynchronous tasks or background processes to prevent blocking the main application thread and mitigate DoS impact on core application functionality.
