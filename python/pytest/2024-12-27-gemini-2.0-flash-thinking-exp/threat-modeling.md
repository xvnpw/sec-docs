## High and Critical Pytest Threats

This table outlines high and critical security threats that directly involve the `pytest` framework.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Pytest Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Test Code Execution** | An attacker with write access to the test codebase injects malicious code within test functions, fixtures, or hooks. This code is then executed by `pytest` during test runs, potentially performing actions like data exfiltration, system modification, or denial of service. | Data breach, system compromise, application instability, false positive test results. | Test functions, Fixtures (`@pytest.fixture`), Hooks (`pytest_configure`, `pytest_sessionstart`, etc.) | High | **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review all test code changes. **Static Analysis:** Utilize linters and static analysis tools on test code. **Sandboxing:** Run tests in isolated environments with limited access to sensitive resources. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimal necessary permissions to the test execution environment. **Input Sanitization (in tests):** If tests interact with external systems, sanitize inputs to prevent injection vulnerabilities within the test context. |
| **Compromised Test Configuration (`pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`)** | An attacker modifies `pytest.ini` or `conftest.py` to alter test behavior maliciously. This could involve disabling security checks, running arbitrary code through hooks, manipulating test paths, or altering plugin configurations. | False sense of security, undetected vulnerabilities, potential execution of arbitrary code during test runs, leading to system compromise. | `pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`, Plugin loading mechanism | High | **Version Control:** Track changes to configuration files. **Access Control:** Restrict write access to these files. **Code Reviews:** Review changes to configuration files. **Input Validation (for custom configuration):** If `conftest.py` introduces custom configuration, validate the input. |
| **Exploiting Pytest Plugin Vulnerabilities** | An attacker leverages known vulnerabilities in third-party `pytest` plugins. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code within the test environment, gain access to sensitive information, or disrupt the testing process. | System compromise, data breach, denial of service in the testing environment. | Plugin system, specific vulnerable plugin modules/functions | High | **Plugin Vetting:** Carefully evaluate and audit third-party plugins before use. **Dependency Management:** Use dependency management tools to track and update plugin versions. **Security Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies, including pytest plugins, for known vulnerabilities. **Pin Plugin Versions:** Avoid using wildcard version specifiers for plugins. |
