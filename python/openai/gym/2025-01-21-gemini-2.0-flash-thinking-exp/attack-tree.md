# Attack Tree Analysis for openai/gym

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the OpenAI Gym library or its integration.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application via Gym Exploitation [CRITICAL]

    *   AND: Exploit Custom Environments
        *   OR: Code Injection in Custom Environment Definition [CRITICAL]
*   OR: Exploit Dependencies of Gym [CRITICAL]
    *   AND: Vulnerabilities in Core Dependencies (e.g., NumPy, SciPy)
*   OR: Model Poisoning (If Application Trains Models) [CRITICAL]
    *   AND: Manipulate Training Data
```


## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Gym Exploitation [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_gym_exploitation__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the root goal, representing any successful compromise of the application through exploiting Gym. It's critical because it signifies the ultimate success of the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gym Library [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_gym_library__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting known or unknown vulnerabilities within the core Gym library itself.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Access:** Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs) in Gym's code or its direct dependencies.
        *   **Action:** Identifying and exploiting these known bugs using readily available exploit code or by adapting existing techniques. This path is high-risk due to the public nature of the vulnerabilities and the potential ease of exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Manipulate Gym Environments [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__manipulate_gym_environments__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Subverting the intended behavior of Gym environments to compromise the application.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Custom Environments -> Code Injection in Custom Environment Definition [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Access:** The ability to influence or provide the code defining a custom Gym environment used by the application.
        *   **Action:** Injecting malicious code directly into the custom environment's definition. When the application loads and executes this environment, the injected code will also be executed, potentially granting the attacker full control. This is critical due to the direct code execution capability.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Dependencies of Gym [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_dependencies_of_gym__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the libraries that Gym relies on.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Vulnerabilities in Core Dependencies (e.g., NumPy, SciPy):**
        *   **Access:** The fact that Gym depends on other Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy, which may have their own vulnerabilities.
        *   **Action:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities within these core dependencies. Since these libraries are fundamental, vulnerabilities in them can have a wide impact and are often targeted.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Model Poisoning (If Application Trains Models) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__model_poisoning__if_application_trains_models___critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Corrupting the machine learning models trained using Gym to manipulate the application's behavior.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Manipulate Training Data:**
        *   **Access:** The ability to influence the data used to train the machine learning models within the Gym environment.
        *   **Action:** Injecting malicious or biased data into the training dataset. This can lead to the model learning incorrect patterns or biases, causing it to make flawed predictions or decisions that benefit the attacker or harm the application. This is critical if the application relies heavily on the accuracy and integrity of its trained models.
