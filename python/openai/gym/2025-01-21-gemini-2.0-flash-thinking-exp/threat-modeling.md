# Threat Model Analysis for openai/gym

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in one of Gym's dependencies (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pillow). They then craft an input or trigger a specific code path within the application that utilizes the vulnerable dependency *through Gym's API* in a way that exposes the vulnerability. This could involve providing specially crafted environment specifications or interacting with Gym functions that rely on the vulnerable dependency.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution on the server or client running the application, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system, steal sensitive data, or launch further attacks. Denial of service by crashing the application or consuming excessive resources.

**Affected Gym Component:** Dependency management, any module or function within Gym that directly or indirectly uses the vulnerable dependency (e.g., environment creation, observation/action space handling).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Gym and all its dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Implement dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) in the development pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities.
*   Pin dependency versions in the project's requirements file to ensure consistent and tested versions are used.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Environment - Code Execution (via Gym's Loading Mechanism)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_environment_-_code_execution__via_gym's_loading_mechanism_.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages Gym's environment loading mechanism (`gym.make()`) to load a custom environment from a malicious source. The malicious code is embedded within the environment's setup or initialization scripts and is executed when Gym attempts to load or instantiate the environment.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to compromise the system, steal data, or disrupt operations.

**Affected Gym Component:** Environment loading mechanism (`gym.make()`), environment registration, potentially the `gym.envs` module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize and validate the source of Gym environments. Only allow environments from trusted and verified sources.
*   Implement sandboxing or containerization for executing Gym environments to limit the impact of malicious code.
*   Restrict the ability to load arbitrary environments, potentially by whitelisting allowed environment IDs or paths.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Environment - Resource Exhaustion (Triggered by Gym)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_environment_-_resource_exhaustion__triggered_by_gym_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a custom Gym environment that, when loaded or interacted with *through Gym's standard functions*, consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space). This could be due to how Gym handles the environment's initialization or step execution.

**Impact:** Denial of service by overloading the server or client, making the application unresponsive or crashing it.

**Affected Gym Component:** Environment loading mechanism (`gym.make()`), environment interaction functions (e.g., `env.reset()`, `env.step()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory usage) for processes interacting with Gym environments.
*   Implement timeouts for environment initialization and step execution within the application's interaction with Gym.
*   Monitor resource usage during environment interaction and implement mechanisms to terminate runaway processes.

## Threat: [Environment Hijacking/Tampering via Gym's External Interactions (If Any)](./threats/environment_hijackingtampering_via_gym's_external_interactions__if_any_.md)

**Description:** If the Gym library itself (not just a specific environment) directly interacts with external systems or resources, an attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate these interactions. This is less common but could occur if Gym has features for remote environment management or data logging.

**Impact:** Data breaches by accessing or modifying sensitive data in external systems. Manipulation of the application's behavior by altering Gym's interaction with external resources.

**Affected Gym Component:** Any module within Gym that handles external interactions (e.g., network requests, file I/O).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for Gym's interactions with external services.
*   Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing external resources through Gym.
*   Implement input validation and output sanitization for data exchanged with external systems by Gym.
