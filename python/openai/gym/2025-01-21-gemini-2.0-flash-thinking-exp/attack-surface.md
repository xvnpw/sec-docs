# Attack Surface Analysis for openai/gym

## Attack Surface: [Compromised PyPI Package](./attack_surfaces/compromised_pypi_package.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor compromises the `gym` package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and injects malicious code.

**How Gym Contributes:** Applications directly depend on installing `gym` from PyPI. If the official package is compromised, any application installing it will be affected.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a modified `gym` package containing a backdoor that executes arbitrary code on the developer's or user's machine during installation.

**Impact:** Critical. Could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or deployment of malware.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in installed packages.
*   Verify the integrity of the downloaded package using checksums (though this is not foolproof if PyPI is compromised).
*   Consider using a private PyPI mirror or a dependency management tool that allows for verification of package sources.
*   Stay informed about security advisories related to Python packages.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Environment Definitions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_environment_definitions.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to define or load custom Gym environments, a malicious user could craft an environment definition that executes arbitrary code when instantiated or interacted with.

**How Gym Contributes:** Gym provides the framework for defining and loading custom environments. If this functionality is exposed without proper sanitization, it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** A user provides a Python file defining a custom environment. This file contains malicious code within the `__init__`, `step`, or `reset` methods that executes when the application loads or interacts with the environment.

**Impact:** High. Could lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid allowing users to directly provide arbitrary code for environment definitions.
*   If custom environments are necessary, implement strict sandboxing or containerization for their execution.
*   Thoroughly review and sanitize any user-provided environment definitions before loading them.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization for any parameters used in environment creation.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization of Environment States](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization_of_environment_states.md)

**Description:** If the application saves and loads Gym environment states (e.g., using `pickle`), a malicious actor could inject malicious code into the saved state.

**How Gym Contributes:** Gym environments can be serialized and deserialized. If this process is not secured, it can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a saved environment state file (e.g., a pickled object) to include malicious code. When the application loads this saved state, the malicious code is executed.

**Impact:** High. Could lead to arbitrary code execution when loading the compromised state.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using insecure deserialization methods like `pickle` for sensitive data.
*   If serialization is necessary, use safer alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers, and ensure proper validation of the deserialized data.
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., using cryptographic signatures) for saved environment states to detect tampering.
