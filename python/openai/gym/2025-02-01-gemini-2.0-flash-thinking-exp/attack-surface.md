# Attack Surface Analysis for openai/gym

## Attack Surface: [Custom Environment Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/custom_environment_code_injection.md)

Description: Execution of arbitrary code embedded within user-provided or modified custom Gym environment definitions.
How Gym Contributes: Gym's design allows for the creation and registration of custom environments, often defined in Python files. The application's mechanism for loading and utilizing these custom environments can become a vector for code injection if not handled securely. Gym itself provides the framework for extending environments, which, if misused, opens this attack surface.
Example: An attacker crafts a malicious Python file intended to be used as a custom Gym environment. This file, when loaded and initialized by the application through Gym's environment registration process, executes commands to compromise the server, steal data, or perform other malicious actions. The vulnerability arises because Gym's flexibility in allowing custom environments can be exploited if the loading process isn't secure.
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE), full server compromise, data breach, Denial of Service (DoS).
Risk Severity: **Critical**
Mitigation Strategies:
* Restrict Custom Environment Definition Methods: Limit how custom environments are defined and loaded. Avoid directly executing arbitrary Python code from untrusted sources. Consider using a more restricted configuration format instead of full Python files.
* Sandboxing Custom Environments: Execute custom environments within a secure sandbox (e.g., containers, VMs, restricted Python environments) with minimal privileges. This limits the damage malicious code can inflict even if executed.
* Strict Input Validation and Sanitization: If accepting Python code for environment definitions is unavoidable, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization. However, this is complex and inherently risky for code execution vulnerabilities.
* Code Review and Security Audits: Thoroughly review all custom environment code, even from seemingly trusted sources, for potential vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/environment_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Exploitation of vulnerabilities within rendering libraries used by Gym environments or within the environment's rendering logic itself, leading to crashes or potentially code execution.
How Gym Contributes: Gym environments frequently utilize rendering libraries (like Pyglet, Pygame, or even Matplotlib) to visually represent the environment state. Gym's environment API includes rendering functionalities, and if these rendering processes or the underlying libraries have vulnerabilities, they become exploitable through Gym interactions.
Example: A specially crafted Gym environment or a specific rendering request triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability in Pyglet (or another rendering library) when the application attempts to render the environment. This could lead to application crashes, Denial of Service, or in more severe cases, Remote Code Execution if an attacker can control memory sufficiently. The attack surface is exposed because Gym environments often rely on these external rendering components.
Impact: Denial of Service (DoS), application crashes, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the specific vulnerability in the rendering library or rendering code.
Risk Severity: **High** (Can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability and exploitability)
Mitigation Strategies:
* Keep Rendering Libraries Updated: Ensure all rendering libraries used by Gym environments (Pyglet, Pygame, Matplotlib, etc.) are updated to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* Input Validation for Rendering Parameters: Validate any user-controlled inputs that influence rendering parameters or environment configurations that affect rendering complexity.
* Secure Rendering Code Practices: If custom rendering logic is implemented within environments, follow secure coding practices to avoid vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, or resource exhaustion.
* Disable Rendering in Production (If Possible): If rendering is not a critical feature in production deployments, consider disabling it to reduce the attack surface.
* Resource Limits for Rendering: Implement resource limits to prevent Denial of Service attacks through excessive or computationally expensive rendering requests.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Pickling of Environments)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__pickling_of_environments_.md)

Description: Exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities when loading Gym environments or related environment data from untrusted sources using Python's `pickle` or `cloudpickle` libraries.
How Gym Contributes: Gym environments and their states can be serialized and deserialized using Python's pickling mechanism or libraries like `cloudpickle`. This functionality, while useful for saving and loading environments, introduces a critical deserialization vulnerability if untrusted pickled data is processed. Gym's ability to be serialized and restored makes it susceptible to this attack vector if not handled carefully.
Example: An attacker provides a malicious pickled Gym environment object. When the application loads this pickled object using `pickle.load()` or `cloudpickle.load()` (perhaps to restore a saved environment state), the malicious code embedded within the pickled data is executed. This can grant the attacker complete control over the application and the underlying system. The vulnerability is directly related to the use of pickling for Gym environment persistence or transfer.
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE), full system compromise, data breach, privilege escalation.
Risk Severity: **Critical**
Mitigation Strategies:
* Absolutely Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data: The most crucial mitigation is to **never** deserialize Gym environment data or any pickled objects from untrusted or unverified sources. Treat pickled data from external sources as inherently dangerous.
* Secure Serialization Alternatives: If serialization is necessary, explore and utilize safer serialization formats and libraries that are less vulnerable to deserialization attacks (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers). However, these might require significant changes to how Gym environments are handled.
* Input Validation and Integrity Checks (If Deserialization is Unavoidable): If deserialization from potentially untrusted sources is absolutely unavoidable, implement extremely robust validation and integrity checks of the serialized data *before* deserialization. This is highly complex and still carries significant risk. Consider using digital signatures and cryptographic verification to ensure data integrity and origin.
* Restrict Deserialization Privileges: If deserialization must be performed, isolate the deserialization process in a highly restricted environment with minimal privileges to limit the potential damage from successful exploitation.
