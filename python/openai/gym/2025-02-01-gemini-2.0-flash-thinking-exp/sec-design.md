  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions introduces a risk of unintentionally or intentionally malicious code.
  - accepted risk: Security testing might be less rigorous compared to commercial software due to resource constraints.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated vulnerability scanning for dependencies and code.
  - security control: Introduce static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.

    - Requirement: Authorization is needed to control access to repository resources (code, issues, pull requests).
    - Requirement: Authorization is needed to manage releases and package publishing.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Environment definitions should be validated to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: User inputs to environments (actions, observations) should be validated to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities within environments.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Cryptography might be relevant for specific environments that involve secure communication or data handling, but is not a core requirement for the library itself. Consider if any environments require secure storage or transmission of sensitive data.
