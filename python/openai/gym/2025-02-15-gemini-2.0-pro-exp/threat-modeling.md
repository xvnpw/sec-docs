# Threat Model Analysis for openai/gym

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Environment](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_environment.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted Gym environment (e.g., through a custom environment ID passed to `gym.make()` or a compromised third-party environment package) that contains malicious code within the environment's `step()`, `reset()`, or other methods. This code exploits vulnerabilities in Gym, its dependencies (like physics engines), or the underlying system. The key here is that the vulnerability is triggered *through* the normal Gym API, by interacting with a malicious environment.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the host machine, allowing data exfiltration, installation of malware, lateral movement within the network, and potentially control over any systems the RL agent interacts with.
    *   **Affected Gym Component:** `gym.make()`, custom environment classes (specifically `step()`, `reset()`, and any methods that interact with external libraries), and potentially underlying physics engines (MuJoCo, PyBullet) or rendering libraries *as used by Gym*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Sandboxing:** Run all Gym environments within isolated containers (Docker, Podman) with minimal privileges and resource limits.  Consider using gVisor or Kata Containers for enhanced security. This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Virtual Machines:** For maximum isolation, run environments in dedicated VMs.
        *   **Environment Vetting:**  Thoroughly review the source code of all custom and third-party environments.  Use static and dynamic analysis tools.
        *   **Trusted Sources:** Only use environments from known, trusted sources (official Gym releases, reputable researchers/organizations).
        *   **Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate any user-supplied input used to select or configure environments (e.g., environment IDs).  Use a whitelist to restrict allowed environments.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Keep Gym and all its dependencies (including physics engines) up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Pay close attention to security advisories for these components.
        *   **Avoid Pickle:** Never use Pickle (or other unsafe deserialization methods) to deserialize environments from untrusted sources. Gym itself should not be doing this internally if used correctly, but custom environments might.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious environment that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space, network bandwidth) during its `step()` or `reset()` functions, *as called through the Gym API*. This could be achieved through infinite loops, large memory allocations, excessive file writes, or network requests within the environment's code.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from training or evaluating agents.  This can also impact other services running on the same host.
    *   **Affected Gym Component:** Custom environment classes (specifically `step()` and `reset()`), and potentially any methods that interact with system resources *as invoked through the Gym API*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict resource limits (CPU time, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth) on Gym environments, even within containers.  Use cgroups or similar mechanisms provided by the container runtime or operating system.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for environment interactions (`step()` and `reset()` calls) to prevent infinite loops within the environment from hanging the application. This is crucial.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Containerization and VMs help limit the impact of resource exhaustion, preventing a single malicious environment from taking down the entire host.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage of environments to detect anomalies that may indicate a DoS attack.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly Exploitable through Gym)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_exploitable_through_gym_.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Gym itself or its *direct* dependencies (NumPy, rendering libraries, physics engines *as used by standard Gym environments*) are exploited *through a malicious environment*. This differs from a general dependency vulnerability; the exploit path must be through the Gym API (e.g., a crafted observation or action that triggers a vulnerability in a rendering library).
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. The impact is directly tied to how Gym uses the vulnerable dependency.
    * **Affected Gym Component:** Gym itself and any of its *directly used* dependencies. This is most critical for dependencies involved in processing environment observations, actions, or rendering.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical), depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Gym and all its *direct* dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches. Prioritize updates for dependencies known to be used in observation/action processing or rendering.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools specifically targeting Python packages and, if applicable, the physics engines used by your environments.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Sandboxing (containers, VMs) can limit the impact of some dependency vulnerabilities, even if they are triggered through the Gym API.
        *  **Minimal Dependencies:** If building custom environments, use the minimal set of necessary dependencies to reduce the attack surface.
