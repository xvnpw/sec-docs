## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gymnasium's Environment Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_gymnasium's_environment_handling__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the overarching threat of exploiting how Gymnasium manages and interacts with environments.  It's critical because it's the foundation for many attacks.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.4 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Specific Environments (Third-Party or Custom) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This is the most likely path to a serious compromise.  Attackers target vulnerabilities within the environments themselves, which are often less secure than the core Gymnasium library.
        *   **Steps:**
            *   **1.1.4.1 Identify a vulnerable environment:**  The attacker researches publicly available environments or analyzes custom environments to find security flaws.  This could involve looking for outdated dependencies, known vulnerabilities, or coding errors.
            *   **1.1.4.2 Craft an exploit:**  Once a vulnerability is found, the attacker develops an exploit tailored to that specific flaw.  This could involve crafting malicious inputs, exploiting buffer overflows, or using other techniques to gain control.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Use only well-maintained and vetted environments.
            *   Thoroughly review the code of any custom or third-party environments.
            *   Implement strict sandboxing to isolate environments from the host system.
            *   Regularly scan environments for known vulnerabilities.
            *   Apply least privilege principles to the Gymnasium application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Learning Process [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_learning_process__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the attacker's goal of altering the training process to produce a biased or malicious model. It's critical because even without full system compromise, this can have severe consequences.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **2.1 Poison Training Data [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker aims to corrupt the training data, leading the model to learn incorrect or malicious behaviors.
        *   **Steps:**
            *   **2.1.1 Modify Existing Training Data:** If the attacker gains write access to the training dataset, they can directly alter the data to introduce bias.
            *   **2.1.2 Inject Malicious Data into Environment Interactions [CRITICAL]:** This is a more sophisticated approach where the attacker manipulates the environment's inputs or observations during training.
                *   **2.1.2.1 Gain control over the environment's input or observation space:** This is a crucial prerequisite. The attacker needs to find a way to influence the data the agent receives, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in the environment.
                *   **2.1.2.2 Craft malicious inputs/observations:** The attacker carefully designs inputs that will subtly shift the model's learning in a desired direction.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Implement strict access controls on training data.
            *   Use data integrity checks (e.g., checksums) to detect modifications.
            *   Sanitize and validate all inputs to the environment.
            *   Employ robust learning algorithms less susceptible to data poisoning.
            *   Monitor training progress for anomalies.

    *   **2.2 Modify Reward Function [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker aims to change the reward function, which dictates the agent's learning objective. This gives the attacker complete control over what the agent learns.
        * **Steps:**
            *   **2.2.1 Directly Modify Code:** Requires write access to the codebase.
            *   **2.2.2 Exploit Environment Vulnerabilities to Influence Reward Calculation:** Requires finding a vulnerability that allows manipulation of the reward signal.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Protect the code defining the reward function from unauthorized modification.
            *   Store reward function parameters in a secure, tamper-proof configuration.
            *   Thoroughly vet and sandbox environments to prevent vulnerabilities that could affect reward calculation.

    *   **2.3 Alter Agent's Actions [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker aims to directly control the actions taken by the trained agent, bypassing the intended learning process.
        * **Steps:**
            *   **2.3.1 Replace Trained Model with Malicious Model:** Requires write access to the stored model.
            *   **2.3.2 Modify Agent's Code:** Requires write access to the agent's codebase.
            *   **2.3.3 Exploit Environment Vulnerabilities to Override Agent's Actions:** Requires a vulnerability in the environment that allows the attacker to interfere with the agent's action selection.
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Use digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of trained models.
            *   Protect the agent's code from unauthorized modification.
            *   Deploy the agent in a secure environment with restricted access.
            *   Thoroughly vet and sandbox environments.
