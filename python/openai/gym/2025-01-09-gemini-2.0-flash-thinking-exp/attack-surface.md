# Attack Surface Analysis for openai/gym

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Environment Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_environment_files.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application loads and parses environment definition files (e.g., YAML, JSON, Python files) for custom Gym environments.

**How Gym Contributes:** Gym allows for the creation and loading of custom environments, often defined through configuration files or Python code. If the application allows users to specify or upload these files without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** A user uploads a YAML file for a custom environment that exploits a known vulnerability in the YAML parsing library, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, data exfiltration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Input Validation: Thoroughly validate the structure and content of environment configuration files before loading them. Use established schema validation libraries.
* Sandboxing: If possible, load and execute environment definition code in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
* Static Analysis: If the environment definition is code, perform static analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
* Restrict File Sources: Limit the sources from which environment files can be loaded. Avoid allowing arbitrary user-provided file paths.

## Attack Surface: [Importing Untrusted Custom Environments](./attack_surfaces/importing_untrusted_custom_environments.md)

**Description:**  Executing malicious code embedded within a custom Gym environment's Python code when the environment is imported or instantiated.

**How Gym Contributes:** Gym's design encourages the creation and sharing of custom environments. If the application dynamically imports environments based on user input or external sources without verifying their integrity, it's at risk.

**Example:** A user specifies an environment name that corresponds to a malicious custom environment hosted on a public repository. When the application imports this environment, the malicious code within its `__init__` method executes, compromising the application.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Code Review: If possible, manually review the code of custom environments before allowing their use.
* Sandboxing: Import and instantiate custom environments within a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
* Integrity Checks: Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of custom environment code (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).
* Whitelisting: Maintain a whitelist of trusted and verified environment sources or specific environment names.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Gym's Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_gym's_dependencies.md)

**Description:**  Leveraging known security vulnerabilities in the libraries that Gym depends on (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pillow).

**How Gym Contributes:** Gym relies on external libraries for its functionality. If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, and Gym utilizes the vulnerable functionality, the application becomes susceptible.

**Example:** A vulnerability exists in an older version of NumPy that Gym uses for numerical computations. An attacker crafts specific input to a Gym environment that triggers this vulnerable code path within NumPy, leading to a buffer overflow and potential code execution.

**Impact:**  Denial of service, arbitrary code execution, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regular Updates: Keep Gym and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
* Dependency Scanning: Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Gym's dependencies.
* Pin Dependencies: Use a dependency management system to pin specific versions of Gym and its dependencies to ensure consistent and secure versions are used.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Serialization/Deserialization of Environment State](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_serializationdeserialization_of_environment_state.md)

**Description:**  Manipulating serialized environment states (e.g., using pickle) to inject malicious code or alter the environment's state in an unintended way.

**How Gym Contributes:** Applications might serialize and deserialize Gym environment states for saving progress or transferring data. If insecure serialization methods are used, they can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts a serialized environment state (e.g., pickled object) and injects malicious code into it. When the application deserializes this modified state, the malicious code is executed.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, state manipulation leading to incorrect application behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid Insecure Serialization: Avoid using insecure serialization methods like `pickle` for untrusted data.
* Digital Signatures: If serialization is necessary, digitally sign the serialized data to ensure its integrity.
* Encryption: Encrypt serialized data to prevent unauthorized modification.
