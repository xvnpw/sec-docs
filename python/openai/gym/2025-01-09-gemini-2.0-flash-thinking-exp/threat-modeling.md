# Threat Model Analysis for openai/gym

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Injection](./threats/malicious_dependency_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency of the `gym` package (or the `gym` package itself on PyPI) and injects malicious code. When the application installs or updates its dependencies, this malicious code is included and executed within the application's environment. The attacker could gain arbitrary code execution, steal secrets, or manipulate application behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the application, data breaches, denial of service, and potential supply chain attacks affecting other users.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `gym` package and its dependencies as installed via `pip`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency pinning to lock down specific versions of `gym` and its dependencies in `requirements.txt` or similar files.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `safety` or `pip-audit`.
        *   Consider using a private PyPI mirror to control the source of packages.
        *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) practices.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Environment Parameters](./threats/code_injection_via_environment_parameters.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Injection via Environment Parameters
    *   **Description:** Some Gym environments allow customization through parameters passed during environment creation. If the application takes user input and directly uses it to configure a Gym environment without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious code within these parameters. This code could be executed within the environment's execution context, potentially affecting the application.
    *   **Impact:** High. Arbitrary code execution within the Gym environment, potentially leading to information disclosure or manipulation of the application's state related to the environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific environment constructors or methods that accept user-provided parameters (e.g., within `gym.make()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it to configure Gym environments.
        *   Avoid directly passing unsanitized user input to Gym environment creation functions.
        *   Use predefined configurations or a whitelist of allowed parameter values.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Complex Environments](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_complex_environments.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion through Complex Environments
    *   **Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger the creation of extremely complex or computationally expensive Gym environments. If the application doesn't have proper resource management, this could lead to excessive CPU or memory usage, causing denial of service or performance degradation.
    *   **Impact:** High. Denial of service, performance degradation, increased infrastructure costs.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `gym.make()` function and the specific environment implementation being instantiated.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory limits) for the processes running Gym environments.
        *   Implement rate limiting on environment creation requests.
        *   Monitor resource usage and alert on anomalies.
        *   Carefully choose and test Gym environments for their resource consumption.
