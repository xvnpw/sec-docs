## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application Using Gym **(CRITICAL NODE)**
*   Exploit Gym Environment Definition **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   Malicious Environment File **(HIGH-RISK PATH STARTS HERE)**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Inject Arbitrary Code via Environment File **(HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**
*   Exploit External Dependencies of Gym **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Compromise a Dependency Used by Gym **(HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**
*   Exploit User-Provided Environments (If Applicable) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   Upload/Use Malicious Custom Environment **(HIGH-RISK PATH STARTS HERE)**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Inject Arbitrary Code in Custom Environment **(HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Arbitrary Code via Environment File](./attack_tree_paths/inject_arbitrary_code_via_environment_file.md)

**High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Malicious Environment Files for Code Execution**

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject Arbitrary Code via Environment File
    *   **Details:** Attacker crafts a malicious environment file (e.g., Python code in `__init__` or `step` methods) that executes arbitrary code when the application loads or interacts with the environment.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise a Dependency Used by Gym](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_a_dependency_used_by_gym.md)

**High-Risk Path 2: Exploiting Vulnerable Dependencies**

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromise a Dependency Used by Gym
    *   **Details:** Gym relies on other Python packages (e.g., NumPy, SciPy). If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them indirectly through Gym. This is a supply chain attack.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Effort:** Varies
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Arbitrary Code in Custom Environment](./attack_tree_paths/inject_arbitrary_code_in_custom_environment.md)

**High-Risk Path 3: Exploiting Malicious Custom Environments for Code Execution**

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject Arbitrary Code in Custom Environment
    *   **Details:** If the application allows users to upload or define their own Gym environments, an attacker can inject malicious code into the environment's Python files.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
