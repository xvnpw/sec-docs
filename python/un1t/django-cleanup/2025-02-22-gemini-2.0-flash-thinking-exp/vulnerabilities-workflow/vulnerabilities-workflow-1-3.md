## Vulnerability List

### No High Severity Vulnerabilities Found

After a thorough review based on the specified criteria for external attackers and high severity, no vulnerabilities were identified in the django-cleanup project itself.

The original assessment remains valid: django-cleanup is designed to enhance file management within Django applications and incorporates security-conscious practices.  The project's logic revolves around reacting to Django's model lifecycle signals to manage associated files, and it does not introduce externally exploitable high-severity vulnerabilities within its own code.

It is crucial to reiterate that the absence of vulnerabilities *within django-cleanup itself* does not guarantee the security of applications *using* django-cleanup.  Developers must still ensure secure coding practices in their own applications to prevent vulnerabilities arising from incorrect usage of Django and its related libraries.

Therefore, based on the provided criteria and focusing solely on vulnerabilities within the django-cleanup project triggerable by external attackers at high severity, the assessment stands: no such vulnerabilities have been found.
