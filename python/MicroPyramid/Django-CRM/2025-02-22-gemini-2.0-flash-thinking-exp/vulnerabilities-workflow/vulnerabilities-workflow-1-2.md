Here is the updated list of vulnerabilities, filtered and formatted as requested:

---

1. **Hardcoded Sensitive Information in Repository**
   - **Description:**
     Sensitive information (like credentials or tokens) is hardcoded in the source code or configuration files. An external attacker who gains read–access (for example, via a repository leak) may use these credentials to access internal systems or services.
   - **Impact:**
     - Unauthorized access to databases, APIs, or other services.
     - Potential lateral movement within the network.
   - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
     - None identified.
   - **Missing Mitigations:**
     - Remove hardcoded credentials.
     - Use environment variables or secure credential management solutions.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The repository is accessible to an attacker or accidentally leaked.
   - **Source Code Analysis:**
     - Inspecting configuration files and source code reveals credentials and secret keys directly embedded into the code.
   - **Security Test Case:**
     - **Step 1:** Gain access to the public repository (or use a leaked copy).
     - **Step 2:** Search for keywords like “password”, “secret”, “API_KEY” in the files.
     - **Step 3:** Confirm that sensitive credentials are visible in the source code.

---

2. **Exposed Database with Default Credentials**
   - **Description:**
     The project’s database is configured with default or weak credentials. An attacker could try to connect directly to the database using these credentials, potentially gaining read–write access.
   - **Impact:**
     - Direct access to sensitive data.
     - Complete database manipulation including deletion or injection of records.
   - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
     - None identified.
   - **Missing Mitigations:**
     - Change database credentials to strong, unique passwords.
     - Restrict database access to trusted IP ranges.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The database is accessible over the network from an attacker–controlled endpoint.
   - **Source Code Analysis:**
     - Configuration files and connection strings are inspected, revealing use of default credentials.
   - **Security Test Case:**
     - **Step 1:** From an external network, attempt to connect to the database using the default credentials.
     - **Step 2:** Verify whether you obtain read or write access.
     - **Step 3:** Confirm that changing the credentials prevents the connection.

3. **Insecure Deployment Server (Use of Django Development Server in Production)**
   - **Description:**
     The application is deployed using Django’s development server rather than a production–grade WSGI server. An attacker could exploit its limitations, bypassing performance and security controls expected from production deployments.
   - **Impact:**
     - Reduced security hardening.
     - Increased exposure to attacks due to lack of production–level features such as robust error handling and connection timeouts.
   - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
     - None identified.
   - **Missing Mitigations:**
     - Deploy the application using a production–ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn or uWSGI) behind a secure web server.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The server is deployed using Django’s built–in development server.
   - **Source Code Analysis:**
     - Deployment scripts and server launch configurations indicate that manage.py runserver is used in a production environment.
   - **Security Test Case:**
     - **Step 1:** Check the banner and HTTP response headers from the application (which often reveal the use of the Django development server).
     - **Step 2:** Confirm that production traffic is served by a production-ready server after applying the fix.

4. **Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability in Opportunity and Event Endpoints**
   - **Description:**
     Specific endpoints for opportunities and events do not limit or validate the type, size, or naming of uploaded files. An attacker may upload a malicious file (such as a webshell or script) that, if executed, could compromise the server.
   - **Impact:**
     - Remote code execution if the file is executed.
     - Unauthorized access and control of the system.
   - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
     - No file validation or sanitization is applied on the server side.
   - **Missing Mitigations:**
     - Validate file types (both by MIME type and file extension).
     - Limit file size and sanitize filenames.
     - Store files in non–executable directories and apply antivirus scanning.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Endpoints accept file uploads and the storage (e.g. an S3 bucket) is misconfigured to serve files as executable.
   - **Source Code Analysis:**
     - Examination of code handling file uploads in endpoints (for example, those used for opportunities and events) shows that the file data from request.FILES is saved without further checks.
   - **Security Test Case:**
     - **Step 1:** Authenticate as a legitimate user (or use an endpoint that does not require strict role checks).
     - **Step 2:** Craft a file payload (for instance, a file named “shell.jpg.php”) containing known webshell code.
     - **Step 3:** Use the vulnerable endpoint (e.g., related to event creation) to upload the crafted file.
     - **Step 4:** Locate the file’s storage URL and attempt to access it directly.
     - **Step 5:** Verify whether the file is served in a way that allows its execution.

5. **Insecure Celery Broker Configuration**
   - **Description:**
     The Celery broker is configured insecurely, possibly using default settings or exposing ports accessible from outside the network. An external attacker may connect to the broker and send malicious tasks or intercept sensitive data.
   - **Impact:**
     - Remote code execution if malicious tasks are injected.
     - Unauthorized manipulation of background processing.
   - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
     - There is no indication that the Celery broker is restricted to internal network addresses.
   - **Missing Mitigations:**
     - Restrict broker connections to trusted hosts only.
     - Use proper authentication and network segmentation.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The broker is accessible on the network without adequate firewall or authentication controls.
   - **Source Code Analysis:**
     - Configuration files (or environment settings inferred from requirements) show that the Celery broker is not hardened against external connections.
   - **Security Test Case:**
     - **Step 1:** From an external machine, attempt to connect to the configured Celery broker port.
     - **Step 2:** Verify whether connection and task submission are possible.
     - **Step 3:** Confirm that tightening network rules prevents unauthorized access.

6. **Sensitive Debug Logging in API Endpoints and Supporting Modules**
   - **Description:**
     Debug-level logging is present in API endpoints and modules, potentially writing sensitive information (such as tokens, personal data, or stack traces) to log files that could be accessed by an attacker.
   - **Impact:**
     - Exposure of sensitive internal state and credentials.
     - Increased risk during forensic investigations or breach analysis.
   - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
     - Debug logging is not limited in production, and sensitive data is logged.
   - **Missing Mitigations:**
     - Lower the logging level in production.
     - Avoid logging sensitive data or ensure log files are properly secured.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The application is running in a production environment with excessive debug logging enabled.
   - **Source Code Analysis:**
     - Review of API endpoints and application modules reveals that log statements output detailed debug information.
   - **Security Test Case:**
     - **Step 1:** Trigger API endpoints under normal use.
     - **Step 2:** Inspect the log files and verify whether sensitive information is recorded.
     - **Step 3:** Confirm that after applying mitigation (reducing log verbosity and filtering sensitive data) such information no longer appears.

7. **Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability in File Attachment Endpoints (Updated)**
   - **Description:**
     Multiple endpoints across the application accept file uploads without proper validation. Originally documented examples covered endpoints related to accounts, tasks, invoices, and leads. Our review of this batch reveals that several additional modules also accept file uploads without proper checks—including file attachments for contacts (in the contacts views), email attachments (in the email compose and edit views), and case attachments (in the cases views). An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file (for example, a webshell or script file with a double extension) that is stored without type, size, or name sanitization. If the uploaded file is later served from a misconfigured (i.e. publicly accessible/executable) storage location (for example, an S3 bucket configured to serve files directly), the attacker may be able to execute the file and take control of the server.
   - **Impact:**
     - Uploaded malicious files may lead to remote code execution and full server compromise.
     - Attackers might use the stored files to bypass access controls and escalate privileges across the system.
   - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
     - There are no validations or sanitizations on file type, size, or filename in any of the endpoints accepting file uploads (accounts, tasks, invoices, leads, contacts, emails, or cases).
   - **Missing Mitigations:**
     - Validate file types using MIME type and extension checks.
     - Limit file sizes and sanitize file names.
     - Store uploaded files in non–executable locations (or on a bucket with proper access controls).
     - Consider antivirus scanning on uploaded files.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The application is deployed with endpoints that allow file uploads (across accounts, tasks, invoices, leads, contacts, emails, and cases).
     - The file storage (such as an S3 bucket) is configured to serve files directly without additional execution safeguards.
   - **Source Code Analysis:**
     - In several modules (for example, in `/code/invoices/forms.py`, `/code/contacts/views.py`, `/code/emails/views.py`, and `/code/cases/views.py`), file data is retrieved directly from `request.FILES` and immediately passed to model fields or attached to emails without any sanitation or content–based validation.
     - There is no evidence of checks on file type, file size, or file name formatting in any of these handlers.
   - **Security Test Case:**
     - **Step 1:** Authenticate as a user with permission to upload files (for instance, via the contact creation, email compose, or case creation endpoints).
     - **Step 2:** Craft a file payload (e.g. a file named `shell.jpg.php`) containing known webshell code or script payload.
     - **Step 3:** Use the vulnerable endpoint (such as the email compose view in `/code/emails/views.py` or the contact attachment upload in `/code/contacts/views.py`) to upload the crafted file.
     - **Step 4:** After upload, locate the file’s storage URL (especially if files are stored in a publicly accessible S3 bucket or similar).
     - **Step 5:** Attempt to access (and if possible execute) the uploaded file.
     - **Step 6:** Confirm that without proper validations (or after applying the fixes) the upload is accepted (or rejected) appropriately and that direct access to the file does (or does not) permit execution.

8. **Failure to Properly Remove Users from Team Associations Due to Improper ID Filtering in Team Removal Task**
   - **Description:**
     When removing users from team associations, improper filtering of IDs leads to incomplete removal. An external attacker who understands the internal ID scheme could potentially manipulate team data or maintain unauthorized associations.
   - **Impact:**
     - Persistent unauthorized access to team–restricted information.
     - Inaccurate team membership leading to privilege escalation.
   - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
     - No effective filtering mechanisms are implemented in the team removal task.
   - **Missing Mitigations:**
     - Implement strict ID filtering and proper validation on removal operations.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The team removal endpoint/task is triggered without proper validation of user IDs.
   - **Source Code Analysis:**
     - Code review of team removal logic shows that the filtering on user IDs is not strict enough, allowing for ambiguous ID selection.
   - **Security Test Case:**
     - **Step 1:** As an authorized user, trigger the team removal function with a crafted list of user IDs (including both valid and invalid ones).
     - **Step 2:** Verify that only the valid, requested users are removed and that no additional (unauthorized) users are affected.
     - **Step 3:** Confirm that after applying stricter filtering, the behavior is correct.

9. **Wildcard ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration Leading to Host Header Injection (New)**
   - **Description:**
     In the project’s settings (see `/code/crm/settings.py`), the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` parameter is set to `["*"]`. This configuration means the server will accept requests regardless of the Host header value. An attacker can manipulate the Host header in their HTTP requests which, if used in constructing absolute URLs (for example, in password-reset links or redirects), could lead to host header injection vulnerabilities. Such manipulation may result in phishing, bypass of some security checks, or abuse in browser-based security logic.
   - **Impact:**
     - May allow attackers to craft links that appear to come from the trusted domain while actually redirecting victims to malicious sites.
     - Could facilitate further attacks leveraging DNS rebinding or cache poisoning.
   - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
   - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
     - There are no additional checks—`ALLOWED_HOSTS` is defined as a wildcard, so no filtering is applied to incoming Host headers.
   - **Missing Mitigations:**
     - Restrict `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to an explicit list of valid, trusted domain names for the application.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - The application is deployed in an environment where clients directly supply the Host header (for example, in public web requests) and absolute URLs derive from the request header.
   - **Source Code Analysis:**
     - In `/code/crm/settings.py`, the line `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]` clearly shows that the application accepts requests for any host.
     - This misconfiguration leaves the door open for host header manipulation attacks.
   - **Security Test Case:**
     - **Step 1:** Using a tool such as cURL or Burp Suite, send an HTTP request to any endpoint of the application while manually setting the `Host` header to an arbitrary value (e.g. `malicious.com`).
     - **Step 2:** Examine any URL or link generated by the application (for example, in automated email notifications or redirects) to see if the manipulated Host header is reflected.
     - **Step 3:** Verify that with a proper `ALLOWED_HOSTS` restriction in place, the server rejects requests with untrusted host headers.

10. **Insecure CSRF Trusted Origins Configuration (New)**
    - **Description:**
      The CSRF protection settings in `/code/crm/settings.py` define `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` as `["https://*.runcode.io", "http://*"]`. The inclusion of the pattern `"http://*"` is overly permissive, effectively trusting any HTTP origin. This can undermine CSRF defense by allowing requests from virtually any origin to pass CSRF checks.
    - **Impact:**
      - An attacker could exploit this misconfiguration to perform cross–site request forgery (CSRF) attacks if they can trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious site that makes forged requests to the application.
      - This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the victim.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
      - Aside from the restriction for HTTPS origins (`https://*.runcode.io`), there is no effective limitation on HTTP origins due to the wildcard pattern `"http://*"`.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
      - Restrict `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` to a limited, explicitly defined list of trusted domains using HTTPS only.
    - **Preconditions:**
      - The application must be accessible over HTTP.
      - CSRF tokens and other standard CSRF protections may be bypassed if the origin check is effectively disabled by the wildcard.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
      - In `/code/crm/settings.py`, the configuration `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ["https://*.runcode.io", "http://*"]` shows that any HTTP origin will be trusted.
      - This misconfiguration effectively negates the protective purpose of CSRF origin checks.
    - **Security Test Case:**
      - **Step 1:** From an attacker-controlled website, craft an HTML form or JavaScript request that sends a state–changing POST request (for example, to update user settings) to a vulnerable endpoint of the CRM application.
      - **Step 2:** Ensure that the HTTP request is sent from an HTTP (not HTTPS) origin that would normally be untrusted.
      - **Step 3:** Observe whether the CRM application accepts the request despite the origin mismatch.
      - **Step 4:** With a tightened CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS configuration in place, repeat the test to verify that requests from unapproved origins are rejected.

11. **Improper Authorization on Planner Event Endpoints Leading to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) (New)**
    - **Description:**
      The planner functionality (covering endpoints for getting and deleting events such as meetings, tasks, and calls) accepts object identifiers (e.g. `meetingID`, `taskID`, `callID`) via POST parameters and performs operations (retrieval or deletion) without enforcing ownership or detailed permission checks. An external attacker who is already authenticated (or who can hijack a session) might manipulate these identifiers to access or remove events that do not belong to them.
    - **Impact:**
      - Unauthorized access to detailed event information.
      - Unauthorized deletion of events, leading to data loss or alteration of schedules.
    - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
    - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
      - Based on the test cases in `/code/planner/tests.py`, the endpoints process valid IDs but do not appear to enforce checks ensuring that the authenticated user is the owner or has rights to modify the given event.
    - **Missing Mitigations:**
      - Implement strict authorization checks on all event-related endpoints.
      - Verify that the requesting user is the creator/owner of the event or has sufficient privileges before allowing access or deletion.
    - **Preconditions:**
      - An endpoint (such as `/planner/meeting/delete/` or `/planner/get/meeting/`) is accessible via POST by an authenticated user.
      - The application does not verify resource ownership.
    - **Source Code Analysis:**
      - In the test cases (for example, in `test_delete_meeting_valid_ID` and `test_get_meeting_validID`), the deletion and retrieval of events rely solely on the ID provided in the POST data without evidence of ownership checks.
      - This indicates that if an attacker can obtain (or guess) the ID of an event that belongs to another user, they could potentially delete or view that event.
    - **Security Test Case:**
      - **Step 1:** Authenticate as a non–privileged user or create a limited–privilege account.
      - **Step 2:** Determine an event ID that is known to belong to another user (this may involve enumeration or intelligence gathering).
      - **Step 3:** Send a POST request to an endpoint such as `/planner/meeting/delete/` with the target event’s ID.
      - **Step 4:** Observe whether the endpoint processes the request successfully (e.g. returns a “Deleted” message) despite the fact that the event should not be accessible.
      - **Step 5:** After applying the proper authorization checks, verify that such a request is rejected.
