# Threat Model Analysis for openinterpreter/open-interpreter

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Prompt Injection](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_prompt_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Prompt Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious prompt that tricks the Large Language Model (LLM) into generating and executing arbitrary code on the server. This could involve instructing the LLM to perform system commands, execute scripts, or interact with the file system in unintended ways *through Open Interpreter's code execution capabilities*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, including data breaches, installation of malware, denial of service, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** `interpreter.chat()` function, the underlying LLM interaction *within Open Interpreter*, and the code execution environment *managed by Open Interpreter*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on user prompts before passing them to the interpreter.
        *   Run the Open Interpreter process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges and resource access.
        *   Carefully configure the LLM with safety settings and potentially use prompt engineering techniques to mitigate injection risks.
        *   Implement robust monitoring and logging of executed code and system commands.
        *   Consider using a "dry-run" mode or requiring explicit user confirmation before executing any code generated by the interpreter.

## Threat: [Unauthorized File System Read](./threats/unauthorized_file_system_read.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized File System Read
    *   **Description:** An attacker uses prompts to instruct the LLM to generate code *that Open Interpreter executes* to read sensitive files on the server's file system. This could include configuration files, database credentials, application code, or other confidential data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to further attacks, data breaches, or compromise of other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** File system interaction capabilities *provided by Open Interpreter's code execution environment*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the file system access permissions of the user or process running Open Interpreter.
        *   Implement file access controls and monitoring to detect unauthorized read attempts.
        *   Sanitize user prompts to prevent requests for reading specific sensitive file paths.
        *   Consider using a virtual file system or chroot environment to limit the accessible file paths.

## Threat: [Unauthorized File System Write/Modification/Deletion](./threats/unauthorized_file_system_writemodificationdeletion.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized File System Write/Modification/Deletion
    *   **Description:** An attacker uses prompts to instruct the LLM to generate code *that Open Interpreter executes* to write, modify, or delete files on the server's file system. This could lead to data corruption, application malfunction, or the introduction of malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, application instability, security breaches, and potential for persistent compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** File system interaction capabilities *provided by Open Interpreter's code execution environment*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the file system write/modify/delete permissions of the user or process running Open Interpreter.
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes.
        *   Sanitize user prompts to prevent requests for writing to or modifying critical file paths.
        *   Implement backups and version control for important files.

## Threat: [Abuse of System Commands](./threats/abuse_of_system_commands.md)

*   **Threat:** Abuse of System Commands
    *   **Description:** An attacker uses prompts to instruct the LLM to generate code *that Open Interpreter executes* to run arbitrary system commands. This bypasses normal application security controls and can lead to various malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, data manipulation, launching attacks, and other severe consequences.
    *   **Affected Component:** Code execution environment's ability *within Open Interpreter* to execute system commands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable or restrict the ability of the Open Interpreter process to execute system commands if not strictly necessary.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the execution of dangerous commands.
        *   Use a restricted shell or command execution environment.
