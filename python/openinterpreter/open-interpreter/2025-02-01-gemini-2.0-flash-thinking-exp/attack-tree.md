## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application System via Open Interpreter](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_system_via_open_interpreter.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Successful exploitation of Open Interpreter's functionalities or misconfigurations leads to compromising the application system.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-nodes):**
    *   Exploit Open Interpreter Functionality
    *   Exploit Misconfiguration or Insecure Setup

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Open Interpreter Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_open_interpreter_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target the core functionalities of Open Interpreter, specifically its interaction with the LLM and its code execution capabilities, to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-nodes):**
    *   Exploit LLM Interaction
    *   Exploit Code Execution Feature

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit LLM Interaction](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_llm_interaction.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the interaction with the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve malicious goals. This primarily focuses on Prompt Injection attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-nodes):**
    *   Prompt Injection to Execute Malicious Code
    *   Information Leakage via LLM Prompts (While Information Leakage is marked as Medium Impact, Prompt Injection for Code Execution is High Impact and thus included under this High-Risk Path)

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Prompt Injection to Execute Malicious Code](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__prompt_injection_to_execute_malicious_code.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers aim to inject malicious instructions into prompts provided to the LLM, causing it to generate and execute unintended code that compromises the system.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-nodes):**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Direct Prompt Injection:**
        *   **Attack:** Crafting prompts that directly instruct the LLM to execute malicious code.
        *   **Example:**  "Run this Python code: `import os; os.system('...')`"
        *   **Mitigation:** Robust input sanitization, prompt filtering, restrictive prompt design, Content Security Policies for prompts.
    *   **Indirect Prompt Injection:**
        *   **Attack:** Injecting malicious content into external data sources that the LLM accesses, leading to the LLM generating and executing malicious code based on this poisoned data.
        *   **Example:** Modifying a file that the LLM reads with malicious code disguised as data.
        *   **Mitigation:** Strict control and sanitization of all data sources accessed by the LLM, input validation for data sources, principle of least privilege for data access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Code Execution Feature](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_code_execution_feature.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers directly target the code execution capabilities of Open Interpreter, attempting to supply and execute malicious code.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-nodes):**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Supply Malicious Code for Execution:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Via LLM-Generated Code Manipulation:**
            *   **Attack:** Influencing the LLM through prompts or input data to generate malicious code as part of its intended output.
            *   **Example:** Crafting prompts that subtly guide the LLM to generate vulnerable or malicious code.
            *   **Mitigation:** Code review and analysis of LLM-generated code *before* execution, static analysis tools for generated code, runtime monitoring of executed code.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Via Direct Code Injection (if application allows):**
            *   **Attack:** Directly injecting malicious code into the application if it allows users to provide code input that is then executed by Open Interpreter.
            *   **Example:** Application feature: "Enter Python code to execute".
            *   **Mitigation:**  **Strongly discourage/remove this feature.** If unavoidable, implement extremely strict input validation, sandboxing, and code execution monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfiguration or Insecure Setup](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_misconfiguration_or_insecure_setup.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit common misconfigurations or insecure deployment practices to compromise the application.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-nodes):**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Overly Permissive Permissions:**
        *   **Attack:** Running Open Interpreter with excessive privileges (e.g., root, sudo), allowing broader system access if compromised.
        *   **Example:** Running Open Interpreter as root user.
        *   **Mitigation:** Run Open Interpreter with the minimum necessary privileges, use dedicated user accounts with restricted permissions, principle of least privilege.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure API Key Management (if applicable):**
        *   **Attack:** Insecure storage or exposure of API keys used by Open Interpreter or the application, leading to unauthorized access to services or further compromise.
        *   **Example:** Hardcoding API keys in application code, storing keys in plain text configuration files.
        *   **Mitigation:** Secure API key storage and management (environment variables, secrets management systems, encrypted configuration files), avoid hardcoding keys.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization in Application:**
        *   **Attack:** Application failing to properly validate and sanitize user input before passing it to Open Interpreter, enabling injection attacks (prompt injection, code injection).
        *   **Example:** Directly passing user-provided text to Open Interpreter without any checks.
        *   **Mitigation:** Robust input validation and sanitization on the application side for all data passed to Open Interpreter, use allow-lists and deny-lists for allowed commands and inputs.
