# Attack Surface Analysis for openinterpreter/open-interpreter

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** The ability for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where the application is running.
    *   **How Open-Interpreter Contributes:** `open-interpreter`'s core functionality is to execute code (primarily Python and shell commands) based on user input or AI-generated instructions. This inherently introduces the risk of executing malicious code.
    *   **Example:** A user inputs a prompt that leads `open-interpreter` to execute a shell command like `rm -rf /` or a Python script that installs malware.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data loss, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Carefully validate and sanitize all user inputs that could influence the code executed by `open-interpreter`.
        *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Execute `open-interpreter` in a highly restricted and isolated environment (e.g., using containers, virtual machines, or secure sandboxing libraries). Limit its access to system resources and network.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application and `open-interpreter` with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running with root or administrator privileges.
        *   **Code Review and Security Audits:** Regularly review the application's code and the integration with `open-interpreter` for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Functionality:** If possible, disable or restrict features of `open-interpreter` that are not essential for the application's functionality.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If the application has a web interface, implement a strict CSP to limit the execution of scripts and other resources.

## Attack Surface: [Prompt Injection](./attack_surfaces/prompt_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the input provided to the language model driving `open-interpreter` to make it perform unintended actions.
    *   **How Open-Interpreter Contributes:** If the application uses user input to construct prompts for `open-interpreter`, attackers can inject malicious instructions within these prompts.
    *   **Example:** A user enters a seemingly harmless request, but it's crafted to trick the AI into executing a command to read a sensitive file or make an unauthorized network request.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, execution of unintended commands, potential compromise of the system if the injected prompt leads to code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Prompt Construction:** Avoid directly embedding user input into prompts destined for `open-interpreter`. Use templating or parameterization techniques.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Filtering:** Sanitize user inputs to remove or neutralize potentially harmful commands or keywords before they reach the language model.
        *   **Contextual Awareness and Validation:** Implement logic to understand the context of the user's request and validate the AI's response before executing any actions.
        *   **Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection:** Monitor user input patterns for suspicious activity and implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
        *   **Human-in-the-Loop Validation:** For sensitive actions, require human approval before `open-interpreter` executes commands.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File System Access](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:** The ability for an attacker to read, write, or delete arbitrary files on the system.
    *   **How Open-Interpreter Contributes:** `open-interpreter` can execute code that interacts with the file system. If not properly controlled, this allows for unauthorized file access.
    *   **Example:** A malicious prompt or code executed by `open-interpreter` reads sensitive configuration files, overwrites important data, or creates backdoors.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, denial of service, and potential system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restricted File System Permissions:** Run the application and `open-interpreter` with limited file system permissions. Only grant access to necessary directories.
        *   **Input Validation for File Paths:** If user input is used to specify file paths, rigorously validate and sanitize these paths to prevent directory traversal attacks.
        *   **Chroot Jails or Containerization:** Use chroot jails or containerization to further restrict `open-interpreter`'s access to the file system.
        *   **File System Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect unauthorized file access or modifications.
