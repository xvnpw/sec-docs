### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Insecure File Upload Endpoints

**Attack Vector Name:** Insecure File Upload Vulnerabilities

**Why High-Risk:** Low Likelihood (if file uploads are handled carefully), Critical Impact. Insecure file uploads are considered high-risk because while implementing secure file uploads is achievable with proper security measures, the consequences of failing to do so can be catastrophic.  A seemingly minor oversight in file upload handling can open doors to severe security breaches. The "Critical Impact" stems from the potential for attackers to gain complete control over the server, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services.

**Exploitation Techniques (Deep Dive in DRF Context):**

*   **Unrestricted File Type Upload:**

    *   **Description:** This vulnerability occurs when the application does not properly validate the type of file being uploaded. Attackers can upload malicious files disguised as legitimate file types (e.g., renaming a `.exe` to `.jpg`). If the server processes or executes these files, it can lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.
    *   **DRF Context & Exploitation:**
        *   **Scenario:** A DRF API endpoint allows users to upload profile pictures. If the backend only checks the file extension (e.g., using `endswith('.jpg')`) and not the actual file content type, an attacker can upload a malicious script (e.g., a Python script with `.jpg` extension).
        *   **DRF Code Example (Vulnerable):**

            ```python
            from rest_framework import serializers, views
            from rest_framework.parsers import MultiPartParser, FormParser
            from rest_framework.response import Response

            class UploadSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
                file = serializers.FileField()

                def validate_file(self, value):
                    if not value.name.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png')): # Insecure extension check
                        raise serializers.ValidationError("Only JPG, JPEG, and PNG files are allowed.")
                    return value

            class UploadView(views.APIView):
                parser_classes = (MultiPartParser, FormParser)
                serializer_class = UploadSerializer

                def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                    serializer = self.serializer_class(data=request.data)
                    if serializer.is_valid():
                        uploaded_file = serializer.validated_data['file']
                        # Insecurely saving the file - potentially executable if web server serves this directory
                        with open(f'media/{uploaded_file.name}', 'wb+') as destination:
                            for chunk in uploaded_file.chunks():
                                destination.write(chunk)
                        return Response({"message": "File uploaded successfully!"})
                    else:
                        return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)
            ```
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            1.  Attacker crafts a malicious file (e.g., a Python script `malicious.jpg` containing Python code).
            2.  Attacker uploads `malicious.jpg` to the vulnerable endpoint.
            3.  If the web server is configured to execute files in the `media/` directory (highly discouraged but possible misconfiguration), or if the application later processes this file in a vulnerable way (e.g., executes it using `os.system` or similar), the malicious code will be executed on the server.

*   **Path Traversal:**

    *   **Description:** Path traversal (or directory traversal) allows attackers to access files and directories outside of the intended upload directory. This is achieved by manipulating the filename during the upload process, often using characters like `../` in the filename. Attackers can potentially overwrite critical system files, application code, or access sensitive data stored elsewhere on the server.
    *   **DRF Context & Exploitation:**
        *   **Scenario:** A DRF API endpoint allows users to upload files to a specific directory, but the application doesn't properly sanitize filenames.
        *   **DRF Code Example (Vulnerable):**

            ```python
            # ... (Previous serializer and view setup) ...

            class UploadView(views.APIView):
                # ... (parser_classes, serializer_class) ...

                def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                    serializer = self.serializer_class(data=request.data)
                    if serializer.is_valid():
                        uploaded_file = serializer.validated_data['file']
                        # Vulnerable - Directly using user-provided filename without sanitization
                        file_path = f'media/{uploaded_file.name}'
                        with open(file_path, 'wb+') as destination:
                            for chunk in uploaded_file.chunks():
                                destination.write(chunk)
                        return Response({"message": "File uploaded successfully!"})
                    else:
                        return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)
            ```
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            1.  Attacker crafts a filename containing path traversal sequences, e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`.
            2.  Attacker uploads a file with this malicious filename.
            3.  The vulnerable code directly uses this filename to construct the file path.
            4.  The file is written to `/etc/passwd` (or attempts to be, depending on permissions), potentially overwriting or corrupting system files.  Alternatively, if the goal is to read a file, the attacker might try to upload a file to a known location and then access it via the web server if directory listing is enabled or the path is guessable.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**

    *   **Description:** Attackers can exhaust server resources (disk space, processing power, bandwidth) by uploading extremely large files. This can lead to application slowdowns, crashes, or complete service unavailability for legitimate users.
    *   **DRF Context & Exploitation:**
        *   **Scenario:** A DRF API endpoint allows file uploads without any size limits.
        *   **DRF Code Example (Vulnerable - No Size Limits):**

            ```python
            # ... (Previous serializer and view setup - no size validation) ...

            class UploadSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
                file = serializers.FileField() # No size limit defined

            # ... (UploadView remains similar to previous examples) ...
            ```
        *   **Exploitation Steps:**
            1.  Attacker creates or obtains a very large file (e.g., several gigabytes).
            2.  Attacker repeatedly uploads this large file to the vulnerable endpoint.
            3.  The server's disk space fills up, or the server's resources are consumed processing and storing the large files, leading to DoS.

**Mitigation Strategies (DRF Focused):**

*   **File Type Validation:**

    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  **Content Type Checking (Crucial):**  Instead of relying solely on file extensions, use libraries like `python-magic` or `mimetypes` to verify the file's actual content type.
        2.  **Whitelist Allowed Types:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed MIME types and file extensions.
        3.  **DRF Serializer Validation:** Implement file type validation within the `validate_file` method of your DRF serializer.

    *   **DRF Code Example (Mitigation):**

        ```python
        import magic # pip install python-magic
        from rest_framework import serializers, views
        from rest_framework.parsers import MultiPartParser, FormParser
        from rest_framework.response import Response

        ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png']
        ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png']

        class SecureUploadSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
            file = serializers.FileField()

            def validate_file(self, value):
                # 1. Extension Check (as a quick initial check)
                if not any(value.name.lower().endswith(ext) for ext in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS):
                    raise serializers.ValidationError(f"Invalid file extension. Allowed extensions: {', '.join(ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS)}")

                # 2. Content Type Check (using python-magic - more robust)
                try:
                    mime_type = magic.from_buffer(value.read(1024), mime=True).decode('utf-8') # Read first 1024 bytes for mime detection
                    value.seek(0) # Reset file pointer after reading
                    if mime_type not in ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES:
                        raise serializers.ValidationError(f"Invalid file type. Allowed MIME types: {', '.join(ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES)}")
                except Exception as e: # Handle potential errors during mime detection
                    raise serializers.ValidationError("Could not determine file type.") from e

                return value

        class SecureUploadView(views.APIView):
            parser_classes = (MultiPartParser, FormParser)
            serializer_class = SecureUploadSerializer

            def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                serializer = self.serializer_class(data=request.data)
                if serializer.is_valid():
                    uploaded_file = serializer.validated_data['file']
                    # Securely saving the file (see other mitigations below for storage)
                    with open(f'media/secure_uploads/{uploaded_file.name}', 'wb+') as destination: # Save to a secure directory
                        for chunk in uploaded_file.chunks():
                            destination.write(chunk)
                    return Response({"message": "File uploaded securely!"})
                else:
                    return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)
        ```

*   **Filename Sanitization:**

    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  **Remove/Encode Dangerous Characters:** Sanitize filenames by removing or encoding characters like `../`, `\`, `:`, `;`, etc., which can be used for path traversal.
        2.  **Generate Unique Filenames:**  Consider generating unique, random filenames instead of relying on user-provided filenames. This eliminates path traversal risks and simplifies file management. Django's `uuid` library is useful for this.
        3.  **DRF View/Serializer:** Implement filename sanitization in your DRF view or serializer before saving the file.

    *   **DRF Code Example (Mitigation - Filename Sanitization):**

        ```python
        import os
        import uuid
        import re # Regular expressions for sanitization
        from rest_framework import serializers, views
        # ... (Other imports from previous example) ...

        def sanitize_filename(filename):
            """Sanitizes filename to prevent path traversal and other issues."""
            # Remove/replace potentially dangerous characters
            filename = re.sub(r'[^\w\._-]', '_', filename) # Allow alphanumeric, underscore, dot, hyphen
            filename = filename.lstrip('.') # Remove leading dots
            return filename

        class SecureUploadSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
            file = serializers.FileField()

            # ... (validate_file method from previous example) ...

        class SecureUploadView(views.APIView):
            # ... (parser_classes, serializer_class) ...

            def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                serializer = self.serializer_class(data=request.data)
                if serializer.is_valid():
                    uploaded_file = serializer.validated_data['file']
                    sanitized_filename = sanitize_filename(uploaded_file.name) # Sanitize filename
                    unique_filename = f"{uuid.uuid4()}_{sanitized_filename}" # Generate unique filename
                    file_path = f'media/secure_uploads/{unique_filename}' # Use unique, sanitized filename
                    with open(file_path, 'wb+') as destination:
                        for chunk in uploaded_file.chunks():
                            destination.write(chunk)
                    return Response({"message": "File uploaded securely!"})
                else:
                    return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)
        ```

*   **File Size Limits:**

    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  **Enforce Limits:**  Set maximum file size limits at both the application level (DRF serializer validation) and the web server level (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`).
        2.  **DRF Serializer Validation:** Use DRF's `FileField` validators or custom validation to enforce size limits.

    *   **DRF Code Example (Mitigation - File Size Limit):**

        ```python
        from rest_framework import serializers, views
        from rest_framework.parsers import MultiPartParser, FormParser
        from rest_framework.response import Response
        from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

        MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB = 5 # 5MB limit
        MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES = MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB * 1024 * 1024

        class SecureUploadSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
            file = serializers.FileField(max_length=MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES) # Enforce size limit in serializer

            def validate_file(self, value):
                if value.size > MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES:
                    raise ValidationError(f"File size exceeds the limit of {MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB}MB.")
                # ... (Other validations - file type, etc.) ...
                return value

        # ... (SecureUploadView remains similar to previous examples) ...
        ```

*   **Secure Storage:**

    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  **Outside Web Root:** Store uploaded files in a directory that is **outside** the web server's document root. This prevents direct access to uploaded files via web requests, mitigating potential execution of malicious files.
        2.  **Appropriate Permissions:** Set restrictive file system permissions on the upload directory to prevent unauthorized access or modification. Ensure the web server process has only the necessary permissions (e.g., write access for uploads, read access if files need to be served later through the application).
        3.  **Dedicated Storage Service (Cloud):** Consider using cloud storage services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage for storing uploaded files. These services often provide built-in security features and scalability. Django's `django-storages` library simplifies integration with these services.

    *   **DRF/Django Context:**
        *   Configure Django's `MEDIA_ROOT` setting to point to a directory outside the web root.
        *   Use Django's `FileField` and `ImageField` in models or serializers, which automatically handle file storage based on `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL`.
        *   For cloud storage, configure `django-storages` and update `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` in `settings.py`.

*   **Antivirus Scanning:**

    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  **Integrate Antivirus:** Integrate an antivirus scanning solution (e.g., ClamAV, commercial antivirus APIs) into your file upload process. Scan uploaded files before saving them to storage.
        2.  **Asynchronous Scanning:** Perform antivirus scanning asynchronously to avoid blocking the user request and maintain API responsiveness. Use task queues like Celery for background scanning.
        3.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for antivirus scanning failures. Decide how to handle files that fail the scan (e.g., reject the upload, quarantine the file).

    *   **DRF/Django Context:**
        *   Use libraries like `python-clamd` to interact with ClamAV.
        *   Create a DRF serializer validation function or a Django signal handler that triggers antivirus scanning after a file is uploaded.
        *   Use Celery tasks to offload the scanning process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of insecure file upload vulnerabilities can have severe consequences:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If unrestricted file type upload is exploited, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service. **Critical Impact (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).**
*   **File System Access & Data Breach:** Path traversal allows attackers to read sensitive files, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, application code, and user data. **High Impact (Confidentiality, Integrity).**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading large files can exhaust server resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. **Medium to High Impact (Availability).**
*   **Website Defacement:** In some scenarios, attackers might be able to overwrite website files, leading to website defacement. **Medium Impact (Integrity, Availability).**

**Conclusion:**

Insecure file upload endpoints represent a significant security risk in DRF applications. By understanding the common vulnerabilities (Unrestricted File Type Upload, Path Traversal, DoS) and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies (File Type Validation, Filename Sanitization, File Size Limits, Secure Storage, Antivirus Scanning), development teams can significantly strengthen the security posture of their APIs and protect against potentially devastating attacks.  It is crucial to prioritize secure file upload handling as a core security requirement during the development lifecycle of DRF applications.
