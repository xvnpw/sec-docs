# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities:
    - Provide a flexible and powerful toolkit for building Web APIs with Django.
    - Enable rapid development of RESTful APIs.
    - Maintain a high-quality, well-documented, and actively supported framework.
    - Foster a strong community around the framework.
- Business goals:
    - Be the leading choice for building REST APIs in the Django ecosystem.
    - Expand adoption of Django REST framework across diverse industries and project types.
    - Continuously improve the framework based on community feedback and evolving web development standards.
- Business risks:
    - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to data breaches in applications built with it, damaging the framework's reputation and user trust.
    - Performance bottlenecks or scalability issues could limit the framework's applicability for high-traffic APIs.
    - Lack of compatibility with future Django versions or other key technologies could fragment the community and reduce adoption.
    - Insufficient documentation or a steep learning curve could deter new users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
    - security control: Leverages Django's built-in security features, including protection against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection. Implemented within the Django framework itself.
    - security control: Encourages secure coding practices through documentation and examples, promoting input validation, proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Described in Django REST framework documentation and best practices guides.
    - security control: Relies on community contributions and code reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented through GitHub's pull request and issue tracking system.
    - security control: Uses HTTPS for secure communication as a general web security best practice, although this is deployment specific and not enforced by the framework itself. Described in general web security best practices.
- Accepted risks:
    - accepted risk: As an open-source project, the framework's security relies on community vigilance and timely reporting of vulnerabilities. There might be a delay between vulnerability discovery and patch availability.
    - accepted risk: Security of applications built with Django REST framework ultimately depends on the developers' secure coding practices and proper configuration of the framework and underlying infrastructure. The framework cannot prevent all security issues arising from improper usage.
- Recommended security controls:
    - security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) in the development and CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
    - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing by security experts to identify and address weaknesses in the framework.
    - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and incident response process to handle security issues efficiently.
    - security control: Provide security-focused documentation and training for developers using Django REST framework, emphasizing secure API development best practices.
    - security control: Implement dependency scanning to ensure that third-party libraries used by the framework are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.
- Security requirements:
    - Authentication:
        - Requirement: Support various authentication schemes (e.g., Token authentication, OAuth 2.0, JWT) to securely identify API clients.
        - Requirement: Provide mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints (e.g., rate limiting, account lockout).
    - Authorization:
        - Requirement: Offer flexible and granular permission control mechanisms to manage access to API endpoints and resources based on user roles or permissions.
        - Requirement: Ensure that authorization checks are consistently enforced across all API endpoints.
    - Input validation:
        - Requirement: Mandate robust input validation for all API requests to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS).
        - Requirement: Provide tools and guidance for developers to easily implement input validation and sanitization.
    - Cryptography:
        - Requirement: Encourage and facilitate the use of HTTPS for all API communication to protect data in transit.
        - Requirement: Provide guidance on securely storing sensitive data at rest, recommending encryption where appropriate.
        - Requirement: Ensure that cryptographic operations within the framework (if any) are implemented using secure and up-to-date algorithms and libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process: Providing a secure, reliable, and efficient framework for building Web APIs. The framework's integrity is crucial for the security and functionality of applications built upon it.
- Data we are trying to protect:
    - Source code of the Django REST Framework: Confidentiality and integrity of the source code are important to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
    - Framework artifacts (e.g., distribution packages, container images): Integrity of build artifacts is crucial to ensure users are using genuine and untampered versions of the framework.
    - User data in applications built with Django REST Framework: While the framework itself doesn't directly handle user data, applications built with it often do. The sensitivity of this data varies depending on the application (e.g., personal information, financial data, authentication credentials). The framework should facilitate secure handling of such data by application developers.
- Data sensitivity:
    - Source code: Confidential and sensitive. Public exposure could lead to vulnerability exploitation.
    - Framework artifacts: Integrity is critical. Tampering could lead to supply chain attacks.
    - User data in applications: Sensitivity depends on the application. Could range from low sensitivity (public data) to high sensitivity (personal health information, financial data).
