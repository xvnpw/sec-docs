# Attack Surface Analysis for encode/django-rest-framework

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Serializers](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_serializers.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can modify fields that should be read-only or internal by manipulating request data, leading to data corruption or privilege escalation.
*   **DRF Contribution:** DRF serializers, especially with broad field definitions (`fields = '__all__'`) or insufficient explicit field control, can expose more fields than intended for modification during updates or creations.
*   **Example:** A user can modify the `is_staff` field of their user profile through an API endpoint if the serializer unintentionally includes it, granting themselves administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, unauthorized modification of sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly define serializer fields using `fields` or `exclude`. Avoid `fields = '__all__'`.
    *   Utilize `read_only_fields` to prevent modification of specific fields via API requests.
    *   Implement custom validation within serializers to enforce business logic and data integrity.
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege, exposing only necessary fields for modification.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Serializers](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_custom_serializers.md)

*   **Description:** Unsafe handling of input data within custom serializers can lead to injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command injection) or code execution.
*   **DRF Contribution:** DRF encourages custom serializers for complex data transformations, increasing the potential for developers to introduce vulnerabilities if input data is not properly sanitized and validated within these custom serializers.
*   **Example:** A custom serializer parses JSON and directly uses user-provided data in a raw SQL query without escaping, leading to SQL injection when a malicious JSON payload is submitted.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, server compromise, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs within custom serializers before using them in database queries, system commands, or other sensitive operations.
    *   Prefer using Django's ORM and queryset methods for database interactions to leverage built-in SQL injection protection. Avoid raw SQL queries where possible.
    *   If using external deserialization libraries, ensure they are up-to-date and known to be secure.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database access, limiting the application user's permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Authentication Schemes in Production](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_authentication_schemes_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Using default DRF authentication schemes like `BasicAuthentication` or `SessionAuthentication` over unencrypted HTTP connections exposes credentials and session information.
*   **DRF Contribution:** DRF provides these schemes out-of-the-box, which are convenient for development but can be insecure if used directly in production without proper HTTPS configuration.
*   **Example:** Using `BasicAuthentication` over HTTP transmits username and password in base64 encoding, easily intercepted by network sniffers.
*   **Impact:** Credential theft, session hijacking, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS in production to encrypt all communication and protect credentials and session data in transit.
    *   Choose secure authentication schemes for production, such as Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) or OAuth 2.0, especially for public APIs.
    *   Configure secure session settings (e.g., `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`) to mitigate session hijacking risks.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured or Weak Permission Classes](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_or_weak_permission_classes.md)

*   **Description:** Overly permissive permission classes or logic flaws in custom permission classes can grant unauthorized access to API endpoints and sensitive data.
*   **DRF Contribution:** DRF's permission system relies on developers to choose and configure appropriate permission classes. Misconfiguration or poorly implemented custom permissions directly weaken access control.
*   **Example:** Using `AllowAny` on an endpoint that should only be accessible to authenticated administrators grants public access to sensitive administrative functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, privilege escalation, data breaches, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring permissions, granting only necessary access based on user roles and authentication status.
    *   Utilize appropriate built-in DRF permission classes (e.g., `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, `DjangoModelPermissions`) that match the required access control level.
    *   Thoroughly test custom permission classes to ensure they enforce intended access control logic without bypasses.
    *   Conduct regular security audits to review and rectify permission configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Filtering Implementation](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_filtering_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** Directly using user-provided filter parameters in database queries without sanitization can lead to SQL injection.
*   **DRF Contribution:** DRF's filtering system, while powerful, requires careful implementation to avoid vulnerabilities when handling user-provided filter parameters.
*   **Example:** Using `filter(field__startswith=request.query_params['search'])` directly without sanitization can lead to SQL injection if a malicious value is provided in the `search` query parameter.
*   **Impact:** SQL injection, data breach, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize DRF's built-in filtering backends and filter fields, which often provide safer ways to handle filtering and can help prevent SQL injection.
    *   Validate and sanitize all user-provided filter parameters before using them in database queries. Use Django's ORM methods and avoid raw SQL.
    *   Parameterize queries when constructing dynamic queries to prevent SQL injection.
