## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement JWT Authentication using DRF's `JWTAuthentication`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_jwt_authentication_using_drf's__jwtauthentication_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Install the `djangorestframework-simplejwt` package, which is commonly used with DRF for JWT authentication: `pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt`.
    2.  Configure DRF to use `JWTAuthentication` as a default authentication class in your `settings.py` file within the `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings:
        ```python
        REST_FRAMEWORK = {
            'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
                'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
            )
        }
        ```
    3.  Protect your API views or viewsets by utilizing DRF's `permission_classes` attribute and setting it to `[IsAuthenticated]` or other appropriate permission classes to enforce authentication.
    4.  Set up token retrieval and refresh endpoints using views provided by `rest_framework_simplejwt.views` (e.g., `TokenObtainPairView`, `TokenRefreshView`) and include them in your `urls.py` to allow clients to obtain and refresh JWT tokens.
    5.  Ensure the `SECRET_KEY` used by DRF and `djangorestframework-simplejwt` is securely managed and consider periodic rotation for enhanced security.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity): Prevents access to DRF API endpoints by clients that do not possess valid JWTs, thus mitigating unauthorized access.
    *   Session Hijacking (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of session hijacking compared to traditional session-based authentication, as JWTs are stateless and typically have shorter lifespans, a benefit when using DRF for APIs.
    *   Brute-force attacks on credentials (Medium Severity): While JWT itself doesn't directly prevent brute-force, using DRF's authentication framework encourages stronger password policies and reduces reliance on easily guessable session identifiers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High risk reduction.
    *   Session Hijacking: Medium risk reduction.
    *   Brute-force attacks on credentials: Medium risk reduction (indirect).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `JWTAuthentication` is configured as the default authentication class in `settings.py` within the `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings.
    *   DRF's `IsAuthenticated` permission class is applied in `ProductViewSet` and `CategoryViewSet` in `products/views.py`.
    *   Token obtain and refresh endpoints from `rest_framework_simplejwt` are included in `api/urls.py`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   DRF's `IsAuthenticated` permission class is not consistently applied across all sensitive DRF viewsets, specifically missing in `UserViewSet` and `OrderViewSet` in `users/views.py` and `orders/views.py`.
    *   Token refresh mechanism, while implemented using DRF and `rest_framework_simplejwt`, lacks thorough testing for edge cases and potential race conditions within the DRF API context.
    *   JWT `SECRET_KEY` rotation strategy, relevant to DRF's security configuration, is not yet defined and implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Granular Permissions using DRF Permission Classes](./mitigation_strategies/implement_granular_permissions_using_drf_permission_classes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Leverage DRF's built-in permission classes such as `IsAdminUser`, `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`, and `AllowAny` within your DRF views and viewsets.
    2.  Create custom permission classes by inheriting from DRF's `BasePermission` class to enforce specific access control rules tailored to your application's logic within DRF views.
    3.  Apply these permission classes to your DRF views or viewsets using the `permission_classes` attribute to control access based on user roles and actions within the API.
    4.  Implement the `has_permission` and `has_object_permission` methods within your custom DRF permission classes to define detailed authorization logic, ensuring fine-grained control over API access.
    5.  Thoroughly test the permission logic within your DRF API to guarantee correct access control for different user roles and scenarios interacting with your API endpoints.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity): Prevents users from accessing DRF API resources or performing actions they are not authorized for, a core security concern in API design.
    *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity): Prevents users from gaining access to higher privilege levels or resources within the DRF API that they should not have access to.
    *   Data Breach (High Severity): Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting access to sensitive data exposed through the DRF API based on roles and permissions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High risk reduction.
    *   Privilege Escalation: High risk reduction.
    *   Data Breach: High risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   DRF's `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` permission class is used for `BlogViewSet` in `blog/views.py` to allow read access to unauthenticated users but require authentication for write operations through the DRF API.
    *   DRF's `IsAdminUser` permission class is used for admin-only endpoints in `admin/views.py`.
    *   A custom DRF permission class `IsOrderOwner` is implemented in `orders/permissions.py` and used in `OrderDetailView` in `orders/views.py` to restrict order access to the order owner within the DRF API.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular DRF permissions are needed for `UserViewSet` to differentiate between user self-management and admin user management within the API.
    *   Custom DRF permission classes are not implemented for complex business logic scenarios in inventory management and reporting modules exposed through the API.
    *   Comprehensive testing of all DRF permission logic across different user roles and API endpoints is lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Define Serializer Fields and Validation in DRF Serializers](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_define_serializer_fields_and_validation_in_drf_serializers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within each DRF serializer, explicitly define the `fields` attribute to list only the fields that should be serialized and deserialized by the API. Avoid using `fields = '__all__'` in production DRF serializers.
    2.  Utilize DRF serializer attributes `read_only_fields` and `write_only_fields` to clearly define field access restrictions within your API data handling.
    3.  Implement robust validation within DRF serializers using DRF's built-in validators (e.g., `validators.MaxLengthValidator`, `validators.RegexValidator`) and custom validators.
    4.  Validate data types, formats, lengths, and business logic constraints for all input fields processed by DRF serializers.
    5.  Sanitize input data within DRF serializers to prevent injection attacks (e.g., HTML escaping, SQL injection prevention) when handling data in the API.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerability (High Severity): Prevents attackers from modifying unintended model fields by sending extra data in API requests processed by DRF serializers.
    *   Data Exposure (Medium Severity): Reduces accidental exposure of sensitive data by controlling which fields are serialized in API responses generated by DRF serializers.
    *   Injection Attacks (High Severity): Prevents injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.) by validating and sanitizing input data processed by DRF serializers.
    *   Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity): Ensures data consistency and validity by enforcing data type and format constraints within DRF serializers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerability: High risk reduction.
    *   Data Exposure: Medium risk reduction.
    *   Injection Attacks: High risk reduction.
    *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   DRF serializers in `products/serializers.py` and `categories/serializers.py` explicitly define `fields` and use `read_only_fields` for `id` and timestamps.
    *   Basic validators like `MaxLengthValidator` are used for `name` fields in DRF serializers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `fields = '__all__'` is still used in some DRF serializers in less critical modules like `notifications/serializers.py`.
    *   Comprehensive validation is missing for complex fields like email, URL, and phone numbers across all DRF serializers.
    *   Custom validators for business logic constraints are not implemented in DRF serializers for order placement and user registration.
    *   Input sanitization is not consistently applied in all DRF serializers, especially for text-based fields that might be rendered in HTML.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting and Throttling using DRF Throttling Classes](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_and_throttling_using_drf_throttling_classes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure default throttling classes in DRF settings in `settings.py` within the `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings using `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES` and `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES`. Consider using DRF's `AnonRateThrottle` and `UserRateThrottle`.
    2.  Customize throttle rates based on API endpoint sensitivity and expected usage patterns within the DRF `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings.
    3.  Apply throttling at the view or viewset level using DRF's `throttle_classes` attribute to override default settings for specific API endpoints requiring different rate limits.
    4.  Implement custom throttling classes by inheriting from DRF's `BaseThrottle` if needed for more complex rate limiting logic within your API.
    5.  Monitor API request rates and adjust DRF throttling settings as needed to balance security and usability of your API.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-force Attacks (High Severity): Limits the number of login attempts or other sensitive actions within a timeframe, making brute-force attacks against the DRF API less effective.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity): Prevents attackers from overwhelming the API server with excessive requests to DRF endpoints.
    *   API Abuse (Medium Severity): Limits excessive API usage by legitimate users or automated scripts, preventing resource exhaustion and ensuring fair usage of the DRF API.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-force Attacks: High risk reduction.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: High risk reduction.
    *   API Abuse: Medium risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   DRF's `AnonRateThrottle` and `UserRateThrottle` are set as default throttle classes in `settings.py` within the `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings with default rates.
    *   Throttling is applied globally to all DRF API endpoints.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Custom throttle rates are not configured for specific sensitive DRF endpoints like login, registration, and password reset.
    *   View-level throttling using DRF's `throttle_classes` is not implemented to fine-tune rate limits for different API functionalities.
    *   Custom DRF throttling classes are not implemented to address specific abuse scenarios or to provide different rate limits for different user tiers accessing the API.
    *   Monitoring and alerting system for API request rates and DRF throttling events is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict API Schema Access in Production using DRF Schema Generation Features](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_api_schema_access_in_production_using_drf_schema_generation_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  In your main `urls.py`, conditionally include DRF schema generation URLs (e.g., using `SchemaView` from `drf_yasg` or `coreapi.Document` integrated with DRF) only when `DEBUG` is True or under specific feature flags.
    2.  If schema access is required in production for documentation purposes, protect the schema endpoint with DRF authentication and authorization to restrict access to authorized users (e.g., administrators or developers).
    3.  Consider using environment variables or configuration settings to control DRF schema exposure in different environments.
    4.  Regularly review the generated DRF schema to ensure it does not inadvertently expose sensitive information or internal implementation details of your API.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Low Severity): Prevents attackers from easily discovering DRF API endpoints, parameters, and data structures by restricting schema access, making reconnaissance slightly harder.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Low risk reduction.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   API schema generation using `drf_yasg` is configured and accessible at `/swagger/` URL, integrated with DRF.
    *   Schema URLs are included unconditionally in `urls.py`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Schema URLs are not conditionally included based on `DEBUG` setting or environment variables, specifically for DRF schema endpoints.
    *   Schema endpoint is not protected with DRF authentication or authorization in production environments.
    *   Review of the generated DRF schema for sensitive information exposure is not performed regularly.
