## High and Critical DRF Threats

Here's the updated threat list containing only high and critical threats that directly involve Django REST Framework:

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected DRF Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mass Assignment Vulnerability (Over-posting)** | An attacker sends extra, unexpected fields in a request (e.g., POST, PUT, PATCH) that are not explicitly defined in the serializer. DRF might inadvertently process and save these extra fields, potentially modifying unintended data or bypassing intended restrictions. | Unauthorized modification of data, potential privilege escalation if attacker can modify sensitive fields. | Serializers (specifically the `save()` method and field handling) | High | Explicitly define all allowed fields in serializers using `fields` or `exclude`. Use `read_only_fields` and `write_only_fields` appropriately. Consider using `extra_kwargs` to set `read_only` or `write_only` on specific fields. |
| **Insecure Deserialization in Custom Serializer Fields** | An attacker provides malicious data that, when deserialized by a custom serializer field (e.g., using `pickle.loads()` or similar), leads to arbitrary code execution or other security issues on the server. | Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach. | Serializers (custom field implementations) | Critical | Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly. If necessary, use secure deserialization methods and thoroughly sanitize input before deserialization. Consider using safer alternatives to pickle. |
| **Insecure Default Permissions** | An attacker accesses API endpoints without proper authorization because the default permission classes (e.g., `AllowAny`) are too permissive for the intended use case in production. | Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential data breach or manipulation. | Permissions (default permission classes applied to views/viewsets) | High | Explicitly define and enforce appropriate permission classes for each view or viewset. Use more restrictive defaults like `IsAuthenticated` or custom permission classes. |
| **Bypassable Custom Permissions** | An attacker circumvents custom permission logic due to flaws in its implementation (e.g., missing checks, incorrect logic). | Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential data breach or manipulation. | Permissions (custom permission class implementations) | High | Thoroughly test and review custom permission logic. Ensure all necessary checks are in place and the logic is sound. Consider using unit tests to verify permission behavior. |
| **Authentication Scheme Weaknesses** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the chosen authentication scheme (e.g., weak password hashing, lack of rate limiting on login attempts) to gain unauthorized access. | Account compromise, unauthorized access to data and functionality. | Authentication (authentication backends configured in DRF) | Critical | Use strong and secure authentication schemes like OAuth 2.0 or JWT. Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication where appropriate. Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts. |
| **Session Fixation/Hijacking (with Session Authentication)** | An attacker manipulates or steals a user's session ID, gaining unauthorized access to their account. This can occur if session cookies are not properly secured or if the application is vulnerable to session fixation attacks. | Account takeover, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user. | Authentication (Session Authentication backend) | High | Ensure proper session management practices are in place, including secure session cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite). Regenerate session IDs upon login and privilege escalation. |
| **Logic Flaws in Custom View Actions** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in custom actions defined within viewsets or views due to insecure coding practices or insufficient validation. | Varies depending on the action's functionality, potentially leading to data corruption, unauthorized operations, or denial of service. | ViewSets/Views (custom action implementations) | High to Critical (depending on the flaw) | Apply secure coding practices when implementing custom actions. Thoroughly test and review the logic. Implement proper input validation and authorization checks within the action. |
| **Data Exfiltration through Insecure Filtering** | An attacker crafts malicious filter queries (e.g., using query parameters) to retrieve more data than they are authorized to access. This can happen if filtering logic is not properly secured or validated. | Unauthorized data access, potential data breach. | Filters (DRF's built-in filters or custom filter backends) | High | Implement secure filtering mechanisms. Validate filter parameters and ensure users only have access to the data they are authorized to see. Avoid exposing internal database structures through filter parameters. |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Custom Renderers** | An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is rendered by a custom DRF renderer (e.g., a custom HTML renderer) without proper output encoding, leading to XSS attacks on users viewing the API response in a browser. | Client-side code execution, session hijacking, data theft. | Renderers (custom renderer implementations) | High | Ensure proper output encoding and sanitization in custom renderers. Use template engines that automatically escape output by default. |
