# Threat Model Analysis for encode/django-rest-framework

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send extra, unexpected fields in a request payload. If the serializer doesn't explicitly define allowed fields, DRF might automatically map these fields to model attributes, potentially modifying sensitive data or internal state that the attacker shouldn't have access to.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data, potentially leading to data corruption, privilege escalation, or other unintended consequences.
*   **Affected Component:** `serializers` module, specifically the automatic field mapping during deserialization.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly define serializer fields using the `fields` or `exclude` attributes in the `Meta` class of the serializer.
    *   Use `SerializerMethodField` or other read-only fields for attributes that should not be directly modifiable through the API.
    *   Carefully review serializer definitions to ensure only intended fields are writable.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to Code Execution](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** If DRF is used to deserialize data from external sources without proper validation (e.g., using `pickle` or other unsafe deserialization methods directly or indirectly through custom serializers), an attacker could craft malicious data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
*   **Affected Component:** `serializers` module, particularly when using custom fields or libraries that perform deserialization of complex data structures.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources using unsafe methods like `pickle`.
    *   Use secure data formats like JSON or XML and rely on DRF's built-in deserialization capabilities.
    *   If custom deserialization is necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Serialization](./threats/information_disclosure_through_serialization.md)

*   **Description:** Serializers might inadvertently include sensitive data in API responses that should not be exposed to the client. This can happen if fields are not explicitly excluded or if custom serialization logic within DRF is flawed. An attacker could then access this sensitive information by simply making a valid API request.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to privacy breaches, identity theft, or other security violations.
*   **Affected Component:** `serializers` module, specifically the field selection and custom serialization logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review serializer definitions and explicitly exclude sensitive fields using the `exclude` attribute or by not including them in the `fields` attribute.
    *   Use `SerializerMethodField` with appropriate logic to control the output of sensitive data based on user permissions or other criteria.
    *   Regularly audit API responses to ensure no unintended data is being exposed.

## Threat: [API Endpoint Accessible Without Proper Authentication](./threats/api_endpoint_accessible_without_proper_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Due to misconfiguration or lack of proper authentication class assignment in DRF views, API endpoints intended to be protected might be accessible to unauthenticated users. An attacker could then access or manipulate resources without providing valid credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** `views` module, specifically the `permission_classes` attribute.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always explicitly define appropriate authentication classes in the `permission_classes` attribute of DRF views.
    *   Use global authentication settings in `settings.py` for default protection, but ensure view-specific overrides are intentional and secure.
    *   Regularly review API endpoint configurations and authentication settings.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Misconfigured Permissions](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_misconfigured_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** Even with authentication in place, incorrect configuration or implementation of permission classes in DRF views can lead to authorization bypass. An attacker with valid credentials but insufficient privileges could gain access to resources or perform actions they are not authorized for.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** `views` module, specifically the `permission_classes` attribute and custom permission classes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and implement permission classes that accurately reflect the application's authorization requirements.
    *   Thoroughly test permission logic to ensure it behaves as expected for different user roles and scenarios.
    *   Avoid overly permissive default permissions.
    *   Consider using object-level permissions for fine-grained access control.
