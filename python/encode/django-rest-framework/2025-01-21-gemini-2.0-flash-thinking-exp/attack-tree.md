## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serializer Vulnerabilities leading to Data Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serializer_vulnerabilities_leading_to_data_injection.md)

**Data Injection via Serializer [CRITICAL]:** DRF serializers are responsible for validating and deserializing incoming data. Weaknesses here can allow attackers to inject malicious data.
    * **Exploit Lack of Input Validation:** If serializers don't properly validate input types, lengths, or formats, attackers can send unexpected data that might cause errors, bypass logic, or even lead to code execution in downstream processes.
    * **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** If custom deserialization logic or external libraries are used within serializers, vulnerabilities like insecure deserialization could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit View Logic by Bypassing Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_view_logic_by_bypassing_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Bypass Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL]:** DRF provides mechanisms for authentication and authorization. Weaknesses here allow unauthorized access.
    * **Exploit Weak Authentication Schemes [CRITICAL]:** If basic authentication is used without HTTPS or with easily guessable credentials, it's vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Vulnerabilities in custom authentication backends can also be exploited.
        * **Brute-force Weak Credentials (if basic auth is used poorly):** Attackers attempt to guess usernames and passwords through repeated login attempts.
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Authentication Backends [CRITICAL]:**  Bugs or flaws in the logic of custom authentication implementations can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.
    * **Exploit Insecure Permission Configuration [CRITICAL]:** Incorrectly configured permissions can allow users to access resources they shouldn't. This includes default permissions being too permissive or vulnerabilities in custom permission classes.
        * **Access Resources Without Proper Permissions:** Attackers can access API endpoints or data that should be restricted to authorized users.
        * **Manipulate Permissions via API (if exposed and vulnerable) [CRITICAL]:** If the API itself allows modification of permissions and is vulnerable, attackers could grant themselves elevated privileges.
    * **Exploit JWT Vulnerabilities (if used) [CRITICAL]:** If JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication, vulnerabilities like weak signing algorithms, lack of signature verification, or allowing "none" algorithm can be exploited to forge tokens.
        * **Token Forgery:** Attackers create valid-looking JWTs without having the correct credentials.
        * **Signature Bypass:** Attackers manipulate the JWT signature to bypass verification.
        * **Replay Attacks:** Attackers reuse previously valid JWTs to gain unauthorized access.
