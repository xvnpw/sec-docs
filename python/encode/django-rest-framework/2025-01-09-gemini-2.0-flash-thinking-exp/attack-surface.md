# Attack Surface Analysis for encode/django-rest-framework

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers can modify unintended model fields by including them in API requests, potentially altering sensitive data or granting unauthorized privileges.

**How Django REST Framework Contributes:** DRF's `ModelSerializer` automatically maps request data to model fields. If not carefully configured, it can expose fields that should not be writable.

**Example:** A user sends a `PATCH` request to `/api/users/1/` with the payload `{"is_staff": true}`, and the `UserSerializer` doesn't explicitly restrict writable fields.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Explicitly define `fields` or `exclude` attributes in serializers to control which fields are writable.
- Use `read_only_fields` to mark fields that should not be modified through the API.
- Review serializer configurations carefully, especially when using `ModelSerializer`.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Issues](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_issues.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from processing untrusted data during deserialization, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious activities.

**How Django REST Framework Contributes:** DRF uses various parsers to handle incoming data (JSON, XML, etc.). Custom fields and validators can also perform deserialization logic. If these are not implemented securely, they can be exploited.

**Example:** A custom serializer field attempts to deserialize a string as a Python object using `pickle.loads()` without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a malicious pickled object.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid using insecure deserialization methods like `pickle` for untrusted input.
- Sanitize and validate data within custom serializer fields and validators.
- Use safer data formats like JSON where possible.
- Be cautious when using third-party libraries for deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Permission Bypass](./attack_surfaces/permission_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers can access API endpoints or perform actions they are not authorized to due to flaws in permission logic.

**How Django REST Framework Contributes:** DRF relies on permission classes to control access to views. Misconfigured or poorly implemented permission classes can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom permission class incorrectly checks user group membership, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive data. Or, a view doesn't have any permission classes defined, making it publicly accessible.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement robust and well-tested permission classes.
- Use built-in permission classes where appropriate (e.g., `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`).
- Ensure all API endpoints have appropriate permission classes applied.
- Thoroughly test permission logic under various scenarios.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Route Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unintended_route_exposure.md)

**Description:**  API endpoints intended for internal use or development are accidentally exposed publicly.

**How Django REST Framework Contributes:** Incorrectly configured routers or manually defined URL patterns can lead to unintended exposure of API functionality.

**Example:** A `ViewSet` with administrative functionality is registered with a router without proper prefixing or permission controls, making it accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, potential for data manipulation or system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Carefully review URL configurations and router setups.
- Use namespaces and versioning in API URLs to manage different levels of access.
- Apply appropriate permission classes to all API endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Parser Vulnerabilities (e.g., XML External Entity - XXE)](./attack_surfaces/parser_vulnerabilities__e_g___xml_external_entity_-_xxe_.md)

**Description:** When using parsers like XMLParser, improper configuration can allow attackers to include external entities, potentially leading to file disclosure or server-side request forgery.

**How Django REST Framework Contributes:** DRF provides `XMLParser`. If used and not configured securely, it can be vulnerable to XXE attacks.

**Example:** An attacker sends an XML payload with a malicious external entity definition that reads a local file on the server.

**Impact:** File disclosure, server-side request forgery, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Disable external entity processing in XML parsers.** Configure the parser to disallow external entities.
- Use safer data formats like JSON if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Action Method Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_action_method_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Custom actions defined in viewsets might contain vulnerabilities if they don't properly validate input or handle edge cases.

**How Django REST Framework Contributes:** DRF allows developers to define custom actions within viewsets. If these actions are not developed securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom action for resetting a user's password doesn't properly validate the provided email address, potentially allowing an attacker to trigger password resets for arbitrary accounts.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized actions, potential for account takeover.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Apply the same security best practices to custom actions as to regular views.
- Thoroughly validate input data within custom actions.
- Ensure proper authorization checks are in place.
