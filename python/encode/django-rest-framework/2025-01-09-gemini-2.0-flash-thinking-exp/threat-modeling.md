# Threat Model Analysis for encode/django-rest-framework

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends extra, unexpected fields in a request (e.g., POST or PUT) to create or update a resource. If the serializer is not properly configured to explicitly define allowed fields (using `fields` or `exclude`), or if `extra_kwargs` is not used carefully, the attacker might be able to modify model fields that were not intended to be user-accessible.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data, potentially leading to data corruption, privilege escalation (if sensitive fields like `is_staff` are modifiable), or unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Component:** `rest_framework.serializers.Serializer` and its subclasses, specifically the `create()` and `update()` methods and field handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly define the allowed fields in your serializers using the `fields` attribute or exclude specific fields using the `exclude` attribute.
*   Override the `create()` and `update()` methods in your serializers to have fine-grained control over how data is processed and saved.
*   Use `extra_kwargs` in your `Meta` class to set fields as `read_only=True` if they should not be modifiable by the user.
*   Carefully review serializer configurations, especially when inheriting serializers.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to Code Execution](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends malicious data disguised as a valid data format (e.g., JSON, XML) that, when deserialized by DRF, can trigger code execution on the server. This is more likely to occur if custom deserialization logic or formatters are used without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** `rest_framework.parsers`, custom parsers, and potentially custom serializer field implementations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid implementing custom deserialization logic unless absolutely necessary.
*   If custom deserialization is required, thoroughly sanitize and validate all input data before processing.
*   Be extremely cautious when using third-party parsing libraries or formatters and keep them updated.
*   Implement strong input validation at the serializer level to ensure data conforms to expected types and formats.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Improper Permission Configuration](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_improper_permission_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for. This can happen if permission classes are not correctly configured in views or viewsets, or if default permissions are too permissive and not overridden appropriately.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data by unauthorized users, or execution of restricted actions.

**Affected Component:** `rest_framework.permissions`, specifically the permission classes applied to views and viewsets.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully choose and configure appropriate permission classes for each view and viewset.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.
*   Test your permission configurations thoroughly to ensure they are working as expected.
*   Avoid relying solely on default permission settings; explicitly define permissions.
*   Consider using custom permission classes for more complex authorization logic.

## Threat: [SQL Injection through Improperly Sanitized Filter Parameters](./threats/sql_injection_through_improperly_sanitized_filter_parameters.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into filter parameters. If custom filters are implemented without proper sanitization or if using raw SQL queries within filters, this can lead to the execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the database.

**Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, or potential compromise of the database server.

**Affected Component:** `rest_framework.filters`, custom filter implementations, and direct database interactions within filters.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using raw SQL queries within filters whenever possible.
*   Use Django's ORM query methods for filtering, as they provide protection against SQL injection.
*   If custom SQL is absolutely necessary, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection.
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all filter input.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data through Improperly Configured Serializers](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_improperly_configured_serializers.md)

**Description:** An attacker can access sensitive data that should not be included in API responses. This can occur if serializers are not configured to exclude sensitive fields or if related models containing sensitive information are serialized without proper control.

**Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, potentially leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or other security breaches.

**Affected Component:** `rest_framework.serializers.Serializer` and its subclasses, field definitions, and related field handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly define the fields to be included in serializer responses using the `fields` attribute or exclude sensitive fields using the `exclude` attribute.
*   Use `read_only=True` for fields that should not be included in request data but might be present in responses.
*   Carefully review the serialization of related models to ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed.
*   Consider using different serializers for different contexts (e.g., list vs. detail views) to control the level of detail exposed.

## Threat: [Insecure Authentication Scheme Implementation](./threats/insecure_authentication_scheme_implementation.md)

**Description:** Developers implement custom authentication schemes or configurations within DRF that are vulnerable to attack (e.g., weak password hashing, insecure token generation, storing secrets in plain text).

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** `rest_framework.authentication`, custom authentication backends, and potentially settings related to authentication.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use well-established and secure authentication methods provided by DRF or reputable third-party libraries.
*   Implement strong password hashing using libraries like `django.contrib.auth.hashers`.
*   Securely generate and store authentication tokens.
*   Avoid storing sensitive credentials or secrets directly in code or configuration files; use environment variables or secrets management tools.
*   Enforce strong password policies.
