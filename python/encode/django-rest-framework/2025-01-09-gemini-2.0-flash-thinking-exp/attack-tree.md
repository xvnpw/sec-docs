## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses.md)

- Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (Critical Node):
    - Attack Vector: Attackers target flaws in how the API verifies user identity and grants access to resources. Successful exploitation directly leads to unauthorized access.
    - Sub-Vectors:
        - Bypass Authentication Mechanisms:
            - Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force: Attackers attempt to guess credentials through repeated login attempts.
            - JWT Secret Key Compromise (Critical Node): If the JWT secret key is compromised, attackers can forge valid authentication tokens.
        - Exploit Authorization Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):
            - Insecure Permissions Configuration: Overly permissive settings allow users to access resources they shouldn't.
            - Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR) (Critical Node): Attackers can access or modify resources belonging to other users by manipulating object identifiers.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__critical_node_.md)

- SQL Injection (Critical Node):
    - Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields, which is then executed by the database, potentially leading to data breaches or remote code execution. This is more likely if raw SQL queries are used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization__critical_node_.md)

- Insecure Deserialization (Critical Node):
    - Attack Vector: Attackers provide malicious serialized data that, when deserialized by the application, leads to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Business Logic Errors (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/business_logic_errors__critical_node_.md)

- Business Logic Errors (Critical Node):
    - Attack Vector: Attackers exploit flaws in the API's business logic to perform unintended actions, such as manipulating prices, bypassing payment processes, or gaining unauthorized access to features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Uploads (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_uploads__critical_node_.md)

- Insecure File Uploads (Critical Node):
    - Attack Vector: Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., scripts, executables) that can be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/debug_mode_enabled_in_production__critical_node_.md)

- Debug Mode Enabled in Production (Critical Node):
    - Attack Vector: Leaving debug mode enabled in production exposes sensitive information about the application's internals, including settings, file paths, and potentially even secrets. It can also enable interactive debuggers, providing a direct path to remote code execution.
