## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Serializer Validation (DRF-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_serializer_validation__drf-specific_aspects_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Leverage DRF Serializers:** Use DRF's `Serializer` classes as the *primary* mechanism for validating *all* incoming data to your API endpoints.  Do not rely solely on Django model validation.
2.  **Field-Level Validation (DRF-Specific):** Utilize DRF's built-in field types and validators:
    *   `CharField`, `IntegerField`, `EmailField`, `DateTimeField`, `BooleanField`, `ChoiceField`, `FileField`, `ImageField`, etc.  These provide inherent type validation.
    *   `max_length`, `min_length`, `required`, `allow_null`, `allow_blank` (use these DRF-specific options judiciously).
    *   `validators`: Use DRF's built-in validators like `UniqueValidator`, `RegexValidator`, or create custom validator functions using DRF's validation framework.
3.  **Object-Level Validation (DRF-Specific):** Implement the `validate()` method within your DRF serializers to perform cross-field validation and enforce complex business rules that span multiple fields. This is a DRF-specific feature.
4.  **`read_only=True` (DRF-Specific):**  Explicitly mark fields as `read_only=True` in your DRF serializers to prevent client modification. This is a core DRF feature for controlling data mutability.
5.  **Nested Serializers (DRF-Specific):**  If using nested serializers (a key DRF feature), ensure thorough validation at *every* level of nesting. Each nested serializer should have its own complete set of validation rules.
6.  **Serializer `Meta` Class:** Use the `Meta` class within your serializer to define model association, fields, and other DRF-specific configurations.
7. **Test Serializers Directly:** Write unit tests that specifically target your DRF serializers, testing both valid and invalid input scenarios, including edge cases.

**Threats Mitigated (DRF-Specific Focus):**
*   **Mass Assignment (Severity: High):** DRF's `read_only=True` and controlled field inclusion in serializers directly prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** DRF's field types and validators ensure data conforms to expected formats, preventing invalid data from entering your application through the API.
*   **Business Logic Bypass (Severity: Medium-High):** DRF's `validate()` method allows for custom, API-specific business logic enforcement.
*   **Injection Attacks (Severity: High/Critical):** While general input validation helps, DRF's structured approach to serialization provides a strong layer of defense against various injection attacks by enforcing data types and formats *before* data interacts with other parts of the application.

**Impact:**
*   **Mass Assignment:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated when used correctly).
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Business Logic Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (as part of a layered defense).

**Currently Implemented:** [Example: Implemented in `UserSerializer` and `ProductSerializer`. Field-level validation is present, but object-level validation is missing in `ProductSerializer`.]

**Missing Implementation:** [Example: Missing comprehensive validation in the `CommentSerializer` (no length limits). Object-level validation is missing in `OrderSerializer`.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular Permissions (DRF-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/granular_permissions__drf-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize DRF Permission Classes:**  Use DRF's built-in permission classes (`IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`) or create *custom* permission classes (subclassing `BasePermission`) to control access to your API endpoints. This is the core of DRF's permission system.
2.  **`DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` (DRF Setting):** Set a restrictive default permission policy in your DRF settings using the `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` setting. This provides a baseline level of security.
3.  **View-Level Permissions (DRF-Specific):**  Apply permission classes directly to your DRF views or viewsets using the `permission_classes` attribute. This allows for fine-grained control over access to specific endpoints.
4.  **`has_object_permission` (DRF-Specific):**  Implement the `has_object_permission` method in your custom DRF permission classes to enforce object-level permissions. This is a key DRF feature for controlling access to individual objects.
5.  **Test Permission Classes:** Write unit tests specifically for your DRF permission classes, covering different user roles and access scenarios.

**Threats Mitigated (DRF-Specific Focus):**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** DRF's permission classes directly control access based on authentication status.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: Critical):** DRF's permission system prevents users from exceeding their authorized privileges.
*   **Horizontal Privilege Escalation (Severity: Critical):** DRF's `has_object_permission` method is specifically designed to prevent this type of attack.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** [Example: `IsAuthenticated` is applied globally. Custom permission class `IsOwnerOrReadOnly` is implemented for the `UserProfile` viewset.]

**Missing Implementation:** [Example: Missing object-level permissions for the `Order` model. Any authenticated user can currently modify any order.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting (Throttling) (DRF-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting__throttling___drf-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize DRF Throttling Classes:** Use DRF's built-in throttling classes (`AnonRateThrottle`, `UserRateThrottle`) or create *custom* throttle classes (subclassing `BaseThrottle`) to limit the rate of API requests.
2.  **`DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES` and `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` (DRF Settings):** Configure default throttle classes and rates in your DRF settings using these settings.
3.  **Throttle Scopes (DRF-Specific):** Define throttle scopes in your DRF settings to apply different throttle rates to different groups of requests (e.g., `anon`, `user`).
4.  **View-Level Throttling (DRF-Specific):** Apply throttle classes directly to your DRF views or viewsets using the `throttle_classes` attribute for per-endpoint control.
5.  **`get_cache_key` (DRF-Specific):**  If creating custom throttle classes, implement the `get_cache_key` method to define how requests are identified and tracked for throttling purposes. This is a key part of DRF's throttling mechanism.
6. **Test Throttling:** Write tests that specifically target your DRF throttling configuration, ensuring it behaves as expected.

**Threats Mitigated (DRF-Specific Focus):**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):** DRF's throttling limits the number of requests, making brute-force attacks much harder.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Severity: High):** DRF's throttling protects against request floods.
*   **API Abuse (Severity: Medium):** DRF's throttling ensures fair usage of API resources.

**Impact:**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **DoS Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **API Abuse:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** [Example: `AnonRateThrottle` and `UserRateThrottle` are applied globally with default rates.]

**Missing Implementation:** [Example: No custom throttling based on request content or specific endpoints.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Browsable API in Production (DRF-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_browsable_api_in_production__drf-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES` (DRF Setting):** In your Django settings, modify the `REST_FRAMEWORK` dictionary's `DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES` setting.
2.  **Remove `BrowsableAPIRenderer`:** Remove `'rest_framework.renderers.BrowsableAPIRenderer'` from the list of default renderers.  This disables DRF's browsable API.
3.  **Conditional Disabling (Recommended):** Use a conditional statement (e.g., based on an environment variable or your `DEBUG` setting) to enable the browsable API only in development environments.

**Threats Mitigated (DRF-Specific Focus):**
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** The DRF browsable API provides a user-friendly interface that can reveal details about your API structure and data models.
*   **Reconnaissance (Severity: Medium):** Attackers can use the DRF browsable API to easily understand your API.
*   **Simplified Exploitation (Severity: Medium):** The DRF browsable API can make it easier to craft malicious requests.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Reconnaissance:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Simplified Exploitation:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** [Example: Browsable API is currently enabled in both development and production.]

**Missing Implementation:** [Example: Browsable API needs to be disabled in production by modifying the `DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES` setting.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Versioning (DRF-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/api_versioning__drf-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose a Versioning Scheme:** DRF supports several versioning schemes:
    *   `URLPathVersioning`: Include the version in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/users`).
    *   `NamespaceVersioning`: Use Django URL namespaces (e.g., `v1:users`).
    *   `AcceptHeaderVersioning`: Use the `Accept` header (e.g., `Accept: application/json; version=1.0`).
    *   `QueryParameterVersioning`: Use a query parameter (e.g., `/api/users?version=1.0`).
    *   `HostNameVersioning`: Use a different hostname or subdomain for each version (e.g., `v1.api.example.com`).
2.  **Configure `DEFAULT_VERSIONING_CLASS` (DRF Setting):** Set the default versioning scheme in your DRF settings.
3.  **Configure `ALLOWED_VERSIONS` (DRF Setting):** Specify the allowed API versions in your DRF settings.
4.  **Configure `VERSION_PARAM` (DRF Setting):** If using `QueryParameterVersioning`, set the name of the version parameter.
5.  **Apply Versioning to Views:** Use DRF's versioning mechanisms to associate different views or serializers with different API versions. This might involve using different URL patterns or conditional logic within your views.
6. **Test different versions:** Ensure that every version works as expected.

**Threats Mitigated (DRF-Specific Focus):**
*   **Breaking Changes (Severity: Medium):** While not a direct security threat, versioning prevents breaking changes from affecting existing clients, which can indirectly lead to security issues if clients are forced to use older, potentially vulnerable versions.
*   **Vulnerability Management (Severity: Medium):** Versioning allows you to deprecate and eventually remove older API versions that may contain known vulnerabilities, forcing clients to upgrade to more secure versions.

**Impact:**
*   **Breaking Changes:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Improved ability to manage and mitigate vulnerabilities over time.

**Currently Implemented:** [Example: No API versioning is currently implemented.]

**Missing Implementation:** [Example: Need to choose a versioning scheme (e.g., `URLPathVersioning`) and configure it in the DRF settings.  Need to update URL patterns and views to support versioning.]
