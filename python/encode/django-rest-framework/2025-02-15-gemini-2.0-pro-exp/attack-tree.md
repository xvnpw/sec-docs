## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Exposure in Logs/Responses (Token Leakage)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_exposure_in_logsresponses__token_leakage_.md)

*   **Description:**  Authentication tokens (JWT, OAuth tokens, etc.) are accidentally included in log files or API responses (e.g., error messages, debug output).
    *   **How it works:**
        *   Developers might inadvertently log the `request.headers` or the entire request object, which includes the `Authorization` header containing the token.
        *   Error handling might not properly sanitize responses, revealing tokens in error messages.
        *   Debug output might include sensitive information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake)
    *   **Impact:** High (Full account takeover)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Just needs to see the logs/response)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If logs are monitored)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Never log sensitive data:**  Explicitly exclude tokens from logging. Use logging filters to redact sensitive information.
        *   **Sanitize error responses:**  Ensure error messages do not reveal internal details or tokens.
        *   **Use HTTPS everywhere:**  This prevents eavesdropping on network traffic, but doesn't protect against logging on the server.
        *   **Review code for logging practices:** Conduct code reviews to identify and fix any instances of logging sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Incorrect Permission Classes](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_incorrect_permission_classes.md)

*   **Description:**  DRF views are configured with overly permissive permission classes (e.g., `AllowAny`), or permission classes are missing entirely, allowing unauthorized access to API endpoints.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   Developers might forget to apply permission classes to views.
        *   They might use `AllowAny` for testing and forget to change it before deployment.
        *   They might misunderstand how permission classes work and use an incorrect one.
        *   The `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` setting in `settings.py` might be too permissive.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the data/functionality exposed)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires reviewing code and API behavior)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the most restrictive permission class that allows the necessary functionality.
        *   **Use appropriate permission classes:**  `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, custom permission classes.
        *   **Set `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES`:**  Configure a restrictive default in your settings.
        *   **Test API endpoints:**  Thoroughly test each endpoint with different user roles and authentication states to ensure permissions are enforced correctly.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Review code to ensure permission classes are applied correctly.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Known CVEs in older DRF versions](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_known_cves_in_older_drf_versions.md)

*   **Description:**  Older, unpatched versions of Django REST Framework contain known vulnerabilities (documented in CVEs) that attackers can exploit.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   Attackers scan for applications using vulnerable versions of DRF.
        *   They use publicly available exploit code or develop their own exploits based on the CVE details.
        *   They target the specific vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (If DRF is not updated)
    *   **Impact:** Varies (Depends on the CVE, could be anything from Low to Very High)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Exploits are often publicly available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Vulnerability scanners can detect this)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Keep DRF up-to-date:**  This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly.
        *   **Use a dependency management tool:**  (e.g., `pip`, `poetry`) to track and update DRF.
        *   **Subscribe to security advisories:**  Stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
        *   **Use a vulnerability scanner:**  Regularly scan your application for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Description:**  DRF serializers deserialize data from untrusted sources (e.g., user input) without proper validation, leading to potential injection attacks or other exploits.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   Attackers craft malicious payloads that exploit weaknesses in the deserialization process.
        *   This can occur with custom fields, nested serializers, or when using unsafe serialization formats (like `pickle`).
        *   The attacker might be able to inject arbitrary code or manipulate data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If input validation is weak)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Potential for RCE or data corruption)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires crafting a malicious payload)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires analyzing input and serializer behavior)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Validate all input:**  Use DRF's built-in validation mechanisms (e.g., `validate_<field_name>` methods, validators).
        *   **Be cautious with custom fields:**  Thoroughly validate data handled by custom fields.
        *   **Avoid unsafe serialization formats:**  Do not use `pickle` or other formats that can execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Use a whitelist approach:**  Only allow specific fields and data types.
        *   **Sanitize input:**  Remove or escape potentially dangerous characters.
        *   **Consider using a safer serialization format:** JSON is generally safer than formats like YAML or pickle.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1 Debug Mode Enabled in Prod](./attack_tree_paths/5_1_debug_mode_enabled_in_prod.md)

*   **Description:**  DRF's debug mode is accidentally left enabled in a production environment, exposing sensitive information like database queries, source code snippets, and internal settings.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   The `DEBUG` setting in `settings.py` is set to `True`.
        *   DRF's error pages and debug toolbar reveal sensitive information to anyone who accesses the API.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Should be caught in deployment, but happens)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Exposes a lot of sensitive information)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Just needs to access the API)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (Obvious in responses)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Set `DEBUG = False` in production:**  This is the *only* mitigation.  Ensure your deployment process sets this correctly.
        *   **Use environment variables:**  Store sensitive settings like `DEBUG` in environment variables, not in the code.
        *   **Automated deployment checks:**  Include checks in your deployment pipeline to ensure `DEBUG` is `False`.
