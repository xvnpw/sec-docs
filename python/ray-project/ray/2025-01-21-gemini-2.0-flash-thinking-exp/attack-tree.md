## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Ray [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_ray__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. It signifies successful exploitation leading to control or significant disruption of the application utilizing the Ray framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ray Framework Weakness [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ray_framework_weakness__critical_node_.md)

This is the initial step where the attacker targets vulnerabilities or weaknesses inherent in the Ray framework itself, rather than the application logic built on top of it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Ray Node [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_ray_node__critical_node_.md)

This involves gaining control over one or more individual nodes within the Ray cluster. A compromised node can be used to further attack the cluster or the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Raylet Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_raylet_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

The Raylet is the core process on each Ray node. Exploiting vulnerabilities here can lead to remote code execution and full control over the node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unpatched Raylet Bug (e.g., RCE) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unpatched_raylet_bug__e_g___rce___high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers target known, unpatched vulnerabilities in the Raylet software to execute arbitrary code on the node. This requires knowledge of the Ray version being used and the existence of exploitable bugs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Node OS/Infrastructure [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_node_osinfrastructure__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

Instead of directly targeting Ray, attackers compromise the underlying operating system or infrastructure on which the Ray node is running. This grants control over all processes on the node, including the Raylet.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OS Vulnerability on Ray Node [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_os_vulnerability_on_ray_node__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the operating system of a Ray node (e.g., in the kernel or system libraries) to gain elevated privileges and control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Ray Node (e.g., weak SSH credentials) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_ray_node__e_g___weak_ssh_credentials___high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers gain access to a Ray node through methods like brute-forcing weak SSH credentials or exploiting other exposed access points.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Objects [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_objects__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers insert malicious data or code into the Ray object store, aiming to influence the behavior of other tasks that consume this data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability in Object Handling [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerability_in_object_handling__high_risk_path_.md)

If Ray or the application uses insecure deserialization of objects from the object store, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that execute arbitrary code when deserialized by worker processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Tasks [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_tasks__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers submit specially crafted tasks to the Ray cluster with the intention of exploiting vulnerabilities or performing malicious actions on worker nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Task Input Sanitization [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_task_input_sanitization__high_risk_path_.md)

If the Ray scheduler or worker processes do not properly sanitize task inputs, attackers can inject malicious code or commands that are executed during task processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Ray Global Control Store (GCS) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_ray_global_control_store__gcs___critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

The GCS manages the overall state of the Ray cluster. Compromising it allows attackers to manipulate the entire cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit GCS Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gcs_vulnerability__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities within the GCS software to gain control or manipulate the cluster state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unpatched GCS Bug (e.g., affecting cluster state) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unpatched_gcs_bug__e_g___affecting_cluster_state___high_risk_path_.md)

Similar to Raylet vulnerabilities, attackers exploit known, unpatched bugs in the GCS to gain control or disrupt the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Nodes [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_nodes__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit weaknesses in the process of adding new nodes to the Ray cluster to introduce compromised nodes under their control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Node Joining/Authentication [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_node_joiningauthentication__high_risk_path_.md)

Attackers bypass or exploit weak authentication or authorization mechanisms during the node joining process to add malicious nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Doesn't Properly Sanitize Data Received from Ray [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/application_doesn't_properly_sanitize_data_received_from_ray__high_risk_path_.md)

The application fails to properly validate or sanitize data received from Ray tasks or the object store, leading to vulnerabilities like injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) within the application logic.
