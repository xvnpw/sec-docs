# Attack Surface Analysis for ray-project/ray

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Network Ports](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_network_ports.md)

*   **Description:** Ray head and worker nodes expose network ports for internal communication and client interaction. If these ports are not properly secured, unauthorized access is possible.
    *   **How Ray Contributes:** Ray's distributed nature necessitates network communication between its components, inherently requiring open ports. Default configurations might not have strong security measures in place.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans the network and finds the Ray head node's default port (e.g., 6379 for Redis, or other Raylet ports) open without authentication. They could then attempt to connect and interact with the Ray cluster directly.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the cluster, potential for submitting malicious tasks, resource manipulation, information disclosure, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure firewalls to restrict access to Ray ports only from trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        *   Utilize network segmentation to isolate the Ray cluster from other less trusted networks.
        *   Consider using VPNs or other secure tunneling mechanisms for client connections.
        *   Change default port configurations if possible and practical.

## Attack Surface: [Raylet API Exposure](./attack_surfaces/raylet_api_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The Raylet process on both head and worker nodes exposes an API for managing the cluster and executing tasks. Lack of proper authentication and authorization on this API can lead to exploitation.
    *   **How Ray Contributes:** Ray's architecture relies on the Raylet API for core functionalities like task scheduling and resource management. This API is a central point of interaction within the cluster.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the network where Ray nodes are running and interacts directly with the Raylet API (e.g., via gRPC) without proper authentication, allowing them to submit arbitrary tasks or query cluster state.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on worker nodes, manipulation of cluster resources, denial of service, information disclosure about the cluster's internal state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and enforce authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Raylet API.
        *   Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication with the Raylet API.
        *   Restrict access to the Raylet API to only authorized components and users.
        *   Regularly review and update Ray versions to patch potential API vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Object Store Access Control Issues](./attack_surfaces/object_store_access_control_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Ray's object store allows for efficient sharing of data between tasks. If access controls are not properly configured or enforced, unauthorized access or modification of data is possible.
    *   **How Ray Contributes:** The shared object store is a core feature of Ray for data sharing and efficient computation, making it a potential target if not secured.
    *   **Example:** A task running with insufficient privileges is able to access or modify sensitive data stored in the object store that it should not have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state, potential for privilege escalation if object store access is tied to other functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained access control mechanisms for the object store, limiting access based on task identity or user roles.
        *   Ensure that tasks only have the necessary permissions to access the data they require.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive data stored in the object store.
        *   Regularly review and audit object store access policies.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Task Submission/Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_task_submissionexecution.md)

*   **Description:** Ray's core functionality involves executing user-defined tasks. If an attacker can submit malicious tasks, they can potentially compromise the worker nodes or the entire cluster.
    *   **How Ray Contributes:** Ray's fundamental purpose is to execute code remotely, making it inherently susceptible to malicious code injection if access is not controlled.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Ray cluster and submits a task that executes arbitrary system commands on a worker node, potentially installing malware or exfiltrating data.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on worker nodes, compromise of worker nodes, data breaches, denial of service, potential for lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for task submission.
        *   Sanitize and validate task inputs to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Run worker nodes in isolated environments (e.g., containers) with restricted privileges.
        *   Implement resource limits and monitoring to detect and prevent malicious resource consumption.
        *   Regularly audit submitted tasks and their origins.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Ray uses serialization to transfer data between clients and the cluster. If insecure deserialization is used, attackers can craft malicious payloads that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How Ray Contributes:** Ray's distributed nature requires serialization for communication between different processes and nodes.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when received and deserialized by a Ray worker, exploits a vulnerability in the deserialization library to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on Ray nodes, potential for full cluster compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using insecure deserialization methods.
        *   Use secure serialization libraries and ensure they are up-to-date.
        *   Implement integrity checks on serialized data to detect tampering.
        *   Restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized.
