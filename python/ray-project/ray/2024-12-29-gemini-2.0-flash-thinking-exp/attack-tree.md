Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **Compromise Application Using Ray (High-Risk Path):**
    * This represents the overarching goal and is considered high-risk due to the potential for significant impact if any of the underlying high-risk paths are successful.

* **Exploit Ray Control Plane Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    * **Unauthorized Access to Ray Dashboard/API (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        * **Exploit Weak or Default Authentication/Authorization:** Attackers attempt to gain access using commonly known default credentials or by brute-forcing weak passwords. This is often a low-effort, beginner-level attack with a potentially high impact.
        * **Exploit Network Exposure of Ray Dashboard/API:** If the Ray dashboard or API is exposed to the public internet without proper authentication, attackers can directly access and potentially control the Ray cluster. This is a high-likelihood, high-impact scenario.
    * **Code Injection into Ray Processes (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        * **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Ray Communication:** Attackers inject malicious serialized objects into Ray's communication channels (e.g., task arguments, actor messages). When these objects are deserialized, they can execute arbitrary code on the Ray nodes.
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Ray Modules/Libraries:** If the application uses custom Ray modules or libraries with vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these flaws to inject and execute malicious code within the Ray environment.

* **Exploit Ray Data Plane Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**
    * **Data Interception/Manipulation in Ray Communication (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        * **Exploit Unencrypted Communication Channels:** If communication between Ray nodes is not encrypted, attackers can intercept and potentially modify sensitive data being transmitted.
    * **Compromise Ray Worker Nodes (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        * **Exploit Weak Security Practices on Worker Nodes:** Attackers leverage common security weaknesses on worker nodes, such as weak passwords, unpatched software, or insecure configurations, to gain unauthorized access and potentially execute code.
    * **Data Exfiltration from Ray Workers/Shared Storage (High-Risk Path):**
        * **Exploit Weak Access Controls on Shared Storage:** If shared storage accessible by Ray workers has weak access controls, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored there.

* **Exploit Ray API Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
    * **Abuse of Ray Client API Functionality (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        * **Submit Malicious Tasks/Actors:** Attackers submit tasks or create actors through the Ray API that are designed to execute malicious code or perform unauthorized actions within the Ray cluster.
        * **Manipulate Application State via API Calls:** Attackers use legitimate API calls in unintended ways to alter the application's state maliciously, potentially disrupting functionality or gaining unauthorized access.
    * **Exploit Insecure API Design/Implementation (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
        * **Lack of Input Validation in API Calls:** Attackers provide malicious input to API calls that is not properly validated. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including code injection or unexpected behavior that compromises the application or Ray cluster.
