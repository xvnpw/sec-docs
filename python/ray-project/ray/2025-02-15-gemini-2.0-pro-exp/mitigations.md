# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ray-project/ray

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Ray Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_ray_authentication.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose Authentication Method:** Ray supports password-based authentication.
2.  **Configure Ray:** When starting the Ray cluster (using `ray start`), set the `RAY_ADDRESS` and `--redis-password` flags.  Example: `RAY_ADDRESS='auto' ray start --head --node-ip-address="<head_node_ip>" --port=6379 --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0 --redis-password="<your_strong_password>"`
3.  **Client-Side Configuration:** When connecting to the cluster from client code (using `ray.init()`), provide the authentication credentials (the password).
4.  **Regular Password Rotation:** Establish a policy and process for regularly changing the Ray cluster password. Automate this if possible, and ensure the updated password is used in all client connection configurations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Cluster Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from connecting to the Ray cluster and executing arbitrary code, accessing data, or disrupting operations.
    *   **Unauthorized Dashboard Access (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from gaining insights into the cluster's state.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of attackers stealing data by preventing unauthorized access.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Makes it harder for attackers to launch DoS attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Cluster Access:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.
    *   **Unauthorized Dashboard Access:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   (Example: "Authentication is enabled for all client connections and the dashboard using a shared password, configured in the `start_ray_cluster.sh` script.")

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   (Example: "We need to implement a script to automate password rotation and update the `start_ray_cluster.sh` script and client connection code accordingly.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Ray TLS Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/enable_ray_tls_encryption.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Generate Certificates:** Generate TLS certificates (and private keys) for the Ray head node and worker nodes.
2.  **Configure Ray Head Node:** When starting the Ray head node, specify the paths to the certificate and private key files using the command-line arguments: `--node-cert-path`, `--node-private-key-path`.
3.  **Configure Ray Worker Nodes:** Configure worker nodes to use TLS certificates when connecting to the head node, using similar configuration options.
4.  **Configure Ray Client:** Configure the Ray client (`ray.init()`) to use TLS when connecting to the cluster. This may involve specifying the CA certificate.
5.  **Certificate Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating the TLS certificates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and modifying communication.
    *   **Eavesdropping (Severity: High):** Protects data in transit.
    *   **Data Tampering (Severity: High):** Ensures data integrity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    *   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   (Example: "TLS encryption is enabled using self-signed certificates. Configuration is done in `start_ray_cluster.sh`.")

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   (Example: "We need to switch to certificates from a trusted CA and implement automated certificate rotation.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Ray Resource Limits](./mitigation_strategies/configure_ray_resource_limits.md)

**Description:**
1.  **CPU Limits:** Specify CPU limits for Ray tasks and actors using the `@ray.remote(num_cpus=...)` decorator.
2.  **Memory Limits:** Specify memory limits using `@ray.remote(memory=...)`.
3.  **GPU Limits:** Specify GPU limits using `@ray.remote(num_gpus=...)`.
4.  **Custom Resources:** Define and use custom resources using `@ray.remote(resources={"custom_resource": ...})` if needed.
5.  **Object Store Memory:** Limit the Ray object store memory using the `--object-store-memory` flag when starting Ray.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents resource exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Protects the cluster.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):** Ensures responsiveness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   (Example: "CPU and memory limits are set for all tasks using the `@ray.remote` decorator.")

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   (Example: "We need to define and apply GPU limits for tasks that utilize GPUs.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Ray Task Prioritization](./mitigation_strategies/use_ray_task_prioritization.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Critical Tasks:** Determine which tasks are most critical to the application's functionality.
2.  **Assign Priorities:** Use the `@ray.remote(priority=...)` decorator to assign higher priorities to critical tasks.  Ray uses numerical priorities (higher numbers indicate higher priority).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Helps ensure critical tasks are executed even under heavy load.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):** Improves responsiveness for important tasks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (helps mitigate, but not a complete solution).
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced for prioritized tasks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   (Example: "Task prioritization is not currently implemented.")

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   (Example: "We need to identify critical tasks and add the `@ray.remote(priority=...)` decorator to their definitions.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Ray Serialization (Custom Serializers)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ray_serialization__custom_serializers_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid Pickle with Untrusted Data:** Do *not* use `pickle` to deserialize data from untrusted sources.
2.  **Prefer Safer Formats:** Use JSON, Protocol Buffers, or Apache Arrow for external data.
3.  **Custom Serializers (If Pickle is Necessary):** If you *must* use `pickle` for *internal* data transfer, implement custom serializers and deserializers using Ray's custom serialization API.  This involves:
    *   Defining classes that inherit from `ray.serialization.SerializationContext`.
    *   Implementing the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods with *strict* validation to prevent code execution.  This is a complex and error-prone process.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Pickle (Severity: Critical):** Prevents code execution through malicious pickle payloads.
    *   **Data Injection (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of data injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE via Pickle:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Very Low* (with properly implemented custom serializers).
    *   **Data Injection:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   (Example: "We are using JSON for all external data. We are using default pickle for internal data.")

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   (Example: "We need to implement custom serializers for all internal data transfer to eliminate the use of default pickle.")

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Ray Logging](./mitigation_strategies/configure_ray_logging.md)

**Description:**
1. **Set Logging Level:** When starting Ray, use the `--logging-level` flag to control the verbosity of logs (e.g., `ray start --head --logging-level=info`). Choose from `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, or `critical`.
2. **Log File Rotation:** Configure log file rotation to prevent log files from growing indefinitely. This is typically handled by the underlying logging system, but Ray's configuration might influence it.
3. **Structured Logging (Advanced):** Consider using structured logging (e.g., logging in JSON format) to make it easier to parse and analyze logs. This may require custom configuration within your Ray tasks.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Undetected Attacks (Severity: High):** Provides visibility into cluster activity.
    * **Delayed Incident Response (Severity: High):** Enables faster response.
    * **Lack of Forensic Evidence (Severity: High):** Provides logs for analysis.

* **Impact:**
    * **Undetected Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    * **Delayed Incident Response:** Risk significantly reduced.
    * **Lack of Forensic Evidence:** Risk significantly reduced.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * (Example: "Ray logging is enabled with the default `info` level.")

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * (Example: "We need to configure log file rotation and consider switching to structured logging for easier analysis.")
