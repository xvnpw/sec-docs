# Attack Surface Analysis for ray-project/ray

## Attack Surface: [1. Untrusted Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/1__untrusted_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Execution of arbitrary, potentially malicious code within the Ray cluster.
*   **How Ray Contributes:** Ray's core functionality is to execute distributed Python code, making it inherently susceptible if not properly secured. Ray provides mechanisms for remote code execution.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a Ray task through a vulnerable web API that contains malicious code to exfiltrate data from the object store or install a backdoor on worker nodes.
*   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data theft, data corruption, denial of service, lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** *Never* trust user-supplied code directly.  Rigorously validate and sanitize all inputs that influence task creation or execution.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Execute user-provided code (if absolutely necessary) within a highly restricted, isolated environment (e.g., a container with minimal privileges and network access).  Consider using Ray's built-in containerization support.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant Ray workers and tasks only the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid running Ray processes as root.
    *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review all code that interacts with Ray, especially code that handles user input.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Carefully vet and manage all dependencies to prevent supply chain attacks.

## Attack Surface: [2. Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC)](./attack_surfaces/2__insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc_.md)

*   **Description:** Unprotected communication channels between Ray components (Raylets, object store, GCS, driver, workers).
*   **How Ray Contributes:** Ray relies heavily on gRPC and shared memory (Plasma) for IPC.  If these channels are not secured, they become attack vectors.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts gRPC traffic between the driver and a worker, modifying the data being processed and causing incorrect results or injecting malicious commands.  Alternatively, an attacker gains access to the shared memory object store and reads sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, data modification, task hijacking, denial of service, potential for code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Enforce TLS encryption with mutual authentication for all gRPC communication.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Use firewalls and network policies to restrict access to Ray ports and isolate the object store.  Only allow necessary communication between components.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for all Ray components.  Ensure that only authorized clients can connect to the Ray cluster.
    *   **Service Mesh (Advanced):** Consider using a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for fine-grained control over network traffic and security policies.

## Attack Surface: [3. Object Store (Plasma) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__object_store__plasma__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Plasma shared-memory object store.
*   **How Ray Contributes:** Plasma is a core component of Ray, and vulnerabilities in its implementation could lead to significant compromise.
*   **Example:** A memory corruption vulnerability in Plasma allows an attacker to overwrite object data, leading to arbitrary code execution within a worker process.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data theft, denial of service, potential for code execution within worker processes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Ray up-to-date to benefit from security patches addressing Plasma vulnerabilities.
    *   **Network Isolation:** Isolate the object store using network policies, limiting access to authorized Ray workers.
    *   **Memory Safety (Advanced):** If feasible, explore using memory-safe languages or techniques for critical object handling within Plasma.

## Attack Surface: [4. Global Control Store (GCS) Compromise](./attack_surfaces/4__global_control_store__gcs__compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the GCS, which stores cluster metadata.
*   **How Ray Contributes:** The GCS is central to Ray's operation, and its compromise grants significant control over the cluster.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the GCS and registers malicious worker nodes, which are then used to launch further attacks.
*   **Impact:** Cluster disruption, task hijacking, data manipulation, potential for widespread compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Secure the GCS with strong authentication and authorization.
    *   **Access Control:** Limit access to the GCS to only the head node and authorized administrative tools.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor GCS access logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [5. Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/5__insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Deserialization of untrusted data using vulnerable methods (e.g., Pickle).
*   **How Ray Contributes:** Ray uses serialization to transfer data between processes.  If Pickle is used with untrusted data, it creates a significant vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted Pickle payload to a Ray worker, which, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Pickle:** *Never* use Pickle to deserialize data from untrusted sources.
    *   **Safe Alternatives:** Use safer serialization formats like Arrow or JSON whenever possible.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Libraries (If Pickle is unavoidable):** If Pickle *must* be used, employ a secure deserialization library or implement rigorous custom validation logic.

## Attack Surface: [6. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Supply Chain Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/6__dependency_vulnerabilities__supply_chain_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:** Ray tasks rely on vulnerable or malicious third-party libraries.
*   **How Ray Contributes:** Ray tasks are Python code and can import any library, making them vulnerable to supply chain attacks.
*   **Example:** A Ray task uses a compromised version of a popular library, which is exploited to gain access to the worker node.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data theft, cluster compromise, depending on the exploited vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use a dependency vulnerability scanner to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin dependency versions to prevent unexpected updates to vulnerable versions.
    *   **Private Package Repository:** Consider using a private package repository to control the source of dependencies.
    *   **Containerization:** Use containerization to create reproducible and isolated environments for each task, including specific dependency versions.
