# Threat Model Analysis for ray-project/ray

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Ray Cluster](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_ray_cluster.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Ray cluster by exploiting exposed Ray ports (e.g., 6379 for Redis, 8265 for the dashboard), weak or default passwords on Ray components, or vulnerabilities in the Ray client connection process. Once inside, they can directly interact with Ray's core functionalities.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Ray cluster, data exfiltration from the Ray object store, manipulation of running Ray tasks, denial of service by shutting down or overloading Ray components, and resource hijacking.

**Affected Component:** Ray Head Node (specifically the GCS - Global Control Store, Redis), Ray Worker Nodes, Ray Client API.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for Ray client connections using TLS certificates or access tokens provided by Ray.
* Restrict network access to Ray cluster components using firewalls and network segmentation, limiting access to necessary Ray ports.
* Change default passwords for Ray components like Redis and the Ray Dashboard.
* Enable TLS encryption for inter-node communication within the Ray cluster as configured by Ray.
* Regularly audit access logs of Ray components and monitor for suspicious activity related to Ray API calls.

## Threat: [Malicious Task Submission](./threats/malicious_task_submission.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the Ray client API submits malicious Ray tasks designed to execute arbitrary code on the worker nodes. This directly leverages Ray's task execution mechanism to run code within the Ray environment.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on Ray worker nodes, potentially leading to data breaches within the Ray context, installation of malware that can interact with Ray resources, lateral movement within the Ray cluster, or denial of service by crashing Ray workers.

**Affected Component:** Ray Client API, Ray Worker Nodes (via `ray.remote`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data passed to Ray tasks, focusing on data that directly influences Ray task execution.
* Apply the principle of least privilege when defining task permissions and resource access within Ray's framework.
* Consider sandboxing or containerizing Ray tasks to limit their potential impact within the Ray environment.
* Implement robust authentication and authorization for task submission through the Ray client API.
* Regularly review and audit the code responsible for creating and submitting Ray tasks using Ray's API.

## Threat: [Ray Dashboard Exploitation](./threats/ray_dashboard_exploitation.md)

**Description:** The Ray Dashboard, a component of Ray, if exposed without proper authentication or with known vulnerabilities in its code, can be exploited by attackers to interact with and control the Ray cluster.

**Impact:** Information disclosure about the Ray cluster state and running applications, manipulation or termination of critical Ray tasks, and potentially remote code execution on the Ray head node through vulnerabilities in the dashboard service.

**Affected Component:** Ray Dashboard Service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the Ray Dashboard with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by Ray or integrated with existing identity providers.
* Restrict network access to the Ray Dashboard to authorized users or internal networks only.
* Keep the Ray version updated to patch known vulnerabilities in the dashboard component.
* Regularly review the dashboard's access logs for suspicious activity related to Ray cluster management.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Task/Actor Arguments](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_taskactor_arguments.md)

**Description:** If Ray tasks or actors receive serialized data as arguments using libraries like `pickle` without proper safeguards, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the Ray worker nodes. This directly involves how Ray handles data passed between its components.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on Ray worker nodes.

**Affected Component:** Ray Task Execution, Ray Actor Invocation, Serialization/Deserialization mechanisms within Ray (specifically when using libraries like `pickle` with `ray.remote` or actor methods).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using insecure deserialization libraries like `pickle` when handling data from untrusted sources in Ray tasks or actors.
* Prefer using safer serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers for data exchanged within the Ray framework.
* Implement input validation and sanitization even for serialized data passed to Ray components.
* If `pickle` is necessary for Ray tasks, ensure the data source is highly trusted and consider using cryptographic signing to verify data integrity before deserialization within the Ray context.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Ray Object Store](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_ray_object_store.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Ray object store, a core component of Ray for sharing data between tasks and actors. This could be due to misconfigured access controls within Ray's object store implementation or compromised credentials used by Ray components.

**Impact:** Data breaches and exposure of sensitive information processed and shared by Ray tasks and actors. Potential for data manipulation or deletion within the Ray object store, impacting the integrity of Ray computations.

**Affected Component:** Ray Object Store (plasma store).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement appropriate access controls for the Ray object store, restricting access to authorized Ray processes and users only.
* Consider encrypting sensitive data stored in the Ray object store.
* Regularly audit access logs for the Ray object store.
* Ensure the underlying storage mechanism used by Ray's object store is securely configured.
