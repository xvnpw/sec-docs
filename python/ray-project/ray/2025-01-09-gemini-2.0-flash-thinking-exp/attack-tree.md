# Attack Tree Analysis for ray-project/ray

Objective: Compromise the application utilizing Ray by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Ray framework itself (focusing on high-risk areas).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ray Core Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ray_core_functionality__critical_node_.md)

- This category represents fundamental weaknesses in how Ray operates, making it a critical target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Ray Node [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__on_ray_node__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

- Goal: Gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on a Ray node, leading to full control.
    - Exploit Unpickling Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        - Attack Vector: Injecting malicious serialized Python objects (using pickle) into Ray's object store or as task arguments. When these objects are deserialized by a Ray process, the malicious code is executed.
        - Likelihood: Medium
        - Impact: High
    - Exploit Insecure Task Execution [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        - Attack Vector: Submitting Ray tasks that contain malicious code. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or restrict task code, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on worker nodes.
        - Likelihood: Medium
        - Impact: High

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data in Ray Object Store [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_in_ray_object_store__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

- Goal: Alter or corrupt data stored in Ray's shared object store, disrupting application logic or causing data integrity issues.
    - Exploit Lack of Access Control [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        - Attack Vector: Directly accessing and modifying objects in the Ray object store without proper authorization checks. This could involve using Ray's API or internal mechanisms if access controls are missing or misconfigured.
        - Likelihood: Medium
        - Impact: Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ray Configuration and Deployment [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ray_configuration_and_deployment__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

- This category focuses on weaknesses arising from how Ray is set up and configured, making it a critical area for security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Default Configurations [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_default_configurations__high_risk_path_.md)

- Goal: Exploit vulnerabilities stemming from using default, insecure settings.
    - Exploit Weak or Missing Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        - Attack Vector: Interacting with the Ray cluster or its components without providing valid credentials or without any authorization checks in place. This allows unauthorized access and control.
        - Likelihood: Medium
        - Impact: High

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deployment Practices [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deployment_practices__high_risk_path_.md)

- Goal: Leverage vulnerabilities introduced by insecure methods of deploying and managing the Ray cluster.
    - Access Sensitive Ray Configuration Files [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        - Attack Vector: Gaining unauthorized access to Ray configuration files that contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, or internal network details. This information can then be used for further attacks.
        - Likelihood: Low to Medium
        - Impact: High
