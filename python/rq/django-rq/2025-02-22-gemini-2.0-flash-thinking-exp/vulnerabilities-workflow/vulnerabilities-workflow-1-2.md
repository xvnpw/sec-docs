- **Vulnerability: Hardcoded SECRET_KEY and Debug Mode Enabled in Django Settings**
  - **Description:**
    The settings file (`integration_test/integration_test/settings.py`) hardcodes a secret key and enables DEBUG mode (i.e. `DEBUG = True`). In a production deployment, an attacker who can trigger an error page (or otherwise inspect configuration details) may obtain extensive diagnostic information. Moreover, with the secret key known, cryptographic operations (such as session signing and token generation) become predictable, making session hijacking or forgery attacks possible.
  - **Impact:**
    Attackers may:
    - View detailed error messages including sensitive file paths, settings, and stack traces (due to DEBUG mode).
    - Forge or tamper with session cookies, authentication tokens, and other cryptographic artifacts because the secret key is publicly known.
    - Potentially bypass authentication or manipulate sensitive data, leading to a complete system compromise.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No mitigations are applied; the secret key is directly embedded in source code and DEBUG remains enabled.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Load the secret key from a secure environment variable or external configuration file rather than hardcoding it.
    - Automatically force `DEBUG = False` when running in a production environment (for example, by checking an environment flag).
    - Include explicit configuration checks that block or warn deployment when insecure settings are detected.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application is deployed with this default configuration in a production (or publicly accessible) environment.
    - An attacker can trigger error conditions (e.g. by making malformed requests) so that the debug pages are rendered.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    In the file `integration_test/integration_test/settings.py` the following lines appear without any environment‐based conditions:
    ```python
    # SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
    SECRET_KEY = '!s1kl4g@+13igo3-&47f4+5-zfj!3j&n*sw$32@m%d65*muwni'

    # SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
    DEBUG = True
    ```
    There is no check to override these values outside of a development environment, which means that if deployed as is, both the secret and the debug mode will be available to an attacker.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the Django application with the current `settings.py` configuration in an environment accessible to external users.
    2. Force an error (for example, by visiting a non-existent URL) to cause an exception and observe the error page; verify that the debug traceback is shown and that the hardcoded secret key is visible in the output or configuration dumps.
    3. Leverage the known secret key to attempt forging a session cookie or a signed token (using Django’s signing functions) to see if the forged artifact grants access to protected areas of the application.
    4. Document that the presence of a publicly visible secret key and detailed debug output enables an attacker to gain sensitive internal information and potentially subvert the application’s security.

- **Vulnerability: Unauthenticated and CSRF‐Exempt Job Enqueue Endpoint**
  - **Description:**
    In the integration app’s view (`integration_test/integration_app/views.py`), the home endpoint is decorated with `@csrf_exempt` and does not enforce any authentication or authorization. This view accepts POST requests and immediately enqueues a background job by passing user‐provided input (the “name” POST parameter) to the `add_mymodel` function. Because no access control or input validation is performed, an external attacker can abuse this endpoint to submit arbitrary jobs.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker may:
    - Enqueue arbitrary jobs repeatedly (for example, with crafted input values) without any verification, potentially polluting the job queue and the database table (`MyModel`).
    - Use the job‐enqueue mechanism as a foothold into the job processing pipeline if, in other parts of the system, similar unsanitized functions are enqueued with more sensitive operations.
    - Trigger unintended behavior, possibly interfering with legitimate processing or corrupting application data.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The endpoint is marked with `@csrf_exempt` (which in a very controlled testing context might be acceptable) but no actual protection is applied to ensure that only authorized users can enqueue jobs.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Remove (or limit) the use of `@csrf_exempt` so that robust CSRF protection is enforced.
    - Require user authentication and check for appropriate authorization before accepting job requests.
    - Validate and sanitize the input data (the “name” field) before using it to create or enqueue a job.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The integration app (including this unauthenticated endpoint) is deployed in a publicly accessible environment.
    - An attacker can send POST requests to the home endpoint (i.e. “/”) without restriction.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    The view is implemented in `integration_test/integration_app/views.py` as follows:
    ```python
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

    from .models import *
    import django_rq

    @csrf_exempt
    def home(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            django_rq.enqueue(add_mymodel, request.POST["name"])
            return HttpResponse("Enqueued")
        names = [m.name for m in MyModel.objects.order_by("name")]
        return HttpResponse("Entries: {}".format(",".join(names)))
    ```
    Notice that:
    - The `@csrf_exempt` decorator disables CSRF protection entirely.
    - There is no authentication or permission check, so any client can POST to this endpoint.
    - The user-supplied value (`request.POST["name"]`) is passed directly to the function that writes to the database.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the application so that the integration app is publicly accessible.
    2. Using a tool such as curl or Postman, send an HTTP POST request to the root URL with the parameter `name` set to a test value (for example, “malicious_input”):
       ```bash
       curl -X POST -d "name=malicious_input" http://<target-domain>/
       ```
    3. Verify that the response returns “Enqueued” and that a new record with the value “malicious_input” now exists in the `MyModel` database table.
    4. Repeat with various inputs to confirm arbitrary job submission is possible.
    5. Document that the endpoint does not require any authentication or CSRF token and that it allows unauthenticated job enqueueing.
