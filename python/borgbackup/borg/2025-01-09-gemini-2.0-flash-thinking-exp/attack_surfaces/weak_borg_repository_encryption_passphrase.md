        print("## Technical Deep Dive:")
        print("* **Underlying Vulnerability:** The core issue is the reliance on a user-provided secret for encryption. Borg's strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) becomes ineffective with a weak key derived from a guessable passphrase.")
        print("* **Attack Vectors:**")
        print("    * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can systematically try every possible combination of characters. Weak passphrases significantly reduce the time required.")
        print("    * **Dictionary Attacks:** Using lists of common words and phrases, attackers can quickly crack passphrases based on dictionary words or common patterns.")
        print("    * **Rainbow Table Attacks:** Pre-computed tables of password hashes can be used to quickly find the passphrase if it's a common one (less likely with strong encryption but still a risk for very weak passphrases).")
        print("    * **Social Engineering:** Attackers might trick users into revealing their passphrase through phishing or other social engineering tactics.")
        print("    * **Compromised Systems:** If the system storing the repository is compromised, attackers can attempt offline brute-force attacks.")
        print("* **Exploitation Process:**")
        print("    1. **Access the Repository:** Attacker gains access to the encrypted Borg repository files (e.g., through a compromised server, cloud storage breach, or insider threat).")
        print("    2. **Offline Cracking:** The attacker downloads the repository data and attempts to crack the encryption offline using tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper.")
        print("    3. **Decryption:** With a weak passphrase, the attacker can successfully decrypt the repository and access the backed-up data.")

        print("\n## Impact Amplification:")
        print("* **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.")
        print("* **Compliance Violations:** Failure to protect sensitive data can result in penalties under regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.")
        print("* **Business Disruption:** Loss of trust and the need for incident response can significantly disrupt business operations.")
        print("* **Long-Term Damage:** The impact of a data breach can be long-lasting, affecting customer trust and brand reputation.")

        print("\n## Mitigation Strategies - Development Team Focus:")
        print("The development team plays a crucial role in guiding users towards secure passphrase practices.")
        print("* **Enhance Borg Functionality (Potential Future Features):**")
        print("    * **Built-in Passphrase Strength Meter:** Implement a feature that evaluates the strength of the entered passphrase in real-time, providing feedback to the user.")
        print("    * **Passphrase Generation Tool:** Offer an optional built-in tool to generate strong, random passphrases for the user.")
        print("    * **Warning Messages for Weak Passphrases:** Display prominent warnings if a user enters a passphrase deemed weak based on predefined criteria (length, character complexity, common patterns).")
        print("    * **Integration with Password Managers (Consideration):** Explore potential integration with common password managers to facilitate secure passphrase storage and retrieval.")
        print("* **Improve User Guidance and Documentation:**")
        print("    * **Clear and Prominent Documentation:** Emphasize the critical importance of strong passphrases in the official Borg documentation. Provide clear examples of strong and weak passphrases.")
        print("    * **Educational Resources:** Create tutorials or FAQs explaining best practices for choosing and managing Borg passphrases.")
        print("    * **Command-Line Hints:** When the `borg init` command is used, display a reminder about the importance of a strong passphrase.")
        print("* **Promote Secure Passphrase Storage (External to Borg):**")
        print("    * **Strong Recommendations:**  Clearly advise users to use password managers or dedicated secrets management solutions for storing Borg passphrases if needed for automation.")
        print("    * **Discourage Insecure Practices:** Explicitly warn against storing passphrases in plain text in configuration files or scripts.")
        print("* **Key File Guidance:**")
        print("    * **Comprehensive Documentation:** Provide detailed instructions on how to generate, use, and securely manage key files as an alternative to passphrases.")
        print("    * **Highlight Security Benefits:** Emphasize the potential security advantages of using key files over passphrases.")
        print("    * **Address Management Challenges:** Provide guidance on securely storing and accessing key files, especially in automated environments.")

        print("\n## Deeper Look at Mitigation Strategies:")
        print("* **Enforce Strong Passphrases:**")
        print("    * **Technical Implementation:** While direct enforcement within Borg might be challenging, the development team can implement features to *guide* users towards strong passphrases (strength meter, warnings).")
        print("    * **User Education:**  Clearly communicate the risks of weak passphrases and provide concrete examples of strong passphrases (e.g., using a passphrase generator, combining unrelated words, using a mix of character types).")
        print("* **Passphrase Complexity Requirements:**")
        print("    * **Guidance, Not Enforcement (Likely):** Borg itself doesn't enforce complexity. The development team's role is to provide clear guidelines and recommendations in the documentation.")
        print("    * **Specific Recommendations:** Suggest minimum length requirements (e.g., 16 characters or more), the use of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding personal information or dictionary words.")
        print("* **Secure Passphrase Storage:**")
        print("    * **Focus on External Tools:** Since Borg primarily uses the passphrase during repository initialization and access, secure storage is largely an external concern. The development team should strongly recommend and provide guidance on using password managers or secrets management solutions.")
        print("    * **Highlight Risks of Insecure Storage:** Clearly explain the dangers of storing passphrases in plain text files or within scripts.")
        print("* **Consider Key Files:**")
        print("    * **Thorough Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation on how to generate, use, and securely manage key files.")
        print("    * **CLI Enhancements (Optional):** Consider adding command-line options to facilitate key file generation and management.")
        print("    * **Security Considerations:** Emphasize that the security of the key file is paramount. It should be treated with the same level of care as a strong passphrase.")
