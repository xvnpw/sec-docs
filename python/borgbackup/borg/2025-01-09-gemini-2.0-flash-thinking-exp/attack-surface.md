# Attack Surface Analysis for borgbackup/borg

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Borg Client SSH Key (for remote repositories)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_borg_client_ssh_key__for_remote_repositories_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the private SSH key used by the Borg client to authenticate to a remote repository.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** Borg often uses SSH keys for secure authentication to remote repositories. The security of these keys is paramount for Borg's security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker steals the private SSH key from the Borg client's machine (e.g., through malware or insider threat).
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can now impersonate the legitimate Borg client, potentially:
        *   Access and download all backups.
        *   Delete or modify existing backups, leading to data loss or corruption.
        *   Upload malicious data disguised as legitimate backups.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Key Management:**  Store SSH private keys securely with appropriate file permissions (read-only for the Borg user).
        *   **Passphrase Protection:** Protect SSH private keys with strong passphrases.
        *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate SSH keys used for Borg backups.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the Borg client user has only the necessary permissions.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring for unauthorized SSH login attempts to the Borg repository.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Borg Repository Encryption Passphrase](./attack_surfaces/weak_borg_repository_encryption_passphrase.md)

*   **Description:** The passphrase used to encrypt the Borg repository is weak or easily guessable.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** Borg's security heavily relies on the strength of the encryption passphrase. A weak passphrase undermines the entire encryption scheme.
    *   **Example:** A user sets a simple passphrase like "password123" or a dictionary word for the Borg repository.
    *   **Impact:** If an attacker gains access to the repository data (e.g., through compromised storage or unauthorized access), they can decrypt the backups using the weak passphrase, exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Strong Passphrases:** Mandate the use of strong, randomly generated passphrases for Borg repositories.
        *   **Passphrase Complexity Requirements:** Implement requirements for passphrase length, character types, and avoid common patterns.
        *   **Secure Passphrase Storage:** If storing the passphrase, use secure methods like password managers or dedicated secrets management solutions. Avoid storing passphrases in plain text in configuration files.
        *   **Consider Key Files:** Explore the use of key files instead of passphrases for potentially stronger security, managing the key file securely.

## Attack Surface: [Local Access and Privilege Escalation on Borg Client Machine](./attack_surfaces/local_access_and_privilege_escalation_on_borg_client_machine.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains local access to the machine running the Borg client and escalates privileges.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:**  The Borg client stores configuration files and potentially interacts with sensitive data. Local access can be leveraged to manipulate Borg.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in another application on the Borg client machine to gain root access.
    *   **Impact:** With elevated privileges, the attacker can:
        *   Access Borg configuration files and retrieve repository locations, passphrases, or SSH keys.
        *   Execute arbitrary Borg commands, potentially deleting or modifying backups.
        *   Modify the Borg client binary itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Harden the Borg Client Machine:** Implement strong security measures on the machine running the Borg client, including regular patching, strong passwords, and disabling unnecessary services.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Borg client with the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Borg client machine and its configuration.
        *   **Endpoint Security Solutions:** Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus software to detect and prevent malicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Application Logic Using Borg](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_vulnerabilities_in_application_logic_using_borg.md)

*   **Description:** An application using Borg constructs Borg commands based on user input without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** If the application integrates with Borg by executing Borg commands, improper input handling can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to specify backup paths, and this input is directly incorporated into a `borg create` command without sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious commands like `; rm -rf /`.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running the Borg client, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input before using it to construct Borg commands.
        *   **Parameterization:** If possible, use Borg's API or libraries in a way that allows for parameterization to avoid direct string concatenation of user input into commands.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application component executing Borg commands runs with the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential command injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Borg Client or Server Software](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_borg_client_or_server_software.md)

*   **Description:**  Security vulnerabilities exist in the Borg client or server software itself.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** Any software can have vulnerabilities. Using Borg introduces the risk of exploiting flaws in its code.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in the Borg client that allows for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts, including:
        *   Remote code execution on the client or server.
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Data corruption or loss.
        *   Information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Borg Updated:** Regularly update Borg to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Subscribe to Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities announced by the Borg project.
        *   **Consider Using Stable Releases:** Opt for stable releases of Borg over development versions in production environments.
