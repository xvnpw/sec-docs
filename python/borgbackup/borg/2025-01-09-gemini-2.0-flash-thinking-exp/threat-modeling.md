# Threat Model Analysis for borgbackup/borg

## Threat: [Compromised Borg Client Binary](./threats/compromised_borg_client_binary.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Borg Client Binary
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains administrative access to the system where the Borg client is installed and replaces the legitimate `borg` executable with a malicious version. This malicious binary, when executed for backup or restore, can perform actions like stealing credentials, modifying data before encryption, or exfiltrating data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the backup process. Stolen credentials allow access to the entire repository. Modified backups lead to data integrity issues. Exfiltrated data breaches confidentiality. A malicious restore can compromise the system.
    *   **Affected Borg Component:** `borg` executable (client binary)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring (e.g., using `aide`, `tripwire`) to detect unauthorized changes to the `borg` binary.
        *   Restrict file system permissions to the `borg` binary and its installation directory, limiting write access.
        *   Regularly update the Borg client to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using signed binaries and verifying signatures if available.
        *   Employ robust access control and security hardening on the server hosting the Borg client.

## Threat: [Exposure of Borg Client Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_borg_client_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Borg Client Configuration
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information like repository connection details, encryption passphrases (if stored insecurely), or authentication keys within the Borg client's configuration files (e.g., `~/.config/borg/config`) are accessible to unauthorized users or processes. An attacker could read these files directly or through vulnerabilities allowing file access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Borg repository, allowing the attacker to view, modify, or delete backups. If the encryption passphrase is exposed, the attacker can decrypt the backups.
    *   **Affected Borg Component:** Configuration file parsing and storage within the Borg client.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Borg configuration files have restrictive permissions (e.g., `chmod 600`).
        *   Avoid storing the encryption passphrase directly in configuration files. Use secure methods like environment variables or key management systems.
        *   Encrypt the home directory or specific configuration directories.
        *   Regularly audit file permissions on the system.
