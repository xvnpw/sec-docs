## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Borg (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_borg__critical_node_.md)

*   **Compromise Application via Borg (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This is the root goal of the attacker and represents any successful compromise of the application by leveraging Borg's weaknesses. It serves as the entry point for all the high-risk paths detailed below.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Borg Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_borg_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Borg Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This node represents the exploitation of inherent flaws or weaknesses within the Borg software itself. Successful exploitation can lead to direct control over the system running Borg.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Borg (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__in_borg__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Borg (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            *   **Exploit Vulnerability in Borg Client/Server Communication:** An attacker could exploit flaws in how the Borg client and server communicate, potentially through:
                *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks to intercept and modify communication, injecting malicious commands.
                *   Exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities where specially crafted data sent during communication leads to code execution.
            *   **Exploit Vulnerability in Borg Archive Processing:** An attacker could upload a maliciously crafted archive that, when processed by Borg, triggers a vulnerability leading to code execution. This could involve buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Borg Repository (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_borg_repository__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Compromise Borg Repository (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   Gaining control over the Borg repository is a critical objective as it provides access to all backed-up data and the ability to manipulate it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Repository Storage (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_repository_storage__critical_node_.md)

        *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Repository Storage (CRITICAL NODE):**  This is a key step in compromising the repository. Attack vectors include:

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Repository Password/Key (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_repository_passwordkey__high-risk_path_.md)

            *   **Exploit Weak Repository Password/Key (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                *   Brute-forcing weak or easily guessable repository passphrases.
                *   Obtaining stored repository keys if they are not securely managed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Phishing for Repository Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringphishing_for_repository_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

            *   **Social Engineering/Phishing for Repository Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Tricking authorized users into revealing the repository passphrase or key through deceptive tactics.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Existing Backups (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_existing_backups__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   **Modify Existing Backups (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Once repository access is gained, attackers can:
            *   Replace legitimate files within backups with malicious versions.
            *   Add backdoors or exploits to existing backed-up data that will be restored to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Backups (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_backups__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   **Inject Malicious Backups (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers can create entirely new backups containing malicious payloads designed to compromise the application when restored.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Borg Functionality (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_borg_functionality__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Abuse Borg Functionality (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   This involves using Borg's legitimate features for malicious purposes after gaining some level of access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from Backups (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data_from_backups__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   **Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from Backups (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  If the attacker gains access to the repository, they can download and extract sensitive data contained within the backups, leading to a data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Restore Compromised Backup (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/restore_compromised_backup__high-risk_path_.md)

        *   **Restore Compromised Backup (HIGH-RISK PATH):** An attacker could trick or force the application to restore a backup that has been previously compromised (either by modifying an existing backup or injecting a malicious one), leading to the deployment of malicious code within the application environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Borg Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_borg_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Borg Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   Borg relies on various Python libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise Borg itself, which can then be used to attack the application. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries like `requests` (for network communication) or `cryptography` (for encryption), potentially leading to remote code execution or other forms of compromise.
