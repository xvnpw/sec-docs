# Threat Model Analysis for borgbackup/borg

## Threat: [Malicious Backup Content Injection](./threats/malicious_backup_content_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's data *before* it is backed up by Borg. They then modify or inject malicious content into the data stream that Borg will archive. This could involve injecting malware, backdoors, or manipulating data to cause harm upon restoration.

**Impact:** Restoring the compromised backup will reintroduce the malicious content into the system, potentially leading to reinfection, data corruption, or further exploitation.

**Affected Borg Component:** `borg create`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust security measures to protect the application's data *before* the backup process.
* Run malware scans on the data before initiating the backup process.

## Threat: [Backup Corruption](./threats/backup_corruption.md)

**Description:** An attacker, or even system errors, could corrupt the Borg repository data on the storage medium. This could involve directly modifying the repository files, causing inconsistencies in the data chunks or index.

**Impact:** Corrupted backups may be unusable, leading to data loss during a restore attempt.

**Affected Borg Component:** `borg repository`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize reliable and trustworthy storage solutions for the Borg repository.
* Implement regular integrity checks of the Borg repository using `borg check --repair`.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce the use of strong, unique passphrases for Borg repository encryption.
* Educate users on passphrase security best practices.

## Threat: [Compromise of the Repository Key](./threats/compromise_of_the_repository_key.md)

**Description:** The Borg repository key is stored insecurely or is compromised through other means.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all backed-up data, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive information without needing the passphrase.

**Affected Borg Component:** `borg init --encryption=repokey-blake2`, storage of the key file.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store the repository key file securely with restricted access permissions.
* Encrypt the key file itself using strong encryption methods.

## Threat: [Exposure of Passphrase in Application Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_passphrase_in_application_configuration.md)

**Description:** The Borg repository passphrase is stored directly within the application's configuration files, environment variables, or source code.

**Impact:**  An attacker gaining access to the application's configuration can easily retrieve the passphrase and compromise the Borg repository.

**Affected Borg Component:** How the application integrates with Borg, specifically where the passphrase is stored and passed to Borg commands.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing the passphrase directly in configuration files or code.
* Use secure secret management solutions to store and retrieve the passphrase.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack during Backup/Restore](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_during_backuprestore.md)

**Description:** When backing up to or restoring from a remote Borg repository over a network, an attacker could intercept the communication if it's not properly secured.

**Impact:**  The attacker could potentially eavesdrop on the backup data, gaining access to sensitive information.

**Affected Borg Component:** Network communication during `borg create` and `borg extract` when using remote repositories.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use SSH for accessing remote Borg repositories (`borg init --remote-path`, `BORG_RSH` environment variable).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to the Repository Storage](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_the_repository_storage.md)

**Description:** The storage location for the Borg repository is not properly secured, allowing unauthorized individuals to access the repository files directly.

**Impact:**  Attackers could potentially download the encrypted backups, attempt to brute-force the passphrase offline, or even delete or corrupt the repository.

**Affected Borg Component:** The underlying storage system where the Borg repository is located.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls on the storage location.
* Utilize cloud storage features like access control lists (ACLs) or IAM roles to restrict access.

## Threat: [Loss of Passphrase or Key Leading to Data Inaccessibility](./threats/loss_of_passphrase_or_key_leading_to_data_inaccessibility.md)

**Description:** The passphrase or repository key is lost, forgotten, or becomes inaccessible.

**Impact:**  The backed-up data becomes permanently inaccessible, resulting in data loss.

**Affected Borg Component:** Repository encryption mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement secure passphrase/key management and recovery procedures.
* Store backup copies of the repository key in a secure, offline location.

## Threat: [Corruption of the Repository Index](./threats/corruption_of_the_repository_index.md)

**Description:** The Borg repository's index becomes corrupted due to storage issues, software bugs, or malicious activity.

**Impact:**  Makes it difficult or impossible to access or restore the backed-up data.

**Affected Borg Component:** `borg repository` index files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize reliable storage.
* Run regular `borg check --repair` to detect and fix index inconsistencies.
* Maintain multiple backup copies of the entire repository.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Borg Binary](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_borg_binary.md)
