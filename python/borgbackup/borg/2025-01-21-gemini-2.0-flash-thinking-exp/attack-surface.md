# Attack Surface Analysis for borgbackup/borg

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the `borg` executable itself.](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the__borg__executable_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or security flaws within the Borg codebase that could be exploited.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** The application directly relies on the `borg` executable for backup and restore operations. Any vulnerability in `borg` becomes a vulnerability in the application's security posture.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the `borg` executable could be triggered by a specially crafted repository or command, leading to arbitrary code execution on the system running the application.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Could lead to complete system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `borg` executable updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor Borg's security advisories and changelogs for reported issues.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on the `borg` codebase (if feasible) to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Local Privilege Escalation via Borg.](./attack_surfaces/local_privilege_escalation_via_borg.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect file permissions or configurations related to the `borg` executable, its configuration files, or repository access that could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** Borg requires specific permissions to access repositories and perform operations. Misconfigurations in these permissions can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** If the `borg` executable is setuid root or if the repository directory has overly permissive write access, a local attacker could potentially manipulate Borg to perform actions with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** High. An attacker could gain root access or other elevated privileges on the system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring permissions for the `borg` executable, its configuration files, and repository directories.
        *   Regularly audit file permissions related to Borg.
        *   Avoid running `borg` with unnecessary elevated privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via User-Supplied Input to Borg.](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_user-supplied_input_to_borg.md)

*   **Description:** If the application constructs `borg` commands using unsanitized user input, an attacker could inject malicious commands that are then executed by the system.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** The application's integration with Borg involves constructing and executing `borg` commands. Improper handling of user input in this process creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to specify the backup archive name. If this input is not sanitized and directly used in a `borg create` command, an attacker could inject shell commands within the archive name (e.g., `--archive "important_data; rm -rf /"`).
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Could lead to arbitrary code execution, data deletion, or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly embed unsanitized user input into shell commands.**
        *   Use parameterized commands or libraries that handle command construction safely, preventing injection.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in `borg` commands.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the user account running the `borg` commands.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Borg Repository.](./attack_surfaces/compromised_borg_repository.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Borg repository, leading to data breach, manipulation, or deletion.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** Borg is responsible for storing the application's backup data. The security of the repository is paramount.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server hosting the Borg repository (either local or remote) due to weak server security or compromised credentials. They can then decrypt and access the backed-up data.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the storage location of the Borg repository with strong access controls and encryption at rest.
        *   For remote repositories, use strong SSH key management and secure server configurations.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing the repository server.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for the repository.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Borg Repository Encryption Passphrase.](./attack_surfaces/weak_borg_repository_encryption_passphrase.md)

*   **Description:** The encryption passphrase used to protect the Borg repository is weak or easily guessable, allowing an attacker to decrypt the backups if they gain access to the repository files.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** Borg's security relies heavily on the strength of the encryption passphrase.
    *   **Example:** A user sets a simple passphrase like "password" for the Borg repository. If an attacker gains access to the repository files, they can easily brute-force the passphrase and decrypt the data.
    *   **Impact:** High. Loss of confidentiality of backup data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong passphrase policies for Borg repositories.
        *   Educate users on the importance of strong, unique passphrases.
        *   Consider using key files instead of passphrases for enhanced security.
        *   Explore using hardware security modules (HSMs) for passphrase management in sensitive environments.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Borg Repository Passphrase/Key.](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_borg_repository_passphrasekey.md)

*   **Description:** The encryption passphrase or key file for the Borg repository is stored insecurely, making it accessible to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** Borg requires access to the passphrase or key to perform backup and restore operations. If this is stored insecurely, it bypasses Borg's encryption.
    *   **Example:** The Borg repository passphrase is stored in plain text in a configuration file or environment variable that is accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Impact:** High. Loss of confidentiality of backup data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never store Borg repository passphrases in plain text.**
        *   Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk) to store and manage passphrases and keys.
        *   Encrypt configuration files containing sensitive information.
        *   Restrict access to files containing passphrases or key files using appropriate file system permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Borg SSH Connections.](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_borg_ssh_connections.md)

*   **Description:** When using SSH for remote Borg repositories, an attacker could intercept and potentially modify the communication between the application and the repository server.
    *   **How Borg Contributes:** Borg often utilizes SSH for secure communication with remote repositories. Vulnerabilities in the SSH setup can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the network performs a MITM attack during a Borg backup or restore operation over SSH, potentially injecting malicious data or stealing the encryption passphrase.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for data corruption, data breach, or compromise of SSH credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the authenticity of the remote SSH server using host key verification.
        *   Use strong SSH key exchange algorithms and ciphers.
        *   Ensure the underlying network infrastructure is secure.
        *   Consider using VPNs or other secure tunnels for added protection.
