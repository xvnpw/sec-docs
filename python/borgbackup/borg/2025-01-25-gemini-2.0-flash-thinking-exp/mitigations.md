# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for borgbackup/borg

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Key Management for Repository Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/secure_key_management_for_repository_encryption.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong Passphrase Generation for Borg Repositories:** When initializing a Borg repository using `borg init`, enforce the use of strong, randomly generated passphrases for encryption. Utilize passphrase generators or guidelines to ensure sufficient complexity and uniqueness.
    2.  **Key Management System (KMS) or Secret Management Tool Integration (Advanced):** For highly sensitive backups, consider integrating Borg with a KMS or secret management tool. Instead of directly using a passphrase, store the encryption key securely within the KMS/secret management tool and configure Borg to retrieve the key programmatically during backup and restore operations. This enhances security by centralizing key management and reducing the risk of passphrase exposure.
    3.  **Secure Passphrase Input to Borg:** When running Borg commands that require the repository passphrase (e.g., `borg create`, `borg restore`), ensure the passphrase is provided securely. Utilize environment variables or interactive prompts instead of hardcoding passphrases in scripts or configuration files. Avoid logging or displaying the passphrase in command history or output.
    4.  **Borg Keyfile Usage (Advanced):** Explore using Borg's keyfile feature for repository access instead of passphrases, especially in automated environments. Securely manage and protect the keyfile, ensuring it is only accessible to authorized processes.
    5.  **Key Rotation for Borg Repositories (Advanced):** Implement a key rotation policy for Borg repository encryption keys. While Borg doesn't directly support key rotation after repository creation, consider strategies like creating a new repository with a new key and migrating backups periodically for long-term security.

        *   Unauthorized Access to Borg Repository due to Exposed Passphrase: High Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Strong passphrase guidelines might be in place. Environment variables might be used for passphrase input in some scripts.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** KMS/Secret Management tool or keyfile integration for Borg, key rotation strategies for Borg repositories, and consistently secure passphrase input methods are likely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Borg Repository Integrity Verification using `borg check`](./mitigation_strategies/regular_borg_repository_integrity_verification_using__borg_check_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automate `borg check` Command:** Schedule regular execution of the `borg check --repository <repository_path>` command using cron jobs, systemd timers, or other scheduling tools. This command is a built-in Borg feature to verify the internal consistency and integrity of the repository.
    2.  **Define `borg check` Frequency:** Determine an appropriate frequency for running `borg check` based on backup frequency, data sensitivity, and repository size. Daily or weekly checks are recommended for most environments.
    3.  **Monitor `borg check` Output:** Implement monitoring for the output of `borg check`. Parse the output for errors or warnings reported by Borg, indicating potential repository corruption or inconsistencies.
    4.  **Alerting on `borg check` Failures:** Set up alerts to notify administrators immediately if `borg check` reports any errors or warnings. Promptly investigate and address any issues identified by `borg check`.
    5.  **Cautious Use of `borg check --repair` (Advanced):** In case `borg check` detects minor inconsistencies, consider using `borg check --repair`. However, exercise caution and thoroughly test repair procedures in a non-production environment first. Always back up the repository before attempting repair. Understand the risks and limitations of `borg check --repair`.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Data Corruption within Borg Repository (Medium Severity) - Integrity, Availability
        *   Backup Restore Failures due to Borg Repository Corruption (High Severity) - Availability
        *   Silent Data Loss within Borg Backups (Medium Severity) - Integrity
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Corruption within Borg Repository: Medium Reduction (early detection by Borg)
        *   Backup Restore Failures due to Borg Repository Corruption: Medium Reduction (early detection and potential repair by Borg)
        *   Silent Data Loss within Borg Backups: Medium Reduction (early detection by Borg)
    *   **Currently Implemented:**  `borg check` might be performed manually occasionally.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Automated and scheduled `borg check` execution, monitoring of `borg check` output, and alerting on failures are likely missing. Automated repair using `borg check --repair` is almost certainly not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Borg Client Binaries and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/secure_borg_client_binaries_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Download Borg from Official BorgBackup Sources:** Obtain Borg client binaries and dependencies exclusively from official and trusted sources maintained by the BorgBackup project. This includes the official BorgBackup GitHub releases page and official distribution package repositories.
    2.  **Verify Borg Binary Integrity:** After downloading Borg binaries, rigorously verify their integrity using checksums (SHA256, etc.) or digital signatures provided by the BorgBackup project. Compare the downloaded checksums against the official published checksums to ensure binaries haven't been tampered with.
    3.  **Utilize Package Managers for Borg Installation:** Prefer using system package managers (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`) to install and manage Borg and its dependencies. Package managers often provide pre-verified binaries from trusted repositories and simplify the update process.
    4.  **Keep Borg Client Updated:** Regularly update the Borg client software to the latest stable version, including its dependencies. Monitor security advisories specifically related to BorgBackup and apply security patches promptly. Utilize package manager update mechanisms or automated update tools where feasible.
    5.  **Vulnerability Scanning for Borg Client Systems:** Periodically scan systems running Borg clients for known vulnerabilities specifically in the installed Borg client software and its dependencies. Use vulnerability scanning tools that can identify outdated versions or known security flaws in Borg.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Compromised Borg Client Binaries (High Severity) - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
        *   Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Borg Client Software (High Severity) - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
        *   Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Borg Client Distribution (Medium Severity) - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromised Borg Client Binaries: High Reduction
        *   Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Borg Client Software: High Reduction
        *   Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Borg Client Distribution: Medium Reduction (mitigates known compromised sources)
    *   **Currently Implemented:**  Binaries are likely downloaded from official sources or package managers. Integrity verification and regular updates might be inconsistent. Vulnerability scanning is less likely to be specifically focused on Borg clients.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Consistent integrity verification of Borg binaries, automated updates for Borg clients and dependencies, and regular vulnerability scanning of Borg client systems for Borg-specific vulnerabilities are likely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Borg Communication Channels using SSH](./mitigation_strategies/secure_borg_communication_channels_using_ssh.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce SSH for Remote Borg Repositories:** When configuring Borg to access remote repositories (using `borg create`, `borg restore`, etc.), strictly enforce the use of SSH as the transport protocol (`ssh://user@host/repository`). SSH provides encryption and authentication specifically for securing Borg's network communication.
    2.  **Verify SSH Host Keys for Borg Repositories:**  Implement SSH host key verification when Borg clients connect to remote repositories for the first time. This is crucial to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks during the initial connection setup for Borg operations. Use tools like `ssh-keyscan` or manual verification of host keys and integrate this into Borg client deployment processes.
    3.  **Optimize SSH Configuration for Borg:** Configure SSH servers used for Borg repository access with strong security settings. Disable weak ciphers and key exchange algorithms within the SSH server configuration specifically for Borg access. Enforce strong authentication methods for SSH users accessing Borg repositories (e.g., public key authentication, multi-factor authentication).
    4.  **Dedicated SSH Keys for Borg (Recommended):** Consider using dedicated SSH keys specifically for Borg client authentication to repository servers. This allows for finer-grained access control and easier revocation of keys if needed, enhancing security for Borg-specific access.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Borg Repository Connections (High Severity) - Confidentiality, Integrity
        *   Eavesdropping on Borg Backup Traffic over Network (High Severity) - Confidentiality
        *   Unauthorized Interception of Borg Repository Credentials during Network Transfer (Medium Severity) - Confidentiality
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Borg Repository Connections: High Reduction
        *   Eavesdropping on Borg Backup Traffic over Network: High Reduction
        *   Unauthorized Interception of Borg Repository Credentials during Network Transfer: Medium Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** SSH is likely used for remote repository access. Basic SSH host key verification might be performed initially. Strong SSH configurations optimized for Borg and dedicated SSH keys for Borg access are less likely to be consistently implemented.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Consistent SSH host key verification for Borg, strong SSH server/client configurations tailored for Borg, and dedicated SSH keys for Borg client authentication are likely missing in some deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Borg Client Temporary Directories](./mitigation_strategies/secure_borg_client_temporary_directories.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Dedicated Borg Temporary Directory:** Explicitly configure Borg client processes to utilize a dedicated temporary directory specifically for Borg operations using the `--tempdir` option or environment variables. This directory should be separate from system-wide temporary directories to isolate Borg's temporary files.
    2.  **Restrict Permissions on Borg Temporary Directory:** Set highly restrictive permissions on the dedicated Borg temporary directory. Ensure that only the user account running the Borg client process has read, write, and execute permissions. Prevent access from other users or processes on the system.
    3.  **Automated Cleanup of Borg Temporary Files:** Implement automated mechanisms to regularly and securely clean up temporary files within the dedicated Borg temporary directory after backup or restore operations are completed. This minimizes the window of opportunity for potential information leakage from temporary files.
    4.  **Avoid Shared Temporary Directories for Borg:** Strictly avoid using shared temporary directories (e.g., `/tmp`, `C:\Windows\Temp`) for Borg operations. Shared temporary directories increase the risk of unauthorized access to Borg's temporary data and potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Information Leakage from Borg Temporary Files (Medium Severity) - Confidentiality
        *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data in Borg Temporary Files (Medium Severity) - Confidentiality, Integrity
        *   Potential for Local Privilege Escalation via Borg Temporary Files (Low Severity) - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Leakage from Borg Temporary Files: Medium Reduction
        *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data in Borg Temporary Files: Medium Reduction
        *   Potential for Local Privilege Escalation via Borg Temporary Files: Low Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:**  Default temporary directory settings might be used by Borg, which might not be dedicated or securely configured.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Dedicated temporary directories configured for Borg using `--tempdir`, restricted permissions on Borg temporary directories, and automated cleanup of Borg temporary files are likely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Borg Backup Verification and Monitoring](./mitigation_strategies/implement_borg_backup_verification_and_monitoring.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Post-Borg Backup Verification:** After each Borg backup operation (e.g., `borg create`), implement automated verification steps to confirm the backup's success specifically from Borg's perspective. This includes checking Borg's exit code (ensure it's 0 for success), parsing Borg's log output for errors or warnings, and potentially using `borg list` or `borg info` to verify repository metadata after backup.
    2.  **Monitor Borg Backup Size Trends:** Track and monitor the size of Borg backups over time. Establish baseline backup sizes and set up alerts for significant deviations or unexpected changes in backup size. This can help detect anomalies in the backup process or potential data integrity issues within Borg backups.
    3.  **Monitor Borg Backup Schedule Execution:** Monitor the execution of Borg backup schedules to ensure backups are running as configured and on time. Implement alerts for missed or delayed Borg backups. Use scheduling tools' monitoring features or custom scripts to track Borg backup execution.
    4.  **Centralized Borg Backup Monitoring Dashboard:** Integrate Borg backup monitoring data into a centralized monitoring dashboard or system. Display key metrics like backup status, size trends, schedule adherence, and alerts related to Borg backups in a consolidated view for easy monitoring and management.
    5.  **Alerting for Borg Backup Failures and Anomalies:** Configure alerting mechanisms specifically for Borg backup failures, verification errors detected in Borg's output, and anomalies identified during Borg backup monitoring (e.g., unexpected size changes, missed schedules). Ensure alerts are promptly routed to administrators for investigation and remediation.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Undetected Borg Backup Failures (High Severity) - Availability
        *   Data Loss due to Unsuccessful Borg Backups (High Severity) - Availability, Integrity
        *   Delayed Detection of Issues Affecting Borg Backups (Medium Severity) - Availability, Integrity
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Undetected Borg Backup Failures: High Reduction
        *   Data Loss due to Unsuccessful Borg Backups: High Reduction
        *   Delayed Detection of Issues Affecting Borg Backups: Medium Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic backup success checks might be in place (e.g., checking exit codes). Comprehensive Borg-specific backup verification, monitoring of Borg metrics, and alerting tailored to Borg are less likely.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Automated post-Borg backup verification based on Borg's output, monitoring of Borg backup size and schedule, centralized dashboards for Borg backup status, and alerting specifically for Borg backup failures and anomalies are likely missing.
