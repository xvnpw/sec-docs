# Deep Analysis: Tampering with Borg Configuration Files

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the potential vulnerabilities related to tampering with BorgBackup configuration files, specifically focusing on the identified critical nodes: "Incorrect Permissions" and "Missing Encryption."  The goal is to:

*   Understand the specific attack scenarios within these nodes.
*   Identify the potential impact on the application and its data.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and best practices to reduce the risk.
*   Assess the residual risk after implementing mitigations.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the "Tamper with Configuration Files" path within the larger attack tree for the BorgBackup-based application.  It focuses on the two critical sub-nodes:

*   **Incorrect Permissions:**  Analyzing vulnerabilities arising from misconfigured file and directory permissions related to Borg's configuration and repository.
*   **Missing Encryption (at rest/in transit):** Analyzing vulnerabilities arising from the absence or misconfiguration of encryption, both for data in transit and at rest.

This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors within the broader attack tree, such as social engineering, physical access to servers, or vulnerabilities within the BorgBackup software itself (although secure configuration *does* mitigate some software vulnerabilities).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Scenario Definition:**  For each critical node, we will define specific, realistic attack scenarios.
2.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will analyze the potential impact of each scenario on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).
3.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  We will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies to address each vulnerability.  These will include both preventative and detective controls.
4.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  After proposing mitigations, we will reassess the likelihood and impact to determine the residual risk.
5.  **Recommendations:**  We will provide concrete recommendations for the development team, prioritized by risk level.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Tamper with Configuration Files

### 4.1.  Incorrect Permissions (CRITICAL NODE)

#### 4.1.1 Scenario Definition

*   **Scenario 1:  World-Writable Configuration File:** The Borg configuration file (`config` within the repository, or a separate configuration file used by the application) has overly permissive permissions (e.g., `777` or `666`), allowing any user on the system to modify it.  An attacker could change the repository location, encryption keys, retention policies, or other critical settings.
*   **Scenario 2:  Group-Writable Configuration File:** The configuration file is group-writable, and an attacker gains access to a user account within that group (e.g., through a compromised service account).  The attacker can then modify the configuration.
*   **Scenario 3:  World-Readable Repository Directory:** The entire Borg repository directory has overly permissive read permissions, allowing any user to list the contents and potentially infer information about the backup structure, filenames, or even access unencrypted chunks (if encryption is misconfigured).
*   **Scenario 4:  Incorrect Ownership:** The configuration file or repository directory is owned by an inappropriate user or group, making it easier for an attacker with access to that user/group to modify it.

#### 4.1.2 Impact Assessment

*   **Confidentiality:**  Medium to High.  An attacker could potentially gain access to encryption keys or redirect backups to a location they control, compromising the confidentiality of the backed-up data.
*   **Integrity:**  High.  An attacker could modify the configuration to delete backups, change retention policies, or inject malicious data into the backup process.
*   **Availability:**  Medium to High.  An attacker could disrupt the backup process, delete existing backups, or make the repository inaccessible.

#### 4.1.3 Mitigation Strategies

*   **Preventative:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the Borg configuration file and repository directory have the *most restrictive* permissions possible.  The configuration file should ideally be readable and writable *only* by the user account running the Borg process (e.g., `600`). The repository directory should be accessible only by that user.
    *   **Secure Ownership:**  The configuration file and repository directory should be owned by the user account running the Borg process and a dedicated group (e.g., `borgbackup`).
    *   **Automated Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack) to enforce secure permissions and ownership consistently and prevent manual errors.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit file and directory permissions to detect any deviations from the secure baseline.  Automated security scanning tools can help with this.
    *   **Avoid Shared User Accounts:** Do not run Borg processes under shared user accounts. Use dedicated service accounts with minimal privileges.
*   **Detective:**
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Implement FIM to monitor the Borg configuration file and repository directory for unauthorized changes.  Tools like `AIDE`, `Tripwire`, or OS-specific solutions can be used.
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate FIM alerts and system logs into a SIEM system to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
    *   **Regular Backup Verification:** Regularly test the integrity and restorability of backups to detect any tampering. Borg's `check` and `mount` commands are crucial for this.

#### 4.1.4 Residual Risk Assessment

After implementing these mitigations, the residual risk is **Low**.  The likelihood of successful exploitation is significantly reduced due to the restrictive permissions and monitoring.  The impact remains potentially high, but the difficulty of exploitation is increased.

### 4.2. Missing Encryption (at rest/in transit) (CRITICAL NODE)

#### 4.2.1 Scenario Definition

*   **Scenario 1:  No Encryption at Rest:** Borg is used without any encryption (`--encryption=none`).  An attacker who gains access to the repository (e.g., through a compromised server or stolen storage device) can directly access the unencrypted backup data.
*   **Scenario 2:  Weak Encryption Algorithm:**  An outdated or weak encryption algorithm is used (e.g., a deprecated mode of `repokey`).  An attacker could potentially brute-force the encryption key or exploit known vulnerabilities in the algorithm.
*   **Scenario 3:  Key Compromise:** The encryption key is stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text in a configuration file, in a version control system, or on a compromised system).  An attacker who obtains the key can decrypt the backups.
*   **Scenario 4:  Unencrypted Transfer:** Backups are transferred over an unencrypted channel (e.g., plain FTP or HTTP) to a remote repository.  An attacker could intercept the data in transit and gain access to the unencrypted backup data.
*   **Scenario 5:  Insecure Key Management:** The process for generating, storing, and rotating encryption keys is weak or non-existent. This increases the risk of key compromise or loss.

#### 4.2.2 Impact Assessment

*   **Confidentiality:**  Very High.  Without encryption, or with weak encryption, the confidentiality of the backed-up data is severely compromised.
*   **Integrity:**  Medium to High.  While encryption primarily protects confidentiality, it also provides some integrity protection.  An attacker with access to unencrypted data could modify it without detection.
*   **Availability:**  Low to Medium.  Encryption itself doesn't directly impact availability, but key loss could make the backups unrecoverable.

#### 4.2.3 Mitigation Strategies

*   **Preventative:**
    *   **Strong Encryption at Rest:**  Always use Borg's built-in encryption with a strong, recommended algorithm (e.g., `repokey-blake2` or `repokey-aes-ocb`).  Avoid using `--encryption=none`.
    *   **Secure Key Storage:**  Store the encryption key *separately* from the repository and the system being backed up.  Use a secure password manager, a hardware security module (HSM), or a key management service (KMS).  *Never* store the key in plain text in a configuration file or version control system.
    *   **Encrypted Transfer:**  Use secure protocols for transferring backups to remote repositories (e.g., SSH, SFTP, HTTPS with TLS).  Borg's built-in SSH support is highly recommended.
    *   **Key Rotation:**  Implement a regular key rotation policy to limit the impact of a potential key compromise.  Borg supports key rotation.
    *   **Strong Passphrases:** Use strong, randomly generated passphrases for encryption keys.  Avoid using dictionary words or easily guessable phrases.
    * **Use Key Derivation Functions:** Borg uses key derivation functions (KDFs) like Argon2. Ensure the KDF parameters are set to sufficiently high values to make brute-forcing computationally expensive.
*   **Detective:**
    *   **Regular Backup Verification:**  Regularly test the integrity and restorability of backups to ensure that the encryption is working correctly and that the data can be decrypted.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity that might indicate an attempt to intercept backup data in transit.
    *   **Audit Key Access:**  Log and monitor access to encryption keys to detect any unauthorized attempts to retrieve them.

#### 4.2.4 Residual Risk Assessment

After implementing these mitigations, the residual risk is **Low to Medium**.  The likelihood of successful exploitation is significantly reduced due to the use of strong encryption and secure key management.  The impact remains potentially high, but the difficulty of exploitation is increased. The medium rating accounts for the inherent risk associated with key management.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Implement Least Privilege:**  Immediately review and enforce the principle of least privilege for all Borg configuration files and repository directories.  Use `600` permissions for configuration files and restrict access to the repository directory to the Borg user.
2.  **Enable Strong Encryption:**  Ensure that all Borg repositories are encrypted using a strong, recommended algorithm (e.g., `repokey-blake2`).  Never use `--encryption=none`.
3.  **Secure Key Management:**  Implement a robust key management system.  Store encryption keys securely, separately from the repository and the backed-up system.  Use a password manager, HSM, or KMS.
4.  **Secure Transfer:**  Always use SSH or another secure protocol for transferring backups to remote repositories.
5.  **Automated Configuration Management:**  Use a configuration management tool to enforce secure configurations and prevent manual errors.
6.  **File Integrity Monitoring:**  Implement FIM to monitor the Borg configuration file and repository directory for unauthorized changes.
7.  **Regular Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to review permissions, encryption settings, and key management practices.
8.  **Regular Backup Verification:**  Regularly test the integrity and restorability of backups.
9. **Training:** Ensure the development team is trained on secure BorgBackup configuration and best practices.
10. **Documentation:** Document all security configurations and procedures related to BorgBackup.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of attackers tampering with Borg configuration files and compromising the security of the backup system. The most critical actions are enforcing least privilege, enabling strong encryption, and implementing secure key management.
