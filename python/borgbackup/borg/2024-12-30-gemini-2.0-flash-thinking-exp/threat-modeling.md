### High and Critical Borg Backup Threats

This list details high and critical threats directly involving Borg Backup.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Borg Repository
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Borg repository where backups are stored. This could involve exploiting weak repository passwords configured within Borg, compromised SSH keys used by Borg for remote repositories, or vulnerabilities in `borg serve` if used. The attacker might then download, modify, or delete backup data using Borg commands.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application data, potential data corruption or deletion leading to inability to restore, and compromise of historical data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Borg Repository (file system interactions managed by Borg), `borg serve` (if used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unique passphrases for repository encryption configured with `borg init`.
        *   Securely manage SSH keys used by Borg for accessing remote repositories (use key-based authentication, restrict key permissions, use passphrases for keys).
        *   If using `borg serve`, ensure it is properly configured with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for suspicious Borg activity.

*   **Threat:** Borg Repository Corruption
    *   **Description:** The Borg repository becomes corrupted due to software bugs within Borg itself that lead to data corruption during backup or maintenance operations. This corruption can make backups unusable or lead to data loss during restoration attempts using Borg.
    *   **Impact:** Inability to restore backups using Borg, leading to significant data loss and potential business disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Borg Repository (repository format, data storage mechanisms within Borg).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly verify the integrity of the Borg repository using `borg check --repair`.
        *   Keep Borg updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes.
        *   Consider backing up the Borg repository itself using a different method to mitigate catastrophic Borg-related corruption.

*   **Threat:** Loss of Borg Repository Encryption Key/Passphrase
    *   **Description:** The encryption key or passphrase used to protect the Borg repository (configured within Borg) is lost or forgotten. Without the correct key, Borg cannot decrypt and restore the backups.
    *   **Impact:** Permanent loss of all backup data managed by Borg, rendering the backups useless.
    *   **Affected Component:** Borg Encryption Module (`borg init --encryption`, key management within Borg).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store the encryption key/passphrase in a password manager or dedicated secrets management system.
        *   Create and securely store backup copies of the encryption key/passphrase in a separate, secure location.
        *   Consider using key files instead of passphrases for potentially stronger security managed by Borg.

*   **Threat:** Weak Borg Repository Encryption Passphrase
    *   **Description:** A weak or easily guessable passphrase is used to encrypt the Borg repository when initializing it with Borg. An attacker could potentially brute-force the passphrase using Borg itself or tools that interact with the Borg repository format.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backup data managed by Borg, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Borg Encryption Module (`borg init --encryption`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong passphrase policies when initializing Borg repositories.
        *   Use a password generator to create strong, random passphrases for Borg.
        *   Consider using key files instead of passphrases for stronger security within Borg.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Borg Client
    *   **Description:** The system running the Borg client is compromised, allowing an attacker to directly interact with Borg. This allows the attacker to manipulate backup processes using Borg commands, potentially deleting backups, modifying backup configurations within Borg, or creating malicious backups.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, corrupted backups created or modified by Borg, and compromise of the backup infrastructure managed by Borg.
    *   **Affected Component:** Borg Client (`borg create`, `borg delete`, configuration files used by Borg).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the system running the Borg client (keep OS and software updated, install security software, restrict user privileges).
        *   Implement strong access controls on the Borg client system.
        *   Regularly scan the Borg client system for malware.
        *   Use dedicated, hardened systems for Borg backup operations.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Borg Communication
    *   **Description:** If Borg is configured to communicate with a remote repository without using SSH (which Borg strongly recommends), an attacker could intercept the communication and potentially steal the encryption key used by Borg or manipulate backup data in transit between the Borg client and repository.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of the encryption key used by Borg, allowing unauthorized access to backups, or corruption of backup data managed by Borg.
    *   **Affected Component:** Borg Communication (network transport used by Borg, potentially `borg serve`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use SSH for secure communication with remote Borg repositories. This is the recommended and most secure method for remote Borg operations.
        *   Verify the authenticity of the remote repository host when configuring Borg.

*   **Threat:** Injection Vulnerabilities in Borg Command Execution
    *   **Description:** If the application constructs Borg commands dynamically using untrusted input and then executes these commands using the Borg client, an attacker could inject malicious commands that are executed by Borg, potentially leading to unintended actions on the repository or the client system.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution via the Borg client, potentially leading to repository corruption, data breaches, or denial of service affecting Borg operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Borg Client (command-line interface).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing Borg commands dynamically using untrusted input.
        *   If dynamic command construction is absolutely necessary, carefully sanitize and validate all input before passing it to the Borg client.
        *   Explore alternative methods of interacting with Borg programmatically that avoid direct command execution if possible.

*   **Threat:** Outdated Borg Version with Known Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of Borg that contains known security vulnerabilities within the Borg software itself. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the Borg client or repository directly.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of backup data managed by Borg, unauthorized access to the repository via Borg vulnerabilities, or denial of service affecting Borg functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** All Borg components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Borg to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for Borg to stay informed about potential threats.
        *   Implement a process for testing and deploying Borg updates.
