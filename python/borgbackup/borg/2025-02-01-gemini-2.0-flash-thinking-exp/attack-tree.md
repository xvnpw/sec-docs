## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Borg Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_borg_configuration_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigurations in how BorgBackup is set up and managed. This path is high-risk because configuration weaknesses are often easier to identify and exploit than software vulnerabilities, and they can directly lead to critical impacts like data breaches.

    *   **2.1. Weak Repository Passwords/Keyfiles [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Threat:** Using easily guessable passwords or failing to adequately protect repository keyfiles.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Full access to backups, data breach)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Enforce strong repository passwords.
            *   Utilize keyfiles for authentication instead of passwords where possible.
            *   Implement password complexity requirements and regular password rotation.
            *   Securely store keyfiles with restricted access.
            *   Monitor for brute-force attempts and implement rate limiting.

        *   **2.1.1. Brute-force Repository Password [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Repeatedly guessing passwords to gain access.
            *   **Mitigations:** Strong passwords, rate limiting, account lockout.

        *   **2.1.2. Dictionary Attack on Repository Password [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Using lists of common passwords to guess the repository password.
            *   **Mitigations:** Strong passwords, password complexity requirements, avoiding common or predictable passwords.

        *   **2.1.3. Keyfile Theft/Exposure [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Stealing or finding exposed keyfiles due to insecure storage or accidental disclosure.
            *   **Mitigations:** Secure keyfile storage, access control lists, avoiding committing keyfiles to version control, encryption of keyfiles at rest.

    *   **2.2. Insecure Repository Permissions [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Threat:** Setting overly permissive file system permissions on the Borg repository directory and files, allowing unauthorized access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (but misconfigurations happen)
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Full access to backups, data breach)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Restrict repository directory and file permissions to only authorized users and processes.
            *   Regularly audit repository permissions.
            *   Apply the principle of least privilege.

        *   **2.2.1. World-Readable Repository Directory [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Setting repository directory permissions to be readable by any user on the system.
            *   **Mitigations:** Restrict permissions to authorized users/groups only.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Logic via Borg Integration](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_logic_via_borg_integration.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code that integrates with BorgBackup. This path is high-risk because application-specific code is often less rigorously tested than Borg itself, and vulnerabilities here can directly compromise the application and its data.

    *   **3.1. Vulnerabilities in Application's Borg Integration Code [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Threat:** Flaws in the application's code that interacts with Borg, leading to command injection, credential exposure, or other security issues.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Application compromise, data breach, code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigations:**
            *   Thoroughly review and test application integration code.
            *   Apply secure coding practices.
            *   Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration testing.

        *   **3.1.1. Improper Input Sanitization when Calling Borg [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] --> Root: Compromise Application via BorgBackup Exploitation**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Failing to sanitize user-supplied or external data before passing it to Borg commands, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.
            *   **Mitigations:** Sanitize all inputs passed to Borg commands, use parameterized commands or secure libraries to construct commands, avoid shell execution where possible.

        *   **3.1.2. Storing Borg Credentials Insecurely in Application [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] --> Root: Compromise Application via BorgBackup Exploitation**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Storing Borg repository passwords or keyfiles in plaintext configuration files, environment variables with broad access, or other insecure locations within the application.
            *   **Mitigations:** Securely store Borg credentials using dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), environment variables with restricted access, or encrypted configuration files.

    *   **3.2. Data Exfiltration via Backup Access [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Threat:** Gaining unauthorized access to the Borg repository and extracting sensitive application data from backups. This is the ultimate goal of many attacks targeting backup systems.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if configuration or integration weaknesses exist)
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Data breach, confidentiality loss)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (after initial access is gained)

            *   Monitor for unusual backup access patterns.

        *   **3.2.1. Unauthorized Access to Backed-up Application Data [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] <-- 2.1. Weak Repository Passwords/Keyfiles [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weak repository passwords or keyfiles to gain access and download backups.
            *   **Mitigations:** Refer to mitigations for "2.1. Weak Repository Passwords/Keyfiles" and "3.2. Data Exfiltration via Backup Access".

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Attacks Targeting Borg Users](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_attacks_targeting_borg_users.md)

        *   **4.1.1. Spear Phishing Emails Targeting Admins [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] --> 3.2.1. Unauthorized Access to Backed-up Application Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Sending targeted phishing emails to administrators responsible for Borg backups to steal repository credentials.
