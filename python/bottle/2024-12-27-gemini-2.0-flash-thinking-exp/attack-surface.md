Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving Bottle and with High or Critical risk severity:

* **Path Traversal via Dynamic Routes**
    * **Description:** Attackers can manipulate dynamically routed parameters to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
    * **How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle's flexible routing allows defining routes with parameters that can be directly used in file system operations. If not validated, these parameters can be manipulated.
    * **Example:** A route defined as `/static/<filepath:path>` and a request like `/static/../../etc/passwd` could potentially expose sensitive system files if `filepath` is not sanitized before use in `open()` or similar functions.
    * **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive files, potential for arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate the dynamic route parameters to ensure they conform to expected patterns and do not contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`).
        * **Whitelisting:**  Instead of blacklisting, explicitly whitelist allowed file paths or patterns.
        * **Use Secure File Handling Functions:** Employ functions that prevent path traversal, or operate within a restricted directory.

* **Template Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)**
    * **Description:**  If user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser.
    * **How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle integrates with various templating engines. If developers don't use the engine's escaping mechanisms correctly when rendering dynamic content, it creates an XSS vulnerability.
    * **Example:** Using a templating engine like Jinja2, if a variable `user_input` from the request is rendered as `{{ user_input }}` without proper escaping, an attacker could submit `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` as input, leading to script execution in the user's browser.
    * **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Auto-Escaping:** Enable the auto-escaping feature of the chosen templating engine.
        * **Explicitly Escape Output:**  Manually escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates using the engine's escaping functions (e.g., `{{ user_input | escape }}` in Jinja2).
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

* **File Upload Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:**  Insecure handling of file uploads can lead to various attacks, including arbitrary code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
    * **How Bottle Contributes:** Bottle provides mechanisms for handling file uploads through the `request.files` object. The framework itself doesn't enforce security measures, leaving it to the developer.
    * **Example:**  If uploaded files are saved to disk without proper validation of file type or name, an attacker could upload a malicious script (e.g., a PHP file) and then access it directly to execute it on the server. Another example is not limiting file size, leading to potential DoS.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, storage exhaustion, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Validate File Types:**  Verify the file's content type based on its magic number (file signature) rather than relying solely on the `Content-Type` header.
        * **Sanitize File Names:**  Rename uploaded files to prevent path traversal and execution of malicious scripts.
        * **Limit File Size:**  Enforce maximum file size limits to prevent denial of service.
        * **Store Uploads Outside Web Root:**  Store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible by the web server.
        * **Implement Virus Scanning:** Scan uploaded files for malware before processing them.
