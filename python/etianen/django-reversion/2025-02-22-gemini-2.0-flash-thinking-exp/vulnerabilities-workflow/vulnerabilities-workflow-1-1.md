## Vulnerability List:

- **No high or critical vulnerabilities found**

After a detailed security review of the django-reversion project, specifically considering potential vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker on a publicly accessible instance, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were identified that meet the specified criteria.

The analysis considered common web application vulnerability types, but none were found within django-reversion that:
- Are valid and not already mitigated.
- Achieve a vulnerability rank of high or critical.
- Are not excluded due to being:
    - Caused by developer-introduced insecure code patterns within the project files.
    - Solely due to missing documentation for mitigation.
    - Denial of service vulnerabilities.

django-reversion demonstrates good security practices by leveraging Django's built-in security mechanisms and following secure development principles.  While continuous security monitoring and audits are always recommended, the current assessment indicates that django-reversion, when deployed in a publicly accessible instance, does not present any readily apparent high or critical vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers according to the defined scope and criteria.
