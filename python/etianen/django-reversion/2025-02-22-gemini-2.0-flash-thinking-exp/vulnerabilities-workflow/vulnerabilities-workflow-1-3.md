Okay, I understand the instructions. Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you want me to process. I will then filter and update the list according to your specifications and return it in markdown format.

**Please paste the list of vulnerabilities here so I can start working on it.**

Once you provide the list, I will:

1. **Analyze each vulnerability** based on your inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2. **Filter out** the vulnerabilities that do not meet the requirements.
3. **Keep the descriptions** of the included vulnerabilities.
4. **Format the output** as a markdown list, maintaining the structure for each vulnerability (vulnerability name, description, impact, rank, mitigations, etc.).

I am ready to process your list as soon as you provide it.
