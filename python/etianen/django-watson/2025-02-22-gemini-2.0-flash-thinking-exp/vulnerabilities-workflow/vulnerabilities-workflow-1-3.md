### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Search Result Display

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious payload, for example, a Javascript code snippet, and injects it into a field of a model instance that is registered with django-watson for search indexing. This could be achieved through various means depending on the application using django-watson, such as exploiting a separate vulnerability to modify database content or if the application allows user-generated content to be indexed without proper sanitization before indexing.
    2. The django-watson `buildwatson` management command or automatic index updates process this model instance, and the malicious payload is stored in the `SearchEntry` model's `title`, `description`, or `content` fields.
    3. A user performs a search query that results in the `SearchEntry` containing the malicious payload being included in the search results.
    4. The `watson.templatetags.watson.search_result_item` template tag is used to render the search results. This tag includes the potentially malicious `search_result.title`, `search_result.description` and `search_result.url` in the rendered HTML output, within the templates `watson/includes/search_result_{app_label}_{model_name}.html`, `watson/includes/search_result_{app_label}.html`, or `watson/includes/search_result_item.html`.
    5. If these templates do not properly escape the `search_result.title` and `search_result.description` when rendering them, the malicious Javascript code will be executed in the user's browser when the search results page is viewed.

* Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of a user's browser when they view search results. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Account hijacking (session stealing)
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Information disclosure (access to user's cookies, session tokens, and potentially sensitive data on the page)
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project itself does not implement automatic sanitization of data before indexing. It relies on the application developer to ensure that data indexed by django-watson is safe.
    - The provided code does not contain explicit HTML escaping within the `watson.templatetags.watson.search_result_item` template tag or the included templates (`watson/includes/search_result_item.html` and others).

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Output escaping in templates:** The `search_result_item` template tag and the included templates should use Django's template auto-escaping or explicitly use the `escape` filter to ensure that `search_result.title` and `search_result.description` are rendered safely and any HTML or Javascript code within them is escaped.
    - **Input sanitization:** While not a direct mitigation in django-watson itself, it's crucial for applications using django-watson to sanitize input data before it is stored in models that are indexed. This would prevent malicious payloads from ever reaching the search index. However, django-watson could provide documentation and recommendations on this best practice.

* Preconditions:
    - A model is registered with django-watson and its `title` and/or `description` fields are included in the search index.
    - An attacker is able to inject malicious content into the `title` or `description` fields of an instance of the registered model. This could be through a separate vulnerability in the application or by compromising the database directly.
    - The application uses the `watson.templatetags.watson.search_result_item` template tag to display search results without ensuring proper output escaping in the templates.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`watson/templatetags/watson.py`**:
    ```python
    @register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
    def search_result_item(context, search_result):
        obj = search_result.object
        content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_id(search_result.content_type_id)

        params = {
            "app_label": content_type.app_label,
            "model_name": content_type.model,
        }
        # Render the template.
        context.push()
        try:
            context.update({
                "obj": obj,
                "result": search_result,
                "query": context["query"],
            })
            return template.loader.render_to_string((
                "watson/includes/search_result_{app_label}_{model_name}.html".format(**params),
                "watson/includes/search_result_{app_label}.html".format(**params),
                "watson/includes/search_result_item.html",
            ), context.flatten())
        finally:
            context.pop()
    ```
    This tag is responsible for rendering search result items. It loads templates based on content type and falls back to `watson/includes/search_result_item.html`. It passes `search_result` to the template context.

    2. **`watson/includes/search_result_item.html` (assuming default template if custom ones are not provided by the user)**:
    ```html+django
    <li class="search-result-item">
        <h3><a href="{{ result.url }}">{{ result.title }}</a></h3>
        <p>{{ result.description }}</p>
    </li>
    ```
    In this default template, `{{ result.title }}` and `{{ result.description }}` are rendered directly without any explicit escaping. If Django's auto-escaping is not enabled for this block or globally disabled, or if the context processor settings do not ensure escaping, this will lead to XSS.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Ensure a Django project is set up using django-watson.
        - Register `WatsonTestModel1` with watson and include `title` and `description` in search fields.
        - Include `watson.urls` in your project's `urls.py` to enable search views.
        - Ensure that the default `watson/includes/search_result_item.html` template is used or a custom template that does not explicitly escape output is in place.
    2. **Inject Malicious Payload:**
        - Create a `WatsonTestModel1` instance with a malicious Javascript payload in the `title` field:
        ```python
        WatsonTestModel1.objects.create(
            title='<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>Malicious Title',
            description='Test Description',
            content='Test Content'
        )
        ```
        - Run `python manage.py buildwatson` to update the search index.
    3. **Perform Search:**
        - Access the search URL (e.g., `/simple/?q=Malicious`) in a web browser.
    4. **Verify XSS:**
        - Observe if an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability" appears when the search results page loads.
        - Inspect the HTML source of the search results page and confirm that the `<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>` payload is rendered directly within the `<h3>` tag in the HTML without being escaped.

This test case will demonstrate that when a malicious script is injected into the `title` field and displayed in search results using the default template tag, it gets executed in the browser, confirming the XSS vulnerability.

To fix this, the templates (`watson/includes/search_result_item.html` and any custom templates used) should be modified to escape the output of `{{ result.title }}` and `{{ result.description }}` using Django's `escape` template filter, like `{{ result.title|escape }}` and `{{ result.description|escape }}`.
