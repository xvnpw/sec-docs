Okay, I understand the instructions. You've provided an initial assessment stating no high or critical vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria were found.  Based on your instructions, I will treat this initial assessment as the starting point and "update" it according to your rules.

Since the initial assessment already concludes that there are no vulnerabilities meeting the criteria, and you haven't provided any vulnerabilities to *remove* or *modify*, the "updated" list will essentially be a re-statement of the initial assessment, formatted in markdown and emphasizing the reasons why no vulnerabilities are listed according to your instructions.

Here's the updated list based on your instructions and the initial assessment:

## Vulnerability List

Based on the criteria provided, there are no vulnerabilities to list for the publicly available instance of the application.

The initial assessment correctly states that after a thorough review, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were identified that:

*   Are caused by the project code itself (and not by developers using the project in an insecure way).
*   Are not already mitigated.
*   Are not Denial of Service vulnerabilities.
*   Are not solely due to missing documentation.

Therefore, according to the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, there are no vulnerabilities to report in the requested format.

**Explanation based on the provided criteria:**

*   **Exclusion Criteria are met for all potential high/critical vulnerabilities:**  The initial assessment implies that any potential high/critical issues either fall under the exclusion criteria (developer misuse, documentation, DoS) or are already mitigated, or simply don't exist within the project's code itself when considering an external attacker.
*   **Inclusion Criteria are not met:**  As no vulnerabilities are listed, it means no vulnerabilities meet the inclusion criteria of being valid, not mitigated, and ranked high or critical *after* applying the exclusion criteria.

**In summary:**  The "updated" list is essentially confirming the initial assessment's conclusion because, based on the provided instructions and the initial information, there are no vulnerabilities that qualify to be listed. If there *were* vulnerabilities that met the criteria, they would be listed in the markdown format as you described.
