- **Vulnerability Name:** Unrestricted Full-Text Search Information Disclosure  
  - **Description:**  
    - The project exposes full‐text search endpoints (both HTML and JSON) without any authentication or authorization checks.  
    - An external attacker can easily submit an HTTP GET request (for example, to `/watson/json/?q=test`) and receive a JSON response containing search results.  
    - Because django‐watson is designed to index data from every model registered with it, if a developer registers any models that include sensitive or non‐public data, an attacker might retrieve that data without needing to authenticate.  
    - In short, the lack of access control on the search endpoints enables any remote user to trigger the search functionality and receive potentially sensitive details.  
  - **Impact:**  
    - **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive or private data (if indexed) may be exposed to an unauthenticated attacker.  
    - **Data Enumeration:** The attacker can learn about the underlying models and indexed fields, providing insight into the application’s internal data structure that may aid in further attacks.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - No access control or filtering is implemented on the search endpoints. The views in `/code/watson/views.py` simply retrieve and return search data without verifying user credentials or permissions.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - **Access Control:** Implement authentication or authorization checks so that only permitted users can invoke the search endpoints.  
    - **Sensitive Data Filtering:** Ensure that only data intended for public consumption is indexed (or redacted) before it is returned in search results.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The search endpoints (e.g. `/watson/` and `/watson/json/`) are publicly accessible.  
    - Models containing sensitive or confidential fields are registered with django‑watson and are being indexed without any additional filtering or masking.  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `/code/watson/urls.py`, the search functionality is exposed via two URL patterns:
      - `re_path("^$", search, name="search")`  
      - `re_path("^json/$", search_json, name="search_json")`  
    - In `/code/watson/views.py`, the `SearchMixin.get_query()` method reads the query parameter (named by default “q”) directly from the GET request without any authentication logic.  
    - The `SearchApiView.render_to_response()` method then serializes the search results (which include fields like title, description, url, and meta) into JSON and returns them verbatim.  
    - There is no code in these modules that checks whether the requestor is authorized to retrieve the displayed content.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    - **Step 1:** From an external, unauthenticated machine (or using a tool such as curl or Postman), submit an HTTP GET request to the JSON search endpoint. For example:  
      ```
      curl -X GET "https://<public-instance-domain>/watson/json/?q=test"
      ```  
    - **Step 2:** Examine the HTTP response. Confirm that the response’s `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json; charset=utf-8` and that the body contains a JSON object with a “results” array.  
    - **Step 3:** Analyze the returned search results to determine whether they include any data from models that might be sensitive or not intended for public disclosure.  
    - **Step 4:** Report that the absence of any access control has enabled the disclosure of potentially sensitive indexed data.

This vulnerability highlights that, without proper access protection—and if developers inadvertently register sensitive models—the application can be used by any remote attacker to retrieve internal data.
