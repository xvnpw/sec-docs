## DEPLOYMENT

Possible deployment solutions:

2.  Multi-Node Deployment: Airflow components are distributed across multiple machines. Provides better scalability and reliability.
3.  Kubernetes Deployment: Airflow components are deployed as containers within a Kubernetes cluster. Offers high scalability, fault tolerance, and resource efficiency. This is the most common and recommended approach for production.
4.  Cloud-Based Deployment: Using managed Airflow services offered by cloud providers (e.g., AWS MWAA, Google Cloud Composer, Astronomer). Simplifies deployment and management.

## BUILD

The build process for Apache Airflow involves several steps, from development to packaging and distribution. It leverages tools like `tox`, `pytest`, and `pre-commit` for testing and code quality, and builds Docker images for containerized deployments.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer: Developers write code and commit it to the repository.
2.  Commit Code: Code is committed to the version control system (Git).
3.  pre-commit Hooks: pre-commit hooks run automatically before each commit, enforcing code style, checking for common errors, and running linters.
    *   security control: Enforces coding standards and best practices.
    *   security control: Prevents committing secrets or sensitive information.
4.  Run Tox: Tox is used to create isolated virtual environments for testing against different Python versions and configurations.
    *   security control: Ensures consistent testing environments.
5.  Run Unit Tests (pytest): Pytest is used to run unit tests, verifying the functionality of individual components.
    *   security control: Detects bugs early in the development cycle.
6.  Run Integration Tests: Integration tests verify the interaction between different components of Airflow.
    *   security control: Ensures that components work together correctly.
7.  Run Static Analysis (mypy, flake8): Static analysis tools like mypy (type checking) and flake8 (style checking) are used to identify potential issues and enforce code quality.
    *   security control: Improves code quality and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities.
8.  Build Packages (wheels, sdist): If all tests pass, Python packages (wheels and source distributions) are built.
9.  Build Docker Images: Docker images are built for various Airflow components (web server, scheduler, worker, etc.).
    *   security control: Uses base images from trusted sources.
    *   security control: Minimizes the attack surface by including only necessary components.
10. Publish Packages: Python packages are published to PyPI (Python Package Index).
11. Publish Docker Images: Docker images are published to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Quay.io).
    *   security control: Images are scanned for vulnerabilities before publishing.
