## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for DAG Authors (Airflow RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_dag_authors__airflow_rbac_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for DAG Authors (using Airflow RBAC)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify DAG Requirements:** For each DAG, list the required Airflow resources (Connections, Variables, Pools).
2.  **Create Custom Roles:** Define custom Airflow RBAC roles within Airflow's UI or via code.  Each role should grant *only* the permissions identified in step 1.  Avoid using "Admin" or "User" roles for DAG authors.  Example: Create a role "DAG_Author_ProjectX" with access only to specific connections and variables related to Project X.
3.  **Assign Roles:** Assign the appropriate custom role to each DAG author based on the DAGs they manage.  This is done through the Airflow UI or programmatically.
4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically (e.g., quarterly) review the assigned roles and permissions within Airflow's UI to ensure they remain aligned with DAG requirements. Revoke unnecessary permissions.
5.  **Audit Logs:** Enable and monitor Airflow's audit logs (if configured) to track role assignments and permission changes.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious DAG Code Execution (Severity: High):** A DAG author intentionally introduces malicious code.
*   **Accidental DAG Code Errors (Severity: Medium):** A DAG author unintentionally introduces code that causes issues.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** A DAG author attempts to steal data through the DAG.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** A DAG author exploits vulnerabilities to gain higher Airflow privileges.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious DAG Code Execution:** Reduces the damage potential; code can only access limited resources.
*   **Accidental DAG Code Errors:** Limits the scope of damage to accessible resources.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Restricts exfiltratable data to what's accessible via the role.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Makes privilege escalation harder, starting from limited permissions.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Custom roles exist for some projects, but not consistently applied. Audit logs are enabled.

**Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive review of all DAG author roles and permissions is needed.  Standardized process for creating/assigning roles based on DAG requirements needs formalization and enforcement.  The "User" role is still used in some cases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review and Static Analysis of DAGs (Integrated with Airflow CI/CD)](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_and_static_analysis_of_dags__integrated_with_airflow_cicd_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Code Review and Static Analysis of DAGs (integrated with Airflow's deployment process)

**Description:**
1.  **Establish Code Review Guidelines:** Create guidelines outlining security checks for DAG code reviews (no hardcoded secrets, input validation, secure libraries).
2.  **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Enforce a policy requiring all DAG code changes to be reviewed before deployment. Use a version control system (Git) with pull requests.
3.  **Integrate Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate static analysis tools (`pylint`, `flake8`, `bandit`) into the CI/CD pipeline *that deploys DAGs to Airflow*. Configure tools to flag security issues.
4.  **Automated Checks:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically run static analysis on every code commit. Fail the build (and prevent DAG deployment) if security violations are detected.
5.  **Regular Tool Updates:** Keep static analysis tools and rule sets up-to-date.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious DAG Code Injection (Severity: High):** Code review helps identify malicious code.
*   **Accidental Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium):** Static analysis catches common coding errors.
*   **Vulnerable Libraries (Severity: Medium):** Static analysis can detect vulnerable libraries.
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: High):** Static analysis and code review can identify potential SQL injection.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious DAG Code Injection:** Reduces the likelihood of malicious code reaching production.
*   **Accidental Vulnerabilities:** Reduces vulnerabilities from coding errors.
*   **Vulnerable Libraries:** Provides early warning of vulnerable libraries.
*   **SQL Injection:** Reduces the risk of SQL injection attacks.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Code reviews are generally performed, but not always with a strong security focus. `pylint` is used, but `bandit` and other security tools are not integrated into the CI/CD pipeline that deploys to Airflow.

**Missing Implementation:**  Formal security guidelines for code reviews are needed. `bandit` and other security-focused static analysis tools should be integrated into the Airflow deployment pipeline. The pipeline should fail builds with security violations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [DAG Isolation (Using Airflow Executors)](./mitigation_strategies/dag_isolation__using_airflow_executors_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** DAG Isolation using Airflow Executors (e.g., `KubernetesExecutor`)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose an Executor:** Select an Airflow executor that supports isolation: `KubernetesExecutor` or `CeleryKubernetesExecutor`.
2.  **Create Docker Images:** For each DAG (or group), create a Docker image with all dependencies. Avoid a single, monolithic image.
3.  **Configure Executor:** Configure the chosen executor within Airflow (via `airflow.cfg` or environment variables) to use the Docker images. Specify the image name, environment variables, and resource limits.
4.  **Test Isolation:** Thoroughly test DAGs within their isolated containers.
5.  **Regular Image Updates:** Regularly update base images and dependencies in the Docker images.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Dependency Conflicts (Severity: Medium):** Prevents conflicts between DAGs.
*   **Task Interference (Severity: Medium):** Prevents tasks from affecting each other.
*   **Compromised Task Exploitation (Severity: High):** Limits the impact of a compromised task.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Allows setting resource limits for each container.

**Impact:**
*   **Dependency Conflicts:** Eliminates dependency conflicts.
*   **Task Interference:** Prevents task interference.
*   **Compromised Task Exploitation:** Reduces damage from a compromised task.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Prevents resource exhaustion.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. `KubernetesExecutor` is used; some DAGs have dedicated containers.

**Missing Implementation:**  Not all DAGs have dedicated Docker images. A consistent process for creating/managing Docker images for all DAGs is needed. Resource limits are not consistently enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Secrets (Using Airflow Secrets Backends)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_secrets__using_airflow_secrets_backends_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Secrets Management using Airflow Secrets Backends

**Description:**
1.  **Choose a Secrets Backend:** Select a secure secrets backend (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager).
2.  **Configure Airflow:** Configure Airflow (via `airflow.cfg` or environment variables) to use the chosen secrets backend.  This involves setting connection details for the backend.
3.  **Store Secrets:** Store *all* secrets in the secrets backend. *Never* store secrets in DAG code, environment variables (for sensitive secrets), or the Airflow metadata database.
4.  **Retrieve Secrets in DAGs:** Use Airflow's mechanisms (`Variable.get()`, `Connection.get_connection()`) to retrieve secrets from the backend within DAGs. Use operators that support retrieving credentials from connections.
5.  **Rotate Secrets:** Regularly rotate secrets.
6.  **Audit Access:** Monitor access to the secrets backend.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Secrets Exposure (Severity: High):** Prevents secrets from being exposed.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets (Severity: High):** Limits access to secrets.
*   **Credential Theft (Severity: High):** Makes credential theft harder.

**Impact:**
*   **Secrets Exposure:** Eliminates plain text secret exposure.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets:** Reduces unauthorized access risk.
*   **Credential Theft:** Makes theft much more difficult.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. AWS Secrets Manager is configured. Some DAGs use it, others have hardcoded credentials or use environment variables insecurely.

**Missing Implementation:**  Complete audit of all DAGs to remove hardcoded secrets/insecure environment variables. All DAGs must retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. Secret rotation process needs establishment and automation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Example DAGs (Airflow Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_example_dags__airflow_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Example DAGs in Production via Airflow Configuration

**Description:**
1. **Locate Configuration:** Find your `airflow.cfg` file or the environment variable settings for your Airflow deployment.
2. **Set `load_examples`:**  Set `load_examples = False` in `airflow.cfg` *or* set the environment variable `AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES=False`.
3. **Restart Airflow Components:** Restart the Airflow webserver and scheduler for the change to take effect.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Exposure of Example Code (Severity: Low):** Example DAGs might contain outdated or insecure code.
* **Unintentional Execution of Example DAGs (Severity: Low):** Prevents accidental triggering of example DAGs.

**Impact:**
* **Exposure of Example Code:** Removes potentially vulnerable example code.
* **Unintentional Execution:** Prevents accidental execution.

**Currently Implemented:** Yes. `load_examples` is set to `False` in the `airflow.cfg`.

**Missing Implementation:** None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of Airflow Webserver (HTTPS, Headers)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_airflow_webserver__https__headers_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Airflow Webserver Configuration (HTTPS, Security Headers)

**Description:**
1.  **HTTPS Only:** Configure the Airflow webserver (Gunicorn) to *only* accept HTTPS connections. Obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate. Configure Gunicorn to use this certificate.
2.  **Strong Ciphers:** Configure Gunicorn to use only strong cipher suites and TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.2 or 1.3).
3.  **HTTP Headers:** Configure Gunicorn (or a reverse proxy in front of it) to set security headers:
    *   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
    *   `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)
    *   `X-Frame-Options`
    *   `X-Content-Type-Options`
    *   `X-XSS-Protection`
4. **Authentication Backend:** Configure a secure authentication backend for Airflow (LDAP, OAuth, database with strong password policies).
5. **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Enforce MFA for all Airflow UI users.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Severity: High):** HTTPS prevents eavesdropping and tampering with traffic.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** CSP and `X-XSS-Protection` headers mitigate XSS.
*   **Clickjacking (Severity: Medium):** `X-Frame-Options` prevents clickjacking.
*   **MIME Sniffing Attacks (Severity: Low):** `X-Content-Type-Options` prevents MIME sniffing.
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Strong authentication and MFA prevent unauthorized login.

**Impact:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Eliminates the risk of traffic interception.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Significantly reduces XSS vulnerability.
*   **Clickjacking:** Prevents clickjacking attacks.
*   **MIME Sniffing Attacks:** Prevents MIME sniffing.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Makes unauthorized access much harder.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. HTTPS is enforced. Some security headers are set.

**Missing Implementation:**  A comprehensive review of all security headers is needed.  Stronger cipher suites need to be enforced. MFA is not universally enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit XCom Usage (Airflow Best Practices)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_xcom_usage__airflow_best_practices_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict XCom Usage and Size

**Description:**
1. **Minimize XCom Data:**  Only use XCom for small pieces of metadata (e.g., status flags, small IDs). Avoid passing large datasets through XCom.
2. **Use External Storage:** For large data transfers between tasks, use external storage (e.g., cloud storage like S3, GCS) and pass only the *reference* (e.g., file path) through XCom.
3. **Configure XCom Limits:**  Review and adjust Airflow's configuration settings related to XCom size limits (if available in your Airflow version) to prevent excessively large XCom values.
4. **Code Review:**  During code reviews, check for appropriate XCom usage.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Data Leakage via XCom (Severity: Medium):**  If XCom data is exposed (e.g., through the UI), limiting its size reduces the potential for sensitive data leakage.
* **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):**  Large XCom values can negatively impact Airflow's performance.
* **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Low):** Extremely large XCom values could potentially contribute to a DoS attack.

**Impact:**
* **Data Leakage via XCom:** Reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data exposed through XCom.
* **Performance Degradation:** Improves Airflow's performance and stability.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Minimizes the risk of DoS related to XCom.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Developers are generally aware of XCom limitations, but there isn't a formal policy or strict enforcement.

**Missing Implementation:**  A formal policy regarding XCom usage should be documented and enforced through code reviews. XCom size limits should be explicitly configured.
