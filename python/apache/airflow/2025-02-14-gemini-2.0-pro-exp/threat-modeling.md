# Threat Model Analysis for apache/airflow

## Threat: [DAG Code Injection via Airflow Features (e.g., Connections, Variables)](./threats/dag_code_injection_via_airflow_features__e_g___connections__variables_.md)

*   **Threat:** DAG Code Injection via *Airflow Features* (e.g., Connections, Variables)

    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages Airflow's own features, such as Connections or Variables, to inject malicious code.  For example, they might store a malicious script in a Variable intended to be used as a file path, or inject code into a Connection string that is later used by an operator to execute commands. This differs from the previous Git-based injection because it exploits *intended* Airflow functionality.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the Airflow environment and potentially connected systems.
        *   Data breaches, data loss, data corruption.
        *   System downtime and disruption of business processes.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Airflow Component:** DAG files (Python scripts), `DagBag` class, Operators that use Connections or Variables (especially custom operators), the process that parses and loads DAGs, and the rendering of templates within DAGs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**
            *   Strictly validate *all* user-provided input to Connections and Variables.  Do *not* assume that data stored in these features is safe.
            *   Use allow-lists rather than deny-lists for validation.  Define *exactly* what is permitted, and reject anything else.
            *   Consider the context in which the data will be used.  For example, if a Variable is supposed to be a file path, validate that it *is* a valid and safe file path.
        *   **Operator Security:**
            *   When developing custom operators, be extremely careful about how you use Connections and Variables.  Avoid directly executing code from these sources.
            *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases or other systems.
            *   Sanitize any data retrieved from Connections or Variables before using it in commands or scripts.
        *   **Template Security:**
            *   Be aware of the potential for template injection vulnerabilities when using Jinja2 templating in DAGs.
            *   Sanitize user-provided data before rendering it in templates.
            *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for rendering templates.
        *   **Least Privilege:**
            *   Ensure that Airflow workers run with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running them as root.
        *   **Secrets Backends:** Prefer using external secrets backends (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) over Airflow Variables for highly sensitive data.

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure via Environment Variables (within Airflow's control)](./threats/secrets_exposure_via_environment_variables__within_airflow's_control_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Secrets Exposure via Environment Variables (within Airflow's control)

    *   **Description:** While the general threat of environment variable exposure exists, this focuses on *Airflow's* role.  If Airflow operators (especially custom operators) are designed to *read* secrets from environment variables without proper safeguards, an attacker who compromises a worker (even with limited privileges) can access those secrets. This is distinct from a general system compromise; it's about how Airflow *uses* the environment.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Airflow Component:** Worker nodes; specifically, the environment in which tasks are executed. Custom operators that interact with environment variables are the primary concern. The `subprocess` module (if used insecurely) is a high-risk area.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secrets Management (Airflow-Specific):**
            *   **Strongly prefer** using Airflow's built-in secrets management features (Connections, Variables, and especially Secrets Backends) over environment variables for storing secrets.
            *   Educate developers on the risks of using environment variables for secrets within Airflow.
        *   **Operator Security:**
            *   *Never* design custom operators to directly read secrets from environment variables without a very strong justification and robust security measures.
            *   If environment variables *must* be used (e.g., for legacy compatibility), ensure they are:
                *   Accessed only through secure, well-vetted helper functions.
                *   Never logged or exposed in task output.
                *   Used in a way that minimizes the risk of exposure (e.g., short-lived processes).
        *   **Airflow Configuration:** Review `airflow.cfg` and ensure that no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed in environment variables set by Airflow itself.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via DAG Bomb (Exploiting Airflow's Scheduling)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_dag_bomb__exploiting_airflow's_scheduling_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service via DAG Bomb (Exploiting Airflow's Scheduling)

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a DAG specifically designed to overwhelm Airflow's scheduler or workers. This isn't just about general resource exhaustion; it's about exploiting Airflow's scheduling logic.  Examples include:
        *   DAGs with extremely high concurrency settings (`max_active_runs`, `max_active_tasks`).
        *   DAGs that create a massive number of tasks dynamically.
        *   DAGs that trigger external systems in a way that causes a cascading failure.
        *   DAGs that abuse `ExternalTaskSensor` or similar operators to create dependency loops or wait indefinitely.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Airflow scheduler or worker nodes become unresponsive or crash.
        *   Legitimate DAGs cannot be scheduled or executed.
        *   System downtime and disruption of business processes.
    *   **Affected Airflow Component:** Scheduler, Workers, Metadata Database. The scheduling loop, task execution engine, database connection pool, and inter-process communication mechanisms are all potential targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **DAG-Level Controls (Enforced):**
            *   Enforce *strict* limits on `max_active_runs` and `max_active_tasks` at the *Airflow configuration level*, preventing DAG authors from overriding them to dangerously high values.
            *   Implement a review process for any DAG that attempts to use high concurrency settings.
        *   **Resource Limits (Airflow-Specific):**
            *   Configure appropriate resource limits (CPU, memory) for Airflow *processes* (scheduler, workers) using settings like `worker_concurrency`, `parallelism`, and resource requests/limits in Kubernetes.  This is about limiting Airflow's *own* resource consumption, not just the tasks it runs.
        *   **Task Timeouts:**
            *   Enforce reasonable timeouts for *all* tasks, preventing them from running indefinitely and consuming resources.
        *   **Dynamic Task Generation Limits:**
            *   Implement safeguards to prevent DAGs from dynamically generating an unbounded number of tasks.  This might involve custom code or configuration to limit the scale of dynamic task creation.
        *   **Operator Review:**
            *   Carefully review custom operators for potential resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting (Airflow-Specific Metrics):**
            *   Monitor Airflow-specific metrics, such as the number of queued tasks, running tasks, scheduler heartbeat, and database connection pool usage.
            *   Set up alerts for anomalies that could indicate a DAG bomb attack.

## Threat: [Unauthorized DAG Triggering via Airflow API (Exploiting Airflow's Authentication/Authorization)](./threats/unauthorized_dag_triggering_via_airflow_api__exploiting_airflow's_authenticationauthorization_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unauthorized DAG Triggering via Airflow API (Exploiting Airflow's Authentication/Authorization)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Airflow's *own* API authentication or authorization mechanisms to trigger DAGs they should not have access to. This is distinct from a general API security issue; it's about how Airflow implements and enforces access control.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of unauthorized workflows.
        *   Potential for data breaches, data corruption, or system disruption, depending on the actions performed by the triggered DAGs.
    *   **Affected Airflow Component:** Airflow REST API, specifically the endpoints related to DAG runs and task instances. The authentication and authorization logic within Airflow (e.g., the `auth` module, RBAC configuration) is the critical area.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication (Airflow-Specific):**
            *   Use a robust authentication backend for the Airflow API (e.g., LDAP, OAuth, or a well-configured custom backend).  Avoid weak or default authentication methods.
            *   Enforce strong password policies.
            *   Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for API access, especially for privileged users.
        *   **RBAC (Airflow-Specific):**
            *   Implement *fine-grained* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Airflow to restrict API access based on user roles and permissions.
            *   Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
            *   Test RBAC thoroughly to ensure it is enforced correctly.
        *   **API Key Management (Airflow-Specific):**
            *   If using API keys, manage them securely:
                *   Generate unique keys for each user or application.
                *   Store keys securely (e.g., using a secrets management system).
                *   Regularly rotate keys.
                *   Implement mechanisms to revoke compromised keys.
        *   **Auditing (Airflow-Specific):**
            *   Enable detailed audit logging for all API requests, including information about the user, the endpoint accessed, and the result.  Ensure this logging is integrated with Airflow's logging system.

## Threat: [Unpatched Airflow Vulnerability Exploitation (Directly Affecting Airflow)](./threats/unpatched_airflow_vulnerability_exploitation__directly_affecting_airflow_.md)

*  **Threat:**  Unpatched Airflow Vulnerability Exploitation (Directly Affecting Airflow)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability *within Airflow itself* (or a core dependency that Airflow directly uses and exposes) to gain unauthorized access or control. This is about vulnerabilities in Airflow's codebase, not the surrounding infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Airflow Component:** Potentially any component of Airflow, depending on the vulnerability. This could include the webserver, scheduler, worker, database interactions, specific operators, or the API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a known, exploitable vulnerability exists and is unpatched)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patch Management (Prioritized for Airflow):**
            *   Prioritize patching Airflow and its *core* dependencies.  This is more critical than patching general system libraries (though those should also be patched).
            *   Establish a rapid response process for critical Airflow security updates.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Focused on Airflow):**
            *   Use vulnerability scanners that specifically target Airflow and its known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Monitoring (Airflow-Specific):**
            *   Actively monitor Airflow security advisories and CVE databases for vulnerabilities that directly affect Airflow.
            *   Subscribe to Airflow security mailing lists and community forums.

## Threat: [Metadata Database Compromise (Through Airflow Misconfiguration)](./threats/metadata_database_compromise__through_airflow_misconfiguration_.md)

* **Threat:** Metadata Database Compromise (Through Airflow Misconfiguration)

    * **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Airflow metadata database *because of a misconfiguration within Airflow itself*. This is distinct from a general database attack. Examples include:
        *   Airflow configured with a weak or default database password.
        *   Airflow configured to connect to a database without encryption.
        *   Airflow's database connection string exposed through a vulnerability in a custom operator or logging.
        *   Airflow configured with overly permissive database user privileges.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Complete control over the Airflow environment.
        *   Ability to modify DAGs, trigger tasks, and access sensitive data.
        *   Data breaches, data loss, data corruption.
        *   System downtime.
    * **Affected Airflow Component:** Metadata Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). The database connection configuration in `airflow.cfg` and the ORM used by Airflow (SQLAlchemy) are relevant. The security of custom operators that interact with the database is also critical.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Database Configuration (within `airflow.cfg`):**
            *   Use a *strong, unique, and randomly generated* password for the Airflow database user.  *Never* use a default password.
            *   Configure Airflow to connect to the database using encryption (TLS/SSL).
            *   Ensure the database connection string is *not* exposed in logs or error messages.
        *   **Least Privilege (Database User):**
            *   Grant the Airflow database user *only* the minimum necessary privileges within the database.  Avoid granting overly permissive roles (e.g., `superuser`).
        *   **Operator Security (Database Interactions):**
            *   If custom operators interact with the metadata database (or any database), ensure they use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
            *   Avoid exposing database connection details within custom operators.
        *   **Regular Audits (Airflow Configuration):**
            *   Regularly audit the `airflow.cfg` file and any environment variables related to database connectivity to ensure they are secure.
