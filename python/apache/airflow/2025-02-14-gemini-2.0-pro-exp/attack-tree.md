## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Airflow Core Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_airflow_core_components.md)

*   **Web UI Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **XSS/CSRF in UI [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web interface, while Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) allows attackers to trick users into performing actions they didn't intend.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Scheduler Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **DoS/Race Conditions [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks overwhelm the scheduler, preventing tasks from being scheduled. Race conditions can lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption due to concurrent access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

*   **Executor Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Code Execution in Scheduler/Executor [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into DAG definitions or tasks, which is then executed by the scheduler or executor without proper sandboxing. This is the most dangerous vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Airflow Providers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_airflow_providers.md)

*   **Weak Authentication (AWS S3 Bucket Access) [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Airflow's connection to an AWS S3 bucket uses weak or compromised credentials, allowing unauthorized access to data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Vulnerable Code (AWS Lambda Vulnerability) [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** An Airflow task uses a vulnerable AWS Lambda function, which the attacker exploits to gain access to other AWS resources.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Misconfiguration (AWS EC2 Misconfiguration) [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** An Airflow task interacts with a misconfigured AWS EC2 instance (e.g., open security groups), allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Leaked Credentials (AWS Secrets Manager) [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Airflow's access to AWS Secrets Manager is compromised (e.g., leaked API key), allowing retrieval of sensitive credentials.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Airflow Configuration & Deployment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_airflow_configuration_&_deployment.md)

*   **Weak Credentials (DB Creds) [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Airflow's connection to its metadata database uses weak or default credentials, allowing access to the database and potential modification of DAGs, tasks, or user accounts.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Exposed API (Web UI API Key) [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The Airflow web UI API is exposed to the internet without proper authentication or authorization, allowing attackers to control Airflow.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

*   **Default Credentials (Admin PW) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** The default Airflow administrator password is not changed, providing easy administrative access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
