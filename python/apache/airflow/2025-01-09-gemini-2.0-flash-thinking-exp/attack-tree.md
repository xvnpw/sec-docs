## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Webserver Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_webserver_vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Webserver Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the Airflow webserver to gain unauthorized access. This often involves exploiting weaknesses in authentication, authorization, or input handling.
*   **Why High-Risk:** The webserver is the primary interface for users and administrators, making it a readily accessible target. Successful exploitation can grant broad control over the Airflow environment.

    *   **Critical Node: Authentication Bypass**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to bypass the authentication mechanisms of the webserver. This can involve exploiting default credentials, vulnerabilities in the authentication logic, or brute-force attacks.
        *   **Why Critical:** Successful authentication bypass provides immediate and direct access to the Airflow web UI, allowing attackers to perform privileged actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Scheduler Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_scheduler_vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Scheduler Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to compromise the Airflow scheduler, which is responsible for orchestrating DAG execution. This often involves injecting malicious DAG definitions or manipulating the scheduler's state.
*   **Why High-Risk:** The scheduler controls the execution of workflows, making it a powerful target for introducing malicious code or disrupting operations.

    *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious DAGs**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers introduce new or modified DAG files containing malicious code into the locations monitored by the scheduler. This can be achieved by gaining write access to the DAGs folder or exploiting vulnerabilities in the web UI's DAG upload functionality.
        *   **Why Critical:** Malicious DAGs allow attackers to execute arbitrary code within the Airflow environment when the DAG is parsed and scheduled.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Worker Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_worker_vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Worker Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the Airflow worker processes, which are responsible for executing the tasks defined in DAGs. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities that allow for arbitrary code execution during task processing.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Compromising workers allows for direct execution of malicious code on the systems where tasks are run, potentially impacting connected systems and data.

    *   **Critical Node: Code Injection in Task Execution**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code into the parameters of DAG tasks or exploit vulnerabilities in custom operators or hooks used within tasks. When the worker executes the task, the injected code is also executed.
        *   **Why Critical:** Successful code injection allows for arbitrary code execution on the worker nodes, granting significant control over those systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Metadata Database](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_metadata_database.md)

**High-Risk Path: Compromise Metadata Database**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the metadata database used by Airflow to store configuration, DAG definitions, and other critical information.
*   **Why High-Risk:** The metadata database holds sensitive information and its compromise can lead to data breaches, manipulation of Airflow's behavior, and further attacks.

    *   **Critical Node: SQL Injection**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the web UI or API interactions with the database that allow for the injection of malicious SQL queries.
        *   **Why Critical:** Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to read, modify, or delete any data within the metadata database, including sensitive credentials and configuration.

    *   **Critical Node: Direct Database Access (if exposed)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain direct network access to the metadata database and exploit weak database credentials to access it directly.
        *   **Why Critical:** Direct access to the database grants full control over the stored data, allowing for exfiltration, modification, or deletion of critical information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Connections and Variables](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_connections_and_variables.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Connections and Variables**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to gain unauthorized access to the connection details and variables stored within Airflow, which often contain sensitive credentials for external systems.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Compromising connections and variables allows attackers to access and potentially compromise the external systems that Airflow interacts with.

    *   **Critical Node: Unauthorized Access to Credentials**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the web UI, API, or gain access to the metadata database to retrieve stored connection details and variables.
        *   **Why Critical:** Access to stored credentials allows attackers to impersonate Airflow and access sensitive resources on external systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit DAG File Storage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dag_file_storage.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit DAG File Storage**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the storage location of DAG files to introduce or modify malicious code.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Modifying DAG files provides a persistent mechanism for executing malicious code within the Airflow environment.

    *   **Critical Node: Modify Existing DAGs**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain write access to the DAGs folder and alter the content of existing DAG files to include malicious code.
        *   **Why Critical:** Modifying existing DAGs allows for the subtle introduction of malicious functionality into established workflows, making detection more difficult.

    *   **Critical Node: Introduce Malicious DAGs**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain write access to the DAGs folder and add new DAG files containing malicious code.
        *   **Why Critical:** Introducing new malicious DAGs provides a direct way to execute arbitrary code within the Airflow environment when the scheduler parses and runs them.
