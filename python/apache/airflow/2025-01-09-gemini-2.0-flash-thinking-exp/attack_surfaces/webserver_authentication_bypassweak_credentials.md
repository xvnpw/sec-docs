# Example usage (replace with actual Airflow configuration path)
# check_default_credentials("/path/to/airflow.cfg")

# Further code examples could include:
# - Scripts to test password complexity requirements if a custom authentication backend is used.
# - Basic scripts to send requests to the login endpoint with various payloads to check for vulnerabilities (requires ethical hacking considerations and proper authorization).
