# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/airflow

## Attack Surface: [Webserver Authentication Bypass/Weak Credentials](./attack_surfaces/webserver_authentication_bypassweak_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the web UI's authentication mechanism or leverage default/weak credentials to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow provides a web interface for managing and monitoring workflows. If authentication is not properly configured or vulnerabilities exist in the authentication implementation, it becomes a direct entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses default credentials (`airflow:airflow`) that were not changed after installation or exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of Flask-AppBuilder (a dependency) to bypass login.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the Airflow environment, including viewing sensitive data, modifying DAGs, triggering tasks, and potentially gaining access to underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Disable or change default credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Regularly update Airflow and its dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust authorization mechanisms using Airflow's RBAC or integration with external identity providers.
        *   Enforce HTTPS to protect credentials in transit.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious DAG Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_dag_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Python code into DAG definitions, which is then executed by the Airflow scheduler and workers.
    *   **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow relies on users defining workflows as Python code (DAGs). If the process for creating or updating DAGs is not secure, malicious code can be introduced. This can happen through direct file uploads, Git synchronization, or API interactions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with write access to the DAGs folder uploads a DAG that executes arbitrary shell commands on the worker nodes, granting them remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on Airflow worker nodes, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for DAG creation and modification.
        *   Use code review processes for all DAG changes.
        *   Employ static code analysis tools to detect potential security vulnerabilities in DAG code.
        *   Consider using Airflow's serialization features to limit the code execution context.
        *   Restrict the permissions of the Airflow user on worker nodes.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection through Operators](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_through_operators.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Airflow operators (especially those interacting with the operating system or external systems) by injecting malicious commands through user-controlled inputs.
    *   **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow operators are designed to interact with various systems. If operator parameters that accept user input are not properly sanitized, they can be exploited for command injection.
    *   **Example:** A DAG uses the `BashOperator` and takes user input for a filename without proper sanitization. An attacker provides an input like `; rm -rf /`, which would be executed on the worker node.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on Airflow worker nodes, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using operators that directly execute shell commands when possible.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided inputs to operators.
        *   Use parameterized queries or equivalent secure methods when interacting with databases or external systems.
        *   Implement input validation and output encoding.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Connections and Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_connections_and_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive connection details (usernames, passwords, API keys) are stored insecurely, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    *   **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow stores connection information to interact with external systems. If this storage is not properly secured, it becomes a target for attackers. This includes the backend database and potentially environment variables if not managed correctly.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Airflow metadata database and is able to decrypt connection details stored with a weak encryption key or find plaintext credentials in environment variables.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to access and potentially compromise connected systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Airflow's built-in connection management features and secure secrets backends (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager).
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in DAG code or environment variables.
        *   Ensure the Airflow metadata database is properly secured with strong encryption and access controls.
        *   Regularly rotate credentials.
