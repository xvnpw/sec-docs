# Threat Model Analysis for apache/airflow

## Threat: [Malicious DAG Code Injection](./threats/malicious_dag_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the DAGs folder (a component directly managed by Airflow) modifies an existing DAG file or creates a new one. The injected code, leveraging Python's capabilities within the Airflow environment, executes arbitrary commands on the worker nodes or the scheduler process. This could involve accessing sensitive environment variables, manipulating data pipelines for malicious purposes, or establishing reverse shells for persistent access within the Airflow infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Airflow environment and potentially connected systems. This includes data breaches, ransomware attacks, disruption of data pipelines, and unauthorized access to sensitive information managed by Airflow.
    *   **Affected Component:** DAG Files (a core Airflow concept), the `DAG` object parsing logic within the Scheduler, and the `BaseOperator` execution within the Scheduler and Workers (all integral parts of Airflow).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on the DAGs folder and related infrastructure that Airflow relies on.
        *   Enforce code reviews for all DAG changes within the development workflow interacting with Airflow.
        *   Utilize static code analysis tools and linters specifically configured to detect potential malicious code patterns in Airflow DAGs.
        *   Implement a secure CI/CD pipeline for DAG deployments, ensuring only authorized changes are deployed to the Airflow environment.
        *   Consider using Airflow's built-in mechanisms for DAG versioning and access control if available and sufficiently robust for your security requirements.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in DAG Definitions](./threats/credential_exposure_in_dag_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Developers unintentionally hardcode sensitive credentials, such as database passwords, API keys (used by Airflow operators), or SSH keys, directly within the Python code of DAG files. This could be in connection definitions, operator arguments (specific to Airflow operators), or even comments within the DAG code. An attacker gaining read access to these DAG files (through mechanisms interacting with Airflow's storage of DAGs) can extract these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external systems and resources that the Airflow instance directly interacts with through its operators and connections. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or further compromise of connected infrastructure managed by or accessed through Airflow.
    *   **Affected Component:** DAG Files (content of the Python files, a fundamental part of Airflow).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never hardcode credentials in Airflow DAG files.**
        *   Utilize Airflow's Connections feature and store credentials securely in the metadata database (an Airflow component) or a dedicated secrets backend integrated with Airflow.
        *   Use environment variables or Airflow Variables (with appropriate access controls within Airflow) to manage sensitive configuration used by DAGs.
        *   Implement code scanning tools to detect potential credential leaks in Airflow DAG files.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to the Airflow Webserver](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_the_airflow_webserver.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or default authentication configurations on the Airflow webserver (a core component of Airflow) – for example, using the default `airflow` example user or not configuring authentication backends like LDAP or OAuth2 within Airflow's settings – allow unauthorized users to access the Airflow UI.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can view sensitive DAG definitions, connection details stored within Airflow, trigger or stop DAG runs managed by Airflow, and potentially gain insights into the application's infrastructure and data pipelines orchestrated by Airflow. This can lead to operational disruption, data manipulation through Airflow, or further exploitation of the Airflow environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Airflow Webserver (authentication and authorization mechanisms, inherent to Airflow).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately disable or change default credentials for the Airflow webserver.**
        *   Configure a robust authentication backend (e.g., LDAP, OAuth2, OpenID Connect) within Airflow's security settings.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for Airflow webserver users.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security when accessing the Airflow UI.
        *   Restrict network access to the Airflow webserver based on IP address or network segments.

## Threat: [Compromise of Stored Connection Credentials](./threats/compromise_of_stored_connection_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** If the Airflow metadata database (where connection credentials are often stored) or the configured secrets backend (integrated with Airflow) is compromised (e.g., due to a database vulnerability in the Airflow metadata database, weak access controls to the database, or a compromised server hosting these components), attackers can gain access to these sensitive credentials managed by Airflow.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external systems and resources that the Airflow instance connects to, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or further compromise of those systems through the compromised Airflow credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** Airflow Metadata Database (a central component of Airflow), configured Secrets Backend (if used with Airflow).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Airflow metadata database with strong authentication, encryption at rest, and network segmentation.
        *   Utilize a dedicated and secure secrets backend to store connection credentials instead of relying solely on the Airflow metadata database.
        *   Implement strict access controls to the secrets backend integrated with Airflow.
        *   Regularly audit access to the Airflow metadata database and any configured secrets backend.

## Threat: [Compromise of Airflow Worker Nodes](./threats/compromise_of_airflow_worker_nodes.md)

*   **Description:** If Airflow worker nodes (the components executing tasks defined in Airflow DAGs) are not properly secured (e.g., unpatched operating systems, vulnerable software installed for Airflow task execution, insecure network configurations surrounding the Airflow worker pool), attackers can gain access to them.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Airflow worker nodes, data exfiltration from the worker nodes or from tasks being processed by Airflow, and potential use of the worker nodes for further attacks within the infrastructure supporting Airflow.
    *   **Affected Component:** Airflow Worker Nodes (the underlying infrastructure executing Airflow tasks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden worker node operating systems and keep them up-to-date with security patches relevant to the software used by Airflow workers.
        *   Implement network segmentation to isolate Airflow worker nodes.
        *   Use strong authentication and authorization for access to Airflow worker nodes.
        *   Regularly scan Airflow worker nodes for vulnerabilities.
