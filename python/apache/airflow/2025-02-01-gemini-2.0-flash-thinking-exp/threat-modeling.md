# Threat Model Analysis for apache/airflow

## Threat: [Weak Webserver Authentication](./threats/weak_webserver_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to the Airflow webserver by exploiting default or weak authentication. This allows them to control Airflow through the UI and API.
*   **Impact:** Full control of Airflow, including viewing sensitive data, modifying DAGs, triggering workflows, and potential infrastructure compromise.
*   **Affected Airflow Component:** Webserver (Authentication module)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication (OAuth 2.0, LDAP, Kerberos).
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Enable HTTPS.
    *   Disable default accounts.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Webserver UI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_webserver_ui.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the Airflow UI via user inputs. When other users view the UI, the script executes.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft, UI defacement, unauthorized actions within Airflow on behalf of victim users.
*   **Affected Airflow Component:** Webserver (UI components)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input sanitization and output encoding in the UI.
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   Regularly update Airflow to patch XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [DAG Parsing Code Execution](./threats/dag_parsing_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker crafts malicious DAG files to exploit parsing vulnerabilities, leading to code execution on the scheduler during DAG loading.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the scheduler server, full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Affected Airflow Component:** Scheduler (DAG parsing module)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict DAG folder access.
    *   Implement DAG code review.
    *   Run scheduler with least privilege.
    *   Update Airflow regularly.
    *   Consider DAG serialization.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Execution in Tasks](./threats/malicious_code_execution_in_tasks.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker introduces malicious Python code within DAG tasks, executing on worker nodes during task runtime.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on workers, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, compromise of connected systems.
*   **Affected Airflow Component:** Executor, Workers (Task execution environment)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict DAG code review.
    *   Secure coding practices in DAGs.
    *   Run workers with least privilege.
    *   Use containerization for task isolation.
    *   Scan DAG dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Metadata Database](./threats/sql_injection_in_metadata_database.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious SQL queries through Airflow components interacting with the metadata database.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches from the metadata database, data manipulation, denial of service via database compromise.
*   **Affected Airflow Component:** Webserver, Scheduler (Database interaction layer)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORM.
    *   Strict input validation.
    *   Regularly update Airflow and database drivers.
    *   Security testing for SQL injection.
    *   Database access controls.

## Threat: [Exposure of Connection Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_connection_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains access to connection credentials stored insecurely within Airflow configurations or variables.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to connected systems, data breaches, data manipulation, service disruption in external systems.
*   **Affected Airflow Component:** Connections management, Variables management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a secrets backend (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
    *   Avoid storing credentials in DAG code or variables directly.
    *   Encrypt connection details in the metadata database.
    *   Implement access controls for connections.

## Threat: [Insecure Secrets Management](./threats/insecure_secrets_management.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits weak secrets management practices in Airflow, such as weak encryption or insecure storage.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive secrets (credentials, API keys), leading to unauthorized access and system compromise.
*   **Affected Airflow Component:** Secrets backend integration, Configuration management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize a robust secrets management solution.
    *   Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit.
    *   Implement strong access controls for secrets.
    *   Regularly audit secrets management.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in DAGs](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_dags.md)

*   **Description:** DAGs rely on vulnerable Python packages. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities present in the worker environment.
*   **Impact:** Code execution on workers or scheduler, denial of service, data breaches depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Airflow Component:** Workers, Scheduler (Dependency management)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability management.
    *   Use dependency pinning.
    *   Regularly update DAG dependencies.
    *   Use virtual environments or containerization for dependency isolation.
