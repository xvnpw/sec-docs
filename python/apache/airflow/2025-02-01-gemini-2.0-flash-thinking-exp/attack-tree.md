            *   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):**  Manipulating the webserver to make requests to internal resources, potentially accessing sensitive data or internal systems.
            *   **API Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the REST API to inject commands or code.
    *   **Access Sensitive Information via Webserver [HIGH-RISK PATH ENDS - Webserver Compromise]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** After gaining unauthorized access or executing code, attacker uses the webserver to access sensitive information:
