# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Apache Airflow project aims to provide a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It is designed to manage complex computational workflows and data pipelines.

Business priorities and goals for adopting Apache Airflow include:
- Automating data pipelines and ETL processes to improve efficiency and reduce manual effort.
- Orchestrating machine learning workflows for model training, deployment, and monitoring.
- Enhancing data reliability and consistency by automating data processing tasks.
- Improving observability and monitoring of complex workflows to ensure timely execution and identify failures.
- Enabling self-service data engineering capabilities for data scientists and analysts.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Data Integrity Risks: Incorrect or incomplete data processing due to workflow failures or misconfigurations can lead to flawed business decisions.
- Data Availability Risks: Downtime or unavailability of Airflow can disrupt critical data pipelines, impacting business operations and reporting.
- Data Security Risks: Unauthorized access to sensitive data processed by workflows or to the Airflow platform itself can lead to data breaches and compliance violations.
- Operational Risks: Complexity of managing and maintaining Airflow infrastructure and workflows can lead to operational inefficiencies and errors.
- Compliance Risks: Failure to meet regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) due to insecure data processing or lack of auditability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Implemented within Airflow Web UI and API to manage user permissions and access to resources (DAGs, connections, pools, etc.). Described in Airflow documentation and code.
- security control: Authentication - Implemented via various backend options (e.g., password, LDAP, OAuth) for user login to the Airflow Web UI and API. Configurable in `airflow.cfg` and documented.
- security control: Connections Encryption - Supports encryption for connections to external systems (databases, cloud services) using connection strings and parameters. Configurable when defining connections in Airflow UI or via code.
- security control: Logging and Auditing - Airflow logs workflow execution details, user actions, and system events, providing audit trails. Logs are stored in configured logging locations (local files, cloud storage, etc.). Configurable in `airflow.cfg` and documented.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies - Airflow relies on numerous Python packages, which may contain security vulnerabilities. Risk is partially mitigated by dependency scanning and updates.
- accepted risk: Misconfigurations - Incorrectly configured Airflow settings, permissions, or connections can lead to security weaknesses. Risk is mitigated by documentation and best practices.
- accepted risk: Insider threats - Malicious or negligent actions by authorized users can compromise the system. Risk is mitigated by RBAC, auditing, and security awareness training.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Secrets Management - Implement a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and manage sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords) used in Airflow connections and DAGs.
- security control: Network Segmentation - Isolate Airflow components (webserver, scheduler, worker) and the underlying infrastructure within secure network segments to limit the impact of potential breaches.
- security control: Vulnerability Scanning - Regularly scan Airflow infrastructure and application dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools.
- security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify and address security weaknesses in Airflow deployments and configurations.
- security control: Incident Response Plan - Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for Airflow security incidents to ensure timely and effective handling of breaches or attacks.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Securely authenticate users accessing the Airflow Web UI and API.
    - Requirement: Support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced user authentication.
    - Requirement: Implement service account authentication for Airflow components interacting with external systems.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Enforce fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions for DAGs, connections, and other Airflow resources.
    - Requirement: Implement authorization policies to control access to sensitive data and operations within workflows.
    - Requirement: Regularly review and update user roles and permissions to maintain least privilege access.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate inputs to DAGs and operators to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
    - Requirement: Sanitize user-provided inputs in the Airflow Web UI to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Implement input validation for API requests to prevent malicious or malformed data from being processed.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Encrypt sensitive data at rest, including database credentials, API keys, and other secrets stored within Airflow.
    - Requirement: Encrypt data in transit between Airflow components and external systems using TLS/SSL.
    - Requirement: Utilize strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices for encryption and decryption operations.
