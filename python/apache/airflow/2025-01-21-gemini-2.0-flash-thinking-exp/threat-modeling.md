# Threat Model Analysis for apache/airflow

## Threat: [Malicious DAG Code Injection](./threats/malicious_dag_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to create or modify DAG definitions, inserting malicious Python code. This could be achieved through exploiting vulnerabilities in Airflow's access controls, insecure API endpoints provided by Airflow, or by compromising user accounts within Airflow. The injected code will then be executed by Airflow workers when the DAG runs.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on worker nodes, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The attacker could steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt critical processes managed by Airflow.
*   **Affected Component:** DAG Parser, Scheduler, Worker
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying DAG definitions within Airflow's RBAC system.
    *   Enforce code review processes for all DAG changes managed through Airflow's interface or API.
    *   Utilize Airflow's built-in role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict DAG creation and modification permissions.
    *   Sanitize and validate any user-provided input used in DAG generation or modification through Airflow's features.
    *   Consider using a Git-based workflow integrated with Airflow for managing DAG changes with version control and access controls enforced by the platform.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in DAGs and Connections](./threats/credential_exposure_in_dags_and_connections.md)

*   **Description:** Developers inadvertently hardcode sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords) directly within DAG Python code or connection definitions managed by Airflow. An attacker gaining access to these definitions through the Airflow UI, API, or metadata store can retrieve these credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external systems and databases configured within Airflow connections, leading to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage. The attacker can impersonate legitimate users or services connected through Airflow.
*   **Affected Component:** DAG Parser, Connections Management, Metadata Database
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Airflow's built-in connection management with appropriate secrets backend configuration (e.g., using a secrets backend like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or GCP Secret Manager integrated with Airflow).
    *   Avoid storing credentials directly in DAG code or environment variables accessible by Airflow.
    *   Implement strong access controls within Airflow to restrict who can create, read, update, and delete connections.
    *   Regularly audit DAG code and connection definitions within Airflow for exposed credentials.
    *   Educate developers on secure credential management practices within the context of Airflow.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious or Poorly Designed DAGs](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_or_poorly_designed_dags.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates or modifies DAGs through Airflow's interface or API to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) on Airflow workers or the scheduler. This could involve creating infinite loops, spawning a large number of tasks, or performing computationally intensive operations without proper limits within the DAG definition.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting the ability of Airflow to schedule and execute legitimate DAGs. This can lead to delays in data processing and application downtime managed by Airflow.
*   **Affected Component:** Scheduler, Worker
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource quotas and limits for DAG runs and tasks within Airflow's configuration.
    *   Monitor resource utilization of Airflow components and individual tasks.
    *   Implement code review processes to identify and prevent inefficient DAG designs within Airflow.
    *   Utilize Airflow's features for task concurrency and parallelism control.
    *   Implement circuit breakers or timeout mechanisms for tasks defined within Airflow to prevent runaway processes.

## Threat: [Unauthorized DAG Modification/Deletion](./threats/unauthorized_dag_modificationdeletion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, without proper authorization within Airflow's RBAC, gains access to modify or delete existing DAGs through the Airflow UI or API. This could be achieved through exploiting weak access controls in Airflow or by compromising user accounts within the Airflow system.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of critical workflows managed by Airflow, data loss due to deleted DAGs, or data corruption if malicious modifications are made through Airflow. This can lead to significant operational impact.
*   **Affected Component:** Webserver (UI and API), Scheduler
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for accessing the Airflow UI and API.
    *   Utilize Airflow's RBAC to restrict DAG modification and deletion permissions based on user roles.
    *   Implement audit logging within Airflow to track all DAG modifications and deletions.
    *   Consider implementing a workflow that requires approvals within Airflow for significant DAG changes.

## Threat: [Scheduler Exploitation](./threats/scheduler_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Airflow scheduler component itself to manipulate DAG scheduling, trigger unauthorized DAG runs, or prevent legitimate DAGs from running. This could involve exploiting API vulnerabilities within the scheduler or gaining unauthorized access to the scheduler process.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of workflows managed by Airflow, execution of unauthorized tasks, potential data manipulation orchestrated by Airflow, or denial of service by preventing DAGs from running.
*   **Affected Component:** Scheduler
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Airflow updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities in the scheduler.
    *   Secure the network access to the scheduler component.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for any APIs interacting with the scheduler.
    *   Monitor scheduler logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Connections](./threats/insecure_storage_of_connections.md)

*   **Description:** Airflow connection details (usernames, passwords, API keys) are stored insecurely within Airflow's metadata database or backend. An attacker gaining access to the database or backend can retrieve these sensitive credentials managed by Airflow.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external systems and services configured within Airflow connections, leading to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Connections Management, Metadata Database
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Airflow's secrets backend integrations (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager) to securely store connection details.
    *   Encrypt the Airflow metadata database at rest.
    *   Implement strong access controls within the database layer to restrict access to the Airflow metadata database.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugins](./threats/malicious_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker installs a malicious Airflow plugin that contains malicious code. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in Airflow's plugin installation mechanisms or by tricking administrators into installing untrusted plugins within the Airflow environment.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Airflow environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service affecting Airflow's operations.
*   **Affected Component:** Plugins System, potentially all other Airflow components depending on the plugin's functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted sources explicitly supported by the Airflow community or your organization.
    *   Review the code of any custom or third-party plugins before installation within Airflow.
    *   Implement a process for vetting and approving plugin installations within the Airflow environment.
    *   Regularly audit installed plugins for known vulnerabilities.
