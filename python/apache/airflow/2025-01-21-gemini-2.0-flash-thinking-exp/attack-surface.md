# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/airflow

## Attack Surface: [Web UI Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/web_ui_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

* **Description:** Unauthorized access to the Airflow web interface, allowing attackers to view sensitive information, modify configurations, or trigger malicious actions.
    * **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow provides its own authentication and authorization mechanisms (including RBAC). Misconfigurations, weak default settings, or vulnerabilities in this system directly expose this attack surface.
    * **Example:** Using the default Fernet key for session management, allowing an attacker with the key to forge session cookies and gain administrative access.
    * **Impact:** Full control over the Airflow environment, potential for data breaches, disruption of workflows, and execution of arbitrary code through DAG manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Generate strong, unique Fernet keys and rotate them regularly.
        * Configure a robust authentication backend (e.g., LDAP, OAuth).
        * Implement and enforce granular role-based access control (RBAC).
        * Regularly audit user permissions and roles.
        * Keep Airflow and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [DAG Parsing and Code Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dag_parsing_and_code_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Maliciously crafted DAG files can exploit vulnerabilities in the DAG parsing process or contain embedded code that executes arbitrary commands on the Airflow scheduler or workers.
    * **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow's core functionality relies on parsing and executing Python code within DAG definitions. This inherently introduces the risk of executing untrusted code.
    * **Example:** A DAG file containing Python code that uses the `os` module to execute system commands, potentially deleting files or installing malware on the scheduler.
    * **Impact:** Server compromise, data loss, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the infrastructure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict code review processes for all DAGs.
        * Restrict access to the DAGs folder and control who can create or modify DAG files.
        * Consider using a DAG serialization format that limits code execution capabilities (though this might impact functionality).
        * Implement static analysis tools to scan DAGs for potential security issues.
        * Run the scheduler and workers with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Connections, Variables, and Secrets](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_connections__variables__and_secrets.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets are stored insecurely, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    * **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow provides mechanisms for storing connections, variables, and secrets. If these mechanisms are not configured securely or if default settings are used, it creates an attack surface.
    * **Example:** Storing database passwords in plain text within the Airflow metadata database or environment variables accessible to the worker processes.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to external systems, and potential financial loss.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize a dedicated secrets backend (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager) for storing sensitive credentials.
        * Configure Airflow to use the secrets backend.
        * Restrict access to the Airflow metadata database.
        * Avoid storing sensitive information in environment variables if possible.
        * Implement encryption at rest for the Airflow metadata database.

## Attack Surface: [Jinja2 Template Injection in Web UI](./attack_surfaces/jinja2_template_injection_in_web_ui.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into Jinja2 templates used by the Airflow web UI, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow uses the Jinja2 templating engine for rendering dynamic content in its web UI. If user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being used in templates, it can create a vulnerability.
    * **Example:** A custom view or plugin that renders user-provided input directly into a Jinja2 template without escaping, allowing an attacker to inject code like `{{request.environ}}` to expose server environment variables.
    * **Impact:** Server compromise, information disclosure, and potential for further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure all user-provided data is properly sanitized and escaped before being used in Jinja2 templates.
        * Follow secure coding practices when developing custom views or plugins.
        * Regularly review and audit custom UI components for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Default Configurations and Examples](./attack_surfaces/default_configurations_and_examples.md)

* **Description:** Using default passwords, API keys, or insecure example DAGs in a production environment.
    * **How Airflow Contributes:** Airflow provides default configurations and example DAGs for demonstration purposes. If these are not properly secured before deployment, they become easy targets.
    * **Example:** Using the default Fernet key or running example DAGs that contain hardcoded credentials.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential for full system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Change all default passwords and API keys immediately upon installation.
        * Remove or secure example DAGs before deploying Airflow to production.
        * Regularly review and update Airflow configurations to ensure they align with security best practices.
