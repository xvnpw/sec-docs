# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/airflow

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Enforce Password Authentication with Strong Password Policies](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_enforce_password_authentication_with_strong_password_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `airflow.cfg`:** Set `auth_backend = airflow.providers.security.auth_manager.password_auth_manager.PasswordAuthManager` in your `airflow.cfg` file. This activates Airflow's built-in password authentication.
    2.  **Disable Anonymous Access:** Ensure `auth_default_view = AuthView.LOGIN` is set in `airflow.cfg`. This setting forces users to log in before accessing any part of the Airflow UI, preventing unauthorized browsing.
    3.  **Implement Strong Password Policies (Externally):** While Airflow's default password authentication doesn't enforce complex policies directly, implement organizational policies for strong passwords (length, complexity, rotation) that users must adhere to when creating Airflow accounts. Consider using OS-level password policies where Airflow user accounts are managed.
    4.  **Educate Users:** Train Airflow users on the importance of strong, unique passwords and the risks of weak credentials within the Airflow system.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High):** Attackers attempting to guess user passwords to gain unauthorized access to Airflow. Severity is high as successful brute-force can lead to full system compromise.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High):** Attackers using lists of compromised usernames and passwords from other breaches to try and log into Airflow. High severity as successful credential stuffing bypasses basic authentication.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High):** Preventing anonymous or default access to Airflow, ensuring only authenticated users can interact with the system. High severity as unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, DAG manipulation, and system disruption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: High reduction in risk.
    *   Credential Stuffing: High reduction in risk.
    *   Unauthorized Access: High reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the production Airflow instance by requiring password login.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Strong password policies are not explicitly enforced within Airflow configuration itself (relying on external policies). No automated password complexity checks within Airflow's password authentication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable RBAC UI:** Ensure RBAC UI is enabled in `airflow.cfg` by setting `rbac = True`. This activates Airflow's RBAC feature, allowing for granular permission management.
    2.  **Define Roles within Airflow:** Use the Airflow UI (or CLI) to create roles that reflect different levels of access needed for various users (e.g., `DAG Developer`, `Data Operator`, `Admin`).
    3.  **Assign Permissions to Roles within Airflow:**  Within the Airflow RBAC interface, meticulously assign permissions to each role. Control access to specific DAGs, connections, variables, pools, and Airflow actions (e.g., trigger DAG, clear task logs, edit connections). Follow the principle of least privilege.
    4.  **Assign Users to Roles within Airflow:**  Assign each Airflow user to the most appropriate role based on their job function and required access level.
    5.  **Regularly Audit and Refine RBAC Policies:** Periodically review user roles and assigned permissions within Airflow to ensure they are still appropriate and aligned with current needs. Adjust as roles and responsibilities change.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Airflow Features (High):** Prevents users from accessing and manipulating parts of Airflow they shouldn't, like editing critical connections or deleting DAGs they don't own. High severity as unauthorized actions can disrupt workflows and compromise data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium):** Limits the potential for users with lower privileges to gain access to administrative functions or sensitive data. Medium severity as it reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of elevated privileges.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion by Unauthorized Users within Airflow (Medium):** Restricts who can modify DAGs, connections, variables, or other Airflow configurations, preventing accidental or malicious changes. Medium severity as incorrect modifications can lead to workflow failures and data inconsistencies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Airflow Features: High reduction in risk.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium reduction in risk.
    *   Data Modification/Deletion by Unauthorized Users within Airflow: Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** RBAC is enabled in production and development Airflow instances. Basic roles are defined.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular roles and permissions are not fully defined and consistently applied across all Airflow resources. Regular audit process for RBAC is not formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure DAG Development Code Reviews (Focus on Airflow Specifics)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dag_development_code_reviews__focus_on_airflow_specifics_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Airflow DAG Specific Code Review Process:** Implement a mandatory code review process specifically for all Airflow DAGs before deployment.
    2.  **Define Airflow Security Checklist for DAGs:** Create a checklist focusing on Airflow-specific security concerns in DAGs, including:
        *   **Secrets Handling in DAGs:** Verify no hardcoded secrets, proper use of Airflow secrets backends or connections.
        *   **Input Validation in DAG Tasks:** Check for proper sanitization and validation of inputs to operators, especially when interacting with external systems or user-provided data within DAG tasks.
        *   **Operator Security:** Review the operators used in DAGs for known vulnerabilities or insecure configurations.
        *   **Connection and Variable Usage:** Verify secure and authorized usage of Airflow connections and variables within DAGs.
        *   **DAG Logic and Permissions:** Review DAG logic for potential vulnerabilities and ensure DAG ownership and permissions are correctly set (if DAG-level permissions are used).
    3.  **Train Reviewers on Airflow DAG Security:** Train developers and reviewers specifically on secure coding practices for Airflow DAGs and the Airflow security checklist.
    4.  **Utilize Version Control for DAGs:** Use Git to manage DAG code and enforce code reviews through pull requests/merge requests before DAG deployment to Airflow.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via DAG Tasks (High):** Prevents SQL injection, command injection, or code injection vulnerabilities within DAG tasks due to insecure coding practices in DAGs. High severity as successful injection attacks can lead to data breaches and system compromise.
    *   **Secrets Exposure in DAG Code (High):**  Reduces the risk of developers accidentally hardcoding sensitive credentials directly into DAG files. High severity as exposed secrets can lead to unauthorized access to systems and data.
    *   **Logic Flaws in DAGs Leading to Security Issues (Medium):** Catches potential errors in DAG logic that could inadvertently create security vulnerabilities or lead to unintended actions. Medium severity as logic flaws can have security implications, though often less direct than injection or secrets exposure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Attacks via DAG Tasks: High reduction in risk.
    *   Secrets Exposure in DAG Code: High reduction in risk.
    *   Logic Flaws in DAGs Leading to Security Issues: Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Code reviews are performed for DAG changes before production deployment.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal Airflow DAG security checklist is not defined. Specific training on secure DAG development is not formalized. Automated security checks tailored for DAGs are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize a Secure Secrets Backend (Airflow Integration)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_a_secure_secrets_backend__airflow_integration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose an Airflow-Supported Secrets Backend:** Select a secrets management solution that Airflow natively integrates with (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager).
    2.  **Install and Configure Airflow Secrets Backend Provider:** Install the necessary Airflow provider package for your chosen secrets backend (e.g., `apache-airflow-providers-hashicorp-vault`).
    3.  **Configure Airflow to use the Secrets Backend in `airflow.cfg`:** Modify `airflow.cfg` to specify the chosen secrets backend and its connection details.  For example, for Vault, configure `secrets.backend = airflow.providers.hashicorp_vault.secrets.vault.VaultSecrets` and provide Vault connection parameters.
    4.  **Store Secrets in the Secrets Backend:**  Store all sensitive information used by Airflow (database passwords, API keys, connection strings) within the configured secrets backend, *not* directly in `airflow.cfg`, environment variables, or DAG code.
    5.  **Retrieve Secrets in Airflow Connections and DAGs:**
        *   **Connections:** Configure Airflow connections to retrieve passwords and other sensitive fields from the secrets backend using the `secrets://` URI scheme in connection URLs.
        *   **DAGs:**  Use Airflow's `Variable.get(..., secret=True)` or similar mechanisms within DAGs to retrieve secrets from the backend instead of hardcoding or using insecure methods.
    6.  **Restrict Access to the Secrets Backend (Externally):**  Configure access control policies within your chosen secrets backend system itself to ensure only authorized Airflow components and users can retrieve secrets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure in Plain Text within Airflow Configuration (High):** Prevents storing secrets directly in `airflow.cfg`, environment variables accessible to Airflow, or DAG code, where they could be easily discovered. High severity as plain text secrets are easily compromised.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets Stored by Airflow (High):**  Limits access to sensitive credentials to only authorized Airflow components and processes, reducing the risk of unauthorized retrieval. High severity as unauthorized secret access can lead to widespread system compromise.
    *   **Secrets Leakage through Airflow Logs or Metadata Database (Medium):**  Minimizes the risk of secrets being accidentally logged or stored in the Airflow metadata database in plain text if proper secrets backend usage is enforced. Medium severity as leaked secrets can be discovered through log analysis or database access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Secrets Exposure in Plain Text within Airflow Configuration: High reduction in risk.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets Stored by Airflow: High reduction in risk.
    *   Secrets Leakage through Airflow Logs or Metadata Database: Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Using AWS Secrets Manager as secrets backend for production Airflow. Connections are configured to retrieve passwords from Secrets Manager.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Secrets backend not fully implemented in development/testing. Some DAGs still rely on environment variables. Not all sensitive variables migrated to Secrets Manager. Automated secret rotation not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable HTTPS for Airflow Webserver (Airflow Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_https_for_airflow_webserver__airflow_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain SSL/TLS Certificate (Externally):** Acquire an SSL/TLS certificate for your Airflow webserver's domain or hostname from a Certificate Authority (CA).
    2.  **Configure Airflow Webserver for HTTPS in `airflow.cfg`:**  Modify the `airflow.cfg` file to enable HTTPS for the webserver. Set `webserver.use_https = True`, and configure `webserver.https_cert` and `webserver.https_key` to point to the paths of your SSL/TLS certificate and private key files on the Airflow webserver.
    3.  **Restart Airflow Webserver:** Restart the Airflow webserver for the HTTPS configuration to take effect.
    4.  **(Optional, External to Airflow but Recommended) Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:** Configure an external load balancer or reverse proxy in front of Airflow to automatically redirect all HTTP requests (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443).
    5.  **(Optional, External to Airflow but Recommended) Enforce HSTS:** Configure the external webserver or load balancer to send the `Strict-Transport-Security` HTTP header to enforce HTTPS connections in browsers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Airflow Web UI (High):** Prevents attackers from intercepting communication between users' browsers and the Airflow webserver to steal login credentials, session cookies, or sensitive data displayed in the UI. High severity as MITM attacks can lead to full account compromise and data breaches.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping on Airflow Web UI Traffic (High):** Encrypts all traffic to and from the Airflow web UI, preventing eavesdropping on sensitive data transmitted over the network. High severity as unencrypted traffic can expose credentials and sensitive workflow information.
    *   **Session Hijacking via Insecure HTTP (Medium):** Prevents attackers from stealing session cookies transmitted over insecure HTTP connections, which could be used to impersonate legitimate users. Medium severity as session hijacking allows attackers to gain unauthorized access but typically for a limited time.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Airflow Web UI: High reduction in risk.
    *   Data Eavesdropping on Airflow Web UI Traffic: High reduction in risk.
    *   Session Hijacking via Insecure HTTP: Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** HTTPS is enabled for the production Airflow webserver using a publicly trusted certificate.
*   **Missing Implementation:** HTTPS is not consistently enabled in development/testing environments. HTTP to HTTPS redirection and HSTS are not configured within Airflow itself (typically handled externally).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Centralized Logging and Security Monitoring (Airflow Logs)](./mitigation_strategies/centralized_logging_and_security_monitoring__airflow_logs_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Airflow for Centralized Logging:** Configure Airflow to send logs from all components (webserver, scheduler, workers, DAG runs) to a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk, ELK stack). This is typically done by configuring Airflow's logging settings in `airflow.cfg` or through environment variables to use a remote logging handler.
    2.  **Implement Security Monitoring Rules for Airflow Logs:** Define monitoring rules and alerts within your centralized logging system specifically to detect security-relevant events in Airflow logs. Examples include:
        *   **Authentication Failures:** Monitor logs for failed login attempts, especially repeated failures from the same IP.
        *   **Authorization Violations:** Look for logs indicating attempts to access resources or perform actions without sufficient permissions.
        *   **Suspicious User Activity:** Monitor for unusual patterns of user activity, such as logins from unexpected locations or rapid changes to DAGs or configurations.
        *   **Error Conditions Indicative of Attacks:**  Monitor for specific error messages or log patterns that might indicate injection attempts or other attacks against Airflow.
        *   **Changes to Critical Airflow Configurations:** Log and monitor changes to `airflow.cfg`, RBAC roles, connections, and other security-sensitive configurations.
    3.  **Establish Incident Response Process for Airflow Security Alerts:** Define a clear process for responding to security alerts generated from Airflow logs, including investigation steps, escalation procedures, and remediation actions.
    4.  **Regularly Review Airflow Logs and Monitoring Rules:** Periodically review Airflow logs and the effectiveness of your security monitoring rules. Refine rules as needed and investigate any suspicious patterns or anomalies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Delayed Detection of Security Incidents in Airflow (High):** Centralized logging and monitoring enable faster detection of security incidents within Airflow, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers. High severity as delayed detection allows attackers more time to compromise systems and data.
    *   **Insufficient Visibility into Airflow Security Events (Medium):** Provides comprehensive visibility into security-related events occurring within Airflow, making it easier to investigate incidents and understand security posture. Medium severity as lack of visibility hinders effective security management.
    *   **Insider Threats within Airflow (Medium):** Monitoring Airflow logs can help detect malicious activities by internal users who might have legitimate access but are misusing their privileges. Medium severity as insider threats can be difficult to detect without proper monitoring.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Delayed Detection of Security Incidents in Airflow: High reduction in risk.
    *   Insufficient Visibility into Airflow Security Events: Medium reduction in risk.
    *   Insider Threats within Airflow: Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Airflow logs are sent to a centralized Elasticsearch cluster. Basic monitoring for system errors is in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Security-specific monitoring rules and alerts tailored for Airflow logs are not fully defined. Formal incident response process for Airflow security incidents is not documented. Regular log review and alert refinement process is not established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Airflow and Dependency Updates & Vulnerability Scanning (Airflow Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_airflow_and_dependency_updates_&_vulnerability_scanning__airflow_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Airflow Update Schedule:** Create a regular schedule for updating Apache Airflow itself to the latest stable versions.
    2.  **Monitor Airflow Security Announcements:** Subscribe to the Apache Airflow security mailing list and regularly check for security advisories related to Airflow releases on the official Airflow website and security vulnerability databases.
    3.  **Test Airflow Updates in Non-Production Environments:** Thoroughly test Airflow updates in development and staging environments before deploying them to production to ensure compatibility and identify any potential issues.
    4.  **Manage Airflow Python Dependencies:** Use dependency management tools (like `pip` or `poetry`) to manage Python dependencies for your Airflow installation. Regularly update these dependencies to their latest secure versions.
    5.  **Implement Vulnerability Scanning for Airflow and Dependencies:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline or deployment process to automatically scan your Airflow installation and its dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
    6.  **Patch Airflow and Dependency Vulnerabilities Promptly:** Prioritize patching identified vulnerabilities in Airflow and its dependencies based on their severity and potential impact. Follow a defined patch management process.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Airflow (High):** Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Airflow itself. High severity as known vulnerabilities are actively targeted by attackers.
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Airflow Dependencies (High):**  Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in Python libraries and other dependencies used by Airflow. High severity as dependency vulnerabilities are a common attack vector.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Medium - Indirect Mitigation):** While updates primarily address known vulnerabilities, staying up-to-date with the latest Airflow versions and dependencies can sometimes indirectly mitigate the risk of zero-day exploits by incorporating general security improvements and bug fixes. Medium severity as zero-day exploits are less common but can be highly impactful.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Airflow: High reduction in risk.
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Airflow Dependencies: High reduction in risk.
    *   Zero-Day Exploits: Medium reduction in risk (indirect).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Airflow version is updated periodically, but not on a strict schedule. Dependency updates are less frequent.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal update schedule for Airflow and dependencies is not defined. Vulnerability scanning for Airflow and its dependencies is not implemented. Formal patch management process for Airflow vulnerabilities is missing. Thorough testing of updates in non-production environments is not consistently performed.
