## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Goal: Unauthorized Access/Control/Disruption of Synapse Homeserver](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_goal_unauthorized_accesscontroldisruption_of_synapse_homeserver.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. This encompasses gaining unauthorized access to user data, controlling the server's functionality, or disrupting its operation.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete compromise of the homeserver and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Synapse Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_synapse_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker leverages vulnerabilities specifically within the Synapse software to achieve their goal. This is the main entry point for the high-risk attacks.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation can lead to a wide range of negative outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Federation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_federation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks exploiting the trust relationships between federated Matrix homeservers.
*   **Impact:** High - Can affect multiple servers and users.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Federation inherently increases the attack surface.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of the Matrix federation protocol.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires knowledge of network protocols and distributed systems.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring federation traffic and analyzing event logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Malicious Federated Server](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_malicious_federated_server.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker controls or compromises a Matrix homeserver and uses it to attack other servers.
*   **Impact:** High - A malicious server has significant control over the data it sends.
*   **Likelihood:** Low - Requires controlling a homeserver or compromising an existing one.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Setting up or compromising a server takes time and resources.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires server administration and potentially exploit development skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring server behavior and reputation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.1 Send Malicious Events](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_1_send_malicious_events.md)

*   **Description:** The malicious server sends specially crafted events designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the target Synapse server's event handling code.
*   **Impact:** High - Could lead to code execution, denial-of-service, or data corruption.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - This is a common attack vector for systems processing external input.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires identifying vulnerable event types and crafting exploits.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of event parsing and vulnerability exploitation.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Malicious events might look similar to legitimate events.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Application Logic Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_application_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within Synapse's core logic, independent of federation.
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to direct server compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Complex software is likely to have logic flaws.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires code review, fuzzing, and vulnerability research.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of web application security.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires good logging and monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2 User Impersonation](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_user_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains the ability to act as another user, accessing their data and privileges.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete account takeover.
*   **Likelihood:** Low - Synapse has authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Effort:** High - Requires bypassing authentication or finding session management vulnerabilities.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced - Requires expertise in web application security.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard - Requires monitoring for unusual user activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2.1 Masquerade as Another User in API Calls](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_1_masquerade_as_another_user_in_api_calls.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker forges API requests to appear as if they originated from a different user, bypassing authorization checks.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete account takeover.
*   **Likelihood:** Low - Requires finding vulnerabilities in API authentication or session handling.
*   **Effort:** Very High - Requires deep understanding of Synapse's API.
*   **Skill Level:** Expert - Requires advanced web application security skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard - Requires monitoring API calls for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.3 Media Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_3_media_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities related to how Synapse handles media file uploads (images, videos, etc.).
*   **Impact:** High - Can lead to code execution, denial-of-service, or data breaches.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Media handling is a common source of vulnerabilities.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires finding vulnerabilities in media processing.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of file upload vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring file uploads and content.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.3.1 Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_3_1_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uploads a file with a crafted filename that allows them to write the file to an arbitrary location on the server.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Could lead to code execution by overwriting critical files.
*   **Likelihood:** Low - Synapse *should* sanitize filenames.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires crafting malicious filenames and testing.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of path traversal attacks.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring file system access.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.3.3 Malicious File Content](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_3_3_malicious_file_content.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uploads a file that, when processed by Synapse or downloaded by a client, exploits a vulnerability (e.g., a malicious image).
*   **Impact:** High - Could lead to code execution or client-side exploits.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the vulnerability of media processing libraries.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires finding or creating malicious files.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of file format vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires malware scanning and sandboxing.
