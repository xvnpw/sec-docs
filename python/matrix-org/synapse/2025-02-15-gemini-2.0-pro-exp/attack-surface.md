# Attack Surface Analysis for matrix-org/synapse

## Attack Surface: [Federation with Malicious Homeservers](./attack_surfaces/federation_with_malicious_homeservers.md)

*   **Description:** The core principle of Matrix, allowing communication between different homeservers, also introduces the risk of interacting with malicious or compromised servers.  This is a *direct* function of Synapse's federation implementation.
    *   **Synapse Contribution:** Synapse implements the federation protocol, making it directly responsible for handling incoming and outgoing federated traffic, validating server identities, and processing federated events.
    *   **Example:** A malicious homeserver joins a room and injects forged events that appear to come from a legitimate user, spreading misinformation or phishing links.  Synapse processes and distributes these events.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, impersonation, denial of service, room disruption, spread of malware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Federation Allowlisting:** Restrict federation to a pre-approved list of trusted homeservers.
        *   **Reputation Systems:** Implement or integrate with systems that track homeserver reputation.
        *   **Strong Server Identity Verification:** Ensure rigorous verification of TLS certificates and identities of federated servers within Synapse's configuration.
        *   **Event Validation:** Implement strict event validation rules *within Synapse* to detect and reject malformed or suspicious events.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Federation):** Implement rate limiting on incoming federation traffic *within Synapse* to prevent DoS.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit Synapse's federation configuration and connected homeservers.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting for unusual federation activity *within Synapse*.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Application Service (AS)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_application_service__as_.md)

*   **Description:** Application Services have elevated privileges within Synapse, making them high-value targets.  Synapse directly manages and authorizes AS.
    *   **Synapse Contribution:** Synapse provides the AS API, manages AS registration (including `hs_token` and `as_token`), and enforces the permissions defined in the registration YAML file.  Synapse routes events to and from AS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a bridge (an AS). The attacker uses the bridge's privileges, *granted by Synapse*, to send spam, eavesdrop, or impersonate users.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over bridged rooms/users, data breaches, impersonation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure AS Registration:** Use strong, randomly generated `hs_token` and `as_token` values. Securely store these tokens, accessible only to Synapse and the AS.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant AS *within Synapse's configuration* only the minimum necessary permissions. Carefully review `namespaces`.
        *   **Input Validation (AS *via* Synapse):** While the AS itself should validate input, Synapse's handling of AS communication can be configured to add an extra layer of defense.
        *   **Code Auditing (AS):** Thoroughly audit AS code, but also review how Synapse interacts with it.
        *   **Regular Updates (Synapse & AS):** Keep *both* Synapse and the AS up-to-date.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate AS, but ensure Synapse can still securely communicate with it.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Server API Abuse](./attack_surfaces/client-server_api_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can target the Client-Server API to gain unauthorized access, perform denial-of-service, or enumerate users. This is a *direct* attack surface of Synapse.
    *   **Synapse Contribution:** Synapse *is* the Client-Server API. It handles all client interactions, authentication, and authorization.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a brute-force attack against Synapse's `/login` endpoint to guess user passwords.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, denial of service, information disclosure (user enumeration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies *within Synapse's configuration*.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Client-Server API):** Implement comprehensive rate limiting on all Client-Server API endpoints *within Synapse*.
        *   **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout policies *within Synapse*.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Encourage or require MFA, configured *within Synapse*.
        *   **CAPTCHA:** Consider CAPTCHAs on registration/login, integrated with Synapse.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide an additional layer of defense, but Synapse's internal protections are primary.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Media Uploads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_media_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can upload malicious files disguised as media, exploiting vulnerabilities in Synapse's media handling.
    *   **Synapse Contribution:** Synapse's media repository *directly* handles the storage, retrieval, and (potentially) processing of media files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a crafted image that exploits a vulnerability in an image processing library *used by Synapse*, leading to RCE on the Synapse server.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, client-side attacks (if media is served to clients), data breaches, denial of service (storage exhaustion).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Type Validation:** Strictly validate file types *within Synapse's media handling logic*.
        *   **File Size Limits:** Enforce file size limits *within Synapse*.
        *   **Media Processing Security:** Use secure image/video processing libraries *within Synapse*. Keep these libraries updated. Consider sandboxing media processing *as part of Synapse's deployment*.
        *   **Virus Scanning:** Integrate virus scanning into Synapse's media upload process.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While often client-side, Synapse can be configured to send appropriate CSP headers.
        *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Synapse and all its dependencies up-to-date.
