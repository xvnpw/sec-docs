# Deep Analysis of Synapse Path Traversal Vulnerability (Attack Tree Path 2.2.3.1)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for path traversal attacks against a Synapse server, specifically focusing on the scenario where an attacker attempts to upload a file with a crafted filename to achieve arbitrary file writes.  We aim to:

*   **Verify** the effectiveness of Synapse's existing mitigations against path traversal.
*   **Identify** any potential weaknesses or bypasses in these mitigations.
*   **Assess** the real-world impact and likelihood of a successful attack, considering Synapse's architecture and configuration.
*   **Recommend** concrete improvements to Synapse's security posture if vulnerabilities are found.
*   **Provide** clear documentation to aid developers in understanding and preventing similar vulnerabilities.

## 2. Scope

This analysis will focus on the following areas:

*   **File Upload Functionality:**  We will examine all Synapse components and APIs that handle file uploads, including but not limited to:
    *   Media Repository API (specifically the `/upload` endpoint).
    *   Custom module upload mechanisms (if applicable).
    *   Any other APIs or features that involve user-provided filenames.
*   **Filename Sanitization and Validation:**  We will analyze the code responsible for sanitizing and validating filenames, looking for potential weaknesses or bypasses.  This includes examining regular expressions, string manipulation functions, and any custom validation logic.
*   **File Storage Mechanisms:** We will investigate how Synapse stores uploaded files, including:
    *   The directory structure used.
    *   File permissions and ownership.
    *   Any transformations applied to filenames before storage.
    *   Interaction with underlying operating system file system calls.
*   **Configuration Options:** We will review configuration options related to file uploads and storage, identifying any settings that could increase or decrease the risk of path traversal.
* **Synapse Version:** The analysis will be performed against a specific, recent version of Synapse (e.g., the latest stable release at the time of analysis).  The version number will be clearly documented.  We will also consider any known vulnerabilities in older versions.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Attacks that do not involve crafted filenames during file uploads (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in image processing libraries after a file is successfully uploaded).
*   Denial-of-service attacks that do not involve arbitrary file writes.
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *unless* they are directly related to how Synapse handles filenames.
*   Client-side vulnerabilities.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a manual code review of the relevant Synapse codebase, focusing on the areas identified in the Scope section.  We will use static analysis tools (e.g., linters, security-focused code analyzers) to assist in identifying potential vulnerabilities.  We will specifically look for:
    *   Insufficient or incorrect use of `os.path.join()`, `os.path.abspath()`, and related functions.
    *   Missing or bypassable checks for ".." sequences, leading and trailing slashes, null bytes, and other special characters.
    *   Inconsistent handling of filenames across different parts of the codebase.
    *   Reliance on client-side validation without server-side enforcement.
    *   Use of unsafe file system operations.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):** We will use fuzzing techniques to test the file upload functionality with a wide range of crafted filenames.  This will involve:
    *   Generating a large number of filenames containing various combinations of special characters, path traversal sequences ("../", "..\\"), long filenames, Unicode characters, and other potentially problematic inputs.
    *   Using a fuzzer (e.g., `wfuzz`, `radamsa`, custom scripts) to send these filenames to the Synapse server via the relevant API endpoints.
    *   Monitoring the server's response and file system for any unexpected behavior, such as:
        *   Successful uploads to unintended directories.
        *   Error messages indicating insufficient sanitization.
        *   Server crashes or hangs.
        *   Changes to file permissions or ownership.

3.  **Penetration Testing:** We will attempt to manually exploit any potential vulnerabilities identified during code review or fuzzing.  This will involve:
    *   Crafting specific payloads designed to bypass identified sanitization mechanisms.
    *   Attempting to overwrite critical system files or configuration files.
    *   Attempting to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by uploading malicious files (e.g., Python scripts) to executable locations.

4.  **Review of Existing Documentation and Security Advisories:** We will review Synapse's official documentation, security advisories, and any relevant community discussions to identify any previously reported path traversal vulnerabilities or related issues.

5.  **Configuration Review:** We will examine the default Synapse configuration and any recommended security configurations to identify any settings that could impact the risk of path traversal.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 2.2.3.1 (Path Traversal)

**4.1. Initial Assessment (Based on Attack Tree):**

The attack tree provides a good starting point:

*   **Impact (Very High):**  Agreed.  Successful path traversal leading to arbitrary file writes can allow an attacker to overwrite critical files, potentially leading to RCE, data breaches, or complete system compromise.
*   **Likelihood (Low):**  This is the key area for investigation.  While Synapse *should* sanitize filenames, we need to verify this rigorously.  The "low" likelihood is an assumption that needs to be validated.
*   **Effort (Medium):**  Reasonable.  Crafting effective payloads may require some experimentation, but the basic principles of path traversal are well-understood.
*   **Skill Level (Intermediate):**  Agreed.  Requires knowledge of path traversal techniques and basic understanding of web application security.
*   **Detection Difficulty (Medium):**  Agreed.  Requires monitoring file system access and potentially analyzing web server logs.  Sophisticated attackers might try to obfuscate their actions.

**4.2. Code Review Findings (Hypothetical Examples & Areas of Focus):**

This section would contain specific code snippets and analysis from the Synapse codebase.  Since we don't have access to the live code during this exercise, I'll provide *hypothetical* examples of the types of vulnerabilities we would look for and how we would analyze them.

**Example 1: Insufficient Sanitization**

```python
# Hypothetical vulnerable code in Synapse
def handle_upload(filename, file_data):
    # BAD: Only removes leading "../" sequences.
    sanitized_filename = filename.lstrip("../")
    upload_path = os.path.join("/var/lib/synapse/uploads", sanitized_filename)
    with open(upload_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(file_data)
```

**Analysis:** This code is vulnerable because it only removes leading "../" sequences.  An attacker could use a filename like `foo/../../etc/passwd` to bypass the sanitization and write to `/etc/passwd`.  The `lstrip()` function only removes characters from the beginning of the string.

**Example 2:  Missing `os.path.abspath()` and `os.path.commonpath()`**

```python
# Hypothetical vulnerable code in Synapse
def handle_upload(filename, file_data):
    upload_dir = "/var/lib/synapse/uploads"
    upload_path = os.path.join(upload_dir, filename)
    # BAD: Does not check if the resulting path is still within the upload directory.
    with open(upload_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(file_data)
```

**Analysis:** This code is vulnerable because it doesn't verify that the final `upload_path` is actually within the intended `upload_dir`.  An attacker could use a filename like `../../etc/passwd` to escape the upload directory.  The correct approach would be to use `os.path.abspath()` to resolve the absolute path and then `os.path.commonpath()` to ensure that the upload directory is a prefix of the resolved path:

```python
# Hypothetical corrected code
def handle_upload(filename, file_data):
    upload_dir = "/var/lib/synapse/uploads"
    upload_path = os.path.join(upload_dir, filename)
    absolute_upload_path = os.path.abspath(upload_path)
    absolute_upload_dir = os.path.abspath(upload_dir)

    if os.path.commonpath([absolute_upload_dir, absolute_upload_path]) != absolute_upload_dir:
        raise ValueError("Invalid filename: Path traversal attempt detected.")

    with open(absolute_upload_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(file_data)
```

**Example 3:  Unicode Normalization Issues**

```python
# Hypothetical vulnerable code
def sanitize_filename(filename):
  # BAD: Does not handle Unicode normalization forms.
  return filename.replace("..", "")
```

**Analysis:**  An attacker might be able to bypass simple string replacements by using different Unicode normalization forms.  For example, the characters ".." might be represented in a different form that is not caught by the `replace()` function.  A robust solution would involve normalizing the filename to a consistent form (e.g., NFC or NFKC) before performing any sanitization.

**Example 4: Null Byte Injection**

```python
# Hypothetical vulnerable code
def handle_upload(filename, file_data):
    if not filename.endswith(".jpg"):
        raise ValueError("Only JPG files are allowed.")
    #BAD: vulnerable to null byte injection
    upload_path = os.path.join("/var/lib/synapse/uploads", filename)
    with open(upload_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(file_data)
```
**Analysis:** An attacker could upload file with name `../../../foo.php%00.jpg`. The check `filename.endswith(".jpg")` will pass, but `open()` function will truncate filename after null byte, so `../../../foo.php` will be written.

**4.3. Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing) Results (Hypothetical):**

This section would document the results of fuzzing the Synapse API.  Examples:

*   **Test Case 1:**  Filename: `../../../../etc/passwd`
    *   **Expected Result:**  Error (400 Bad Request or similar), no file written outside the upload directory.
    *   **Actual Result (Hypothetical Vulnerability):**  200 OK, file written to `/etc/passwd`.  **CRITICAL VULNERABILITY FOUND!**
*   **Test Case 2:**  Filename: `foo/bar/../baz.txt`
    *   **Expected Result:**  File written to `/var/lib/synapse/uploads/foo/baz.txt` (assuming `foo` and `baz.txt` are valid).
    *   **Actual Result:**  As expected.
*   **Test Case 3:**  Filename: `\u202e/etc/passwd` (using a right-to-left override character)
    *   **Expected Result:**  Error or proper sanitization.
    *   **Actual Result (Hypothetical Vulnerability):**  File written to a location determined by the server's handling of the Unicode character.  **POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY!**
* **Test Case 4:** Filename: `valid_file.jpg%00../../../malicious.php`
    * **Expected Result:** Error or proper sanitization
    * **Actual Result (Hypothetical Vulnerability):** File written to a location determined by the server's handling of null byte. **POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY!**

**4.4. Penetration Testing (Hypothetical Exploitation):**

Based on the hypothetical vulnerabilities found above, we would attempt to exploit them.  For example:

*   **Exploiting Example 1:**  We would successfully overwrite `/etc/passwd` with a crafted file, potentially adding a new user with root privileges.
*   **Exploiting Example 3:**  We would investigate the server's behavior with the Unicode character and attempt to find a way to write to a sensitive location.

**4.5. Configuration Review:**

We would examine Synapse's configuration file (`homeserver.yaml`) for settings related to:

*   `media_store_path`:  The base directory for storing media files.  We would ensure this directory has appropriate permissions (not world-writable).
*   `max_upload_size`:  While not directly related to path traversal, a large upload size could exacerbate the impact of a successful attack.
*   Any custom modules or configurations that might affect file uploads.

**4.6. Mitigation Recommendations:**

Based on the findings (hypothetical in this case, but would be concrete in a real analysis), we would provide specific recommendations, such as:

1.  **Use `os.path.abspath()` and `os.path.commonpath()`:**  Always validate that the resolved absolute path of the uploaded file is within the intended upload directory.
2.  **Comprehensive Sanitization:**  Implement a robust sanitization function that handles:
    *   Leading and trailing "../" sequences.
    *   Multiple consecutive slashes.
    *   Null bytes.
    *   Unicode normalization.
    *   Invalid characters (e.g., control characters).
    *   Potentially dangerous file extensions (if applicable).
3.  **Whitelist, Not Blacklist:**  If possible, define a whitelist of allowed characters for filenames, rather than trying to blacklist all potentially dangerous characters.
4.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular code reviews and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
5.  **Stay Up-to-Date:**  Keep Synapse and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
6.  **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the Synapse process runs with the least necessary privileges.  It should not run as root.
7. **Input validation:** Validate file extension before saving file.
8. **File System Permissions:** Configure strict file system permissions on the upload directory to prevent unauthorized access or modification.

## 5. Conclusion

This deep analysis provides a framework for thoroughly investigating path traversal vulnerabilities in Synapse.  By combining code review, dynamic analysis, penetration testing, and configuration review, we can identify and mitigate potential weaknesses, significantly improving the security of Synapse deployments. The hypothetical examples illustrate the types of vulnerabilities that can exist and the importance of rigorous security practices.  A real-world analysis would involve applying these techniques to the actual Synapse codebase and configuration.

This detailed markdown provides a comprehensive analysis framework. Remember that the "Code Review Findings" and "Dynamic Analysis Results" sections contain *hypothetical* examples. A real analysis would require access to the Synapse source code and a testing environment. The methodology and recommendations, however, are directly applicable to a real-world assessment.
