# Attack Surface Analysis for matrix-org/synapse

## Attack Surface: [Client-Server API Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/client-server_api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in Synapse's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **How Synapse Contributes:** Synapse implements its own authentication logic and integrates with various authentication providers (e.g., password, SSO). Vulnerabilities in this implementation or integration can lead to bypasses.
    *   **Example:** A flaw in the password reset flow allows an attacker to reset another user's password without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Full account takeover, access to private messages, ability to send messages as the compromised user, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust and well-tested authentication logic adhering to security best practices.
            *   Regularly audit authentication code for vulnerabilities.
            *   Enforce strong password policies.
            *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) options.
            *   Securely handle and store authentication credentials.
            *   Thoroughly test integrations with third-party authentication providers.
        *   **Users/Admins:**
            *   Enable and enforce MFA for all users.
            *   Educate users on strong password practices.
            *   Regularly review and update authentication configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Federation API Malicious Event Injection](./attack_surfaces/federation_api_malicious_event_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  A malicious actor on a federated Matrix server crafts and injects events that exploit vulnerabilities in Synapse's event processing logic.
    *   **How Synapse Contributes:** Synapse handles and processes events received from other federated servers. Weaknesses in event validation or state resolution can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted event causes a denial-of-service on the Synapse server by consuming excessive resources during processing.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service, data corruption, manipulation of room state, potential for remote code execution if event processing vulnerabilities are severe.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust event validation according to the Matrix specification.
            *   Sanitize event content to prevent injection attacks.
            *   Implement rate limiting on federation traffic.
            *   Thoroughly test event processing logic for edge cases and vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement mechanisms to isolate or quarantine potentially malicious events.
        *   **Users/Admins:**
            *   Monitor federation traffic for suspicious activity.
            *   Consider restricting federation with untrusted or known malicious servers.
            *   Keep Synapse updated to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Admin API Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/admin_api_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Synapse Admin API to gain unauthorized administrative privileges.
    *   **How Synapse Contributes:** Synapse provides an Admin API for managing the server. Flaws in authentication or authorization for these endpoints can allow unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** A bug in the Admin API allows a regular user to call an endpoint that should only be accessible to server administrators, granting them elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the Synapse server, ability to manipulate user data, access private information, potentially compromise the entire system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict authentication and authorization controls for all Admin API endpoints.
            *   Regularly audit Admin API code for vulnerabilities.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing administrative roles and permissions.
            *   Implement logging and monitoring of Admin API access.
        *   **Users/Admins:**
            *   Restrict access to the Admin API to only trusted administrators.
            *   Use strong, unique passwords for administrator accounts.
            *   Regularly review administrator account permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Federation API Server Impersonation](./attack_surfaces/federation_api_server_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the federation protocol to impersonate another Matrix server.
    *   **How Synapse Contributes:** Synapse relies on the federation protocol for inter-server communication. Vulnerabilities in how Synapse verifies the identity of other servers can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor sets up a server that pretends to be a legitimate federated server, allowing them to inject malicious events or intercept communication.
    *   **Impact:** Injection of malicious events, manipulation of room state, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks on federated communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Strictly adhere to the Matrix federation specification for server verification.
            *   Implement robust mechanisms for verifying the authenticity of federated servers.
            *   Consider implementing certificate pinning or similar techniques.
        *   **Users/Admins:**
            *   Monitor federation connections for suspicious activity.
            *   Be cautious about federating with unknown or untrusted servers.
