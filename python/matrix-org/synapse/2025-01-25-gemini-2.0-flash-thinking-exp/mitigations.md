# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for matrix-org/synapse

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Federation Controls](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_federation_controls.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access `homeserver.yaml`:** Locate and open the `homeserver.yaml` configuration file for your Synapse instance.
    2.  **Configure `federation_domain_whitelist`:** Add the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting to the `homeserver.yaml` file. Populate this list with the domain names of Matrix servers you explicitly trust and need to federate with. For example:
        ```yaml
        federation_domain_whitelist:
            - "matrix.org"
            - "example.com"
        ```
    3.  **Optional: Configure `federation_domain_blacklist`:** If needed, add `federation_domain_blacklist` to block specific domains. This is less common if using a whitelist but can be used for known malicious servers.
    4.  **Restart Synapse:** Restart the Synapse service for the configuration changes to take effect.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update:** Schedule periodic reviews of the whitelist and blacklist to ensure they remain relevant and secure as the Matrix ecosystem evolves.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Federation Partners (High Severity):**  Compromised or malicious federated servers could send malicious events, attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in your Synapse instance, or leak data.
        *   **Federation Spam/Abuse (Medium Severity):**  Open federation can lead to spam or abuse from unwanted servers, potentially impacting performance and user experience.
        *   **Unintended Data Exposure (Medium Severity):**  Federating with untrusted servers increases the risk of unintended data exposure if those servers are insecure or malicious.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Federation Partners:**  Significantly reduces risk by limiting connections to vetted servers.
        *   **Federation Spam/Abuse:**  Effectively eliminates spam and abuse from servers not on the whitelist.
        *   **Unintended Data Exposure:**  Reduces risk by controlling data flow to trusted partners.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `federation_domain_whitelist` configuration is present in `homeserver.yaml` but currently empty, effectively allowing open federation.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Populating `federation_domain_whitelist` with a curated list of trusted domains based on project requirements and risk assessment. Regular review process for the list is not yet defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limit Inbound Federation Traffic](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limit_inbound_federation_traffic.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Rate Limiting in Synapse:**  Synapse has built-in rate limiting configurations.  Adjust settings in `homeserver.yaml` under the `federation_ratelimiter` section. Key settings include `window_size`, `burst_count`, and `decay_rate`.
    2.  **Start with Conservative Limits:** Begin with conservative rate limits and monitor federation traffic. Gradually adjust limits based on observed traffic patterns and performance. Example configuration:
        ```yaml
        federation_ratelimiter:
            window_size: 10  # seconds
            burst_count: 100 # requests
            decay_rate: 0.1 # fraction of burst_count to allow per window_size
        ```
    3.  **Monitor Federation Logs:** Regularly monitor Synapse federation logs for rate limiting events and adjust configurations as needed.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Federation Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Malicious federated servers can flood your Synapse instance with requests, causing resource exhaustion and service unavailability.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Federation Denial of Service (DoS):**  Significantly reduces risk by limiting the rate of inbound federation requests, preventing resource exhaustion from malicious servers.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic rate limiting is enabled in `homeserver.yaml` with default Synapse settings.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Rate limiting settings need to be tuned based on observed federation traffic patterns and performance testing. Monitoring of federation rate limiting events in logs is not actively performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Federation Event Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_federation_event_size_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `max_event_size`:**  Set the `max_event_size` configuration option in `homeserver.yaml` under the `federation` section. This limits the maximum size of events accepted from federation. Choose a reasonable limit based on your expected event sizes. Example:
        ```yaml
        federation:
            max_event_size: 1048576 # 1MB (in bytes)
        ```
    2.  **Restart Synapse:** Restart Synapse for the configuration to take effect.
    3.  **Monitor for Rejected Events:** Monitor Synapse logs for events rejected due to exceeding the size limit. Adjust the limit if legitimate events are being rejected, but maintain a reasonable maximum.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Federation Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Malicious servers can send excessively large events designed to consume excessive resources (memory, CPU) on your Synapse instance, leading to performance degradation or DoS.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Federation Resource Exhaustion:**  Significantly reduces risk by preventing processing of excessively large events, protecting server resources.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. `max_event_size` is configured in `homeserver.yaml` with a default value.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  The configured `max_event_size` value has not been reviewed and tuned based on expected event sizes and resource constraints. Monitoring for rejected events due to size limits is not actively performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limit Client API Requests](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limit_client_api_requests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Client Rate Limiting in Synapse:** Synapse provides extensive client rate limiting options in `homeserver.yaml` under the `rc_client` section. Configure rate limits for various API endpoints like registration, login, message sending, etc.
    2.  **Define Rate Limit Categories:**  Categorize API endpoints and apply different rate limits based on their sensitivity and resource consumption. For example, registration and login might have stricter limits than message sending.
    3.  **Use `rules` and `default_rules`:**  Utilize the `rules` and `default_rules` sections in `rc_client` to define specific rate limits for different API paths and user types.
    4.  **Start with Moderate Limits and Monitor:** Begin with moderate rate limits and monitor client API usage and performance. Adjust limits based on observed traffic and legitimate user needs.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Client API Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Attackers can flood client API endpoints with requests, causing resource exhaustion and service unavailability for legitimate users.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting login and registration endpoints mitigates brute-force password guessing and account creation attempts.
        *   **Resource Abuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents abuse of resource-intensive API endpoints by malicious users or bots.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Client API Denial of Service (DoS):**  Significantly reduces risk by limiting the rate of client API requests, preventing resource exhaustion.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Effectively mitigates brute-force attempts by slowing down attackers.
        *   **Resource Abuse:**  Reduces the impact of resource-abusing clients.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic client rate limiting is enabled in `homeserver.yaml` with default Synapse settings.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed configuration of `rc_client` with specific rules for different API endpoints and user types is missing. Rate limits are not tuned based on observed client traffic patterns.

        *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):**  Lack of caching can lead to excessive database load and slow response times, impacting user experience.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Excessive database queries due to lack of caching can lead to database resource exhaustion and potential DoS.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Performance Degradation:**  Improves performance and responsiveness by reducing database load.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Reduces risk by minimizing database queries and resource consumption.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Synapse's default caching mechanisms are enabled.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Cache sizes are not tuned based on performance monitoring. Cache hit rates are not monitored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Password Policy in Synapse:**  Configure password policy settings in `homeserver.yaml` under the `password_policy` section. Define minimum password length, complexity requirements (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and password history restrictions.
    2.  **Enforce Policy During Registration and Password Change:** Ensure that Synapse enforces the configured password policy during user registration and password change processes.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Password-Based Account Compromise (High Severity):** Weak passwords are easily guessable through brute-force or dictionary attacks, leading to unauthorized account access.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Password-Based Account Compromise:**  Significantly reduces risk by making passwords harder to guess.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic password policy settings (minimum length) are configured in `homeserver.yaml`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  More comprehensive password policy settings (complexity, history) are not configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable MFA in Synapse:** Enable MFA support in `homeserver.yaml` under the `mfa` section. Configure supported MFA methods (e.g., TOTP, WebAuthn).

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** MFA significantly reduces the risk of account takeover even if passwords are compromised, as attackers need access to a second factor.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Account Takeover:**  Drastically reduces risk by adding a strong second layer of security.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. MFA is not enabled in Synapse.
