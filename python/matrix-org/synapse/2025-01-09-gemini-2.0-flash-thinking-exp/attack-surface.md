# Attack Surface Analysis for matrix-org/synapse

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in the Matrix Federation Protocol](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_the_matrix_federation_protocol.md)

- **Description:** The protocol used for communication between different Matrix homeservers can have vulnerabilities that allow malicious actors to inject data, disrupt communication, or impersonate servers.
    - **How Synapse Contributes:** Synapse's implementation of the Matrix Federation Protocol determines how it handles incoming and outgoing federation traffic, including event validation and signature verification. Vulnerabilities in this implementation can be exploited.
    - **Example:** A malicious homeserver could send a crafted event with a forged signature that Synapse incorrectly validates, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions within a room hosted on the Synapse instance.
    - **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, information injection, potential for wider network disruption.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Adhere strictly to the Matrix Federation Protocol specification. Implement robust event validation and signature verification. Regularly review and update the federation implementation based on protocol updates and security advisories. Implement rate limiting and input sanitization for federation traffic.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Federation](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_federation.md)

- **Description:** An attacker controlling a federated server could trick the Synapse instance into making requests to internal or external resources that it shouldn't have access to.
    - **How Synapse Contributes:** Synapse's federation process involves making requests to other homeservers. If not properly controlled, a malicious federated server could influence the URLs Synapse requests.
    - **Example:** A malicious homeserver could send a request to Synapse that causes it to make a request to an internal network resource, potentially exposing internal services or data.
    - **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for URLs used in federation requests. Use allow-lists for permitted external domains if feasible. Avoid directly using user-provided data in federation request URLs.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Media API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_media_api_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** The API for uploading and downloading media files can have vulnerabilities allowing for unauthorized access, manipulation, or injection of malicious content.
    - **How Synapse Contributes:** Synapse's implementation of the Media API handles file uploads, storage, and retrieval. Vulnerabilities in this implementation, such as insufficient input validation or improper handling of file types, can be exploited.
    - **Example:** An attacker could upload a malicious file with an executable extension that is then served to other users, potentially leading to client-side exploits. Alternatively, path traversal vulnerabilities could allow access to files outside the intended media directory.
    - **Impact:** Client-side attacks, information disclosure, potential for server compromise through malicious file uploads.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Implement robust input validation for file uploads, including file type, size, and content checks. Sanitize filenames and prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Store uploaded files in a secure location with appropriate access controls. Implement content security policies (CSP) to mitigate client-side execution risks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Implemented Authentication Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_implemented_authentication_mechanisms.md)

- **Description:** Weaknesses in how Synapse handles user authentication can lead to unauthorized access.
    - **How Synapse Contributes:** Synapse implements various authentication methods (e.g., password-based, SSO). Vulnerabilities in these implementations can be exploited.
    - **Example:** A flaw in the password reset process could allow an attacker to reset another user's password. Weak enforcement of password policies could make brute-force attacks easier.
    - **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Implement strong password policies and enforce them. Use secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2). Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). Securely handle session management and prevent session fixation attacks. Regularly review and test authentication logic for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Third-Party Modules or Integrations](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_third-party_modules_or_integrations.md)

- **Description:** If Synapse is extended with third-party modules or integrations, vulnerabilities in these components can introduce new attack vectors.
    - **How Synapse Contributes:** Synapse's architecture allows for extensions. If these extensions are not developed securely, they can be exploited to compromise the Synapse instance.
    - **Example:** A poorly written third-party module might have an SQL injection vulnerability that could be exploited to access or modify the Synapse database.
    - **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from data breaches to complete server compromise.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:**  Follow secure development practices when creating third-party modules. Implement proper input validation and output encoding. Avoid running third-party code with excessive privileges.
