# Threat Model Analysis for matrix-org/synapse

## Threat: [Malicious Federated Server Sending Crafted Events](./threats/malicious_federated_server_sending_crafted_events.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker controlling a federated Matrix server crafts a malicious Matrix event. This event could exploit a parsing vulnerability in Synapse's event handling code. The attacker sends this event to the target Synapse server via the federation protocol.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (crashing the server), information disclosure (reading sensitive data from memory), or potentially remote code execution on the Synapse server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Synapse Federation event processing module, specifically the functions responsible for parsing and validating incoming events.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all incoming federated events.
        *   Keep Synapse updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a federation firewall or similar mechanism to filter incoming events based on reputation or other criteria.

## Threat: [Information Leakage to Malicious Federated Servers](./threats/information_leakage_to_malicious_federated_servers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker operates a malicious Matrix server and joins a room hosted on the target Synapse server. As users on the target server interact in the room, the malicious server receives information about room membership, messages, and potentially user profiles through the standard federation mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of private conversations, user identities, and other sensitive information to the attacker operating the malicious server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Synapse Federation module, specifically the components responsible for sharing room state and messages with other servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Educate users about the risks of interacting with users on untrusted servers.
        *   Implement features to allow users to block or ignore users from specific servers.
        *   Consider implementing server ACLs to restrict federation with known malicious or untrusted servers.
        *   Utilize end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to protect message content from being read by federated servers.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Federation Requests](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_federation_requests.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker controls multiple federated servers and floods the target Synapse server with a large volume of federation requests (e.g., for missing events, room state). This overwhelms the target server's resources.
    *   **Impact:** The Synapse server becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Synapse Federation module, particularly the components handling incoming federation requests and state resolution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on incoming federation requests.
        *   Implement mechanisms to identify and block or temporarily ban servers sending excessive requests.
        *   Optimize Synapse's federation handling code for performance.

## Threat: [Insecure Password Reset Mechanism](./threats/insecure_password_reset_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Synapse's password reset process could allow an attacker to reset a user's password without proper authorization, for example, by exploiting predictable reset tokens or insecure email verification.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover and unauthorized access to user data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Synapse Password Reset module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens.
        *   Ensure proper verification of the user's identity via email or other secure methods before allowing a password reset.
        *   Implement rate limiting on password reset requests.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Synapse](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_synapse.md)

*   **Description:** A bug in Synapse's permission model or access control logic could allow a regular user to perform actions that require higher privileges, potentially gaining administrative access.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Synapse instance, including the ability to access and modify all data, create or delete users, and change server configurations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Synapse User Management and Authorization modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement thorough testing and code reviews of the permission model and access control logic.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.
        *   Regularly audit user permissions and roles.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Room History Access Control Issues](./threats/information_disclosure_via_room_history_access_control_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in how Synapse manages room history visibility and access control could lead to unauthorized users viewing past messages they should not have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of private conversations and sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Synapse Room Management and History Storage modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement strict access controls on room history.
        *   Ensure that users joining a room only have access to the intended history.
        *   Thoroughly test changes to room history access control logic.

## Threat: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Messages](./threats/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_messages.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious user injects malicious Javascript code into a message. When other users view this message through a vulnerable Matrix client, the script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim. Synapse's role is in storing and serving this malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, and other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's client.
    *   **Affected Component:** Synapse Message Storage and Retrieval modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   While primarily a client-side issue, Synapse can implement server-side sanitization of message content to remove potentially malicious scripts (though this can break legitimate formatting).
        *   Encourage users to use secure and up-to-date Matrix clients that properly sanitize and render messages.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on the Synapse web interface (if used) to mitigate client-side XSS.

## Threat: [Insecure Media Storage or Access Controls](./threats/insecure_media_storage_or_access_controls.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Synapse stores or controls access to uploaded media files could allow unauthorized users to access or modify media.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of private images, videos, and other files.
    *   **Affected Component:** Synapse Media Storage and Access Control modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure storage mechanisms for media files.
        *   Enforce proper access controls to ensure only authorized users can access specific media.
        *   Consider using a separate storage backend with its own security measures.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to the Admin API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_the_admin_api.md)

*   **Description:** If the Synapse Admin API is not properly secured (e.g., weak authentication, exposed without proper network restrictions), attackers could gain unauthorized access to administrative functions.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Synapse instance, including user management, configuration changes, and data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Synapse Admin API module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Admin API with strong authentication (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
        *   Restrict access to the Admin API to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Regularly audit access to the Admin API.
