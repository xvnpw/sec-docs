## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Federation Controls](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_federation_controls.md)

### 1. Implement Strict Federation Controls

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Federation Controls (Domain Whitelisting/Blacklisting)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Trusted Domains:** Determine the Matrix servers your Synapse instance needs to federate with.
    2.  **Configure `federation_domain_whitelist`:** In your `homeserver.yaml` configuration file, set the `federation_domain_whitelist` option to a list of these trusted domains. Only federation requests from these domains will be accepted by Synapse.
    3.  **Alternatively, Configure `federation_domain_blacklist`:** If whitelisting is impractical, use `federation_domain_blacklist` in `homeserver.yaml` to block known malicious or untrusted domains from federating with your Synapse instance.
    4.  **Regularly Review and Update:** Periodically review and update the whitelist or blacklist in `homeserver.yaml` as trust relationships change.
    5.  **Restart Synapse:** Restart the Synapse service for the configuration changes to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Federation Spam/Abuse (Medium - High):** Prevents unwanted rooms, messages, and user reports from untrusted servers interacting with your Synapse instance.
    *   **Federation-Based DoS/DDoS (Medium):** Limits the attack surface of your Synapse instance by restricting federation connections.
    *   **Exposure to Vulnerable Federated Servers (Medium):** Reduces the risk of your Synapse instance interacting with vulnerable or malicious external servers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Federation Spam/Abuse (High):**  Significantly reduces spam and abuse originating from external Matrix servers on your Synapse instance.
    *   **Federation-Based DoS/DDoS (Medium):** Moderately reduces the risk of federation-based DoS/DDoS attacks targeting your Synapse instance.
    *   **Exposure to Vulnerable Federated Servers (Medium):** Moderately reduces risk to your Synapse instance, depending on the whitelist/blacklist comprehensiveness.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Synapse provides `federation_domain_whitelist` and `federation_domain_blacklist` configuration options directly within `homeserver.yaml`.
    *   **Location:** Configuration is done in the `homeserver.yaml` file of your Synapse instance.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Proactive Whitelist Management within Synapse UI/API:** Lack of built-in Synapse UI or Admin API for easier, dynamic management of the federation whitelist/blacklist.
    *   **Automated Domain Reputation Integration within Synapse:**  No direct integration within Synapse to automatically update the blacklist based on domain reputation services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limit Federation Requests](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limit_federation_requests.md)
