- **Vulnerability Name:** HTTP Response Splitting in Custom Redirect Handling  
  **Description:**  
  In the file `/code/extra_views_tests/views.py`, the `OrderCreateView` class overrides its `form_valid` method to modify the redirect response as follows:  
  ```python
  def form_valid(self, form):
      response = super().form_valid(form)
      response["Location"] += "?form_valid_called=1"
      return response
  ```  
  Here, the `get_success_url()` (called by the parent method) falls back to using `self.request.get_full_path()` when no explicit `success_url` is defined. Because the full request path (including query string) is derived from external user input, an attacker could supply malicious characters (for example, CRLF sequences) in the URL. These characters would then be concatenated directly into the `Location` header, possibly allowing header injection or HTTP response splitting. The exploitation steps might be:  
  1. An attacker crafts a URL with a payload—e.g., including `%0d%0aInjectedHeader:value`—in its query string.  
  2. The malicious URL is passed as the request’s full path, and, after form submission, the response header is set to this unsanitized value with the appended query string.  
  3. If the header value is not validated or sanitized, the attacker may inject rogue HTTP headers.  
  **Impact:**  
  - HTTP response splitting may lead to header injection, which can be used for cache poisoning, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other client-side attacks.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - None; there is no sanitization or validation of the URL as it is used directly in the response header.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Sanitize or validate the return value from `request.get_full_path()` before using it.  
  - Use proper URL-building functions rather than raw string‑concatenation when constructing redirect locations.  
  - Enforce strict checks that disallow newline or carriage-return characters in header values.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to control part of the request’s URL (for example, by supplying a malicious query string).  
  - The application uses the default behavior where `success_url` is not set, causing `get_full_path()` to be used directly.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The `OrderCreateView` in `/code/extra_views_tests/views.py` does not override `get_success_url()`, so it inherits the behavior of `FormSetMixin.get_success_url()`, which returns `self.request.get_full_path()` when no explicit URL is provided.  
  - In the override of `form_valid`, the code simply concatenates an extra query string (`"?form_valid_called=1"`) without sanitizing the original Location value.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Craft a URL request such as:  
     ```
     /inlines/new/?malicious=%0d%0aInjectedHeader:value
     ```  
  2. Submit a valid POST request to create an order using this URL.  
  3. Capture and inspect the HTTP redirect response (particularly the `Location` header).  
  4. Check whether the injected CRLF sequence results in an extra header (e.g. “InjectedHeader”) being present.  
  5. A positive result confirms that unsanitized user input is being used in header construction, thus proving the vulnerability.
