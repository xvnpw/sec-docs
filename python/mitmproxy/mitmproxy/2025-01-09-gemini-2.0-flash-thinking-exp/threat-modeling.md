# Threat Model Analysis for mitmproxy/mitmproxy

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Exposure](./threats/insecure_configuration_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the `mitmproxy` configuration files (e.g., `config.yaml`, scripts) which might contain sensitive information like API keys, internal network details, or custom script logic. This could happen through misconfigured file permissions, exposed development environments, or compromised developer machines. The attacker could then leverage this information to compromise the application or other systems.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data can lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, external services, or the application itself. Malicious actors could understand the application's internal workings and identify further vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Loading Module, potentially Addons/Scripting components if secrets are within scripts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store sensitive configuration parameters (like API keys) outside of `mitmproxy` configuration files, using environment variables or secure vault solutions.
* Implement strict access controls on `mitmproxy` configuration files and directories.
* Avoid committing sensitive configuration files to version control systems.
* Regularly review and audit `mitmproxy` configurations.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to mitmweb/API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_mitmwebapi.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `mitmweb` interface or the `mitmproxy` API. This could be due to weak or default credentials, lack of authentication, or network exposure of the `mitmproxy` instance itself. Once accessed, the attacker can view intercepted traffic, manipulate flows, or potentially execute arbitrary code if scripting capabilities are exposed without proper authorization through `mitmproxy`.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of intercepted data, potential for data manipulation through `mitmproxy`, injection of malicious content into intercepted traffic, and disruption of development activities.

**Affected Component:** `mitmweb` module, API endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable and enforce strong authentication for `mitmweb` and the API (e.g., username/password, API keys).
* Restrict network access to the `mitmproxy` instance, including `mitmweb` and the API, to authorized users and IP addresses.
* Regularly change default credentials for `mitmproxy`.
* Consider disabling `mitmweb` or the API when not actively in use.

## Threat: [Malicious Addon/Script Execution](./threats/malicious_addonscript_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects a malicious addon or script into the `mitmproxy` environment. This could happen through compromised developer machines, insecure script repositories, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in `mitmproxy`'s addon loading mechanism. The malicious script, running within the `mitmproxy` process, could intercept and exfiltrate data passing through `mitmproxy`, modify traffic for malicious purposes, or compromise the system running `mitmproxy`.

**Impact:**  Data breaches of intercepted traffic, data manipulation within intercepted requests/responses, system compromise of the machine running `mitmproxy`, and potential for further attacks on the application or network by leveraging `mitmproxy`'s position.

**Affected Component:** Addons/Scripting module, Event Hooks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only load addons and scripts from trusted sources.
* Implement code review processes for custom addons and scripts before deployment to `mitmproxy`.
* Use digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of addons used with `mitmproxy`.
* Restrict permissions for writing to the `mitmproxy` addons directory.
* Regularly audit installed addons and scripts within the `mitmproxy` environment.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Intercepted Traffic](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_intercepted_traffic.md)

**Description:**  `mitmproxy` captures sensitive data (credentials, API keys, personal information, etc.) within the intercepted HTTP/HTTPS traffic. If the `mitmproxy` instance, its logs, or flow history are not handled securely, this data could be exposed to unauthorized individuals who gain access to the `mitmproxy` environment. This could occur through accidental sharing of `mitmproxy` data, insecure storage of `mitmproxy` data, or a breach of the system running `mitmproxy`.

**Impact:**  Data breaches, privacy violations, and potential regulatory compliance issues due to the exposure of sensitive data handled by `mitmproxy`.

**Affected Component:** Core Proxy Logic (flow interception), Flow Storage (files, memory), Logging module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Educate developers on the risks of exposing sensitive data during debugging with `mitmproxy`.
* Implement filters or scripts within `mitmproxy` to automatically redact or mask sensitive information in captured traffic.
* Securely store `mitmproxy` flow data, using encryption and access controls on the system where `mitmproxy` runs.
* Implement policies for regularly purging or anonymizing captured data within `mitmproxy`.
* Avoid sharing raw `mitmproxy` flow files containing sensitive information.

## Threat: [Accidental Deployment in Production](./threats/accidental_deployment_in_production.md)

**Description:**  The `mitmproxy` tool or its components are unintentionally deployed or left running in a production environment. This causes all production traffic to be intercepted by `mitmproxy`, posing a significant security risk as the tool is not intended for production use.

**Impact:**  Massive data breach as production traffic is exposed through `mitmproxy`, exposure of sensitive user data, potential for manipulation of production traffic via `mitmproxy`, and severe regulatory compliance violations.

**Affected Component:** Entire `mitmproxy` installation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict separation between development and production environments to prevent `mitmproxy` from being present in production.
* Automate deployment processes with checks to prevent the inclusion of development tools like `mitmproxy` in production deployments.
* Regularly audit production systems for unexpected software installations, including `mitmproxy`.
* Use infrastructure-as-code and configuration management tools to ensure consistent and secure deployments that exclude `mitmproxy` from production.
