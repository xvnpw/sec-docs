# Attack Surface Analysis for mitmproxy/mitmproxy

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Mitmproxy Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_mitmproxy_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Mitmproxy is configured in a way that exposes its control interfaces or allows for unintended access or behavior.
    *   **How Mitmproxy Contributes:** Mitmproxy provides various configuration options, and improper settings can directly lead to vulnerabilities. This includes how it listens for connections, authenticates access, and handles upstream proxies.
    *   **Example:** Running mitmproxy with default API keys and exposing the web interface on a public network without authentication allows attackers to inspect and manipulate intercepted traffic.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to intercepted data, manipulation of network traffic, potential compromise of systems interacting with mitmproxy.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure strong authentication for mitmproxy's web interface and API (if enabled).
        *   Restrict access to mitmproxy's listening ports using firewalls or network segmentation.
        *   Avoid using default API keys or credentials; generate strong, unique values.
        *   Securely store and manage mitmproxy's configuration files.
        *   Regularly review and audit mitmproxy configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Mitmproxy Add-ons](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_mitmproxy_add-ons.md)

*   **Description:**  Third-party or custom-developed mitmproxy add-ons contain malicious code or security vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    *   **How Mitmproxy Contributes:** Mitmproxy's extensibility through add-ons introduces the risk of incorporating insecure code. Mitmproxy executes these add-ons with the same privileges as the core application.
    *   **Example:** An attacker installs a malicious add-on that intercepts sensitive data and sends it to an external server or modifies intercepted traffic to inject malware. A vulnerable add-on might have a remote code execution flaw.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, compromise of the mitmproxy instance, potential compromise of the application and connected systems, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party mitmproxy add-ons before installation.
        *   Implement code review processes for custom-developed add-ons, focusing on security best practices.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies of add-ons, addressing known vulnerabilities.
        *   Run mitmproxy with the least privileges necessary for its operation.
        *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate mitmproxy and its add-ons.

## Attack Surface: [Insecurely Written Mitmproxy Scripts](./attack_surfaces/insecurely_written_mitmproxy_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Custom scripts used with mitmproxy contain security vulnerabilities due to poor coding practices.
    *   **How Mitmproxy Contributes:** Mitmproxy allows for scripting to automate tasks and modify traffic. Insecure scripts can be a direct entry point for attacks.
    *   **Example:** A script that logs intercepted data without proper sanitization could be vulnerable to log injection attacks. A script that makes external API calls without validating responses could be tricked into performing unintended actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of intercepted traffic, potential for arbitrary code execution on the mitmproxy host.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing mitmproxy scripts.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for any data handled by scripts.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in scripts; use secure configuration mechanisms.
        *   Regularly review and test mitmproxy scripts for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to script execution.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Intercepted Sensitive Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_intercepted_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive data intercepted by mitmproxy is exposed due to insecure storage, logging, or access controls.
    *   **How Mitmproxy Contributes:** Mitmproxy's core function is to intercept and inspect traffic, which inherently involves handling potentially sensitive information.
    *   **Example:** Mitmproxy logs containing API keys or passwords are stored in plain text and are accessible to unauthorized users. The mitmproxy web interface displays intercepted credentials without proper masking.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive accounts and systems, compliance violations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure mitmproxy to avoid logging sensitive data where possible.
        *   Implement strong access controls for mitmproxy logs and captured traffic data.
        *   Encrypt stored mitmproxy logs and captured data at rest.
        *   Redact or mask sensitive information in the mitmproxy web interface and logs.
        *   Implement secure deletion practices for mitmproxy logs and captured data.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to Mitmproxy Control Interface](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to_mitmproxy_control_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to mitmproxy's web interface or API, allowing them to control its behavior and inspect traffic.
    *   **How Mitmproxy Contributes:** Mitmproxy provides web and API interfaces for control and monitoring. If these interfaces are not properly secured, they become attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the mitmproxy web interface to gain access without authentication. An attacker brute-forces weak API credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over mitmproxy's functionality, including the ability to inspect, modify, and replay intercepted traffic. Potential for further attacks on connected systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and enforce strong authentication for the mitmproxy web interface and API.
        *   Use HTTPS for accessing the web interface to protect credentials in transit.
        *   Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   Keep mitmproxy updated to patch known vulnerabilities in its control interfaces.
        *   Restrict network access to the control interfaces to authorized users and networks.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Mitmproxy Software Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_mitmproxy_software_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the mitmproxy software itself.
    *   **How Mitmproxy Contributes:** As with any software, mitmproxy may contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited if not patched.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in an outdated version of mitmproxy to gain control of the server it's running on.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the mitmproxy instance, potential for lateral movement to other systems, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep mitmproxy updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for mitmproxy to be informed of new vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a vulnerability management process to regularly scan and address vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using intrusion detection/prevention systems to detect and block exploitation attempts.
