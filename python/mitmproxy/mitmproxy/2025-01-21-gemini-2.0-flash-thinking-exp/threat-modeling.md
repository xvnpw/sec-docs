# Threat Model Analysis for mitmproxy/mitmproxy

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to mitmproxy Web Interface](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_mitmproxy_web_interface.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the mitmproxy web interface (mitmweb). This could be achieved through weak or default credentials, exposed ports, or vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism *within mitmproxy*. Once accessed, the attacker can view intercepted traffic, modify *mitmproxy* configurations, and potentially execute arbitrary code if scripting is enabled and insecurely managed *within mitmproxy*.
* **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data intercepted by *mitmproxy*, manipulation of intercepted traffic via *mitmproxy*, potential compromise of the system running *mitmproxy*, and disruption of application functionality due to *mitmproxy* actions.
* **Affected Component:** mitmweb module (web interface).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Configure strong, unique passwords for the mitmproxy web interface.
    * Restrict access to the mitmproxy web interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.
    * Disable the web interface if it's not required.
    * Ensure the mitmproxy instance is not exposed to the public internet without proper access controls (e.g., VPN, firewall).
    * Regularly update mitmproxy to patch any security vulnerabilities *within mitmproxy*.

## Threat: [Malicious Script Execution via mitmproxy](./threats/malicious_script_execution_via_mitmproxy.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the mitmproxy instance (either through the web interface or direct file system access) uploads or modifies a malicious script that is then executed by *mitmproxy*. This script could perform various malicious actions, such as exfiltrating intercepted data *handled by mitmproxy*, modifying traffic to inject malware through *mitmproxy*, or interacting with the underlying operating system *from the mitmproxy process*.
* **Impact:** Data breach of information processed by *mitmproxy*, data manipulation performed by *mitmproxy*, compromise of the system running *mitmproxy*, and potential compromise of systems interacting with the application due to *mitmproxy's* actions.
* **Affected Component:** Scripting engine (mitmproxy core functionality).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Strictly control access to the mitmproxy instance and the ability to upload or modify scripts.
    * Implement code review processes for all mitmproxy scripts.
    * Run mitmproxy with the least necessary privileges.
    * Consider disabling scripting functionality if it's not essential.
    * Implement input validation and sanitization within scripts to prevent injection attacks *within the mitmproxy scripting environment*.

## Threat: [Interception and Exposure of Sensitive Data](./threats/interception_and_exposure_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** *mitmproxy*, by its nature, intercepts network traffic. If not properly secured, an attacker with access to the *mitmproxy* instance can view sensitive data transmitted between the application and other services (e.g., backend APIs, databases) that is being processed by *mitmproxy*. This includes credentials, personal information, and business-critical data flowing through *mitmproxy*.
* **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations, financial loss, and reputational damage due to exposure of data handled by *mitmproxy*.
* **Affected Component:** Proxy core functionality (traffic interception).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure all communication between the application and other services uses HTTPS (TLS encryption). This encrypts the traffic even when intercepted by *mitmproxy*, making it unreadable without the decryption keys.
    * Secure the *mitmproxy* instance to prevent unauthorized access.
    * Configure *mitmproxy* to redact or mask sensitive data in logs and the web interface.

## Threat: [Modification of Requests and Responses](./threats/modification_of_requests_and_responses.md)

**Description:** An attacker with control over the *mitmproxy* instance can modify requests sent by the application or responses received from other services *as they pass through mitmproxy*. This could be used to bypass security checks, inject malicious payloads, alter data, or disrupt the application's functionality by manipulating traffic via *mitmproxy*.
* **Impact:** Security vulnerabilities introduced by *mitmproxy's* manipulation, data corruption caused by *mitmproxy*, application malfunction due to altered traffic by *mitmproxy*, and potential compromise of interacting systems through *mitmproxy*.
* **Affected Component:** Proxy core functionality (traffic manipulation).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the *mitmproxy* instance to prevent unauthorized access.
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on both the client and server sides of the application *to mitigate the impact of potential mitmproxy modifications*.
    * Utilize cryptographic signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) to verify the integrity of critical data exchanged between services *independently of mitmproxy*.
    * Monitor network traffic for unexpected modifications *that might originate from mitmproxy*.
