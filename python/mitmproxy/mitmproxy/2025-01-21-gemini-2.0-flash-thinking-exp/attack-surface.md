# Attack Surface Analysis for mitmproxy/mitmproxy

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Access to the mitmproxy Web Interface](./attack_surfaces/insecure_access_to_the_mitmproxy_web_interface.md)

*   **How mitmproxy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** mitmproxy provides a web interface for controlling and monitoring the proxy. If not properly secured, this interface becomes a direct point of attack.
*   **Example:** Leaving the web interface accessible on a public IP address without any authentication allows anyone to view intercepted traffic, modify proxy settings, or even shut down the proxy.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (exposure of intercepted traffic), manipulation of proxy behavior, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication (username/password, certificate-based authentication) for the web interface.
    *   Restrict access to the web interface to trusted networks or IP addresses using firewall rules.
    *   Disable the web interface entirely if it's not required.
    *   Regularly review and update the authentication credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Malicious mitmproxy Add-ons](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_malicious_mitmproxy_add-ons.md)

*   **How mitmproxy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** mitmproxy allows extending its functionality through custom Python scripts (add-ons). If an attacker can introduce a malicious add-on, they can gain significant control over the proxy and the proxied traffic.
*   **Example:** An attacker tricks an administrator into installing an add-on that secretly logs all intercepted credentials and sends them to a remote server.
*   **Impact:** Data theft, system compromise (if the add-on exploits vulnerabilities in the mitmproxy environment or the underlying OS), manipulation of proxied traffic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install add-ons from trusted sources.
    *   Thoroughly review the code of any add-on before installation.
    *   Implement a process for vetting and approving add-ons.
    *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for testing new add-ons.
    *   Regularly audit installed add-ons.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of mitmproxy's Traffic Manipulation Capabilities](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_mitmproxy's_traffic_manipulation_capabilities.md)

*   **How mitmproxy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The core functionality of mitmproxy is to intercept and modify network traffic. If an attacker gains control of mitmproxy, they can leverage this capability for malicious purposes.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the mitmproxy instance and modifies responses to inject malicious JavaScript into web pages served to users, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, malware injection, defacement of applications, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls to prevent unauthorized access to the mitmproxy instance.
    *   Monitor mitmproxy's activity logs for suspicious traffic modifications.
    *   Implement alerts for unexpected changes in proxied traffic patterns.
    *   Ensure that only authorized and trusted users can configure traffic manipulation rules.

## Attack Surface: [TLS Stripping or Downgrade Attacks via mitmproxy Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/tls_stripping_or_downgrade_attacks_via_mitmproxy_misconfiguration.md)

*   **How mitmproxy Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If mitmproxy is not configured correctly for handling TLS connections, it could be susceptible to attacks that force a downgrade to unencrypted HTTP, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data.
*   **Example:**  Mitmproxy is configured in a way that allows an attacker to intercept the initial TLS handshake and prevent the establishment of a secure connection, forcing communication over HTTP.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure mitmproxy is configured to enforce HTTPS connections.
    *   Properly configure and manage TLS certificates used by mitmproxy.
    *   Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) on the applications being proxied to prevent downgrade attacks.
    *   Regularly review mitmproxy's TLS configuration.
