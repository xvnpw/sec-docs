# Attack Surface Analysis for mitmproxy/mitmproxy

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Interception Certificates and Private Keys](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_interception_certificates_and_private_keys.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access or compromise of the private key used by mitmproxy to generate interception certificates.
*   **mitmproxy Contribution:** mitmproxy *generates and stores* this private key, which is essential for its MITM functionality. The security of connections intercepted by certificates signed with this key directly depends on the protection of this key.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the file system of a developer's machine where mitmproxy is installed and retrieves the `mitmproxy-ca.pem` file containing the private key. The attacker can then use this key to create rogue certificates for any domain and perform MITM attacks against users who trust certificates signed by this compromised key.
*   **Impact:**  Full MITM capability for attackers, allowing them to intercept and modify traffic, steal credentials, inject malware, and impersonate legitimate servers.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store the private key in a secure location with restricted access. Avoid storing it in publicly accessible directories or version control systems.
    *   **Access Control:** Limit access to the machine running mitmproxy and the directory containing the private key to authorized users only.
    *   **Key Rotation (Advanced):**  While less common for development proxies, consider rotating the CA key periodically in more sensitive environments.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in mitmproxy Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_mitmproxy_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the mitmproxy software code that can be exploited by attackers.
*   **mitmproxy Contribution:** As a complex software application, *mitmproxy itself* is susceptible to vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be in its core proxy engine, web interface, or addon system.
*   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in mitmproxy's HTTP parsing library. An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that, when processed by mitmproxy, allows them to execute arbitrary code on the machine running mitmproxy.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, privilege escalation on the mitmproxy host. This can lead to compromise of the development environment or data being intercepted.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability type)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep mitmproxy updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories and release notes.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Periodically scan mitmproxy installations for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
    *   **Minimize Exposure:** Limit the network exposure of mitmproxy, especially the web interface, to trusted networks only.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration and Deployment](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_and_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** Risks arising from misconfiguring mitmproxy or deploying it in an insecure environment.
*   **mitmproxy Contribution:**  *Incorrect configuration of mitmproxy features* or insecure deployment choices directly increase its attack surface and make it an easier target.
*   **Example:** mitmproxy is deployed with its web interface exposed to the public internet without any authentication. An attacker discovers this open web interface and gains full control of the proxy, potentially intercepting traffic from unsuspecting users or pivoting to attack the internal network.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, data breaches, system compromise, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the severity of misconfiguration)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration:** Follow security best practices for mitmproxy configuration. Disable unnecessary features, configure strong authentication for the web interface, and use HTTPS for the web interface.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Deploy mitmproxy within a secure network segment, not directly exposed to the public internet. Use firewalls to restrict access to mitmproxy ports and web interface.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Deployment):** Run mitmproxy with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root if possible.
