    *   **Best Practices:**
        *   **Input Validation:**
            *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Define allowed characters, formats, and ranges for inputs. Reject anything that doesn't conform.
            *   **Data Type Validation:**  Ensure inputs are of the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, email address).
            *   **Regular Expressions:**  Use regular expressions for complex input validation patterns.
        *   **Output Encoding:**
            *   **Context-Aware Encoding:**  Encode output based on the context where it will be used (e.g., HTML encoding for web pages, URL encoding for URLs).
            *   **Use Security Libraries:**  Utilize security libraries that provide built-in functions for safe output encoding (e.g., `html.escape` in Python for HTML encoding).
            *   **Avoid Manual Encoding:**  Minimize manual encoding as it is error-prone.
