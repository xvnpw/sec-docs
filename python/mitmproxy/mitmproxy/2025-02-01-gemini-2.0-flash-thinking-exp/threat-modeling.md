# Threat Model Analysis for mitmproxy/mitmproxy

## Threat: [Unintentional Data Logging and Exposure](./threats/unintentional_data_logging_and_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Unintentional Data Logging and Exposure
*   **Description:** An attacker, or unintentional internal user, could access sensitive data logged by mitmproxy. This occurs when mitmproxy logs excessive information, including credentials or personal data, and these logs are insecurely stored, accidentally shared, or left accessible. Access can be gained through file system access, exposed interfaces, or interception of unsecured log transmissions.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data, compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA), reputational damage, identity theft, financial loss.
*   **mitmproxy Component Affected:** Logging module, log storage (file system, etc.), web interface (if logs are accessible).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize logging: Configure mitmproxy to log only essential data using filters and ignore patterns to exclude sensitive information.
    *   Secure Log Storage: Store logs in secure locations with restricted access controls and encrypt logs at rest and in transit.
    *   Regular Log Review and Purging: Implement processes for regular review and secure deletion of logs.
    *   Access Control: Restrict access to log files and interfaces exposing logs.
    *   Awareness Training: Educate personnel on logging risks and secure mitmproxy usage.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to mitmproxy Interface](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_mitmproxy_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to mitmproxy Interface
*   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to mitmproxy's web, scripting, or other interfaces due to weak credentials, lack of authentication, or interface vulnerabilities. Upon access, they could view intercepted traffic, modify requests/responses, access logs, and manipulate application behavior.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (traffic viewing), data manipulation (traffic modification), unauthorized control over mitmproxy and the application, potential for further attacks.
*   **mitmproxy Component Affected:** Web interface, scripting interface, API, authentication mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strong Authentication: Implement strong authentication for all mitmproxy interfaces using strong passwords or certificate-based authentication.
    *   Access Control Lists (ACLs): Restrict interface access based on IP address or network segments.
    *   Network Segmentation: Deploy mitmproxy in a segmented network, limiting access from untrusted networks.
    *   Disable Unnecessary Interfaces: Disable unused mitmproxy interfaces.
    *   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of mitmproxy configurations and access controls.

## Threat: [Accidental or Malicious Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) in Production-like Environments](./threats/accidental_or_malicious_man-in-the-middle__mitm__in_production-like_environments.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental or Malicious Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) in Production-like Environments
*   **Description:** mitmproxy, if mistakenly left running or maliciously deployed in a production-like environment, becomes a Man-in-the-Middle. Production or sensitive traffic could be routed through this instance, allowing interception and modification of data between the application and its backend or external services.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of data confidentiality and integrity for traffic through the rogue mitmproxy. Data theft, manipulation, authentication bypass, impersonation, denial of service, severe reputational damage and legal repercussions.
*   **mitmproxy Component Affected:** Core proxy functionality, traffic interception and forwarding.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict Environment Separation: Enforce clear separation between development/testing and production environments.
    *   Environment Awareness: Implement clear indicators to distinguish environments where mitmproxy is used.
    *   Automated Shutdown/Removal: Automate processes to prevent mitmproxy deployment or running in production-like environments.
    *   Monitoring and Alerting: Monitor for unexpected proxy activity and alert on configuration deviations.
    *   Deployment Checks: Include checks in deployment pipelines to prevent accidental mitmproxy deployment to production.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of mitmproxy Settings](./threats/misconfiguration_of_mitmproxy_settings.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration of mitmproxy Settings
*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured mitmproxy settings, such as weak credentials, disabled HTTPS interception verification, misconfigured filters, or overly permissive access controls, can create vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these to gain unauthorized access, intercept traffic, or cause denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Data exposure, unauthorized access to mitmproxy and the application, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, denial of service, application malfunction, unintended data logging.
*   **mitmproxy Component Affected:** Configuration system, various modules (authentication, interception, logging).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific misconfiguration)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Configuration Practices: Follow security best practices for mitmproxy configuration, including strong passwords, HTTPS interception verification, careful filter definition, and least privilege access controls.
    *   Configuration Management: Use configuration management tools for consistent and secure configurations across environments.
    *   Regular Configuration Reviews: Periodically review configurations to identify and remediate misconfigurations.
    *   Configuration Templates and Best Practices: Develop and use secure configuration templates and documented best practices.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in mitmproxy Software or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mitmproxy_software_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in mitmproxy Software or Dependencies
*   **Description:** mitmproxy or its dependencies may contain security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these could allow attackers to gain unauthorized system access, cause denial of service, or manipulate intercepted traffic.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data breach, denial of service, manipulation of application traffic, potential for lateral movement.
*   **mitmproxy Component Affected:** Core mitmproxy application, dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regular Updates: Keep mitmproxy and dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Vulnerability Scanning: Regularly scan the system running mitmproxy for vulnerabilities.
    *   Security Monitoring: Monitor mitmproxy and the system for suspicious activity indicating vulnerability exploitation.
    *   Security Hardening: Apply security hardening measures to the system running mitmproxy.
