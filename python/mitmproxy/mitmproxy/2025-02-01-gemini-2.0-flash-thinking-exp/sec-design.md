# BUSINESS POSTURE

mitmproxy is an interactive TLS-capable intercepting HTTP proxy. It is primarily used by security professionals, software developers, and QA engineers to inspect, analyze, and manipulate network traffic.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a powerful and flexible tool for intercepting, inspecting, and modifying HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
  - Enable users to debug, test, and secure web applications and APIs.
  - Offer a user-friendly interface and scripting capabilities for advanced traffic analysis and automation.
  - Maintain an active open-source community and project.

- Business Risks:
  - Misuse of mitmproxy for malicious purposes due to its powerful interception capabilities.
  - Security vulnerabilities in mitmproxy itself could expose users to risks if they rely on it for security testing.
  - Lack of commercial support might be a concern for enterprise users requiring guaranteed uptime and SLAs.
  - Open-source nature requires community trust and reliance on volunteer contributions for maintenance and updates.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Security - The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Regular Code Reviews - Contributions are reviewed by maintainers before being merged. (Implemented: GitHub Pull Request Process)
  - security control: Issue Tracking - Public issue tracker for reporting bugs and security vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub Issues)
  - security control: TLS Encryption - mitmproxy supports TLS interception and analysis, demonstrating awareness of encryption importance. (Implemented: Core Functionality)
  - security control: Input Validation - mitmproxy likely implements input validation to handle various HTTP traffic formats. (Implemented: Codebase - needs verification)
  - security control: Authorization - mitmproxy's access control is primarily based on user's system permissions to run the proxy. (Implemented: Operating System Level)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to exist in the codebase due to complexity of network protocol handling.
  - accepted risk: Users might misuse mitmproxy for unethical or illegal activities.
  - accepted risk: No formal security certification or penetration testing reports publicly available.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy and process.
  - security control: Conduct periodic penetration testing by external security experts.
  - security control: Provide security hardening guidelines for mitmproxy deployments.
  - security control: Implement signed releases to ensure software integrity and prevent tampering.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: mitmproxy itself does not require user authentication as it relies on the user's operating system permissions.
    - Requirement: For mitmproxy web interface (if enabled), consider adding authentication to restrict access.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization is primarily handled by the operating system's user permissions.
    - Requirement: Within mitmproxy scripts, implement authorization checks if sensitive operations are performed.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Rigorously validate all inputs, especially when parsing and processing network traffic (HTTP headers, bodies, etc.) to prevent injection attacks and parsing vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Sanitize user-provided script inputs to prevent script injection vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Ensure proper and secure implementation of TLS and other cryptographic operations.
    - Requirement: Use well-vetted cryptographic libraries and avoid implementing custom cryptography.
    - Requirement: Protect private keys used for TLS interception and certificate generation.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Maintaining the mitmproxy project as a valuable open-source tool for security professionals and developers.
  - Ensuring the integrity and security of mitmproxy software releases.
  - Protecting the reputation of the mitmproxy project and community.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Source Code: Publicly available, but integrity and confidentiality of development process are important.
  - Build Artifacts: Publicly available, integrity is critical to prevent supply chain attacks.
  - User Scripts and Addons: Potentially sensitive if users create custom scripts or addons that handle sensitive data.
  - Intercepted Network Traffic (Flows): Can contain highly sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personal information, etc.). Sensitivity depends on user's usage and target applications. By default, mitmproxy users are expected to handle sensitive data with care.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that mitmproxy needs to adhere to, especially regarding the handling of intercepted data?
  - Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure policy in place for mitmproxy?
  - Are there any plans for commercial support or enterprise versions of mitmproxy in the future?
  - What is the current process for security testing and penetration testing of mitmproxy?
  - Are there any specific security certifications or audits that mitmproxy aims to achieve?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to maintain mitmproxy as a useful open-source security tool, rather than a commercially driven product.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is a significant concern for the project, but resources are limited due to its open-source nature. Security controls are primarily community-driven and rely on open-source best practices.
  - DESIGN: The architecture is modular and designed for flexibility and extensibility through addons and scripting. Deployment is primarily focused on individual user workstations for testing and analysis purposes. Build process relies on GitHub Actions for automation and basic security checks.
