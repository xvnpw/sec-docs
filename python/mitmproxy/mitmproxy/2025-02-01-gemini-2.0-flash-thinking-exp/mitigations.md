# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mitmproxy/mitmproxy

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization and Redaction in Logs](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_and_redaction_in_logs.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data Patterns:**  Define patterns and keywords that indicate sensitive data within HTTP requests and responses (e.g., "password", "api_key", credit card numbers, email addresses).
2.  **Implement Redaction Script/Addon:** Develop or utilize a mitmproxy addon or script that automatically identifies and redacts sensitive data based on the defined patterns *within mitmproxy itself* before logging. This can involve using mitmproxy's scripting API to intercept flows and modify request/response content, or using addons that provide redaction functionality. Replace sensitive data with placeholder values (e.g., "[REDACTED]") *before* logs are written to disk.
3.  **Configure Selective Logging in mitmproxy:** Configure mitmproxy's logging options to selectively log only necessary information. Utilize mitmproxy's filtering capabilities to control what traffic is logged and at what level of detail. Avoid logging full request/response bodies by default, especially in environments handling potentially sensitive data. Focus on logging headers and metadata relevant for debugging.
4.  **Regularly Review Redaction Rules:** Periodically review and update the redaction rules and patterns *within the mitmproxy script/addon* to ensure they are effective in identifying and redacting newly introduced sensitive data types.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach via Log Exposure (High Severity):** Even with secure storage, unredacted logs containing sensitive data pose a significant breach risk if accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems.
    *   **Internal Data Leakage (Medium Severity):**  Unredacted logs shared within the development team or with external vendors for debugging purposes could lead to unintentional data leakage.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):**  Storing unredacted sensitive data in logs can directly violate data privacy regulations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach via Log Exposure:** High reduction in risk.  Significantly reduces the sensitivity of data stored in logs, minimizing the impact of a potential log breach.
    *   **Internal Data Leakage:** Medium reduction in risk. Reduces the risk of accidental data leakage when sharing logs for debugging or analysis.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Medium reduction in risk.  Helps in meeting data minimization and data protection requirements for compliance.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of the need to avoid using real sensitive data in testing. However, there is no automated redaction *within mitmproxy* in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated redaction script or addon *for mitmproxy* is not implemented.
    *   Configuration for selective logging *within mitmproxy* to minimize data capture is not enforced.
    *   Formal guidelines and training on data sanitization for developers and testers *using mitmproxy features* are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Logging of Sensitive Data](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure Mitmproxy Logging Level:**  Adjust mitmproxy's logging level to capture only essential information for debugging and testing. Avoid using overly verbose logging levels (like `debug` or `verbose`) in environments where sensitive data might be processed. Use more restrictive levels like `info` or `warn` for general operation and only increase verbosity when actively troubleshooting.
2.  **Disable Full Request/Response Body Logging in Mitmproxy:** Configure mitmproxy to *not* log the full request and response bodies by default. Focus logging on headers, URLs, and metadata which are often sufficient for debugging network interactions without capturing potentially sensitive payload data.  Enable full body logging only temporarily and consciously when absolutely necessary for specific debugging tasks.
3.  **Utilize Mitmproxy Filtering for Selective Logging:** Leverage mitmproxy's powerful filtering capabilities to selectively log traffic based on specific criteria (e.g., domains, paths, content types). This allows you to focus logging on areas of interest while excluding traffic that is less relevant or more likely to contain sensitive information.
4.  **Regularly Review Logging Configuration:** Periodically review mitmproxy's logging configuration to ensure it remains aligned with the principle of minimizing data capture and that logging levels are not unnecessarily verbose.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach via Log Exposure (High Severity):**  Logging excessive data, especially request/response bodies, increases the risk of capturing and exposing sensitive information in logs.
    *   **Log Storage Overload (Medium Severity):**  Verbose logging can lead to rapid growth of log files, consuming storage space and potentially impacting system performance.
    *   **Performance Impact of Logging (Low Severity):**  Excessive logging can introduce a performance overhead to mitmproxy itself, especially when logging large request/response bodies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach via Log Exposure:** High reduction in risk. Minimizing logged data directly reduces the amount of sensitive information at risk in logs.
    *   **Log Storage Overload:** Medium reduction in risk. Reduces the volume of logs generated, mitigating storage concerns.
    *   **Performance Impact of Logging:** Low reduction in risk.  Reduces the performance overhead associated with excessive logging.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Mitmproxy is generally configured with a default logging level, but it's not actively managed or minimized for security purposes.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal configuration guidelines for minimizing mitmproxy logging are not defined.
    *   Automated checks or enforcement of minimal logging configurations are not in place.
    *   Regular reviews of mitmproxy logging configurations are not conducted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Mitmproxy Addons and Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/secure_mitmproxy_addons_and_scripts.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Source Code Review of Addons/Scripts:**  Thoroughly review the source code of any mitmproxy addons or custom scripts *before* deploying them. Pay close attention to code that handles sensitive data, interacts with external systems, or modifies mitmproxy's core functionality. Look for potential vulnerabilities like insecure data handling, command injection, or privilege escalation.
2.  **Trusted Sources for Addons:**  Prefer using mitmproxy addons from trusted and reputable sources.  Prioritize addons that are officially maintained by the mitmproxy project or well-known and respected developers in the security community. Avoid using addons from unknown or unverified sources.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Scripts/Addons:** Design custom mitmproxy scripts and addons to operate with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid granting scripts or addons broad access to system resources or sensitive data unless absolutely required.
4.  **Input Validation and Output Encoding in Scripts/Addons:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding within mitmproxy scripts and addons to prevent common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or injection attacks if the scripts interact with web interfaces or external systems.
5.  **Regularly Update Addons:** Keep mitmproxy addons updated to the latest versions.  Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in addons, so staying up-to-date is crucial for maintaining security.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Addons/Scripts Introducing Security Flaws (High Severity):**  Malicious or poorly written addons/scripts can introduce new security vulnerabilities into the mitmproxy setup, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Malicious Addons (High Severity):**  Malicious addons could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive data captured by mitmproxy to external attackers.
    *   **Compromise of Mitmproxy Host via Addon Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in addons could be exploited to compromise the host system where mitmproxy is running.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Addons/Scripts Introducing Security Flaws:** High reduction in risk. Code review, trusted sources, and secure coding practices significantly reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through addons and scripts.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Malicious Addons:** High reduction in risk.  Careful addon selection and code review make it much harder for malicious addons to be introduced and exfiltrate data.
    *   **Compromise of Mitmproxy Host via Addon Vulnerabilities:** Medium reduction in risk.  Security practices for addons reduce the attack surface and potential for host compromise.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. There is no formal process for reviewing or vetting mitmproxy addons or custom scripts before use.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal code review process for mitmproxy addons and scripts is not established.
    *   Guidelines for selecting trusted addon sources are missing.
    *   Security best practices for developing mitmproxy scripts and addons are not documented or enforced.
    *   Automated addon update mechanisms and vulnerability scanning for addons are not in place.
