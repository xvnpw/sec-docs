# Attack Surface Analysis for mitmproxy/mitmproxy

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional Sensitive Data Exposure (Logging/Storage)](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_sensitive_data_exposure__loggingstorage_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data passing through mitmproxy is inadvertently logged or stored in an insecure manner.
*   **mitmproxy Contribution:** mitmproxy decrypts and processes all intercepted traffic, making it a central point where sensitive data can be exposed if not handled carefully. This is *inherent* to its function.
*   **Example:** A developer uses mitmproxy to debug an API call that includes an API key in the request header.  mitmproxy logs this request, including the API key, to an unencrypted file on the developer's machine. An attacker gains access to the developer's machine and steals the API key.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, unauthorized access to systems and data, potential financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Redaction:** Implement robust redaction rules within mitmproxy (using scripts or addons) to automatically remove or mask sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens, PII) from logs and saved traffic.
    *   **Secure Storage:** If saving intercepted traffic is necessary, encrypt the saved data using strong encryption and restrict access to authorized personnel only.
    *   **Minimal Logging:** Configure mitmproxy to log only the minimum necessary information for debugging. Avoid verbose logging in production or testing environments.
    *   **Log Rotation and Deletion:** Implement a policy for regularly rotating and deleting old log files to minimize the amount of sensitive data stored.
    *   **Secure Log Aggregation:** If using a centralized log server, ensure it is securely configured and access-controlled.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Production Traffic Interception](./attack_surfaces/accidental_production_traffic_interception.md)

*   **Description:** Developers accidentally leave their browsers or applications configured to use the mitmproxy instance after testing, routing *live, production* traffic through the proxy.
*   **mitmproxy Contribution:** mitmproxy acts as a proxy, and if client applications are configured to use it, all traffic (including production traffic) will be routed through it. This is a direct consequence of its proxy functionality.
*   **Example:** A developer forgets to remove the proxy settings from their browser after debugging a web application.  They then log in to their bank account, and their credentials are intercepted and logged by mitmproxy.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of live user data, credentials, and sensitive transactions.  Potential for significant financial loss, identity theft, and legal repercussions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Clear Instructions and Training:** Provide clear instructions to developers on how to properly configure and *deconfigure* proxy settings after using mitmproxy.
    *   **Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) Files (with Caution):**  Use PAC files to automatically configure proxy settings, but ensure the PAC file is securely managed and only points to mitmproxy when intended.  Regularly audit PAC file configurations.
    *   **Dedicated Testing Environments:**  Encourage the use of dedicated testing environments (e.g., virtual machines, containers) that are isolated from production systems.
    *   **Visual Indicators:** Use browser extensions or other visual indicators to clearly show when a proxy is active.
    *   **Post-Testing Checklists:** Implement checklists that include removing proxy settings as a mandatory step after using mitmproxy.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised mitmproxy Instance (Vulnerabilities/Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_mitmproxy_instance__vulnerabilitiesmisconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains control of the mitmproxy instance itself, either through exploiting vulnerabilities in mitmproxy or through misconfiguration.
*   **mitmproxy Contribution:**  mitmproxy is a software application, and like any software, it can have vulnerabilities or be misconfigured. This is a direct risk associated with running the mitmproxy software.
*   **Example:**  mitmproxy's web interface (mitmweb) is exposed to the public internet without a password, or with a default password. An attacker discovers this and gains full control of the proxy, allowing them to intercept and modify all traffic passing through it.
*   **Impact:**  Complete control over intercepted traffic, ability to inject malicious code, potential for lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:**  Always require strong, unique passwords for accessing mitmproxy's web interface (mitmweb).
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Restrict network access to the mitmproxy instance using firewall rules.  Only allow connections from trusted networks and IP addresses.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep mitmproxy and its dependencies up-to-date to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.  Subscribe to security advisories.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run mitmproxy with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running it as root or administrator.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the mitmproxy instance on a separate network segment to limit the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity that might indicate an attempt to compromise the mitmproxy instance.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious/Vulnerable Addons/Scripts](./attack_surfaces/maliciousvulnerable_addonsscripts.md)

*   **Description:**  A malicious or poorly written mitmproxy addon or inline script introduces vulnerabilities or leaks sensitive data.
*   **mitmproxy Contribution:** mitmproxy's extensibility through addons and scripts allows for custom functionality, but also introduces a risk if these extensions are not carefully vetted. This is a direct consequence of mitmproxy's addon architecture.
*   **Example:**  A developer installs a third-party mitmproxy addon from an untrusted source.  This addon contains malicious code that steals API keys from intercepted traffic and sends them to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Impact:**  Data leakage, unauthorized access, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code of any addons or scripts before using them.  Look for potential security vulnerabilities and suspicious behavior.
    *   **Trusted Sources:**  Only install addons from trusted sources, such as the official mitmproxy repository or reputable developers.
    *   **Sandboxing (Limited):** While mitmproxy doesn't offer full sandboxing, consider running addons with limited privileges if possible.
    *   **Input Validation:**  If an addon processes user-provided data, ensure it performs proper input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically audit the addons and scripts that are in use to ensure they remain secure.
