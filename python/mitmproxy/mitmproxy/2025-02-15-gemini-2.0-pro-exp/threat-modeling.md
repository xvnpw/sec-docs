# Threat Model Analysis for mitmproxy/mitmproxy

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Web Interface Access](./threats/unauthenticated_web_interface_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthenticated Web Interface Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker on the same network (or the internet, if misconfigured) accesses the mitmproxy web interface (mitmweb) because it's running without authentication. The attacker can view live traffic, modify flows, and potentially inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of intercepted traffic.  The attacker can steal data, modify requests/responses, and potentially gain control of the client application or server.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `mitmweb` component (specifically, the web server and associated handlers).  This involves the `mitmproxy.tools.web` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always run `mitmweb` with authentication enabled (e.g., using the `--web-auth` option with a strong username and password).
        *   Bind the web interface to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default (`--web-host 127.0.0.1`).  Only expose it to other networks if absolutely necessary and with strong security measures.
        *   Use a firewall to restrict access to the mitmproxy web interface port.
        *   Consider using a reverse proxy with authentication and TLS termination in front of mitmweb for added security.

## Threat: [CA Certificate Exposure](./threats/ca_certificate_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** CA Certificate Exposure
    *   **Description:** The mitmproxy CA certificate (`mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem`) is leaked or stolen. An attacker can use this certificate to perform their own MITM attacks against users who have trusted that certificate.  This is *directly* related to mitmproxy because it's *mitmproxy's* CA certificate that enables the interception.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows an attacker to intercept and decrypt traffic from users who have installed the compromised CA certificate.  This can lead to widespread data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** The mitmproxy CA certificate generation and management process. This is primarily a procedural issue related to how mitmproxy's generated certificate is handled, but the certificate itself is core to mitmproxy's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store the mitmproxy CA certificate securely (e.g., in a password-protected file or a hardware security module).
        *   Do not share the CA certificate publicly or with untrusted parties.
        *   Regularly rotate the CA certificate (generate a new one).
        *   Educate developers and users about the risks of trusting unknown CA certificates.
        *   If the certificate is compromised, immediately revoke it and inform users to remove it from their trusted certificate stores.

## Threat: [Malicious Addon Execution](./threats/malicious_addon_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Addon Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious mitmproxy addon (or compromises a legitimate one) that intercepts and exfiltrates sensitive data, modifies traffic, or executes arbitrary code on the host machine.  A developer unknowingly installs and runs this addon. This is a *direct* threat because it exploits mitmproxy's addon system.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, traffic manipulation, potential system compromise. The severity depends on the capabilities of the malicious addon.
    *   **Affected Component:** mitmproxy's addon loading and execution mechanism. This affects the `mitmproxy.addonmanager` module and any code that interacts with addons.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install addons from trusted sources (e.g., the official mitmproxy GitHub repository or well-known community developers).
        *   Carefully review the source code of any addons before installing them.
        *   Use a virtual environment to isolate addon dependencies and prevent conflicts.
        *   Regularly update addons to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for running mitmproxy and its addons.

## Threat: [Insecure Upstream Proxy Configuration](./threats/insecure_upstream_proxy_configuration.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Upstream Proxy Configuration
    * **Description:** mitmproxy is configured to use an upstream proxy (--mode upstream:http://proxy.example.com), but the connection to that upstream proxy is not secured (using plain HTTP instead of HTTPS). An attacker on the network between mitmproxy and the upstream proxy can intercept and modify the traffic. This is a direct threat because it involves mitmproxy's configuration and upstream proxy handling.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of all traffic sent through the upstream proxy, including potentially sensitive data that was originally intended to be encrypted.
    * **Affected Component:** The upstream proxy configuration and connection handling within mitmproxy. This affects the `mitmproxy.proxy.server` and related modules.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always use HTTPS when connecting to an upstream proxy.
        * Verify the certificate of the upstream proxy.
        * If the upstream proxy requires authentication, use secure authentication mechanisms.
