## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Sniff Traffic -> Capture Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_sniff_traffic_-_capture_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path involves passively intercepting network traffic to capture user credentials (usernames and passwords).
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Sniff Traffic:** The attacker uses mitmproxy to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
    *   **Capture Credentials {CRITICAL NODE}:** The attacker extracts usernames and passwords from the intercepted traffic, often from HTTP requests (if TLS is not properly enforced) or by breaking weak encryption.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if TLS/SSL is not properly enforced or if the attacker can compromise the certificate trust chain).
*   **Impact:** High (leads to account compromise, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user).
*   **Effort:** Very Low (mitmproxy makes traffic interception easy).
*   **Skill Level:** Novice (basic understanding of mitmproxy and network traffic).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires network traffic analysis and potentially decryption).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Enforce strong TLS/SSL encryption with proper certificate validation.
    *   Use multi-factor authentication.
    *   Avoid sending credentials in plain text.
    *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Sniff Traffic -> Capture API Keys](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_sniff_traffic_-_capture_api_keys.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path involves passively intercepting network traffic to capture API keys or other sensitive tokens.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Sniff Traffic:** The attacker uses mitmproxy to intercept network traffic.
    *   **Capture API Keys {CRITICAL NODE}:** The attacker extracts API keys or other authentication tokens from the intercepted traffic.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on how API keys are transmitted).
*   **Impact:** High (can grant the attacker access to sensitive APIs and data).
*   **Effort:** Very Low (passive sniffing).
*   **Skill Level:** Novice.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires traffic analysis and potentially decryption).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use secure methods for transmitting API keys (e.g., HTTPS with proper certificate validation).
    *   Implement API key rotation and revocation mechanisms.
    *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Modify Traffic -> Inject Malicious Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_modify_traffic_-_inject_malicious_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path involves actively modifying intercepted traffic to inject malicious scripts into web pages or API responses.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Modify Traffic:** The attacker uses mitmproxy's scripting capabilities to alter the content of requests or responses.
    *   **Inject Malicious Scripts {CRITICAL NODE}:** The attacker inserts JavaScript or other code into web pages, enabling attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or session hijacking.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (requires finding an injection point and crafting a suitable payload).
*   **Impact:** High (can lead to client-side compromise, data theft, and session hijacking).
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires crafting malicious scripts and understanding the application's behavior).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (requires knowledge of web security vulnerabilities and scripting).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (modified traffic may appear legitimate; requires client-side security analysis).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding.
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of scripts.
    *   Regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor client-side behavior for anomalies.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit mitmproxy Configuration/Scripting -> Insecure Configuration -> Disable TLS/SSL](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_mitmproxy_configurationscripting_-_insecure_configuration_-_disable_tlsssl.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting a misconfiguration of mitmproxy to disable TLS/SSL verification, allowing for easy interception of encrypted traffic.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Insecure Configuration:** The mitmproxy instance is configured insecurely, often due to user error or negligence.
    *   **Disable TLS/SSL {CRITICAL NODE}:** TLS/SSL verification is disabled, allowing the attacker to intercept and decrypt traffic without needing to compromise the certificate trust chain.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (users are generally aware of TLS/SSL importance, but mistakes happen).
*   **Impact:** Very High (exposes all intercepted traffic to the attacker).
*   **Effort:** Very Low (simple configuration change).
*   **Skill Level:** Novice.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (can be detected by checking the mitmproxy configuration).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never disable TLS/SSL verification in a production environment.**
    *   Regularly audit the mitmproxy configuration.
    *   Use configuration management tools to enforce secure settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise mitmproxy Instance -> Physical/Network Access -> Gain Shell Access -> Modify mitmproxy Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_mitmproxy_instance_-_physicalnetwork_access_-_gain_shell_access_-_modify_m_866a2a61.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves gaining full control over the machine or container running mitmproxy, allowing the attacker to modify its configuration and behavior.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Physical/Network Access:** The attacker gains physical access to the machine or compromises it over the network (e.g., through SSH, RDP, or a vulnerability).
    *   **Gain Shell Access {CRITICAL NODE}:** The attacker obtains a command-line shell on the system.
    *   **Modify mitmproxy Configuration {CRITICAL NODE}:** The attacker changes mitmproxy's settings to disable security features, enable malicious behavior, or redirect traffic.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (requires significant effort to gain access).
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete control over mitmproxy and potentially the host system).
*   **Effort:** High (requires network penetration or physical security bypass skills).
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (depends on the security measures in place).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strong network security controls (firewalls, intrusion detection systems).
    *   Secure the host system with strong passwords, regular patching, and host-based security software.
    *   Monitor for unauthorized access attempts.
    *   Use least privilege principles for user accounts.
    *   Implement physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the machine.
