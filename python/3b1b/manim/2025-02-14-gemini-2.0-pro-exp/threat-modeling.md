# Threat Model Analysis for 3b1b/manim

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via `Scene.render()`](./threats/uncontrolled_resource_consumption_via__scene_render___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a Manim script that defines an extremely long or complex animation within the `Scene.render()` method.  This could involve a large number of `Mobject` instances, complex transformations, or computationally intensive operations within custom `Animation` subclasses. The attacker might use nested loops or recursive calls within the `construct()` method to amplify the complexity.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to server resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk space if temporary files are excessively large).  The server may become unresponsive, affecting other users.
    *   **Manim Component Affected:** `manim.Scene.render()`, `manim.Mobject`, `manim.Animation`, and potentially any custom subclasses of these. The `construct()` method of the `Scene` class is the primary entry point.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (AST Analysis):** Use Python's `ast` module to parse the user-provided Manim code *before* execution.  Analyze the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to:
            *   Limit the nesting depth of loops and function calls within `construct()`.
            *   Restrict the number of `Mobject` instances created (e.g., by counting calls to `add()`).
            *   Disallow or limit the use of known resource-intensive functions or classes.
        *   **Resource Limits (cgroups/Docker):** Enforce strict resource limits (CPU time, memory, disk I/O) using containerization technologies like Docker and cgroups.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement a hard timeout for the `Scene.render()` process.  If rendering exceeds the timeout, terminate the process.
        *   **Frame Rate and Duration Limits:** Enforce maximum frame rate and total animation duration limits.

## Threat: [File System Access via `Text` and LaTeX](./threats/file_system_access_via__text__and_latex.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages the `Text` class, which uses LaTeX internally, to attempt to read or write arbitrary files on the server.  The attacker might craft a malicious LaTeX document that uses commands like `\input` or `\write18` (if enabled) to access sensitive files or execute shell commands.  Even without `\write18`, clever LaTeX tricks can sometimes be used for information disclosure (e.g., probing for file existence).  This is a *direct* threat because Manim's `Text` class is the gateway to this vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (reading sensitive files), potential Code Execution (if `\write18` or similar is exploitable), or Denial of Service (overwriting critical files).
    *   **Manim Component Affected:** `manim.mobject.text.text_mobject.Text`, which relies on LaTeX rendering (specifically, the `tex_to_svg_file` function and the underlying LaTeX engine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **LaTeX Sanitization:**  Use a LaTeX sanitizer to remove or escape potentially dangerous LaTeX commands and macros.  This is *crucial*.  Consider using a whitelist approach, allowing only a very limited set of LaTeX commands.
        *   **Restricted LaTeX Environment:** Configure the LaTeX environment to disable features like `\write18` and restrict file access.  Use a chroot jail or containerization to limit LaTeX's access to the file system.
        *   **Input Validation (Text Content):**  Validate the text content provided to the `Text` class to prevent the injection of malicious LaTeX code.  This is a *defense-in-depth* measure, as LaTeX sanitization should be the primary defense.
        *   **Separate LaTeX Process:** Run the LaTeX rendering process in a separate, isolated process with minimal privileges.

## Threat: [Arbitrary File Write via `Scene.save_state()` and related methods](./threats/arbitrary_file_write_via__scene_save_state____and_related_methods.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to influence the file paths used by `Scene.save_state()`, `Scene.save_final_image()`, or similar methods, an attacker could attempt to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. This might be used to overwrite critical system files or create malicious files.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (overwriting critical files), potential Code Execution (if the attacker can overwrite executable files or configuration files), or Data Tampering.
    *   **Manim Component Affected:** `manim.Scene.save_state()`, `manim.Scene.save_final_image()`, and any other methods that write files to disk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Path Control:**  *Never* allow users to directly specify file paths.  Use a predefined, secure directory for storing output files, and generate unique filenames internally (e.g., using UUIDs).
        *   **File System Permissions:** Ensure that the Manim process has write access *only* to the designated output directory and no other locations.
        *   **Input Validation (Indirect Control):** Even if users don't directly control file paths, validate any input that *indirectly* influences them (e.g., scene names that might be used to construct file paths).

## Threat: [Infinite Loop in Custom `Updater`](./threats/infinite_loop_in_custom__updater_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker defines a custom `Updater` function (using `add_updater`) that contains an infinite loop or a very long-running computation. This updater is then attached to a `Mobject`.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to CPU exhaustion. The rendering process will hang indefinitely.
    *   **Manim Component Affected:** `manim.Mobject.add_updater()`, `manim.Mobject.update()`, and any custom updater functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (AST Analysis):** Analyze the AST of custom updater functions to detect potential infinite loops or long-running computations. This is challenging but can be partially addressed by limiting loop nesting and function call depth.
        *   **Timeouts (per Updater):** Implement a timeout mechanism *specifically* for updater functions. If an updater takes too long to execute, terminate it. This requires careful management of the Manim event loop.
        *   **Whitelisting:** If possible, only allow a predefined set of safe updater functions.
