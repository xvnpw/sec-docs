## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization with Templating (Manim-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_with_templating__manim-centric_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Manim Scene Schema:** Define a precise schema that dictates *exactly* which Manim parameters users can control.  This goes beyond basic data types; it defines which Manim classes, methods, and attributes are accessible and with what constraints.  For example:
    *   Allowed `Text` content (length, character set).
    *   Allowed `Mobject` colors (from a predefined list).
    *   Allowed animation types (from a predefined list).
    *   Allowed numerical parameters for positioning, scaling, etc. (ranges and step sizes).
2.  **Whitelist-Based Parameter Control:**  The schema acts as a strict whitelist.  Any attempt to use Manim features *not* explicitly allowed in the schema is rejected.
3.  **Jinja2 Templating for Manim Scenes:**  Use Jinja2 (or a similar secure templating engine with auto-escaping *enabled*) to create Manim scene files (`.py` files).
    *   User input, *after* validation against the schema, is passed as *data* to the Jinja2 template.
    *   The template renders the final Manim scene code, ensuring safe insertion and escaping of user-provided values.  This prevents code injection.
    *   Example:  Instead of directly constructing a `Text` object with user input like `Text(user_input)`, you would have a template like `Text("{{ user_text }}")` and pass `user_text` as a variable to the template.
4.  **Input Validation Library (for Manim Parameters):** Use a Python validation library (e.g., `cerberus`, `voluptuous`) to enforce the Manim scene schema.  This library should be configured to understand the specific constraints of Manim parameters.
5.  **Reject, Don't Sanitize (Primarily):** Focus on rejecting invalid input rather than attempting to "clean" it.  Sanitization is error-prone.  Only minimal sanitization (e.g., whitespace trimming) should be considered, and only after thorough validation.
6. **Contextual Validation within Manim:** Validate input in the context of its specific use within Manim. For example, if a user provides coordinates, validate them against the expected range for the Manim scene.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary Python code into the Manim rendering process *through Manim scene parameters*.
    *   **Indirect Code Execution via External Programs (Severity: High):** By strictly controlling the parameters passed to Manim, this indirectly reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in external programs called by Manim (like FFmpeg).
    * **XSS (Severity: High):** If Manim output is displayed in web context, proper escaping prevents XSS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Very Low* (assuming correct and comprehensive implementation).
    *   **Indirect Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced, but not eliminated (requires additional mitigations for external program interactions).
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** "Basic input validation is present, but no formal schema or templating is used for Manim scene generation."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** "Define a comprehensive Manim scene schema.  Refactor the code to use Jinja2 templating for all Manim scene creation.  Integrate a validation library to enforce the schema."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of External Programs (Manim Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_external_programs__manim_interaction_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Manim's External Calls:**  Carefully examine the Manim code and configuration to identify *all* instances where Manim interacts with external programs (FFmpeg, LaTeX, SoX, etc.). This includes explicit calls and implicit dependencies.
2.  **Safe API Usage:**  If Manim provides higher-level APIs for interacting with these external programs (rather than requiring direct command-line construction), *use those APIs*.  These APIs are more likely to handle argument escaping and validation correctly.
3.  **Parameter Validation (Even with APIs):**  Even when using Manim's APIs, *validate* any data that is ultimately passed to the external program through those APIs. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
4.  **Whitelisting Arguments (If Necessary):** If you *must* construct command-line arguments within your application code (which should be avoided if possible), use a strict whitelist. Define *exactly* which arguments and options are allowed, and reject anything else.  This is *highly* discouraged; prefer Manim's built-in mechanisms.
5. **Configuration Review:** Review Manim's configuration related to external programs. Disable any unnecessary features or codecs that could increase the attack surface. For example, if you're not using LaTeX, ensure it's disabled in Manim's configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Indirect Code Execution (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in external programs called by Manim (e.g., FFmpeg command injection).
    *   **File System Access (Severity: Medium):** By controlling filenames and paths passed to external programs, this mitigates path traversal vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Indirect Code Execution:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Medium* or *Low* (depending on the thoroughness of the implementation and the security of the external programs themselves).
    *   **File System Access:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** "The application uses Manim's default settings for interacting with FFmpeg, without additional validation."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** "Thoroughly review all Manim code that interacts with external programs.  Implement strict validation of all parameters passed to these programs, even through Manim's APIs.  Consider whitelisting arguments if direct command-line construction is unavoidable (but strongly prefer using Manim's APIs)."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Output and Filename Management (Manim Output)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_output_and_filename_management__manim_output_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Manim Configuration for Output:** Use Manim's configuration options (e.g., `config.media_dir`, `config.output_file`) to control the output directory and filename generation.
2.  **Avoid User-Controlled Paths/Filenames:**  Do *not* allow users to directly specify the output path or filename through input.  Instead, use Manim's configuration to set a fixed output directory.
3.  **Filename Sanitization (Within Manim):** If Manim generates filenames based on scene parameters (which might include user input *indirectly*), ensure that Manim's internal filename sanitization is robust. If necessary, implement custom pre-processing of user input *before* it's used by Manim, to remove any potentially dangerous characters. This is a defense-in-depth measure, assuming Manim *should* handle this, but you're adding an extra layer.
4. **Unique Filename Generation:** Configure Manim to generate unique filenames for each rendered animation (e.g., using a UUID or a hash). This prevents collisions and overwriting. This is usually a configuration option within Manim.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from using Manim to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system.
    *   **File Overwriting (Severity: Medium):** Prevents attackers from overwriting existing files via Manim's output.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    *   **File Overwriting:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** "Manim's default output directory is used, but filenames are not guaranteed to be unique."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** "Configure Manim to generate unique filenames (e.g., using UUIDs).  Review and, if necessary, enhance Manim's internal filename sanitization. Ensure users cannot influence the output path."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Complexity Restrictions (Manim-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_complexity_restrictions__manim-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze Manim Features:** Analyze which Manim features (e.g., complex scenes, large numbers of objects, long animations, high resolutions) have the greatest impact on resource consumption (CPU, memory, rendering time).
2.  **Parameter Limits:**  Identify the Manim parameters that control these resource-intensive features.  Impose strict limits on these parameters based on user input.  For example:
    *   Limit the maximum number of `Mobject`s in a scene.
    *   Limit the maximum duration of an animation.
    *   Limit the maximum resolution or frame rate.
    *   Limit the complexity of mathematical expressions (if applicable).
3.  **Validation Against Limits:**  Validate user input against these limits *before* passing it to Manim.  Reject any input that would result in excessive resource usage.
4. **Manim Configuration for Limits:** Explore if Manim itself offers configuration options to limit resource usage (e.g., maximum rendering time). If so, utilize these options.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents attackers from crafting malicious Manim scenes that consume excessive resources, making the application unavailable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** "No specific limits are placed on Manim scene complexity."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** "Identify resource-intensive Manim features and parameters.  Implement input validation to restrict these parameters to safe limits. Explore and utilize any relevant Manim configuration options for resource control."
