# Attack Surface Analysis for 3b1b/manim

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution__ace_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject and execute malicious Python code within the `manim` rendering process.
    *   **Manim Contribution:** `Manim` executes user-provided (or influenced) Python code to define animation scenes. This execution, often using functions like `exec()`, creates a direct pathway for code injection if input is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Example:** A web application allows users to input a mathematical function. An attacker inputs `"; import os; os.system('rm -rf /'); #"` instead of a valid function.  If this is directly used in the `manim` scene code, it could delete files.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the system running `manim`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous whitelisting of allowed input. Reject anything that doesn't strictly conform.
        *   **Parameterization:** Use parameterized approaches instead of string concatenation for dynamic scene elements.
        *   **Sandboxing (Essential):** Run `manim` in a highly restricted, isolated environment (e.g., Docker container with minimal privileges). This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the `manim` process with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review code that handles user input and interacts with `manim`.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft `manim` scenes that consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk), making the system unresponsive.
    *   **Manim Contribution:** `Manim`'s rendering can be computationally expensive. Complex animations, high resolutions, or long durations can overwhelm resources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker submits a scene requesting an extremely high-resolution render of a fractal with an infinite zoom and long duration, exhausting server resources.
    *   **Impact:** System unavailability. The application or server becomes unusable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Impose strict limits on rendering parameters (resolution, frame rate, duration, object count, complexity).
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for rendering processes. Terminate renders exceeding a time limit.
        *   **Job Queues:** Use a job queue and worker system to isolate rendering processes.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor system resource usage and alert on threshold breaches.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit rendering requests per user within a time period.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Sandboxing helps contain the impact of resource exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate file paths used by `manim` to write files to arbitrary locations.
    *   **Manim Contribution:** `Manim` writes output files (videos, images).  User-influenced output paths without sanitization are vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A user provides an output filename like `../../../etc/passwd`, potentially overwriting the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, system compromise, or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fixed Output Directory:** Use a dedicated, secure, and *fixed* output directory. Do *not* allow user input to influence the directory.
        *   **Unique Filenames:** Generate unique, unpredictable filenames (e.g., UUIDs). Do *not* use user-provided filenames directly.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Rigorously sanitize any user input that *might* influence the filename.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run `manim` with minimal file system permissions.
        *   **Sandboxing:** A sandboxed environment restricts file system access.
