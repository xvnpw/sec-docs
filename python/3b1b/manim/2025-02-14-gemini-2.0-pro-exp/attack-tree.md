## Attack Tree Path: [1. RCE via Unsafe Scene Construction](./attack_tree_paths/1__rce_via_unsafe_scene_construction.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary attack vector. Manim scenes are defined using Python code. If an attacker can inject arbitrary Python code into the scene definition, they can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is typically done by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles user input that is used to generate the scene.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  If user input is used *at all* in the scene creation process without extremely careful sanitization and validation, this vulnerability is highly likely to exist.  It's easy to accidentally introduce this vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful RCE on the server gives the attacker complete control over the server process running Manim. They can read, write, and delete files, execute arbitrary commands, potentially escalate privileges, and pivot to other systems on the network. This is a complete system compromise.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  Finding the injection point might require some understanding of the application's code, but crafting a malicious Python payload is relatively straightforward.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.  Requires understanding of Python, how Manim processes scene definitions, and basic web application security principles (input validation, output encoding).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Unusual server behavior, unexpected file modifications, or network traffic could indicate a compromise.  Good logging and monitoring are crucial, but a skilled attacker might try to cover their tracks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Attack Vector 1a: Inject Malicious Python Code into Scene Definition](./attack_tree_paths/sub-attack_vector_1a_inject_malicious_python_code_into_scene_definition.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker directly injects Python code into the part of the application that constructs the Manim scene. This could be through a web form, API endpoint, or any other input mechanism that influences the scene's code.
*   **Example:** If the application takes user input for a mathematical formula and directly uses that input in a `manim.TextMobject()` call without proper sanitization, the attacker could inject Python code disguised as a formula.  For instance, if the application does something like `TextMobject(f"The answer is {user_input}")`, an attacker could provide input like `1; import os; os.system('rm -rf /') #`. 
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never** directly embed user input into Python code that constructs Manim scenes.
    *   Use a strict whitelist of allowed characters and functions.  For example, if the input is supposed to be a mathematical expression, only allow numbers, operators, and specific mathematical functions.
    *   Use a template engine that automatically escapes output, and ensure it's configured to escape Python code.
    *   Consider using a separate, sandboxed process for rendering Manim animations, limiting its access to the rest of the system.
    *   Input validation and sanitization are paramount.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 1b: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Manim's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1b_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_manim's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Even if the application perfectly handles user input and prevents direct code injection, Manim relies on external libraries (like NumPy, FFmpeg, Cairo, etc.).  A vulnerability in one of these dependencies could be exploited through Manim.  This is a *critical node* because it's outside the direct control of the application developer.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in a library Manim uses for image processing could allow an attacker to craft a specially designed image that, when processed by Manim, triggers the vulnerability and leads to code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. While less likely than direct code injection, dependency vulnerabilities are a constant threat.  The likelihood depends on the specific dependencies used and their update frequency.
*   **Impact:** High.  Similar to direct RCE, exploiting a dependency vulnerability can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Effort:** High.  Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries often requires significant expertise and research.
*   **Skill Level:** High.  Requires deep understanding of vulnerability research, reverse engineering, and potentially exploit development.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High.  Detecting exploitation of a dependency vulnerability can be very difficult, especially if the attacker is sophisticated.  It often requires advanced intrusion detection systems and security monitoring.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Manim and all its dependencies to the latest versions.  This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Tool:** SCA tools can identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to Manim and its dependencies.
    *   **Consider Dependency Pinning:** Pinning dependencies to specific versions can prevent unexpected updates that might introduce new vulnerabilities, but it also means you need to actively manage updates to get security patches.  This is a trade-off.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Manim rendering process with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they exploit a vulnerability.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run Manim in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container, virtual machine) to isolate it from the rest of the system.
