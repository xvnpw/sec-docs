Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the `manim` library:

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Scene Definition
    *   **Description:** An attacker could provide malicious input that is used to construct a Manim `Scene` object, injecting arbitrary Python code that gets executed during the rendering process. This could happen if the application dynamically generates scene code based on user input without proper sanitization, leveraging Manim's code execution capabilities within scene definitions.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server or the environment where Manim is running, potentially leading to data breaches, system takeover, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Manim Component:** `Scene` class, specifically the code execution within the `construct` method or custom methods defined in the scene.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly constructing Manim scene code from user-provided input.
        *   If dynamic scene generation is necessary, use a safe and restricted subset of Manim functionality, avoiding direct code execution.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data that influences Manim scene creation.
        *   Consider running the Manim rendering process in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions to restrict the impact of code execution.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion through Complex Scene Rendering
    *   **Description:** An attacker could request the rendering of an extremely complex Manim scene that inherently consumes excessive CPU, memory, or disk I/O resources due to the nature of the animation being rendered by Manim. This could involve scenes with a very large number of objects, intricate mathematical computations, or high rendering quality settings that push Manim's processing limits.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation for other users, potential server instability or crashes due to Manim's resource consumption.
    *   **Affected Manim Component:** The rendering pipeline within Manim, including modules responsible for object creation, animation interpolation, and output generation (e.g., `renderer` module, mathematical functions within Manim).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory usage) specifically for the Manim rendering process.
        *   Set reasonable limits on the complexity of animations that can be requested, considering Manim's performance characteristics.
        *   Implement request queuing and throttling to prevent overwhelming the rendering process with computationally intensive Manim tasks.
        *   Monitor server resources and implement alerts for high resource usage triggered by Manim rendering.
        *   Consider optimizing Manim scene generation and rendering settings to reduce resource consumption where possible.
