# Attack Surface Analysis for 3b1b/manim

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Manim Scripts](./attack_surfaces/malicious_manim_scripts.md)

* **Attack Surface: Malicious Manim Scripts**
    * **Description:** If the application allows users to upload or provide Manim scripts directly, a malicious script could contain code designed to harm the server or other users.
    * **How Manim Contributes:** Manim executes Python code provided in the script. This inherent functionality makes it a potential vector for executing arbitrary code.
    * **Example:** An attacker could upload a Manim script that uses Python's `os` module to delete files on the server, read sensitive configuration files, or execute system commands.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, data loss, information disclosure, compromise of the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never directly execute user-provided Manim scripts without thorough sanitization and sandboxing.**
        * If user-provided scripts are necessary, implement a secure sandboxing environment with restricted permissions and resource limits.
        * Use static analysis tools to scan scripts for potentially malicious code patterns before execution.
        * Consider alternative approaches to user-generated content that don't involve direct code execution.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via External Tools (ffmpeg, LaTeX)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_external_tools__ffmpeg__latex_.md)

* **Attack Surface: Command Injection via External Tools (ffmpeg, LaTeX)**
    * **Description:** Manim relies on external command-line tools like `ffmpeg` for video encoding and potentially LaTeX for rendering mathematical formulas. If input to these tools is not properly sanitized, command injection vulnerabilities can arise.
    * **How Manim Contributes:** Manim constructs and executes commands for these external tools based on the scene definition and configuration. If the application doesn't sanitize inputs that influence these commands, attackers can inject malicious commands.
    * **Example:** An attacker might manipulate a filename or configuration parameter that gets passed to `ffmpeg`, injecting commands like ``; rm -rf /`` (a highly destructive command).
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strictly sanitize and validate all inputs that are used to construct commands for external tools.**
        * Avoid directly concatenating user-provided input into command strings.
        * If possible, use libraries or APIs that provide safer ways to interact with these tools rather than directly executing shell commands.
        * Implement the principle of least privilege for the user account under which Manim and these tools are executed.

## Attack Surface: [File System Manipulation (Output)](./attack_surfaces/file_system_manipulation__output_.md)

* **Attack Surface: File System Manipulation (Output)**
    * **Description:** Manim generates output files (videos, images, LaTeX files). If the application doesn't control the output directory and filenames properly, attackers might be able to overwrite critical files or place malicious files in accessible locations.
    * **How Manim Contributes:** Manim's core function is to generate these output files. If the application doesn't manage this process securely, it creates an attack vector.
    * **Example:** An attacker could manipulate configuration parameters or script content to make Manim output a file named `.bashrc` in a user's home directory containing malicious commands that would execute upon login.
    * **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution, data corruption, defacement of the application or server.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce a strict and controlled output directory for Manim-generated files.**
        * Sanitize or generate unique filenames to prevent overwriting existing files.
        * Implement proper access controls on the output directory.
        * Avoid serving Manim's output directory directly to the public without careful consideration and security measures.
