# Threat Model Analysis for 3b1b/manim

## Threat: [Malicious Manim Script Injection](./threats/malicious_manim_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted Manim script as input to the application. This script leverages Manim's Python execution environment to run arbitrary code on the server. The attacker might aim to read sensitive files, execute system commands, or establish a reverse shell. This directly exploits Manim's capability to execute user-provided Python code.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the server hosting the application, including data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Manim Component:** `Scene` class, script parsing and execution engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided Manim script input to remove or neutralize potentially harmful code.
        *   Execute Manim in a heavily sandboxed environment with restricted permissions, limiting access to system resources and network.
        *   Consider using a secure, pre-defined set of Manim functionalities instead of allowing arbitrary script execution.
        *   Implement robust code review processes for any user-provided Manim scripts before execution.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Scene](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_scene.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits an intentionally complex Manim scene that utilizes Manim's rendering capabilities in a way that consumes excessive computational resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O). This can lead to the server becoming unresponsive or crashing due to the demands of Manim's rendering process.
    *   **Impact:** High. Denial of service, impacting the availability of the application for legitimate users due to Manim's resource consumption.
    *   **Affected Manim Component:** Rendering pipeline, animation engine, object creation and manipulation within Manim.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory usage) specifically for Manim rendering processes.
        *   Analyze the complexity of submitted scenes before rendering (e.g., by counting the number of objects or animations) and reject overly complex ones.
        *   Implement timeouts for Manim rendering processes to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
        *   Utilize asynchronous rendering to prevent blocking the main application thread while Manim is processing.

## Threat: [Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities through Manim](./threats/exploiting_dependency_vulnerabilities_through_manim.md)

*   **Description:** Manim relies on various Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pillow). Attackers could craft specific Manim scenes or inputs that, when processed by Manim, trigger known vulnerabilities within these dependent libraries. This exploitation occurs because Manim utilizes these libraries in its internal operations.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical. Depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, this could lead to arbitrary code execution within the Manim process, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Manim Component:** Dependency management, any Manim module that directly utilizes vulnerable dependencies (e.g., image manipulation, mathematical computations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Manim and *all* its dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Manim's dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for monitoring and addressing security advisories related to Manim's dependency stack.

## Threat: [Unintended File System Access via Manim's Output Paths](./threats/unintended_file_system_access_via_manim's_output_paths.md)

*   **Description:** If the application doesn't strictly control the output paths used by Manim to save rendered files (images or videos), an attacker might be able to manipulate the Manim scene or configuration to specify output paths that overwrite critical system files or expose sensitive data by writing output to accessible locations. This threat directly arises from Manim's file output functionality.
    *   **Impact:** High. Potential for data loss, system instability, or information disclosure due to Manim's ability to write files.
    *   **Affected Manim Component:** File output mechanisms within Manim's rendering modules (e.g., video writing, image saving functions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strict control over Manim's output directory, preventing users from specifying arbitrary paths.
        *   Sanitize and validate any user-provided input that influences Manim's output path configuration.
        *   Run the Manim process with the least necessary file system privileges to limit the impact of potential path manipulation.
