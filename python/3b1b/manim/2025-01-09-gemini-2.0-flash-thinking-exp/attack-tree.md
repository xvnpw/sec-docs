## Attack Tree Path: [**Compromise Application via Manim Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_manim_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing a successful breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities within the Manim library.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path: Exploit Manim's Code Directly via Code Injection:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_manim's_code_directly_via_code_injection.md)

This path involves leveraging the application's handling of user input to inject and execute malicious Python code through Manim.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Code Injection via Unsafe Input Handling [CRITICAL NODE]:**](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_unsafe_input_handling__critical_node_.md)

The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input before incorporating it into Manim scene definitions. This creates an opportunity for attackers to inject arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Supply Malicious Scene Definition [CRITICAL NODE]:**](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_scene_definition__critical_node_.md)

The attacker crafts a scene definition that contains malicious Python code. This could be through direct input fields, file uploads, or other means of providing data to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Inject malicious Python code within scene definition [HIGH-RISK PATH START, CRITICAL NODE]:**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_python_code_within_scene_definition__high-risk_path_start__critical_node_.md)

The attacker embeds malicious Python code within the scene definition. This code could perform various actions, such as executing system commands, accessing sensitive data, or establishing a backdoor.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Application executes the scene definition using Manim [HIGH-RISK PATH END, CRITICAL NODE]:**](./attack_tree_paths/application_executes_the_scene_definition_using_manim__high-risk_path_end__critical_node_.md)

The application uses the Manim library to process and execute the attacker-supplied scene definition, including the embedded malicious code. This results in the execution of the attacker's commands within the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [**High-Risk Path: Exploit Manim's Dependencies with High Impact:**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_manim's_dependencies_with_high_impact.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries that Manim relies upon.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit vulnerabilities in Manim's dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_manim's_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

Manim depends on other Python libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them through Manim's usage of the vulnerable dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Trigger the vulnerable functionality through Manim's usage of the dependency [HIGH-RISK PATH START/END, CRITICAL NODE if leads to high impact]:**](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_the_vulnerable_functionality_through_manim's_usage_of_the_dependency__high-risk_path_starten_562058dd.md)

The attacker crafts input or triggers specific Manim functionality that, in turn, utilizes the vulnerable dependency in a way that exposes the vulnerability. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other severe consequences depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Malicious File Handling by Manim:**](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_file_handling_by_manim.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities related to how Manim handles file paths and file operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [**File Path Traversal/Injection:**](./attack_tree_paths/file_path_traversalinjection.md)

**Manim reads or writes files outside the intended directory [CRITICAL NODE if sensitive files are accessed/modified]:**
            By manipulating file paths provided to the application or Manim, an attacker can cause Manim to read sensitive files it shouldn't have access to or write to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting critical files.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Arbitrary File Write/Overwrite:**](./attack_tree_paths/arbitrary_file_writeoverwrite.md)

**Manim overwrites critical system files or application data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            Exploiting vulnerabilities in Manim's output file naming or handling can allow an attacker to force Manim to write to unintended locations, potentially overwriting critical system files or application data, leading to system instability or data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Logic Errors or Bugs in Manim:**](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_or_bugs_in_manim.md)

This involves exploiting flaws within Manim's own code logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Manim crashes, leaks information, or allows arbitrary code execution [CRITICAL NODE]:**](./attack_tree_paths/manim_crashes__leaks_information__or_allows_arbitrary_code_execution__critical_node_.md)

By crafting specific input or triggering a particular sequence of operations, an attacker can exploit bugs or logic errors within Manim's code. This could lead to the application crashing, leaking sensitive information, or, in severe cases, allowing for arbitrary code execution within the Manim process.
