## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application Using Manim [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_using_manim__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application that utilizes the Manim library.
*   **Significance:** Represents the highest level of risk. All subsequent attack paths aim to achieve this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Injection Vulnerabilities in Manim Usage [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_injection_vulnerabilities_in_manim_usage__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of user-provided input when generating Manim scripts or interacting with Manim functionalities.
*   **Risk Level:** High - Due to the common nature of input injection vulnerabilities in web applications and the potential for severe impact.
*   **Attack Vectors within this Path**:
    *   **Python Code Injection via User-Controlled Input in Manim Scripts [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:**  The most critical attack vector. Occurs when the application directly embeds unsanitized user input into Python code that is executed by Manim.
        *   **Critical Nodes within this Vector**:
            *   **Application passes unsanitized user input to Manim script generation [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the root cause. If the application fails to sanitize input, it becomes vulnerable.
            *   **Attacker crafts malicious input to execute arbitrary Python code during Manim rendering [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the exploitation step. The attacker leverages the lack of sanitization to inject and execute malicious Python code.
        *   **Impact:** Critical - Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to completely compromise the server, access sensitive data, modify application logic, or perform other malicious actions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - Input injection is a common vulnerability, especially when dynamically generating code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Manim Stack [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_manim_stack__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path targets vulnerabilities present in the dependencies used by Manim (e.g., Pillow, numpy, cairo, etc.).
*   **Risk Level:** High -  Due to the reliance on numerous external libraries, and the constant discovery of vulnerabilities in software dependencies.
*   **Attack Vectors within this Path**:
    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Manim's Python Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Manim's dependencies.
        *   **Critical Node within this Vector**:
            *   **Application uses vulnerable versions of Manim dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Using outdated libraries is the primary vulnerability.
        *   **Impact:** Variable - Impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It can range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE), potentially leading to full server compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium -  Applications often use outdated dependencies. Vulnerabilities in popular libraries are frequently discovered and exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [File Path Manipulation via User-Controlled Input in Manim Scripts [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/file_path_manipulation_via_user-controlled_input_in_manim_scripts__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves manipulating file paths used by Manim through user-controlled input.
*   **Critical Node**:
    *   **Application allows user input to control file paths used by Manim [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the application uses user input to construct file paths without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Impact:** Significant - Attackers can perform directory traversal to access sensitive files outside the intended directories, potentially overwrite critical application files, or cause Denial of Service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - File path manipulation is a common web vulnerability, often resulting from insecure file handling practices.
