# Attack Surface Analysis for 3b1b/manim

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Manim Script Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_manim_script_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Execution of untrusted Python code disguised as a Manim animation script, leveraging Manim's script execution capabilities.
    *   **Manim Contribution:** Manim's core design is to execute user-provided Python scripts to generate animations. This makes it inherently vulnerable to malicious scripts if executed without proper vetting. Manim provides the execution environment.
    *   **Example:** A developer unknowingly runs a Manim script downloaded from an untrusted source. This script, when executed by Manim, contains malicious Python code that could steal sensitive data, install malware, or compromise the developer's system.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, malware infection, and privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly execute Manim scripts only from highly trusted sources:**  Verify the origin and integrity of scripts with extreme caution.
        *   **Mandatory code review for all external scripts:**  Thoroughly examine the code of any script from an unknown or untrusted source before execution, looking for suspicious or malicious commands.
        *   **Utilize isolated environments (Virtual Machines, Containers):** Run Manim and execute external scripts within isolated environments to contain potential damage from malicious code execution.
        *   **Employ code analysis tools:** Use static analysis tools to automatically scan Manim scripts for potential security vulnerabilities or malicious patterns before execution.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via External Tools (LaTeX, ffmpeg)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_external_tools__latex__ffmpeg_.md)

*   **Description:** Potential vulnerabilities arising from improper sanitization of user-controlled input when Manim passes commands to external tools like LaTeX and ffmpeg. This could allow injection of arbitrary commands if Manim's input handling is flawed.
    *   **Manim Contribution:** Manim relies on external commands (LaTeX, ffmpeg) and constructs command-line calls based on scene names, text elements, and other script parameters. If Manim's code fails to properly sanitize these inputs before constructing and executing these commands, it creates a command injection vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor crafts a Manim script with a specially crafted scene name or text element containing shell metacharacters. If Manim does not properly escape or sanitize this input before passing it to LaTeX or ffmpeg, it *could* allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running Manim.
    *   **Impact:** **High to Critical**. Arbitrary command execution on the system, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or denial of service. The severity depends on the privileges of the user running Manim and the extent of the command injection vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Manim and external tools (LaTeX, ffmpeg) updated:** Ensure all components are patched against known vulnerabilities, including potential command injection flaws in the tools themselves or in Manim's interaction with them.
        *   **Code Audits of Manim's Command Construction:** For developers contributing to Manim or deeply concerned about this risk, conduct thorough code audits of Manim's codebase, specifically focusing on how it constructs and executes commands for LaTeX and ffmpeg. Verify proper input sanitization and escaping.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Manim processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage if a command injection vulnerability is exploited.
        *   **Input Sanitization within Manim (Development):** If extending or modifying Manim, rigorously implement input sanitization and validation for all user-provided data that is used to construct external commands. Use secure coding practices to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
