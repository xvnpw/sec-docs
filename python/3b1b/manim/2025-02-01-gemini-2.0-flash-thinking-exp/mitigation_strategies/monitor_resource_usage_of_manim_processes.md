#### 4.5. Threats Mitigated and Impact Analysis

*   **DoS via Manim (High Severity - Detection):**
    *   **Analysis:** Monitoring resource usage significantly improves the *detection* of DoS attacks targeting `manim`. By observing abnormal spikes in CPU, memory, or request queue length, administrators can identify potential DoS attempts early on.
    *   **Impact:**  The strategy *partially reduces* the impact of DoS by enabling faster detection. However, it does not inherently *prevent* DoS attacks. Mitigation actions (rate limiting, resource scaling, service isolation) would be necessary to fully address DoS.
*   **Resource Exhaustion due to Manim (High Severity - Detection):**
    *   **Analysis:**  Similar to DoS, resource monitoring is crucial for detecting resource exhaustion caused by legitimate but resource-intensive `manim` tasks or misconfigurations. Early detection allows for proactive intervention to prevent service degradation or outages.
    *   **Impact:** The strategy *partially reduces* the impact of resource exhaustion by enabling early detection and response.  It allows for timely intervention to prevent complete resource depletion and service failure.
*   **Performance Issues Related to Manim (Medium Severity - Security Related):**
    *   **Analysis:**  Monitoring helps identify performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies within the `manim` animation generation pipeline. Performance issues can be exploited or lead to instability, making this a security-related concern.
    *   **Impact:** The strategy *significantly improves* the ability to identify and resolve performance issues. By providing detailed metrics and logs, it facilitates troubleshooting and optimization of `manim` service performance, indirectly enhancing security and stability.

#### 4.6. Currently Implemented vs. Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic server monitoring provides a general overview of server health but lacks application-specific visibility into `manim` processes.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The core of this mitigation strategy is missing:
    *   **Detailed monitoring of `manim` process resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.).**
    *   **Alerting system specifically for `manim` resource thresholds and anomalies.**
    *   **Integration of `manim` monitoring data into dashboards for visibility.**

This gap highlights a significant vulnerability. Without specific `manim` monitoring, the application is blind to resource-related issues originating from or targeting the `manim` service, making it susceptible to DoS and resource exhaustion attacks, and hindering performance troubleshooting.
