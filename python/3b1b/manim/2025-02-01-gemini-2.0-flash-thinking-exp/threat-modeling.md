# Threat Model Analysis for 3b1b/manim

## Threat: [Malicious Manim Scene Code Injection](./threats/malicious_manim_scene_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious Python code into Manim scene definitions. This is possible if the application uses user-provided input to construct or modify Manim scene code. When Manim renders the scene, the injected Python code is executed by the Python interpreter.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. Attackers can gain full control of the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Manim Component Affected:** Scene rendering process, specifically the execution of Python code within Manim scenes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs that influence Manim scene generation.
*   Avoid directly constructing Manim scene code from user input.
*   Use parameterization or templating to separate user data from Manim code.
*   Run Manim scene generation in a sandboxed or isolated environment.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of scene generation logic.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Manim Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_manim_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Manim relies on numerous third-party Python libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies (like `numpy`, `Pillow`, `Cairo`, `ffmpeg`) can be exploited if the application uses vulnerable versions of these libraries as part of its Manim integration.

**Impact:**  Depending on the specific vulnerability, impacts can range from Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Denial of Service (DoS) to Information Disclosure.

**Manim Component Affected:** Dependency management and the use of vulnerable underlying libraries required by Manim.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Manim and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
*   Utilize dependency management tools (e.g., `pipenv`, `poetry`) to track and manage dependencies.
*   Implement vulnerability scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in Manim's dependencies.
*   Adopt Software Composition Analysis (SCA) practices for continuous monitoring of open-source dependencies.

## Threat: [Resource Intensive Animation Generation (DoS)](./threats/resource_intensive_animation_generation__dos_.md)

**Description:** Manim animations, especially complex ones, can be computationally expensive. An attacker can intentionally request or craft animations that are extremely resource-intensive (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to overload the server responsible for running Manim, leading to a Denial of Service.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown or unavailability, server crashes, increased operational costs due to resource exhaustion.

**Manim Component Affected:** Scene rendering engine, resource consumption during animation processing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time) for Manim scene generation processes.
*   Apply rate limiting to restrict the number of animation requests from a single user or IP address.
*   Use a queueing system to manage and prioritize animation requests.
*   If possible, impose limits on the complexity of user-provided inputs that influence animation generation.
*   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Excessive Output File Generation (DoS)](./threats/excessive_output_file_generation__dos_.md)

**Description:** Manim generates video and image files as animation outputs. A malicious user could attempt to generate a large number of animations or very large animation files, rapidly consuming server disk space and potentially leading to disk exhaustion and Denial of Service.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to disk space exhaustion, server instability, application failure.

**Manim Component Affected:** Output file generation, file system storage related to Manim's rendering output.

**Risk Severity:** High (potential for High severity if not managed)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the size and number of generated output files.
*   Enforce disk quotas for the application or user accounts involved in animation generation.
*   Utilize temporary storage for generated files and implement automated cleanup mechanisms.
*   Monitor disk space usage and set up alerts for approaching capacity limits.
