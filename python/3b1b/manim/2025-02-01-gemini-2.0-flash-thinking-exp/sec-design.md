- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a powerful and flexible tool for creating high-quality mathematical animations.
  - Maintain an open-source and community-driven project to foster collaboration and innovation.
  - Ensure ease of use and accessibility for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
  - Support a wide range of mathematical concepts and visualization techniques.

- Business Goals:
  - Increase adoption of Manim within the educational and content creation communities.
  - Expand the functionality and features of Manim based on user feedback and community contributions.
  - Establish Manim as the leading open-source animation engine for mathematics.
  - Ensure long-term sustainability and maintainability of the project.

- Business Risks:
  - Complexity of use hindering adoption by non-technical users.
  - Lack of community contributions leading to slow development and feature stagnation.
  - Security vulnerabilities in dependencies or the core codebase impacting user trust and project reputation.
  - Performance issues or limitations in handling complex animations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Manim is an open-source project primarily used locally by individual users to generate animations. As such, the security posture is focused on the integrity of the software itself and the security of the user's local environment.

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Review - The codebase is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Python's `pip` and `requirements.txt` are used to manage project dependencies. Implemented: Project Repository.
  - security control: GitHub Security Features - GitHub provides basic security features like vulnerability scanning for dependencies. Implemented: GitHub Platform.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in Dependencies - The project relies on numerous Python libraries, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies could affect Manim. Mitigation: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
  - accepted risk: Code Injection via User Scripts - Users write Python scripts to define animations, and malicious or poorly written scripts could potentially cause harm to the user's local system. Mitigation: User education and sandboxing (if feasible).
  - accepted risk: Supply Chain Attacks - Compromise of upstream dependencies or build tools could introduce malicious code into Manim. Mitigation: Dependency pinning and verification, secure build processes.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
  - security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Utilize SCA tools to gain visibility into the project's software components and their associated risks.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically analyze the codebase for potential security flaws.
  - security control: Security Awareness Training for Contributors - Provide security awareness training to project contributors to promote secure coding practices.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable as Manim is primarily a local, offline tool. No user authentication is required.
  - Authorization: Not applicable as Manim operates within the user's local file system permissions. No specific authorization mechanisms are needed within the application itself.
  - Input Validation: User-provided Python scripts are the primary input. Input validation is crucial to prevent execution of malicious code or unexpected behavior. This should focus on validating the structure and syntax of animation scripts, and potentially sandboxing script execution.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for Manim's primary functionality of animation generation. However, if features involving data storage or network communication are added in the future, appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered. For now, ensure no sensitive data is stored or transmitted by Manim itself.

# DESIGN

Manim is designed as a Python library that users install and utilize locally to create mathematical animations. The core architecture revolves around processing user-defined Python scripts to generate video or GIF outputs.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a functional and reliable animation engine for users.
  - Maintaining the open-source community and project reputation.
  - Ensuring the long-term availability and maintainability of Manim.

- Data to Protect:
  - User-created animation scripts: Sensitivity - Medium (potentially contains intellectual property, but generally not highly sensitive personal data). Integrity and availability are important.
  - Manim source code: Sensitivity - Medium (intellectual property of the project). Integrity and availability are crucial for project continuity.
  - Project infrastructure (build systems, distribution channels): Sensitivity - Medium (compromise could lead to supply chain attacks). Integrity and availability are critical.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Low to Medium. Manim primarily processes and generates visual content. User scripts might contain some intellectual property, but the application itself does not handle highly sensitive personal or financial data. The main concern is the integrity of the software and the user's local system.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any plans to introduce features that involve network communication or data storage beyond local file system operations?
  - Is there a formal process for security vulnerability reporting and handling within the Manim project?
  - What is the current level of security awareness and training among project contributors?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements or industry standards that Manim needs to adhere to?

- Assumptions:
  - Manim is primarily used as a local, offline tool.
  - User scripts are the main form of input and are assumed to be created by users on their own systems.
  - The project is community-driven and relies on open-source principles for security.
  - There is no central server or service component for Manim in its current architecture.
  - Distribution is primarily through PyPI and GitHub.
