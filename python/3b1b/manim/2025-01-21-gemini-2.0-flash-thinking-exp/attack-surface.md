# Attack Surface Analysis for 3b1b/manim

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Python Code Injection via Scene Definition](./attack_surfaces/malicious_python_code_injection_via_scene_definition.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious Python code into the definition of a Manim scene. When Manim attempts to render this scene, the malicious code is executed.

**How Manim Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Manim's core functionality involves executing Python code to define and render animations. If the application allows users to directly input or modify scene definitions as Python code, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** A user provides a scene definition containing `import os; os.system('rm -rf /')` which, if executed by the server running Manim, could lead to data loss or system compromise.

**Impact:** Critical - Full control over the system running Manim, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Direct User Input of Python Code:**  Do not allow users to directly input or modify raw Python code for scene definitions.
*   **Use a Safe Abstraction Layer:**  Provide a higher-level, safer interface for users to define animations, abstracting away the direct Python code.
*   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** If direct code execution is necessary, run the Manim rendering process in a sandboxed or isolated environment with limited permissions.
*   **Code Review and Static Analysis:** If user-provided code is unavoidable, implement rigorous code review and static analysis tools to detect potentially malicious patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized Input in Text Objects Leading to Command Injection (via LaTeX)](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_input_in_text_objects_leading_to_command_injection__via_latex_.md)

**Description:** When using Manim's `Tex` or related objects, unsanitized user input can be interpreted as LaTeX commands. If the underlying LaTeX installation is not properly secured, this could potentially lead to command injection.

**How Manim Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Manim relies on LaTeX for rendering mathematical formulas and text. If user-provided text is directly passed to LaTeX without sanitization, LaTeX's command execution capabilities can be exploited.

**Example:** A user provides the input `$(shell echo 'ATTACK!')` within a text field intended for a mathematical formula. If not sanitized, LaTeX might execute the `echo` command on the server.

**Impact:** High - Potential for arbitrary command execution on the server, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize user-provided text before using it in `Tex` objects. Remove or escape potentially dangerous LaTeX commands.
*   **Restrict LaTeX Functionality:** Configure the LaTeX installation used by Manim to disable or restrict potentially dangerous commands.
*   **Use Alternative Text Rendering Methods:** If possible, consider using Manim's `Text` object for simpler text rendering where LaTeX's advanced features are not required.
