# Threat Model Analysis for 3b1b/manim

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Manim Scripts](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_manim_scripts.md)

**Description:** If the Manim library itself does not properly sanitize or escape user-provided input when constructing or executing scripts (e.g., within functions like `Text`, `MathTex`, or custom scene elements), an attacker could inject malicious Python code. This code would then be executed by the Manim interpreter.

**Impact:**
*   Remote code execution on the server or client running the Manim script.
*   Access to sensitive data on the server or client file system.
*   Modification or deletion of files.
*   Installation of malware or backdoors.
*   Compromise of other services or systems accessible from the affected machine.

**Affected Manim Component:**
*   Specifically affects the script execution process within Manim.
*   Potentially any module or function within Manim that handles user-provided data and incorporates it into the script, such as functions for creating `Text` objects, `MathTex` objects, or defining scene elements based on user input.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization within Manim:** Ensure Manim's internal functions properly sanitize or escape user-provided input to prevent code injection. This might involve changes to the Manim library itself.
*   **Parameterization within Manim:** Design Manim's API to encourage passing data as parameters rather than directly embedding it into script strings.
*   **Code Review of Manim:**  Contribute to or encourage thorough code reviews of the Manim library to identify and fix potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Manim Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_manim_library_itself.md)

**Description:**  Bugs or security flaws within the Manim library code itself could be exploited by an attacker. This could involve crafting specific inputs or triggering certain conditions that expose these vulnerabilities, leading to unexpected behavior or the ability to execute arbitrary code within the Manim process.

**Impact:**
*   Remote code execution within the Manim process.
*   Denial of service by crashing the Manim process.
*   Unexpected behavior or errors in the application.
*   Potential for data corruption or leakage depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Manim Component:**
*   Any module or function within the Manim library could be affected depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   This could range from core rendering modules to utility functions.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Manim Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of Manim to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any security advisories or vulnerability reports related to Manim.
*   **Contribute to Manim:** If possible, contribute to the Manim project by reporting bugs and security issues.
*   **Consider Static Analysis of Manim:** Use static analysis tools on the Manim codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unintended File System Access](./threats/unintended_file_system_access.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities or design flaws within Manim's file handling mechanisms could allow it to access or modify files outside of its intended working directory. An attacker could potentially exploit this to read sensitive files or overwrite critical system files through Manim's file operations.

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of sensitive configuration files or data.
*   Overwriting critical system files, leading to system instability or failure.
*   Data breaches if sensitive user data is accessed.
*   Potential for privilege escalation if executable files are modified.

**Affected Manim Component:**
*   Modules and functions within Manim related to file input/output operations, such as those used for loading scene files, saving rendered output, or accessing external assets.
*   Potentially the configuration system within Manim if it allows specifying arbitrary file paths without proper validation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure File Handling within Manim:** Review and improve Manim's internal file handling logic to prevent access to unauthorized locations.
*   **Restrict File Paths within Manim:** Ensure Manim's configuration and internal logic restrict file access to a designated working directory.
*   **Input Validation for File Paths within Manim:** If Manim accepts file paths as input (e.g., for assets), strictly validate them to prevent directory traversal attacks.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion During Rendering](./threats/resource_exhaustion_during_rendering.md)

**Description:**  Inefficiencies or vulnerabilities within Manim's rendering engine could be exploited by an attacker to create excessively complex scenes or trigger resource-intensive operations, leading to denial of service. This could occur without necessarily involving malicious code injection, but rather by leveraging the inherent capabilities of Manim in an abusive way.

**Impact:**
*   Denial of service (DoS) for the application.
*   Server instability or crashes.
*   Impact on other applications or services running on the same machine.
*   Increased infrastructure costs due to excessive resource consumption.

**Affected Manim Component:**
*   The core rendering engine and related modules within Manim responsible for processing scene definitions and generating output.
*   Specifically, modules dealing with complex mathematical calculations, object rendering, and animation generation.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (While potentially high impact, the direct involvement of Manim vulnerabilities might be less direct than other threats, but can escalate to high if specific flaws are found)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Resource Limits within Manim:** Explore options within Manim to set internal limits on resource consumption during rendering.
*   **Optimize Rendering Algorithms:** Contribute to or encourage optimization of Manim's rendering algorithms to improve efficiency.
*   **Input Complexity Limits within Manim:** If possible, implement mechanisms within Manim to detect and prevent excessively complex scene definitions that could lead to resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Rendering Commands](./threats/command_injection_via_rendering_commands.md)

**Description:** If Manim directly constructs and executes system commands for rendering (e.g., using LaTeX or other external tools) without properly sanitizing inputs that influence these commands, an attacker could inject malicious commands.

**Impact:**
*   Remote code execution on the server.
*   Access to sensitive data.
*   Modification or deletion of files.
*   Compromise of the server.

**Affected Manim Component:**
*   Modules or functions within Manim that interact with external rendering engines or command-line tools.
*   Specifically, the parts of the Manim code that construct and execute system commands.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction within Manim:** Modify Manim to avoid constructing rendering commands dynamically based on potentially untrusted input.
*   **Input Sanitization within Manim:** If dynamic construction is unavoidable, ensure Manim strictly sanitizes and validates all input before incorporating it into commands.
*   **Parameterization within Manim:** Utilize parameterized commands or APIs provided by the rendering tools instead of directly constructing shell commands.
