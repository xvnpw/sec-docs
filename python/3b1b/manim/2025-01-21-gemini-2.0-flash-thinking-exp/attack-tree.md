## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server__critical_node_.md)

*   **Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities in Manim Scripts [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities_in_manim_scripts__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities in Manim Scripts [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This node represents a category of vulnerabilities arising from how the application processes and executes Manim scripts, especially those provided by users or external sources. Successful exploitation here allows attackers to inject malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Python Code into Manim Script [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_python_code_into_manim_script__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Python Code into Manim Script [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious Python code directly into a Manim script that the application subsequently executes. This is possible if the application doesn't sanitize or validate user-provided or externally sourced scripts.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code on the server with the application's privileges.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization of Manim scripts. Consider using a sandboxed environment for script execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Execution of Injected Code [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_execution_of_injected_code__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Trigger Execution of Injected Code [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Once malicious Python code is injected into a Manim script, the Manim rendering process executes this code as part of its normal operation.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of the attacker's injected code, leading to arbitrary command execution.
    *   **Mitigation:** Prevent the initial injection of malicious code through robust input validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Manim's File System Access [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_manim's_file_system_access__critical_node_.md)

*   **Leverage Manim's File System Access [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This node represents the potential for attackers to exploit Manim's ability to interact with the file system. Manim scripts can read, write, and manipulate files, which can be abused.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate File Paths for Malicious Actions [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_file_paths_for_malicious_actions__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Manipulate File Paths for Malicious Actions [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate file paths within Manim scripts to perform unauthorized actions on the server's file system.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to reading sensitive files, overwriting critical files, or even executing malicious files.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict validation of file paths used in Manim scripts. Avoid using user-controlled input directly in file path construction.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal: Access or modify files outside intended directories. [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_access_or_modify_files_outside_intended_directories___high_risk_path_.md)

    *   **Path Traversal: Access or modify files outside intended directories. [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting file paths with ".." sequences or other path traversal techniques, attackers can access or modify files and directories outside the intended scope of the application.
        *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data, modification of application files, potential for further compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust path validation and sanitization. Use absolute paths or restrict file access to specific directories.

## Attack Tree Path: [Arbitrary File Write/Overwrite: Create or modify sensitive files. [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/arbitrary_file_writeoverwrite_create_or_modify_sensitive_files___high_risk_path_.md)

    *   **Arbitrary File Write/Overwrite: Create or modify sensitive files. [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can use Manim's file writing capabilities to create new files in arbitrary locations or overwrite existing sensitive files with malicious content.
        *   **Impact:**  Can lead to configuration changes, replacement of legitimate files with backdoors, or denial of service.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Restrict file writing permissions and validate output file paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Manim's External Command Execution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_manim's_external_command_execution__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Manim's External Command Execution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   This node represents the risk of attackers leveraging Manim's ability (or the ability of libraries it uses) to execute external system commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands into Manim Script [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_into_manim_script__high_risk_path_.md)

    *   **Inject Malicious Commands into Manim Script [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious system commands into a Manim script that the application executes. This is possible if the application doesn't prevent the use of command execution functions or doesn't sanitize script content.
        *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands on the server with the application's privileges.
        *   **Mitigation:** Disable or restrict the use of functions that allow external command execution in Manim scripts, especially for user-provided content. Implement strict input validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Execution of Injected Commands [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_execution_of_injected_commands__high_risk_path_.md)

    *   **Trigger Execution of Injected Commands [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Once malicious commands are injected, the Manim rendering process (or underlying libraries) executes these commands.
        *   **Impact:**  Full control over the server through command execution.
        *   **Mitigation:** Prevent the initial injection of malicious commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Manim's Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_manim's_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Manim's Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This node represents the risk arising from vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries that Manim relies on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerability through Manim Usage [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerability_through_manim_usage__high_risk_path_.md)

    *   **Trigger Vulnerability through Manim Usage [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Manim's code interacts with a vulnerable dependency in a way that triggers the vulnerability. This could involve providing specific input that exploits the flaw or using the dependency's API in an insecure manner.
        *   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but can range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update Manim and its dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Injection: Provide malicious input that triggers the vulnerability in the dependency. [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/data_injection_provide_malicious_input_that_triggers_the_vulnerability_in_the_dependency___high_risk_7f62b9fc.md)

        *   **Data Injection: Provide malicious input that triggers the vulnerability in the dependency. [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft specific input that, when processed by the vulnerable dependency through Manim, triggers the vulnerability.
            *   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability, potentially leading to code execution or other forms of compromise.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Keep dependencies updated and implement input validation even for data passed to dependencies.
