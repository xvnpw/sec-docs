# Threat Model Analysis for mesonbuild/meson

## Threat: [Malicious `meson.build` Modification](./threats/malicious__meson_build__modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository and modifies the `meson.build` file. They might insert commands to download and execute arbitrary code during the build process, modify compiler flags to introduce vulnerabilities, or alter the build output to include malicious components.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, introduction of backdoors or malware into the application, exfiltration of sensitive information from the build environment, or supply chain compromise affecting downstream users.

**Affected Meson Component:** `meson.build` file parsing and execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls and authentication for the source code repository.
* Enforce code review processes for all changes to `meson.build` files.
* Utilize file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.
* Consider signing `meson.build` files to verify their authenticity.

## Threat: [Exploiting Undocumented or Unexpected `meson.build` Features](./threats/exploiting_undocumented_or_unexpected__meson_build__features.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and leverages undocumented or unintended behavior within the Meson Domain Specific Language (DSL) or its modules. This could involve manipulating internal state, bypassing security checks, or triggering unexpected code execution during the build.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution during the build, unexpected build behavior leading to vulnerabilities, or denial of service on the build system.

**Affected Meson Component:** Meson DSL interpreter, specific Meson modules (e.g., `files()`, `run_command()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with Meson releases and security advisories.
* Carefully review Meson documentation and be cautious when using less common features.
* Report any discovered unexpected behavior to the Meson development team.
* Consider static analysis of `meson.build` files to identify potential issues.

## Threat: [Injection Attacks via Meson Options](./threats/injection_attacks_via_meson_options.md)

**Description:** If build options are sourced from untrusted external inputs (e.g., command-line arguments, environment variables), an attacker could inject malicious values. Meson might pass these values to underlying build tools (compilers, linkers) without proper sanitization, leading to command injection or manipulation of build behavior.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, modification of compiler flags to introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., disabling security features), or denial of service during the build process.

**Affected Meson Component:** Option parsing and handling, integration with underlying build tools.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize and validate all external inputs used to configure the build process.
* Avoid directly passing untrusted input to potentially dangerous Meson functions or compiler flags.
* Use Meson's built-in mechanisms for defining and validating build options.

## Threat: [Malicious Dependencies via `fetch()` and `subproject()`](./threats/malicious_dependencies_via__fetch____and__subproject___.md)

**Description:** Meson's `fetch()` and `subproject()` functionalities download external dependencies. An attacker could compromise the source of these dependencies (e.g., a compromised Git repository, a malicious tarball hosted on a seemingly legitimate site) and inject malicious code that gets incorporated into the build.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malware into the application through compromised dependencies, potentially affecting all users of the built application.

**Affected Meson Component:** `fetch()` function, `subproject()` function, dependency management system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize dependency pinning and integrity checks (e.g., using checksums provided by the dependency source).
* Carefully vet the sources of external dependencies and prefer reputable sources.
* Consider using a private dependency mirror or repository to control and audit dependencies.
* Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.

## Threat: [Compromised WrapDB Entries](./threats/compromised_wrapdb_entries.md)

**Description:** Meson's WrapDB provides pre-packaged build definitions for common libraries. If an attacker compromises a WrapDB entry, they could inject malicious build instructions or point to compromised dependency sources.

**Impact:** Inclusion of vulnerable or malicious code into the application, potentially affecting all users.

**Affected Meson Component:** WrapDB integration, dependency resolution using WrapDB.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Exercise caution when using WrapDB and prioritize official package managers or direct source where possible.
* Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies even when using WrapDB.
* Monitor for any unusual activity or changes in WrapDB entries relevant to your project.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Dependency Downloads](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_dependency_downloads.md)

**Description:** During the dependency download process initiated by `fetch()` or `subproject()`, an attacker intercepts the communication (e.g., through a compromised network) and replaces legitimate dependencies with malicious ones.

**Impact:** Introduction of compromised dependencies into the application.

**Affected Meson Component:** `fetch()` function, `subproject()` function, network communication during dependency download.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure secure connections (HTTPS) are used for all dependency downloads.
* Verify checksums or signatures of downloaded dependencies after retrieval.
* Utilize trusted and secure network infrastructure for the build process.

## Threat: [Exploiting `run_command()` Functionality](./threats/exploiting__run_command____functionality.md)

**Description:** Meson's `run_command()` function allows executing arbitrary shell commands during the build process. If this function is used with unsanitized inputs or allows external control over the command being executed, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the build machine.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Affected Meson Component:** `run_command()` function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Minimize the use of `run_command()`.
* Carefully sanitize and validate any inputs used with `run_command()`.
* Avoid constructing shell commands dynamically from untrusted sources.
* Consider using alternative Meson built-in functions or safer methods for achieving the desired build tasks.

## Threat: [Compromise of the Meson Installation](./threats/compromise_of_the_meson_installation.md)

**Description:** If the Meson installation itself is compromised (e.g., through vulnerabilities in Meson or its dependencies, or through unauthorized access to the installation directory), an attacker could manipulate the build process without directly modifying project files.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors into the application, bypassing standard security checks.

**Affected Meson Component:** The Meson installation directory and its contents.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Install Meson from trusted sources and verify its integrity.
* Keep Meson updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Secure the build environment and restrict access to the Meson installation directory.
* Consider using isolated build environments (e.g., containers).
