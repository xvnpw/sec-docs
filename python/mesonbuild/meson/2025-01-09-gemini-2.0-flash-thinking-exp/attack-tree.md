## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Built with Meson (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_built_with_meson__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access or control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code During Build Process (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_during_build_process__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on injecting malicious code into the application during the build process, ensuring it's part of the final artifact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Build Definition (`meson.build`) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_build_definition___meson_build____critical_node_.md)

By gaining control over the `meson.build` file, an attacker can influence the entire build process, introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands via `custom_target` (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_via__custom_target___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit the `custom_target` functionality in `meson.build` to execute arbitrary commands during the build.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit insufficient sanitization of inputs used in `command` argument (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insufficient_sanitization_of_inputs_used_in__command__argument__critical_node_.md)

If user-provided or external data used in the `command` argument of `custom_target` is not properly sanitized, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the build system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Alter Dependency Specifications leading to malicious dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/alter_dependency_specifications_leading_to_malicious_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers modify the dependency declarations in `meson.build` to point to malicious repositories or specific vulnerable versions of legitimate libraries, introducing compromised code into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify `dependency()` calls to point to compromised repositories or versions (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/modify__dependency____calls_to_point_to_compromised_repositories_or_versions__critical_node_.md)

This specific action within the "Alter Dependency Specifications" path directly introduces malicious or vulnerable dependencies into the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Backdoors via Custom Scripts Executed by Meson (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_backdoors_via_custom_scripts_executed_by_meson__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage Meson's ability to execute custom scripts during the build process (e.g., using `run_command`) to introduce backdoors or malicious functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage `run_command` or similar functions with unsanitized inputs (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage__run_command__or_similar_functions_with_unsanitized_inputs__critical_node_.md)

Similar to `custom_target`, if inputs to functions like `run_command` are not properly sanitized, attackers can inject arbitrary commands to be executed during the build.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Meson Itself (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_meson_itself__critical_node_.md)

This involves directly exploiting security vulnerabilities within the Meson build system itself, such as command injection flaws in Meson's internal processes, path traversal issues, or even arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities in the Meson interpreter (Python).

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Subproject (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_subproject__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on compromising an external subproject that the application depends on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise a Meson subproject used by the application (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_a_meson_subproject_used_by_the_application__critical_node_.md)

The attacker gains control over a subproject used by the main application's build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious code within the subproject's `meson.build` or source files (HIGH-RISK PATH END)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_within_the_subproject's__meson_build__or_source_files__high-risk_path_end_.md)

Once a subproject is compromised, the attacker injects malicious code into its build definition or source files, which will then be included in the final application build.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Build Output (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_build_output__critical_node_.md)

This involves directly tampering with the output of the build process, potentially after the compilation stage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Built Artifacts (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_built_artifacts__critical_node_.md)

The attacker modifies the compiled executables or other build artifacts to inject malicious code or alter their functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Executables After Compilation via Custom Commands (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_executables_after_compilation_via_custom_commands__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage Meson's ability to execute custom commands after the compilation stage to modify the generated executables, injecting malware or backdoors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage post-build steps to inject malicious code (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_post-build_steps_to_inject_malicious_code__critical_node_.md)

This specific action within the "Modify Executables After Compilation" path involves using post-build scripts or commands to directly inject malicious code into the compiled binaries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in Meson Usage (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_meson_usage__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting insecure configurations or practices in how Meson is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of User-Provided Options (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH END)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_user-provided_options__critical_node__high-risk_path_end_.md)

If the application allows users to provide options to the Meson build system without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious values that lead to command injection or other vulnerabilities during the build process.
