## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Code During Build Process (HIGH-RISK PATH)

This analysis delves into the "Inject Malicious Code During Build Process" attack path for an application using Meson. We will break down the various sub-paths an attacker might take, the potential impact, and mitigation strategies.

**Attack Tree Path:** Inject Malicious Code During Build Process (HIGH-RISK PATH)

**Goal:**  Successfully embed malicious code into the final application artifact during the build process, ensuring it is executed by legitimate users.

**Why This is High-Risk:**

* **Stealth:** Code injected during the build process can be difficult to detect as it becomes part of the legitimate application.
* **Persistence:** The malicious code will be present in every instance of the built application, impacting all users.
* **Trust Exploitation:**  Users generally trust applications built from reputable sources. This attack leverages that trust.
* **Wide Impact:**  A successful attack can compromise a large number of users and systems.

**Detailed Breakdown of Sub-Paths:**

We can categorize the injection points based on the stage of the build process and the components involved.
