# Attack Surface Analysis for mesonbuild/meson

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted `meson.build` Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted__meson_build__files.md)

**Description:**  An attacker provides or influences the content of the `meson.build` file with malicious intent.

**How Meson Contributes:** Meson directly parses and executes the instructions within the `meson.build` file. Vulnerabilities in Meson's parsing logic or the features it exposes can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker injects code into a `custom_target()` command within `meson.build` that executes arbitrary commands on the build system during the configuration phase.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build system, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strictly control access to and modification of `meson.build` files.** Implement version control and code review processes.
*   **Sanitize and validate any external input used within `meson.build` files.** Avoid directly using unsanitized environment variables or command-line arguments in critical commands.
*   **Follow the principle of least privilege for the build environment.** Limit the permissions of the user running the Meson build.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Commands/Targets](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_custom_commandstargets.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit insufficient sanitization when constructing and executing custom commands or targets defined in `meson.build`.

**How Meson Contributes:** Meson provides the `custom_target()` and `custom_command()` features, allowing developers to execute arbitrary shell commands. If input to these commands is not properly handled, injection vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:** A `custom_target()` uses user-provided input to construct a file path without proper validation, allowing an attacker to perform path traversal and overwrite arbitrary files.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, file system manipulation (including deletion or modification), information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Avoid constructing shell commands directly from user-provided input.** If necessary, use safe command execution methods provided by Meson or the underlying operating system.
*   **Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input used in custom commands and targets.**  Use whitelisting and escaping techniques.
*   **Minimize the use of custom commands where possible.** Explore if Meson's built-in functionalities can achieve the desired outcome more securely.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Dependency Management via `fetch()`](./attack_surfaces/insecure_dependency_management_via__fetch___.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise the integrity of downloaded dependencies using Meson's `fetch()` functionality.

**How Meson Contributes:** Meson's `fetch()` module downloads external resources. If not configured securely, it can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks or fetching from untrusted sources.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts the download of a dependency specified in `meson.build` using `fetch()` over an insecure HTTP connection and replaces it with a malicious version.

**Impact:** Inclusion of compromised libraries or tools in the build process, potentially leading to vulnerabilities in the final application or the build environment.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Always use HTTPS for `fetch()` URLs.**
*   **Utilize the `checksum` argument in `fetch()` to verify the integrity of downloaded files.** Use strong cryptographic hash functions.
*   **Consider using `extract:` argument with caution and verify the contents after extraction.**
*   **If possible, mirror dependencies or use a private package repository for better control.**
