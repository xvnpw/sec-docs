# Attack Surface Analysis for mesonbuild/meson

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Execution via `meson.build` Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_execution_via__meson_build__files.md)

**Description:**  `meson.build` files, written in a Python-like DSL, can contain arbitrary code that is executed during the configuration phase.

**How Meson Contributes:** Meson directly interprets and executes the code within `meson.build` files. This is a core functionality for defining the build process.

**Example:** A compromised `meson.build` file could contain code to download and execute a malicious binary from a remote server during the `meson setup` command.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's or build system, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and audit all `meson.build` files for suspicious code.
*   Implement code review processes for changes to `meson.build` files.
*   Use static analysis tools to scan `meson.build` files for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Restrict write access to `meson.build` files to authorized personnel.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsanitized User-Provided Options](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsanitized_user-provided_options.md)

**Description:** Meson allows users to provide options during configuration. If these options are not properly sanitized and are used in commands executed by Meson (e.g., in custom targets or scripts), it can lead to command injection.

**How Meson Contributes:** Meson provides mechanisms to access and utilize user-provided options within the build process, making it the conduit for potentially malicious input.

**Example:** A custom target executes a command like `os.system(f"process_data --file {mesonlib.project_options['input_file']}")`. A malicious user could provide an `input_file` option like `"; rm -rf /"` leading to arbitrary command execution.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the build system, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize all user-provided options before using them in commands or scripts.
*   Avoid using shell execution (e.g., `os.system`) when possible. Prefer using Python's subprocess module with explicit argument lists.
*   Implement input validation to ensure options conform to expected formats and values.
*   Run build processes with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Subprojects or WrapDB](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_via_compromised_subprojects_or_wrapdb.md)

**Description:** Meson's `subproject()` functionality and its interaction with WrapDB can introduce vulnerabilities if external dependencies are compromised.

**How Meson Contributes:** Meson facilitates the inclusion of external projects and libraries, making the build process reliant on their integrity.

**Example:** A malicious actor compromises a project hosted on WrapDB, injecting malicious code. When a user builds a project that depends on this compromised subproject, the malicious code is included in their build.

**Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the final application, potentially leading to various security vulnerabilities for end-users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of subprojects using checksums or signatures.
*   Pin specific versions of subprojects to avoid unexpected changes.
*   Monitor subproject repositories for suspicious activity.
*   Consider hosting internal copies of critical dependencies.
*   Be cautious about using dependencies from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Custom Targets and Scripts](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution_via_custom_targets_and_scripts.md)

**Description:** Meson allows defining custom targets that execute arbitrary commands or scripts during the build process.

**How Meson Contributes:** Meson provides the mechanism to define and execute these custom build steps, granting significant power to the build configuration.

**Example:** A `custom_target` is defined to execute a shell script downloaded from an external, potentially compromised, server.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build system, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and audit all custom targets and associated scripts.
*   Avoid downloading and executing code from untrusted sources within custom targets.
*   Restrict the use of custom targets to essential build steps.
*   Run custom targets with the least necessary privileges.
