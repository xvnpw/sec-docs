# Threat Model Analysis for mesonbuild/meson

## Threat: [Command Injection via `run_command` or `custom_target`](./threats/command_injection_via__run_command__or__custom_target_.md)

* **Threat:** Command Injection via `run_command` or `custom_target`
    * **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious Mesonfile or influence external input used within `run_command` or `custom_target` to execute arbitrary commands on the build system. This involves Meson's functionality to execute external commands.
    * **Impact:**
        * Data Exfiltration: Sensitive data from the build environment could be stolen.
        * Malware Installation: Malicious software could be installed on the build system.
        * Build Artifact Manipulation: The attacker could modify the generated binaries or libraries.
        * Denial of Service: The build system could be crashed or rendered unusable.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `mesonbuild/interpreter/interpreter.py`: The interpreter module responsible for executing Mesonfile commands.
        * Specifically, the `run_command` function and the execution logic for `custom_target`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strict Input Validation: Sanitize and validate all external input used in `run_command` and `custom_target`. Avoid directly using user-provided strings in command arguments.
        * Use `command_substitution=False`:** When using `run_command`, explicitly set `command_substitution=False` to prevent shell command injection.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Run the build process with the minimum necessary privileges.
        * Code Review: Carefully review Mesonfiles for potential command injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in File Operations](./threats/path_traversal_in_file_operations.md)

* **Threat:** Path Traversal in File Operations
    * **Description:** A malicious actor could manipulate file paths within a Mesonfile, potentially using constructs like `..` to access or modify files outside the intended build directory. This exploits how Meson handles file paths during build operations.
    * **Impact:**
        * Access to Sensitive Files: Attackers could read sensitive files on the build system.
        * Modification of Critical Files:  Important build files could be altered.
        * Code Injection:  Malicious code could be written to locations where it might be executed later.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `mesonbuild/interpreter/interpreter.py`: The interpreter module handling file system operations.
        * Functions like `files`, `copy_file`, and path manipulation logic within custom targets.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use Absolute Paths: Where possible, use absolute paths instead of relative paths.
        * Path Canonicalization:  Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and `..` components before using them.
        * Restrict File Access: Limit the file system access of the build process to the necessary directories.
        * Input Validation: Validate and sanitize any user-provided input used in file path construction.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution via External Dependency Retrieval](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_via_external_dependency_retrieval.md)

* **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Substitution via External Dependency Retrieval
    * **Description:** While Meson doesn't directly manage dependencies like a package manager, it can interact with external tools (e.g., `git submodule`, custom scripts) to retrieve dependencies. An attacker could potentially trick the build process into using a compromised dependency if the retrieval process, orchestrated by Meson, lacks proper verification.
    * **Impact:**
        * Compromised Binaries: Malicious code from the substituted dependency could be included in the final application.
        * Supply Chain Attack: The attacker gains control over a component of the application's supply chain.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `mesonbuild/interpreter/interpreter.py`: The interpreter module executing commands related to dependency retrieval (e.g., via `run_command`).
        * Custom scripts or modules used for dependency management *as invoked by Meson*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify Dependency Integrity: Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies.
        * Use Secure Protocols: Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) for retrieving dependencies.
        * Pin Dependency Versions: Specify exact versions of dependencies to prevent unexpected updates.
        * Vendor Dependencies: Consider vendoring dependencies to have more control over the source code.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Meson Tool Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_meson_tool_itself.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Meson Tool Itself
    * **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within the Meson build system software itself could be exploited by a malicious actor. This involves flaws in Meson's code that can be triggered by crafted Mesonfiles or input.
    * **Impact:**
        * Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the build system.
        * Denial of Service: Meson could crash or become unresponsive.
        * Information Disclosure: Sensitive information about the build process or environment could be leaked.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * Various modules within the Meson codebase (`mesonbuild/*`).
        * The core interpreter, parser, and backend modules.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Meson Updated: Regularly update Meson to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        * Monitor Security Advisories: Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in Meson.
        * Run Meson in a Sandboxed Environment: Isolate the build process to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
