## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Meson Configuration/Build Files [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_meson_configurationbuild_files__critical_.md)

This represents the broad category of attacks that target the `meson.build` files and the build process they define. Compromising this area allows attackers to control how the application is built, leading to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via `meson.build` [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via__meson_build___critical_.md)

The `meson.build` file is a Python-based DSL that dictates the build process. Attackers can inject malicious code directly into this file to be executed during the build.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Commands via `run_command()` (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_via__run_command_____high-risk_path_.md)

The `run_command()` function in `meson.build` allows executing arbitrary shell commands. If the arguments to this function are not properly sanitized or are derived from untrusted sources, an attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed during the build process. This can lead to downloading malware, modifying files, or gaining access to the build environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code via `custom_target()` (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_via__custom_target_____high-risk_path_.md)

The `custom_target()` function allows defining custom build steps, which can involve executing arbitrary scripts or commands. Attackers can define malicious scripts within these custom targets that will be executed as part of the build, allowing them to perform actions similar to those achievable with `run_command()`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Subprojects (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_subprojects__high-risk_path_.md)

Meson allows including external projects as subprojects. An attacker can introduce a malicious subproject or compromise an existing one that is included in the build. This malicious subproject's `meson.build` file or source code can then introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the final application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Files During the Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_files_during_the_build_process.md)

This category involves manipulating files during the compilation and linking stages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Replace Legitimate Dependencies with Malicious Ones [CRITICAL] (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/replace_legitimate_dependencies_with_malicious_ones__critical___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can exploit Meson's dependency management features (e.g., WrapDB, git submodules) to replace legitimate dependencies with malicious versions. When Meson fetches and uses these compromised dependencies, it integrates malicious code into the application without the developers' direct knowledge. This is a significant supply chain risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Meson Usage [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringsupply_chain_attacks_targeting_meson_usage__critical_.md)

This category encompasses attacks that target the human element or the external dependencies of the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Machines [CRITICAL] (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_machines__critical___high-risk_path_.md)

If a developer's machine is compromised, attackers gain access to their development environment and tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Developer's `meson.build` or Related Files (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_developer's__meson_build__or_related_files__high-risk_path_.md)

With access to a developer's machine, an attacker can directly modify the `meson.build` files or other build-related scripts. This allows them to inject malicious code that will be incorporated into the application during the build process, as if a legitimate developer made the change.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Application's Dependency Supply Chain [CRITICAL] (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_application's_dependency_supply_chain__critical___high-risk_path_.md)

This focuses on attacks that target the external sources of the application's dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Dependencies that Meson Pulls In (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_dependencies_that_meson_pulls_in__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can compromise upstream dependency repositories or create malicious packages with similar names to legitimate ones. If the application's `meson.build` file is configured to pull in these malicious dependencies, either through direct specification or transitive dependencies, the attacker can inject malicious code into the application's build.
