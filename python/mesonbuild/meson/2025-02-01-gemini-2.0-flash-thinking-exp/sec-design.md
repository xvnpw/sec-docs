# BUSINESS POSTURE

Meson is an open-source build system designed to be fast, user-friendly, and portable. It aims to provide a better alternative to older build systems like Autotools and CMake, focusing on modern software development practices and developer experience.

Business priorities and goals:
- Primary goal: To provide a robust, efficient, and developer-friendly build system for software projects.
- Key priorities:
  - Speed and performance of the build process.
  - Ease of use and clear syntax for build definitions.
  - Cross-platform compatibility and portability.
  - Extensibility and support for modern development tools.
  - Active community and continuous improvement.

Most important business risks:
- Risk of vulnerabilities in the build system itself that could compromise software projects using Meson.
- Risk of supply chain attacks targeting Meson's dependencies or distribution channels.
- Risk of adoption failure if Meson does not meet developer needs or faces competition from other build systems.
- Risk of security issues arising from complex build configurations or custom Meson extensions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open source development model with public code repository on GitHub. This allows for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
- security control: Use of standard version control system (Git) for tracking changes and enabling rollback. (Implemented: Git repository)
- security control: Bug reporting and issue tracking system (GitHub Issues) for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub Issues)
- security control: Community contributions and peer review process for code changes. (Implemented: GitHub pull requests)
- security control: Testing framework and test suite to ensure the correctness and stability of the build system. (Implemented: Test suite in repository)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Risks inherent in open source software, including potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities and reliance on community maintenance.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Meson.
- accepted risk: Risk of malicious contributions being merged into the codebase, although mitigated by review process.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the Meson codebase.
- recommended security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Meson.
- recommended security control: Generate and publish Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Meson releases to improve transparency and supply chain security.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear process for handling security vulnerabilities, including responsible disclosure and timely patching.
- recommended security control: Consider code signing for Meson releases to ensure integrity and authenticity.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Meson itself as a build system. Authentication is relevant in the context of systems that *use* Meson, such as CI/CD pipelines or package repositories.
- Authorization: Meson needs to respect file system permissions during build processes. It should not bypass user-level authorization controls. Meson extensions and build scripts should operate within expected authorization boundaries.
- Input validation: Meson must rigorously validate all input, including build definition files (meson.build), command-line arguments, and environment variables, to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Meson itself may not directly implement cryptographic algorithms, but it should support and integrate with cryptographic tools and libraries used in software projects being built. If Meson provides features like downloading dependencies, secure channels (HTTPS) should be enforced. If Meson provides features like package signing or verification, robust cryptographic practices are essential.

Deployment Options:
1. Package Managers: Distributed through system package managers (apt, yum, brew, pip).
2. Standalone Binaries: Downloadable pre-compiled binaries for different platforms.
3. Source Code: Available as source code on GitHub for manual compilation and installation.

Detailed Deployment (Package Managers - most common):

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code and Meson build files (meson.build) and commits them to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. A CI/CD workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered by code changes.
3. The CI workflow sets up a clean build environment.
4. The CI workflow checks out the source code from the Git repository.
5. The CI workflow uses Meson to configure and build the project. This includes:
    - Running `meson setup` to configure the build based on meson.build files.
    - Running `meson compile` to compile the code using the backend build tool.
6. The CI workflow performs security checks (SAST, dependency scanning - recommended security controls).
7. The CI workflow runs tests to ensure the build is functional.
8. The CI workflow packages the build artifacts (e.g., source distributions, wheels).
9. The CI workflow publishes the build artifacts to package repositories (e.g., PyPI for Python packages, distribution repositories).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- The integrity and availability of the Meson build system itself. If Meson is compromised, it could lead to widespread vulnerabilities in software projects that rely on it.
- The trust and reputation of the Meson project. Security incidents can damage user trust and hinder adoption.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of Meson: Intellectual property, vulnerabilities in source code can be exploited. High sensitivity.
- Build scripts (meson.build):  Less sensitive than source code, but vulnerabilities in build scripts could also be exploited. Medium sensitivity.
- Build artifacts (Meson packages):  Must be protected from tampering to ensure users download legitimate and safe software. High sensitivity.
- Development and build infrastructure (CI/CD pipelines, build environments):  Compromise can lead to supply chain attacks. High sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the current process for handling security vulnerability reports in Meson? Is there a dedicated security team or contact?
- Are there any existing security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) integrated into the Meson development or CI/CD process?
- Is there a process for generating and publishing SBOMs for Meson releases?
- Are Meson releases currently signed? If not, is code signing considered for future releases?
- What is the process for reviewing and merging contributions from the community, especially from a security perspective?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: Assumed that the primary business goal is to provide a secure and reliable build system for the open-source community and wider software development ecosystem.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Assumed that while basic open-source security practices are in place, there is room for improvement in areas like automated security scanning, SBOM generation, and formal vulnerability handling processes.
- DESIGN: Assumed a modular design with clear separation of concerns, as reflected in the container diagram. Assumed that the build process is primarily automated using CI/CD pipelines.
