# Threat Model Analysis for mesonbuild/meson

## Threat: [Compromised Meson Distribution](./threats/compromised_meson_distribution.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the official or unofficial distribution channels of Meson. They replace legitimate Meson binaries or installation scripts with malicious versions. Users downloading Meson from these compromised sources unknowingly install a backdoored build system.
**Impact:**  Critical.  Installation of a compromised Meson build system can lead to backdoored applications built using it, introduction of vulnerabilities into all projects built with the compromised Meson, data exfiltration from build environments, and complete loss of build process integrity.
**Meson Component Affected:**  Meson Installer, Meson Binaries, Distribution Channels.
**Risk Severity:** Critical.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Download Meson only from official sources (mesonbuild.com, trusted package managers).
    *   Verify the integrity of downloaded Meson packages using cryptographic signatures (if provided).
    *   Use package managers with secure update mechanisms.
    *   Implement checksum verification for downloaded files.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Meson Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_meson_code.md)

**Description:**  Attackers discover and exploit vulnerabilities within the Meson build system's source code. This could involve exploiting parsing bugs in `meson.build` files, logic errors in build process handling, or vulnerabilities in Meson's internal libraries. Exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution during the build process.
**Impact:** High. Remote code execution on the build machine during the build process, denial of service of the build system, information disclosure from the build environment (e.g., source code, secrets), manipulation of build artifacts, and potential supply chain compromise if vulnerabilities are widespread.
**Meson Component Affected:**  Meson Core, Parser, Interpreter, Modules, Backend.
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Meson updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor Meson security advisories and vulnerability databases.
    *   Report any suspected vulnerabilities to the Meson development team.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools on `meson.build` files to detect potential issues that might trigger Meson vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Execution via `meson.build` Scripts](./threats/malicious_code_execution_via__meson_build__scripts.md)

**Description:**  Meson's design allows execution of arbitrary code embedded within `meson.build` scripts. Attackers, or compromised developers, could leverage this to inject malicious code into `meson.build` files. When Meson processes these scripts, the malicious code is executed within the build environment.
**Impact:** Critical. Arbitrary code execution on the build machine during the build process, introduction of backdoors or vulnerabilities into the built application through build-time manipulation, data exfiltration from the build environment, and supply chain compromise if malicious scripts are distributed or committed to repositories.
**Meson Component Affected:** `meson.build` scripts, Interpreter, Run-Process functionality, Custom Targets.
**Risk Severity:** Critical.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Code review `meson.build` scripts as rigorously as application code, paying close attention to external commands and script execution.
    *   Implement strict access control and review processes for changes to `meson.build` files.
    *   Use least privilege principles for build processes, limiting the permissions of the build environment.
    *   Employ static analysis and linters on `meson.build` files to detect suspicious patterns and potentially malicious code constructs.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Meson Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_meson_modules.md)

**Description:**  Meson's functionality can be extended through modules. If these modules contain vulnerabilities, either in their code or design, they can be exploited when Meson loads and utilizes them during the build process. This could lead to various security issues depending on the module's functionality.
**Impact:** High. Introduction of vulnerabilities into the build process or potentially the final application, depending on the module's purpose. Potential for remote code execution during build if a module vulnerability allows it.  Risk depends on the criticality and exposure of the vulnerable module.
**Meson Component Affected:** Meson Modules, Module Loading Mechanism, Specific Vulnerable Modules.
**Risk Severity:** High.
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and audit third-party Meson modules before use, especially those from untrusted sources.
    *   Keep modules updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to Meson modules.
    *   If possible, limit the use of external or non-essential modules to reduce the attack surface.
    *   Consider contributing to the security auditing and improvement of popular Meson modules.
