# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mesonbuild/meson

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin Meson Version](./mitigation_strategies/pin_meson_version.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify the current Meson version used in your project. Check project documentation, CI/CD configuration, or run `meson --version`.
2.  Explicitly declare this version as a dependency in your project's dependency management file (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` for Python projects: `meson==<pinned_version>`). Document the version in `README` or installation instructions.
3.  In CI/CD or build scripts, ensure the pinned Meson version is installed before building (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4.  Regularly review and consider upgrading the pinned version, testing for compatibility and regressions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents automatic upgrades to potentially compromised Meson versions.
    *   **Unexpected Build Breakages due to Meson Updates (Medium Severity):** Ensures consistent builds by avoiding unforeseen Meson behavior changes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces risk of using malicious Meson.
    *   **Unexpected Build Breakages:** Medium risk reduction. Improves build stability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, in `requirements.txt` and `README.md`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not enforced in CI/CD. Need to add a step to verify Meson version in CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Meson Installation Source](./mitigation_strategies/verify_meson_installation_source.md)

**Description:**
1.  Install Meson from official, trusted sources: PyPI (`pip install meson`) for Python, or OS package managers from official repositories (e.g., `apt install meson`, `yum install meson`).
2.  Verify package integrity if possible. PyPI provides checksums (SHA256). Compare downloaded package checksum to the official checksum. OS package managers usually handle this automatically.
3.  Avoid installing from untrusted third-party sources or source code unless necessary and you can thoroughly audit the source.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Reduces risk of installing compromised Meson from untrusted sources.
    *   **Installation of Backdoored Software (High Severity):** Prevents malicious code introduction via tampered Meson installation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** High risk reduction. Significantly lowers probability of using malicious Meson.
    *   **Installation of Backdoored Software:** High risk reduction. Prevents compromised build tools.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Using `pip` is a trusted source. Checksum verification is not performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement checksum verification for Meson package downloads in build scripts/documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Scanning for Meson Itself](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_scanning_for_meson_itself.md)

**Description:**
1.  Integrate a dependency scanning tool (e.g., `pip-audit`, SCA tools) into workflow/CI/CD.
2.  Configure the tool to scan Python dependencies, including Meson, for known vulnerabilities (CVE databases).
3.  Set up alerts or fail builds for vulnerabilities in Meson or dependencies above a certain severity (e.g., High, Critical).
4.  Regularly update Meson and dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (Medium to High Severity):** Identifies vulnerabilities in Meson's dependencies.
    *   **Outdated Software Components (Medium Severity):** Encourages keeping Meson and dependencies updated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** Medium to High risk reduction. Depends on tool effectiveness and patching speed.
    *   **Outdated Software Components:** Medium risk reduction. Promotes a more secure build environment.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Dependency scanning not implemented for Meson.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Integrate dependency scanning into CI/CD to scan Python dependencies including Meson.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review for `meson.build` Files](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_for__meson_build__files.md)

**Description:**
1.  Include `meson.build` files in standard code review. Treat them as code requiring scrutiny.
2.  Train developers on secure `meson.build` coding, emphasizing risks of external commands, file operations, and unsafe Meson functions.
3.  During reviews, check for:
    *   `run_command()` usage without input sanitization.
    *   File path manipulation leading to path traversal.
    *   Unnecessary complexity in `meson.build`.
    *   Deprecated/insecure Meson features.
4.  Use linters/static analysis tools (if available for Meson) to detect potential issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents malicious input injection into commands executed by `meson.build`.
    *   **File System Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces path traversal, race conditions, unauthorized file access.
    *   **Logic Errors in Build Scripts (Medium Severity):** Catches errors leading to insecure build outputs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** High risk reduction. Code reviews are effective for this.
    *   **File System Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High risk reduction. Reviews can catch many file system issues.
    *   **Logic Errors in Build Scripts:** Medium risk reduction. Improves build script quality.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes. `meson.build` files are code reviewed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No specific training on secure `meson.build` coding. No static analysis tools for `meson.build`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation in `meson.build`](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_in__meson_build_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify external inputs in `meson.build`: command-line arguments (`-D`), environment variables, data from files.
2.  Implement validation in `meson.build` to ensure inputs conform to expected formats, types, values.
3.  Use Meson functions or Python code within `meson.build` for validation (e.g., whitelist values, check file path directories).
4.  Sanitize inputs before using in commands/file paths (e.g., escape special characters).
5.  Raise an error and halt build for invalid input with a clear error message.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection via user-controlled inputs.
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized file access by validating paths.
