## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Meson Build Scripts (meson.build) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_meson_build_scripts__meson_build___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within the `meson.build` scripts themselves, which control the entire build process. Successful exploitation here grants significant control.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **Code Injection in meson.build [CRITICAL NODE]:** Injecting malicious code directly into `meson.build` to be executed during the build.
        *   **Command Injection via `run_command` or similar functions [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting functions that execute shell commands to inject and run arbitrary commands.
            *   **Malicious dependency provides crafted input [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** A compromised or attacker-controlled dependency provides malicious input that is used unsafely in `run_command`, leading to command injection.
            *   **Vulnerable configuration file parsed by meson.build [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  `meson.build` parses a configuration file that contains malicious commands or input that, when used in `run_command`, results in command injection.
            *   **User-controlled environment variables influence script execution [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  `meson.build` uses environment variables in `run_command` without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to control command execution via environment variables.
    *   **Logic Errors in meson.build leading to insecure build [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting logical flaws in the script to manipulate the build process in a way that weakens security.
        *   **Incorrect compiler flags set (e.g., disabling security features like ASLR, stack canaries) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Manipulating the `meson.build` logic to disable important compiler security flags, resulting in a less secure application.
            *   **Malicious dependency influences build flags [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** A malicious dependency provides information or configuration that causes `meson.build` to set insecure compiler flags.
            *   **Crafted environment variables manipulate build flags [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Environment variables are used in `meson.build` logic to control compiler flags, allowing an attacker to manipulate them and disable security features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Meson Itself (Meson Software) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_meson_itself__meson_software___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities within the Meson build system software itself (parser, interpreter, dependency resolution logic). Exploiting Meson directly can have widespread impact.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **Logic vulnerabilities in Meson dependency resolution or build orchestration [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting flaws in how Meson handles dependencies or orchestrates the build process.
        *   **Dependency confusion attacks via Meson's dependency handling [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Leveraging Meson's dependency resolution to trick it into downloading and using a malicious dependency instead of a legitimate one.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Meson Plugins/Modules (if used) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_meson_pluginsmodules__if_used___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses Meson plugins, these become an additional attack surface. Vulnerabilities in plugins or malicious plugins can compromise the build.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **Malicious Meson plugins designed for exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers create and distribute plugins specifically designed to be malicious.
        *   **Backdoored plugins distributed through unofficial channels [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Malicious plugins with backdoors are distributed through unofficial or less secure channels, hoping developers will unknowingly use them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Meson Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_meson_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting the broader supply chain of Meson, including its own dependencies and distribution channels. Compromising Meson's supply chain can have a cascading effect.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **Compromise of Meson's own dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Python packages or other libraries that Meson itself relies upon.
    *   **Compromise of Meson distribution channels [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Compromising the channels used to distribute Meson software, allowing attackers to distribute backdoored versions of Meson.
