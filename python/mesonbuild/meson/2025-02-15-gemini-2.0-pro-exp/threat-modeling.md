# Threat Model Analysis for mesonbuild/meson

## Threat: [Threat 1: Malicious `meson.build` Injection](./threats/threat_1_malicious__meson_build__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the project's source repository (or a dependency's repository) and modifies a `meson.build` file (or an included file, like a `.wrap` file) to include malicious code. This code is executed during Meson's configuration or build phases. The attacker leverages Meson's features like `run_command()`, custom targets, or manipulates dependency resolution.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromised build artifacts (executables, libraries) with backdoors/malware.
        *   Arbitrary code execution on the build machine, compromising the build environment.
        *   Potential leakage of sensitive information from the build environment.
    *   **Affected Meson Component:** `meson.build` files (core configuration), `run_command()` function, custom target definitions, dependency resolution (including wrap files and subprojects).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Review:** Mandatory, thorough code reviews for *all* `meson.build` changes and included files.
        *   **Version Control Security:** Strong access controls, audit trails, and multi-factor authentication for repository access.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Specify exact versions of all dependencies (including subprojects).
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Use checksums (e.g., in `wrap` files) to verify dependency integrity.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the build process with minimal privileges. Avoid running Meson as root.
        *   **Sandboxed Build Environments:** Use containers (Docker, Podman) or VMs to isolate the build process.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Compromised WrapDB/Custom Wrap Provider](./threats/threat_2_compromised_wrapdbcustom_wrap_provider.md)

*   **Description:** The official Meson WrapDB (or a custom wrap provider) is compromised. An attacker modifies wrap file definitions to point to malicious dependencies or inject malicious build instructions directly into the wrap file.
    *   **Impact:** The build fetches and uses compromised dependencies, resulting in malicious code in the final build. The attacker can also inject malicious build steps.
    *   **Affected Meson Component:** WrapDB integration, `meson wrap` command, custom wrap providers, dependency resolution using wrap files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure WrapDB is *always* accessed via HTTPS (default, but verify).
        *   **Wrap File Checksums:** Meson automatically verifies wrap file checksums. Do *not* disable this.
        *   **Secure Custom Wrap Providers:** If using a custom provider, ensure it's securely hosted, uses HTTPS, and has strong access controls. Audit regularly.
        *   **Dependency Mirroring:** Mirror critical dependencies locally to reduce reliance on external providers.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit the security of the wrap provider (official or custom).

## Threat: [Threat 3: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) during Dependency Fetching (Meson-managed fetches)](./threats/threat_3_man-in-the-middle__mitm__during_dependency_fetching__meson-managed_fetches_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker intercepts network traffic during dependency fetching *specifically when Meson is managing the fetch*. This is most relevant when using features like `subproject()` with a URL, or custom fetch commands within `run_command()` that don't inherently provide strong security.  (If a project uses, say, `curl` with HTTPS and checksum verification *within* a `run_command()`, that's less of a *direct* Meson threat, as the security is handled by `curl`.)
    *   **Impact:** The attacker substitutes malicious dependencies, leading to compromised build artifacts.
    *   **Affected Meson Component:** Dependency resolution mechanisms, `subproject()` (when fetching from URLs), `run_command()` (when used for *unprotected* fetching).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS Everywhere:** *Always* use HTTPS for fetching dependencies within Meson configurations.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Verify checksums whenever possible, especially for dependencies fetched via `subproject()` or custom commands.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pinning helps ensure the same version is fetched, reducing the MitM attack window.
        * **Avoid Unsafe Fetching in `run_command()`:** If using `run_command()` for fetching, ensure the command itself uses secure protocols and verifies integrity (e.g., use `curl` with HTTPS and checksumming).  Prefer built-in Meson mechanisms when possible.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Improper `install` Target Permissions](./threats/threat_4_improper__install__target_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** `install` targets in `meson.build` are misconfigured, installing files with excessive permissions (e.g., world-writable) or to unintended locations, potentially overwriting system files.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can exploit these permissions to gain elevated privileges or modify critical system files.
    *   **Affected Meson Component:** `install` target definitions, `meson install` command.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Install files with minimal necessary permissions. Avoid overly permissive modes.
        *   **Careful Path Selection:** Choose installation paths carefully. Avoid system-wide locations unless necessary. Use `prefix` and `DESTDIR` correctly.
        *   **Testing:** Test installation in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container).
        *   **Review:** Thoroughly review all `install` target configurations.

## Threat: [Threat 5: Custom Commands with Elevated Privileges](./threats/threat_5_custom_commands_with_elevated_privileges.md)

* **Description:** `meson.build` uses `run_command()` to execute commands with elevated privileges (e.g., via `sudo`). An attacker modifying `meson.build` can inject malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Attacker gains complete control over the build system.
    * **Affected Meson Component:** `run_command()` function.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Privilege Escalation:** Do *not* use `sudo` or similar within `run_command()`.
        * **Least Privilege Principle:** Run the build process with the lowest possible privileges.
        * **Sandboxing:** If elevated privileges are *absolutely unavoidable*, isolate the task in a tightly controlled sandbox.
        * **Code Review:** Scrutinize any use of `run_command()` for privilege escalation risks.

## Threat: [Threat 6: Masquerading Legitimate Dependency (Direct Meson Resolution)](./threats/threat_6_masquerading_legitimate_dependency__direct_meson_resolution_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency. If the project's Meson configuration doesn't specify a precise version or checksum, *and Meson is responsible for resolving the dependency*, Meson might fetch the malicious package. This is distinct from a general supply chain attack; this is about Meson's resolution logic.
    * **Impact:** The build incorporates the malicious dependency, leading to compromised artifacts.
    * **Affected Meson Component:** Dependency resolution, wrap files (if used and not properly configured), external project fetching *managed by Meson*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Dependency Pinning:** Specify the *exact* version of each dependency in `meson.build` or the wrap file.
        * **Checksum Verification:** Use checksums (e.g., in wrap files) to verify dependency integrity.
        * **Private Repositories:** For sensitive projects, use private, trusted repositories.
        * **SCA Tools:** Use Software Composition Analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities and potentially malicious packages, *but understand this is a broader mitigation, not solely a Meson-specific one*. The core issue here is Meson's resolution without sufficient verification.
