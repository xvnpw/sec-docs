# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mesonbuild/meson

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Pinning and Verification (Meson `wrap` System)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_pinning_and_verification__meson__wrap__system_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Pinning and Verification (Meson `wrap` System)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `wrap` Dependencies:** List all external dependencies managed through Meson's `wrap` system (subprojects).
    2.  **`wrap-file` Mode:** For dependencies fetched as archives, use the `wrap-file` mode in your `[wrap-file]` sections within the `subprojects` directory.
    3.  **Specify `source_url`:** Provide the exact URL to the dependency's archive within the `[wrap-file]` section.
    4.  **Specify `source_filename`:** Provide the exact filename of the dependency's archive within the `[wrap-file]` section.
    5.  **Calculate SHA-256 Hash:** Download the dependency archive *manually* and calculate its SHA-256 checksum.
    6.  **Specify `source_hash`:** Add the calculated SHA-256 hash to the `source_hash` field in the `[wrap-file]` section.
    7.  **`wrap-git` Mode:** For dependencies fetched from Git repositories, use the `wrap-git` mode.
    8.  **Specify `url`:** Provide the URL to the Git repository within the `[wrap-git]` section.
    9.  **Specify `revision`:** Use the *full 40-character commit hash* (not a branch or tag) in the `revision` field of the `[wrap-git]` section.
    10. **Regular Audits:** Periodically review your `subprojects/*.wrap` files to ensure they are still pointing to the correct versions and hashes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code via compromised `wrap` dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Confusion (High Severity):** Ensures you're using the *intended* version of a `wrap` dependency.
    *   **Accidental Dependency Updates (Medium Severity):** Prevents unintended upgrades of `wrap` dependencies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk for dependencies managed by `wrap`.
    *   **Dependency Confusion:** Eliminates the risk for `wrap` dependencies.
    *   **Accidental Dependency Updates:** Eliminates the risk for `wrap` dependencies.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Example - Needs to be filled in):** Partially implemented. `wrap-file` is used for some dependencies with SHA-256 hashes, but `wrap-git` dependencies are using branch names instead of commit hashes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Example - Needs to be filled in):**
        *   All `wrap-git` dependencies in `subprojects/*.wrap` files need to be updated to use full commit hashes.
        *   A system for regularly auditing `subprojects/*.wrap` files needs to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review of `meson.build` Files](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_of__meson_build__files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Code Review of `meson.build` Files

*   **Description:** (This strategy *directly* involves reviewing Meson build files, so it's included)
    1.  **Establish Review Process:** Make review of *all* `meson.build` files (including those from dependencies brought in via `wrap` or direct dependencies) a mandatory part of your code review.
    2.  **Focus Areas (Meson-Specific):**
        *   `run_command()`: Scrutinize *all* uses of `run_command()`.
        *   Custom Targets: Examine custom targets that execute shell commands.
        *   `find_program()`: Check how external programs are located and used, looking for potential `PATH` manipulation.
        *   `meson.get_compiler()`: Review how compilers are obtained and configured.
        *   `dependency()`: Examine how dependencies are declared and used.
        *   File/Network Operations: Be wary of any unusual file or network access within the `meson.build` file.
    3.  **Multiple Reviewers:** Have at least two developers review each `meson.build` file.
    4.  **Automated Checks (Optional):** Develop or use linters/scripts to flag potentially dangerous constructs in `meson.build` files (e.g., searching for `run_command()`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious `meson.build` Files (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of malicious code in build files.
    *   **Unintentional Vulnerabilities in `meson.build` (Medium Severity):** Helps identify and fix insecure coding practices within Meson build files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious `meson.build` Files:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Unintentional Vulnerabilities:** Reduces the risk by catching common mistakes.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Example):** Basic code review is performed, but it doesn't specifically focus on the security aspects of `meson.build` files. Dependency `meson.build` files are not consistently reviewed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Example):**
        *   Establish a formal process for reviewing *all* `meson.build` files, including those from dependencies.
        *   Create checklists/guidelines for reviewing `meson.build` files for security.
        *   Implement automated checks for potentially dangerous constructs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Use of `run_command()` (within `meson.build`)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_use_of__run_command_____within__meson_build__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Controlled Use of `run_command()` (within `meson.build`)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Usage:** Avoid `run_command()` in your `meson.build` files whenever possible. Use Meson's built-in functions (e.g., `dependency()`, `find_program()`, custom targets, generators) instead.
    2.  **Input Validation:** If you *must* use `run_command()`, rigorously validate and sanitize *all* inputs within your `meson.build` file, especially if they come from external sources or are derived from Meson variables that could be manipulated.
    3.  **Whitelisting:** If possible, implement whitelisting within your `meson.build` file to restrict the commands that `run_command()` can execute.
    4.  **Avoid Shell Interpolation:** Pass arguments to commands as separate strings in a list to `run_command()`, rather than constructing a single command string.  Meson's API encourages this, but double-check.
    5.  **Error Handling:** Check the return code and output of `run_command()` within your `meson.build` file to detect and handle errors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary commands via `run_command()` in `meson.build`.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of executing malicious code through `run_command()` in `meson.build`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk if input validation and whitelisting are correctly implemented within the `meson.build` file.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Reduces the risk by limiting the attack surface within the `meson.build` file.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Example):** `run_command()` is used in a few places in `meson.build`, but input validation is not consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Example):**
        *   Review all uses of `run_command()` in `meson.build` and implement rigorous input validation.
        *   Replace `run_command()` calls with safer Meson alternatives where possible.
        *   Implement whitelisting for allowed commands within `meson.build`, if feasible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Compiler and Linker Flags (within `meson.build`)](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_compiler_and_linker_flags__within__meson_build__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Explicit Compiler and Linker Flags (within `meson.build`)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Security Flags:** Research security-related compiler/linker flags for your platform and language.
    2.  **`add_project_arguments`:** Use `add_project_arguments` in your `meson.build` file to add compiler flags for the entire project.
    3.  **`add_global_arguments`:** Use `add_global_arguments` cautiously for global flags in your `meson.build` file.
    4.  **`add_project_link_arguments`:** Use `add_project_link_arguments` in your `meson.build` file for linker flags.
    5.  **Language Specificity:** Use the `language` keyword (e.g., `language: 'c'`) in your `meson.build` file.
    6.  **Compiler Feature Checks:** Use Meson functions like `compiler.has_argument()` in your `meson.build` file to check for compiler support before adding flags.
    7.  **Consistency:** Ensure consistent flags across build configurations within your `meson.build` file.
    8. **Documentation:** Document flags and their purpose within your `meson.build` file or associated documentation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows (High Severity):** Flags like stack protection help.
    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** ASLR and DEP/NX make injection harder.
    *   **Return-oriented Programming (ROP) (High Severity):** RELRO and similar flags increase ROP difficulty.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows:** Significantly reduces exploitability.
    *   **Code Injection:** Makes injection significantly more difficult.
    *   **ROP:** Increases the difficulty of ROP attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Example):** Some basic compiler flags are set in `meson.build`, but not a comprehensive set of security flags. Linker flags are not explicitly configured for security.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Example):**
        *   Add a comprehensive set of security-related compiler and linker flags to `meson.build`.
        *   Implement compiler feature checks in `meson.build` for portability.
        *   Document the purpose of each security flag in `meson.build` or related documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Use of `find_program()` (within `meson.build`)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_use_of__find_program_____within__meson_build__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Controlled Use of `find_program()` (within `meson.build`)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize System `PATH` Reliance:** When using `find_program()` in your `meson.build` file, be as specific as possible about the expected location of the program.  Avoid relying solely on the system's `PATH` environment variable.
    2.  **`required` Keyword:** Use the `required: true` keyword with `find_program()` in your `meson.build` file.  This will cause the build to fail if the program is not found.
    3.  **`version` Keyword:** If possible, use the `version` keyword to specify the required version of the program.
    4.  **`native` Keyword:** Use `native: true` when the tool is needed by the build machine, and not for cross-compilation.
    5.  **`check` Method:** Always check the `.found()` method of the object returned by `find_program()` in your `meson.build` file to ensure the program was actually found before using it.
    6. **Alternatives:** If dealing with a library, prefer using Meson's `dependency()` mechanism instead of `find_program()`. `dependency()` provides better control and version management.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Hijacking (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of an attacker placing a malicious executable in a location earlier in the `PATH` than the intended program.
    *   **Unexpected Program Behavior (Medium Severity):** Ensures that the correct version of a program is used, preventing unexpected behavior due to version mismatches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Hijacking:** Reduces the risk by making it harder to hijack program lookups.
    *   **Unexpected Program Behavior:** Improves build reliability and consistency.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Example):** `find_program()` is used in `meson.build`, but the `required` keyword and version checks are not consistently used.  Reliance on `PATH` is not minimized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Example):**
        *   Review all uses of `find_program()` in `meson.build` and add the `required: true` keyword.
        *   Specify version requirements using the `version` keyword where possible.
        *   Minimize reliance on the system `PATH` by providing more specific paths.
        *   Always check the `.found()` method before using the result of `find_program()`.
        *   Consider replacing `find_program()` with `dependency()` for libraries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Reproducible Builds (Meson Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/reproducible_builds__meson_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Reproducible Builds (Meson Configuration)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Meson Options:** Review Meson's documentation on reproducible builds and configure your `meson.build` and `meson_options.txt` files accordingly. This may involve:
        *   Setting specific options related to timestamp handling.
        *   Avoiding features that introduce non-determinism.
        *   Using consistent compiler and linker flags (as covered in a previous strategy).
    2.  **Deterministic Inputs:** Ensure *all* inputs to the build process are deterministic. This is primarily managed *outside* of Meson (e.g., using containers, pinning dependency versions), but your `meson.build` file should *not* introduce non-determinism.
    3.  **Avoid Non-Deterministic Constructs:** Within your `meson.build` file, avoid:
        *   Using the current date or time.
        *   Generating random numbers.
        *   Relying on external factors that might change between builds (e.g., network access).
    4. **Verification:** This is done *outside* of Meson, but is crucial for confirming reproducibility.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Build Artifact Tampering (Medium Severity):** Makes tampering easier to detect.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Helps verify the build process hasn't been compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Build Artifact Tampering:** Improves detection capabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Provides an additional layer of verification.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **(Example):** Not implemented. No specific steps have been taken in `meson.build` or `meson_options.txt` to ensure reproducible builds.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **(Example):**
        *   Review Meson's documentation on reproducible builds and configure `meson.build` and `meson_options.txt` accordingly.
        *   Ensure that `meson.build` does not introduce any non-deterministic behavior.
