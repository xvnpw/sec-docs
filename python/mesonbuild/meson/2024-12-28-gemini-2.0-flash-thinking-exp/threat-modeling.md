### High and Critical Meson Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Subproject Inclusion
    *   **Description:** An attacker convinces a developer to include a malicious subproject in their `meson.build` file, either by social engineering or by compromising a legitimate project's repository. Meson will then execute the malicious subproject's `meson.build` file during the build process, potentially running arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or supply chain contamination by injecting malicious code into the final application.
    *   **Affected Meson Component:** `subproject()` function, subproject handling logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet all subprojects before inclusion.
        *   Use dependency pinning and checksum verification for subprojects when possible.
        *   Regularly audit subproject dependencies.
        *   Implement code review processes for changes to `meson.build` files.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Substitution
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits Meson's dependency resolution mechanism to trick it into downloading and using a malicious dependency instead of the intended legitimate one. This can happen if dependencies are fetched from public repositories without strict versioning or checksum verification.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the build process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or the inclusion of backdoors in the final application.
    *   **Affected Meson Component:** `dependency()` function, dependency resolution logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Specify dependency sources explicitly (e.g., using `git` or `http` sources with verification).
        *   Utilize dependency pinning to lock down specific versions.
        *   Implement checksum verification for downloaded dependencies.
        *   Consider using private or curated dependency repositories.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection in `meson.build`
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the project's repository and directly modifies the `meson.build` file to inject malicious code. This code will be executed by Meson during the build process.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or the injection of backdoors into the final application.
    *   **Affected Meson Component:** `meson.build` file parsing and execution logic, functions like `run_command()`, custom target definitions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for the project repository.
        *   Enforce code review processes for all changes to `meson.build` files.
        *   Utilize version control systems and track changes to `meson.build`.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection in Custom Targets
    *   **Description:** A developer creates a custom target in `meson.build` that uses unsanitized user-provided input when executing external commands. An attacker could manipulate this input to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed during the build process.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build machine with the privileges of the build process.
    *   **Affected Meson Component:** `custom_target()` function, `run_command()` function within custom targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly in shell commands within custom targets.
        *   Sanitize and validate all external input before using it in commands.
        *   Use Meson's built-in functions for common tasks instead of relying on shell commands where possible.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Meson Itself
    *   **Description:** Meson, like any software, could contain bugs or vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the build process or gain control over the build environment.
    *   **Impact:** Unpredictable behavior during the build process, potential for arbitrary code execution on the build machine, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Meson Component:** Various Meson modules and core logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Meson updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Monitor Meson's security advisories and release notes.
        *   Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the Meson development team.
