---

- **Vulnerability Name**: Arbitrary File Read in HTML Export via Unsanitized Image Paths
  - **Description**:
    An attacker supplies a malicious Markdown file that contains an image reference with a relative path (for example, using directory‐traversal sequences such as `../../../../etc/passwd`). When the user triggers the “Print to HTML” or batch print command, the extension calls its helper (via a function similar to `relToAbsPath`) that joins the Markdown file’s folder with the supplied path without adequate normalization or boundary checks. The result is that the extension uses synchronous file reads (via `fs.readFileSync`) to include arbitrary local files’ content in the exported HTML.
    - *Step-by-step trigger*:
      1. An attacker crafts a Markdown file with an image tag such as:
         `![sensitive](../../../../etc/passwd)`
      2. The victim opens this Markdown file in VS Code and invokes the HTML export command.
      3. The extension computes the absolute path by simply joining the document directory and the supplied path.
      4. Without restrictions on the resulting path, `fs.readFileSync` reads the target file, and its content becomes embedded in the exported HTML.
  - **Impact**:
    Sensitive data from local files (e.g., system files, credentials, or private documents) may be exposed as the file content is inadvertently embedded into the exported HTML.
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    • The code distinguishes absolute URLs (those starting with “http” or “data:”) before processing relative paths.
  - **Missing Mitigations**:
    • Validate and normalize the computed absolute path to guarantee it remains within an allowed directory or workspace folder.
    • Reject paths that contain parent directory (“..”) sequences when such resolution would escape expected boundaries.
  - **Preconditions**:
    • The attacker must induce the victim to open a malicious Markdown document containing a crafted relative image path.
    • The victim must invoke HTML export (either via single‑document or batch mode) so that image paths are resolved on the local file system.
  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    • In `/code/src/print.ts`, the helper function `relToAbsPath` simply checks whether the provided `href` is absolute (or starts with “http”) and otherwise returns `path.join(path.dirname(document.fsPath), href)` without further validation.
    • This simple concatenation allows directory traversal sequences in the Markdown image tags to produce unintended absolute paths.
  - **Security Test Case**:
    1. Create a Markdown file (e.g., “malicious.md”) with the line:
       `![sensitive](../../../../etc/passwd)`
    2. Open the file in VS Code and trigger the “Print to HTML” command.
    3. Open the generated HTML file and inspect whether base64–encoded content corresponding to sensitive files appears.
    4. The presence of such content confirms the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name**: Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) in Exported Markdown HTML via Unescaped Raw HTML
  - **Description**:
    The Markdown rendering engine is configured with HTML enabled (for example, by calling MarkdownIt with `{ html: true }`). When a user prints the Markdown to HTML, the extension embeds the rendered output directly into an HTML template without sanitizing raw HTML. An attacker can include inline HTML or script tags (for example, `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`) that will be executed when the exported HTML is viewed.
    - *Step-by-step trigger*:
      1. An attacker prepares a Markdown document containing raw HTML such as `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.
      2. The victim opens the document in VS Code and uses the print command to export it to HTML.
      3. The exported HTML embeds the unsanitized script.
      4. When the victim (or another user) opens the HTML file in a browser, the JavaScript executes.
  - **Impact**:
    Allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or further compromise.
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    • The export code safely encodes the title element using an HTML encoder.
  - **Missing Mitigations**:
    • Sanitize or filter the Markdown engine’s output (or offer an option to disable raw HTML) prior to injecting it into the HTML template.
  - **Preconditions**:
    • The attacker must supply a Markdown document containing malicious HTML.
    • The victim must export the document to HTML and then view the exported file in a web browser.
  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    • In `/code/src/markdownEngine.ts`, the MarkdownIt instance is instantiated with the option `html: true`.
    • In `/code/src/print.ts`, the output of `mdEngine.render()` is embedded directly into the HTML template without further sanitization.
  - **Security Test Case**:
    1. Create a Markdown file (e.g., “xss.md”) with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
    2. Open the file in VS Code and execute the “Print to HTML” command.
    3. Open the resulting HTML file in a browser.
    4. The triggering of the alert confirms the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name**: Localization File Injection Leading to Potential Cross-Context Scripting
  - **Description**:
    The NLS (localization) component scans the extension’s resource directory for files matching a naming pattern (for example, `package.nls.[locale].json`) and merges their JSON–parsed contents into the internal localization bundle. Without schema validation or cryptographic verification, an attacker who can modify or inject files into the extension’s installation folder (via a supply–chain compromise or writable installation directory) can plant a malicious localization file that contains script or HTML payloads. When the extension later renders a localized string—in a settings panel or webview—the malicious payload may execute.
    - *Step-by-step trigger*:
      1. The attacker injects a malicious JSON file (e.g., `package.nls.zh-malicious.json`) into the extension’s resource directory containing a key–value pair such as:
         `{ "malicious.message": "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>" }`
      2. On startup, the extension calls `resolveResource` in `/code/src/nls/resolveResource.ts`, which reads and merges all matching JSON files.
      3. When a localized message is later displayed (for example, in a settings webview), the malicious payload is rendered.
  - **Impact**:
    Enables execution of arbitrary scripts within the extension’s UI context, potentially exposing workspace data and sensitive credentials.
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    • The resource resolution code ensures that the directory path is absolute and uses a fixed pattern for locating JSON files.
  - **Missing Mitigations**:
    • Restrict file loading to a whitelist of expected filenames rather than using a broad pattern.
    • Validate the JSON schema and contents (or require a digital signature) before merging.
    • Sanitize localized strings before injecting them into any HTML context.
  - **Preconditions**:
    • The attacker must have the capability to inject or modify localization JSON files in the extension’s resource directory.
    • The extension must load the malicious file during startup and later render the affected localized content in an HTML context.
  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    • In `/code/src/nls/resolveResource.ts`, the function reads all files matching the naming pattern and merges their parsed JSON into the localization bundle via simple object assignment.
    • If an attacker plants a file with HTML or script tags in its string values, they will be rendered unsanitized in the UI.
  - **Security Test Case**:
    1. In a controlled test environment, add a file (e.g., `package.nls.test.json`) with:
       `{ "malicious.message": "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>" }`
    2. Configure the extension so that the “test” locale is used and the file is loaded.
    3. Trigger the display of the localized message (for example, by opening a settings webview).
    4. If the malicious HTML executes, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- **Vulnerability Name**: Snippet Injection via Unsanitized Clipboard Link in Paste Command
  - **Description**:
    When the paste command is invoked in a Markdown document, the extension reads text from the system clipboard. If the clipboard content qualifies (via an `isSingleLink` regular expression) as a valid link, the extension constructs a snippet by directly embedding the clipboard text into a Markdown link snippet template (for example,
    ```
    `[$TM_SELECTED_TEXT$0](${textTrimmed})`
    ```
    ). Since no additional escaping or sanitization is applied to the clipboard text, an attacker can craft clipboard content that includes snippet placeholder syntax (such as `${1:malicious}`). When the snippet expands, the injected placeholder is processed unexpectedly.
    - *Step-by-step trigger*:
      1. The attacker arranges for the victim’s clipboard to contain a malicious string like:
         `http://attacker.com/${1:malicious}`
      2. The victim invokes the paste command in a Markdown document where the current selection does not already form part of a link.
      3. The extension detects the clipboard text as a “single link” and embeds it directly into the snippet template.
      4. During snippet expansion, the injected token `${1:malicious}` is interpreted, leading to unexpected behavior.
  - **Impact**:
    The unsanitized snippet injection can lead to unintended insertion of placeholder tokens, potentially altering document content in an unauthorized way. In some scenarios, this may serve as a stepping stone for further exploitation.
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    • A regular expression (`isSingleLink`) is used after trimming the clipboard text to verify that it appears to be a link; however, this does not escape snippet syntax characters.
  - **Missing Mitigations**:
    • Escape or otherwise sanitize characters with special meaning in snippet syntax (such as `$`, `{`, or `}`) before embedding the clipboard text into the snippet template.
    • Validate that the clipboard content does not contain snippet tokens that could be misinterpreted.
  - **Preconditions**:
    • The victim must have a malicious clipboard string containing snippet placeholder syntax.
    • The paste command is triggered in a context where no existing link prevents the injection.
  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    • In `/code/src/formatting.ts`, the `paste()` function calls `env.clipboard.readText()`, trims the result, and then checks for a “single link” using a regular expression.
    • If the check passes, it embeds the clipboard text directly into the snippet template (`[$TM_SELECTED_TEXT$0](${textTrimmed})`) without escaping any special syntax.
  - **Security Test Case**:
    1. Copy the following URL into the clipboard:
       `http://attacker.com/${1:malicious}`
    2. Open a Markdown document in VS Code where the current selection is on a single line and is not already part of a link.
    3. Trigger the paste command (for example, via Ctrl+V).
    4. If the snippet expands with the injected placeholder `${1:malicious}` being processed, then the vulnerability is confirmed.
