## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Strikethrough Decoration

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown document containing a long sequence of spaces or whitespace characters between strikethrough markers (`~~`).
    2. When the VSCode extension attempts to render decorations for this document, specifically the strikethrough decoration, it uses a regular expression to identify text ranges to decorate.
    3. The regular expression used for strikethrough decoration, `/(?<![~\\])~~[^~\p{Zs}\t\r\n\f].*?(?<![~\p{Zs}\t\r\n\f])~~(?!~)/gu`, is susceptible to ReDoS when processing the crafted input.
    4. The non-greedy quantifier `.*?` and the negative lookbehind assertions cause excessive backtracking when the regex engine attempts to match the pattern in the presence of a long string of spaces between the strikethrough markers.
    5. This backtracking leads to a significant increase in processing time, potentially blocking the VSCode extension's thread and causing a delay or unresponsiveness in the editor.

- Impact:
    - High
    - An attacker can cause the VSCode extension to become unresponsive or slow down significantly when opening or editing a specially crafted markdown document.
    - This can degrade the user experience and potentially lead to denial of service of the extension's functionality for the user.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code uses the vulnerable regular expression in `/code/src/theming/decorationWorkerRegistry.ts` within the `DecorationClass.Strikethrough` worker.  The provided project files do not introduce any new mitigations for this vulnerability.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Replace the vulnerable regular expression with a more efficient and ReDoS-safe alternative.
    - Consider using a different approach for identifying strikethrough text ranges that does not rely on complex regular expressions, such as token-based parsing of the markdown document.
    - Implement a timeout mechanism for decoration analysis tasks to prevent long-running regex operations from blocking the extension.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must open or edit a markdown document containing the crafted malicious strikethrough text.
    - The "markdown.extension.theming.decoration.renderStrikethrough" setting must be enabled (which is the default).

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/theming/decorationWorkerRegistry.ts`
    - Function: `[DecorationClass.Strikethrough]` worker
    - Vulnerable code snippet:
    ```typescript
    ranges.push(...Array.from<RegExpMatchArray, vscode.Range>(
        text.matchAll(/(?<![~\\])~~[^~\p{Zs}\t\r\n\f].*?(?<![~\p{Zs}\t\r\n\f])~~(?!~)/gu), m => {
            return new vscode.Range(
                document.positionAt(beginOffset + m.index!),
                document.positionAt(beginOffset + m.index! + m[0].length)
            );
        }
    ));
    ```
    - Visualization:
        - The regex `/(?<![~\\])~~[^~\p{Zs}\t\r\n\f].*?(?<![~\p{Zs}\t\r\n\f])~~(?!~)/gu` is applied to the text content of each inline token.
        - When processing a crafted input like `~~a<long_spaces>~~`, the regex engine will perform extensive backtracking due to the `.*?` and negative lookbehind, trying different combinations to find a match, leading to performance degradation.
    - Additional context from new files: The new files, specifically those related to editor context services (`/code/src/editor-context-service/`), `nls` (`/code/src/nls/`), `configuration` (`/code/src/configuration/`), and tests (`/code/src/test/`), do not directly interact with or mitigate this ReDoS vulnerability. They are focused on different aspects of the extension, such as context management, localization, configuration handling, and testing functionalities. These files do not introduce new code that would address the regex vulnerability in the strikethrough decoration.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Open VSCode with the extension enabled.
    2. Create a new markdown file or open an existing one.
    3. Insert the following malicious strikethrough text into the document:
    ````markdown
    ~~a

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ~~
    ````
       (Note: The spaces between 'a' and the closing '~~' should be a very long sequence, e.g., copy and paste spaces multiple times to create a long line).
    4. Observe the editor's performance. In a vulnerable case, you should notice a significant delay or unresponsiveness in the editor, especially when typing or scrolling in the document.
    5. To further confirm, you can use a CPU profiler to check if the VSCode process is consuming high CPU resources when processing this document, and if the `RegExp.exec` or `String.matchAll` function related to the strikethrough regex is taking a significant amount of time.

This test case, when executed, should demonstrate the ReDoS vulnerability by causing performance issues when the extension tries to apply strikethrough decorations to the malicious input.
