## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: **HTML Injection in Exported HTML via Markdown Content**
- Description: The Markdown extension allows exporting Markdown documents to HTML. When processing Markdown content for HTML export, the extension does not properly sanitize heading content, allowing for HTML injection. An attacker can craft a Markdown document with malicious HTML code within a heading. When this document is exported to HTML using the extension's print feature, the injected HTML code will be executed in the exported HTML file.
- Impact: **High**. Execution of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code in the exported HTML file. If a user opens the exported HTML in a browser, the injected script can perform malicious actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user if the HTML is opened in a context where such actions are possible (e.g., a local HTML file opened by a logged in user on a website).
- Vulnerability Rank: **High**
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The code directly renders the heading content into HTML without sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization**: Implement proper sanitization of heading content before rendering it into HTML. Use a library or function that safely escapes HTML entities in the heading text to prevent execution of injected code.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must open a crafted Markdown document containing malicious HTML in a heading using VSCode.
    - The user must use the "Markdown: Print current document to HTML" or "Markdown: Print documents to HTML" command to export the document.
    - The user must open the exported HTML file in a web browser or an application that renders HTML.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/print.ts`
    - Function: `print`
    - Vulnerable code section:
        ```typescript
        let title: string | undefined = m === null ? undefined : m[1].trim();

        // Empty string is also falsy.
        if (!title) {
            // Editors treat `\r\n`, `\n`, and `\r` as EOL.
            // Since we don't care about line numbers, a simple alternation is enough and slightly faster.
            title = doc.getText().split(/\n|\r/g).find(lineText => lineText.startsWith('#') && /^#{1,6} /.test(lineText));
            if (title) {
                title = title.replace(/<!--(.*?)-->/g, '');
                title = title.trim().replace(/^#+/, '').replace(/#+$/, '').trim();
            }
        }

        //// Render body HTML.
        let body: string = await mdEngine.render(doc.getText(), workspace.getConfiguration('markdown.preview', doc.uri));

        ...

        html = `<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>${title ? encodeHTML(title) : ''}</title>
            ...
        </head>
        <body class="vscode-body ${themeClass}">
            ${body}
            ...
        </body>
        </html>`;
        ```
        - The code extracts the title from the document, if available, and uses it to set the `<title>` tag in the exported HTML.
        - The `body` is rendered using `mdEngine.render(doc.getText(), ...)` which might sanitize body content, but the `title` is passed through `encodeHTML(title)` which is for HTML entity encoding, not full sanitization against script injection in `<title>`.
        - If a malicious heading like `# <script>alert('XSS')</script>` is present, the `title` variable will contain this unsanitized HTML, and `encodeHTML(title)` is not sufficient to prevent script execution in the `<title>` tag.
        - The `body` content is rendered by `mdEngine.render`, which uses `markdown-it`. While `markdown-it` itself might be configured to sanitize HTML in the body, the vulnerability here is specifically in the `<title>` tag generation, which is handled separately and appears to lack proper sanitization.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new Markdown file in VSCode.
    2. Add the following content to the Markdown file:
        ```markdown
        # <script>alert('XSS-title')</script> Malicious Title

        ## Normal Content
        ```
    3. Save the Markdown file (e.g., `xss.md`).
    4. Open the command palette in VSCode (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    5. Execute the command "Markdown: Print current document to HTML".
    6. Open the generated HTML file (`xss.html`) in a web browser.
    7. Observe that an alert box with "XSS-title" is displayed, indicating successful HTML injection in the `<title>` tag.

- Vulnerability Name: **Potential Remote Code Execution via Malicious Markdown Extension (Dependency Vulnerability)**
- Description: The extension utilizes third-party Markdown-it plugins (`markdown-it-task-lists`, `markdown-it-github-alerts`, `@neilsustc/markdown-it-katex`). If any of these plugins have a security vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution (e.g., due to unsafe parsing of specific Markdown syntax or options), it could be exploited by an attacker. A malicious Markdown file, when processed by the extension (e.g., during preview or export), could trigger the vulnerability in a plugin, leading to remote code execution within the VSCode environment.
- Impact: **High to Critical**.  Remote Code Execution. An attacker could potentially gain full control over the user's machine if a vulnerability exists in one of the Markdown-it plugins and is triggered by processing a malicious Markdown document.
- Vulnerability Rank: **High** (due to potential RCE, though dependent on external dependencies)
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None directly in the project code to mitigate vulnerabilities in dependencies. The project relies on the security of the used `markdown-it` plugins.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Dependency Security Audits**: Regularly audit the security of the used `markdown-it` plugins and their dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    - **Dependency Updates**: Keep the dependencies up-to-date to incorporate security patches released by the plugin maintainers.
    - **Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN resources**: While not directly related to plugin vulnerabilities, if CDN resources are used (like KaTeX from CDN in `print.ts`), implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that the integrity of these resources is not compromised.
    - **Sandboxing (Limited Mitigation in VSCode Extension context)**: While full sandboxing might be challenging in a VSCode extension context, explore if there are any VSCode API features or best practices to limit the impact of potential RCE from dependencies (e.g., principle of least privilege, process isolation if feasible).
- Preconditions:
    - A security vulnerability must exist in one of the used `markdown-it` plugins (`markdown-it-task-lists`, `markdown-it-github-alerts`, `@neilsustc/markdown-it-katex`) or their dependencies.
    - The user must open and process (e.g., preview, export) a crafted Markdown document that triggers the vulnerability in the plugin.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/markdown-it-plugin-provider.ts`
    - Vulnerable code section:
        ```typescript
        export function extendMarkdownIt(md: MarkdownIt): MarkdownIt {
            md.use(require("markdown-it-task-lists"), {enabled: true});
            md.use(require("markdown-it-github-alerts"), { matchCaseSensitive: false })

            if (configManager.get("math.enabled")) {
                // We need side effects. (#521)
                require("katex/contrib/mhchem");

                // Deep copy, as KaTeX needs a normal mutable object. <https://katex.org/docs/options.html>
                const macros: KatexOptions["macros"] = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(configManager.get("katex.macros")));

                if (Object.keys(macros).length === 0) {
                    delete katexOptions["macros"];
                } else {
                    katexOptions["macros"] = macros;
                }

                md.use(require("@neilsustc/markdown-it-katex"), katexOptions);
            }

            return md;
        }
        ```
        - The code directly uses `require()` to include `markdown-it-task-lists`, `markdown-it-github-alerts`, and `@neilsustc/markdown-it-katex` plugins.
        - If any of these `require()`d modules, or their dependencies, have a vulnerability, it can be exploited when `md.use()` is called, or later when `md.render()` is invoked with malicious Markdown content.
        - The risk is that the extension implicitly trusts the security of these third-party plugins and does not implement any additional security measures to mitigate potential vulnerabilities within them.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **(Conceptual Test - Requires Vulnerable Dependency)**:  Assume a hypothetical vulnerability is discovered in `markdown-it-task-lists` that allows RCE when processing a task list with a specially crafted input.
    2. Craft a Markdown document that includes the specific Markdown syntax that triggers the hypothetical vulnerability in `markdown-it-task-lists`.
        ```markdown
        - [ ] Malicious Task List Item that triggers RCE
        ```
    3. Open this Markdown document in VSCode with the extension activated.
    4. Trigger the Markdown processing functionality, for example by opening the preview (`Ctrl+Shift+V`) or exporting to HTML (`Markdown: Print current document to HTML`).
    5. **Expected Outcome (if vulnerability exists)**: If the crafted Markdown triggers the hypothetical vulnerability in `markdown-it-task-lists`, arbitrary code execution would occur.  This might be observed as unexpected behavior within VSCode, system-level changes (if the exploit is successful in escaping the VSCode process), or through debugging/monitoring tools that can detect code execution originating from the extension's process.

    **Note**: This test case is conceptual as it relies on a hypothetical vulnerability. To perform a real security test, one would need to identify a known vulnerability in one of the dependencies and craft a test case that specifically triggers it. In the absence of known vulnerabilities, regular dependency security audits and updates are the primary mitigation strategies.
