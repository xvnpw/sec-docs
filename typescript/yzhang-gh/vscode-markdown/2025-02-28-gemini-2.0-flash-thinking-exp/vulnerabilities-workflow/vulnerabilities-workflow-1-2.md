### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name:  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and potential Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in HTML Export and Preview

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a Markdown document containing an image tag with a maliciously crafted `src` attribute.
    2. The attacker opens this Markdown document in VS Code with the "Markdown All in One" extension installed, triggering the preview feature, or exports the Markdown document to HTML using the extension's export functionality.
    3. The extension attempts to load and process the image from the attacker-controlled URL provided in the `src` attribute.
    4. If the URL points to an internal resource (SSRF) or a remote file (RFI), the extension might inadvertently access or include these resources in the exported HTML or during preview rendering.
    5. In the case of RFI, if the remote file contains malicious code (e.g., JavaScript in an SVG image), it could be executed within the context of the VS Code preview or exported HTML, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

- Impact:
    - **SSRF**: An attacker could potentially use the extension to probe internal network resources that are not directly accessible from the outside. This could be used to gather information about internal services or potentially interact with internal APIs if no authentication is required.
    - **RFI & Potential XSS**: If a malicious SVG or other file type with embedded scripts is included, it could lead to Remote File Inclusion and potentially Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the context of the rendered HTML preview or exported HTML file. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's VS Code environment when previewing the crafted Markdown file or when opening the exported HTML in a browser.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The extension has settings like `markdown.extension.print.imgToBase64` and `markdown.extension.print.absoluteImgPath`, but these settings do not prevent SSRF/RFI. They only control how image paths are handled during the export process.
    - The `markdown.extension.print.validateUrls` setting exists, but it is unclear if it effectively prevents SSRF/RFI as it might only validate URL format and not the target resource.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **URL Sanitization and Validation**: The extension is missing proper sanitization and validation of image URLs, especially before attempting to load them. This should include:
        - **Protocol Whitelisting**: Only allow `http://`, `https://`, and potentially `file://` protocols, and strictly validate them. Block `javascript:`, `data:`, and other potentially dangerous protocols.
        - **Hostname/Domain Whitelisting or Blacklisting**: Implement a whitelist of allowed image hostnames or a blacklist of disallowed ones to prevent access to internal or malicious domains.
        - **Path Sanitization**: Sanitize the path component of the URL to prevent directory traversal attacks and ensure that only intended file paths are accessed.
        - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: For preview and exported HTML, implement a strict Content Security Policy to mitigate potential XSS if RFI is exploited. Specifically, restrict `img-src` directive to safe origins.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to create or control a Markdown document that will be opened and previewed or exported by a user who has the "Markdown All in One" extension installed.
    - The user must have the preview feature enabled or use the export to HTML functionality.
    - The `markdown.extension.print.validateUrls` setting, if it exists to prevent this, must be disabled or ineffective against SSRF/RFI.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/src/print.ts`**:
       - The `print` function handles the Markdown to HTML export functionality.
       - Line 112: `let body: string = await mdEngine.render(doc.getText(), workspace.getConfiguration('markdown.preview', doc.uri));` - This line renders the Markdown content to HTML. The `mdEngine.render` function might be vulnerable to XSS if it doesn't sanitize user-provided content properly, although this vulnerability focuses on image loading, not general XSS from markdown rendering itself.
       - Lines 115-148: Image path handling logic.
         - `const imgTagRegex = /(<img[^>]+src=")([^"]+)("[^>]*>)/g;` - Regular expression to find image tags and their `src` attributes.
         - `body = body.replace(imgTagRegex, function (_, p1, p2, p3) { ... });` - Replaces image `src` attributes based on configuration.
         - `const imgSrc = relToAbsPath(doc.uri, p2);` - Converts relative paths to absolute paths.
         - `fs.readFileSync(imgSrc.replace(/%20/g, '\ '))` - **VULNERABLE LINE**: Directly reads file content based on `imgSrc`, which can be influenced by the attacker-controlled `p2` (image URL from Markdown). No sufficient validation or sanitization is performed on `imgSrc` before `fs.readFileSync` is called. This allows for SSRF/RFI.
         - The code checks if `p2` starts with `http` or `data:`, but this check is insufficient as it doesn't prevent access to internal resources via URLs like `file:///`, or other schemes that might be processed by `relToAbsPath` or `fs.readFileSync`.
         - The `relToAbsPath` function at line 340 simply joins the directory of the document with the provided `href`, which doesn't prevent SSRF if `href` is a malicious URL.

    2. **File: `/code/src/preview.ts`**:
       - Although this file primarily handles preview display, it relies on the same rendering and potentially the same image processing logic as the export function, making it also vulnerable if the rendering engine or image handling is flawed. The preview uses `markdown.showPreviewToSide` command of VS Code, which might internally reuse parts of the export logic, or might be vulnerable itself to similar issues if it processes images.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Attacker-Controlled Markdown --> Extension (Preview/Export) --> Vulnerable Image Processing (src/print.ts) --> fs.readFileSync(attacker_controlled_URL) --> SSRF/RFI --> Potential XSS (if RFI includes malicious script)
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new Markdown file in VS Code.
    2. Insert the following Markdown content into the file:
       ```markdown
       ![SSRF/RFI Test](file:///etc/passwd)  <!-- Attempt to access local file (SSRF/RFI) -->
       ![External Image](http://example.com/image.png) <!-- Normal external image (for comparison) -->
       ![Malicious SVG](http://attacker.com/malicious.svg) <!-- Malicious SVG with JavaScript (potential XSS via RFI) -->
       ```
       Create a file `malicious.svg` on `attacker.com` with content:
       ```xml
       <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
       <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
       <svg width="200" height="200" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
         <script type="text/javascript">
           alert("XSS Vulnerability via SVG!");
         </script>
         <text x="10" y="20" font-size="20">SVG with XSS</text>
       </svg>
       ```
    3. Open the Markdown preview (`Ctrl+Shift+V` or `Ctrl+K V`).
    4. Observe if the preview attempts to load `/etc/passwd` (you might see errors in the console related to file access if it tries). For security reasons, direct file access might be restricted by VS Code, but in less restricted environments, it might work.
    5. Check if the image from `http://example.com/image.png` loads normally (as a baseline for comparison).
    6. Check if the alert box from `malicious.svg` on `http://attacker.com/malicious.svg` is displayed in the preview (or when the exported HTML is opened in a browser), indicating potential XSS vulnerability via RFI.
    7. Export the Markdown to HTML (`Markdown All in One: Print current document to HTML`).
    8. Open the exported HTML file in a web browser.
    9. Check if the alert box from `malicious.svg` is displayed in the browser, again indicating potential XSS vulnerability via RFI in the exported HTML.
    10. Inspect the HTML source of the exported file and check if the `src` attribute of the image tags related to `file:///etc/passwd` and `http://attacker.com/malicious.svg` are present and not sanitized, confirming the SSRF/RFI risk in the exported output.
