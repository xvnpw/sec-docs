### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Exported HTML via Custom Stylesheets

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious CSS file hosted on a public server or within the user's workspace.
    2. The attacker tricks a victim into opening a markdown file in a VSCode workspace and configuring the `markdown.styles` setting in `.vscode/settings.json` to include the malicious CSS file URL or file path.
    3. The victim uses the "Markdown All in One: Print current document to HTML" command.
    4. The exported HTML includes a `<link>` or `<style>` tag pointing to the malicious CSS file.
    5. When the victim opens the exported HTML in a browser or shares it with others who open it, the malicious CSS executes JavaScript code embedded within it (e.g., using `expression` or `@import url("javascript:...")`).

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the exported HTML file when opened in a browser. This can lead to stealing credentials, session hijacking, or other malicious actions depending on the browser and the user's environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly includes stylesheets specified in the configuration without sanitization.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization or validation of stylesheet URLs and file paths in `markdown.styles` setting to prevent injection of malicious resources.
    - Display a warning message to the user when exporting HTML with custom stylesheets enabled, indicating the potential security risks.
    - Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) in exported HTML to restrict the execution of external resources, although this might break intended functionality of custom stylesheets.

- Preconditions:
    - The victim must open a VSCode workspace controlled by the attacker or be tricked into modifying the `markdown.styles` setting in their workspace settings.
    - The "markdown.extension.print.pureHtml" setting must be false (default).

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/print.ts`
    - Function: `getStyles(uri: Uri, hasMathEnv: boolean, includeVscodeStyles: boolean)`
    - Step 1: The function `getCustomStyleSheets(uri)` retrieves stylesheet paths from the workspace configuration `markdown.styles`.
    - Step 2: The function `wrapWithStyleTag(cssSrc)` wraps each stylesheet path in either a `<link>` tag (if it's a URL) or a `<style>` tag (if it's a local file path), without any sanitization.
    - Step 3: These tags are directly included in the exported HTML string.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        Configuration 'markdown.styles' --> getCustomStyleSheets() --> wrapWithStyleTag() --> HTML output
        ```
    - Attack flow: Attacker controls `markdown.styles` configuration -> Extension includes malicious CSS in exported HTML -> Victim opens HTML in browser -> Malicious CSS executes JavaScript.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a malicious CSS file named `malicious.css` in a publicly accessible location (e.g., using a simple HTTP server or a GitHub Gist). The CSS file should contain JavaScript code that executes when the CSS is loaded, for example:
       ```css
       body {
           background-image: url("javascript:alert('XSS Vulnerability!')");
       }
       ```
    2. Create a markdown file named `test.md` in a new VSCode workspace.
    3. In the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`), add the following configuration, replacing `<URL_TO_MALICIOUS_CSS>` with the actual URL of the malicious CSS file:
       ```json
       {
           "markdown.styles": ["<URL_TO_MALICIOUS_CSS>/malicious.css"]
       }
       ```
    4. Open `test.md` in VSCode.
    5. Run the command "Markdown All in One: Print current document to HTML".
    6. Open the exported HTML file (`test.html`) in a web browser.
    7. Observe that the JavaScript code from `malicious.css` is executed (e.g., an alert box appears).
