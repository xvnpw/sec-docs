# Vulnerabilities List

- **Vulnerability Name:** WebAssembly‑based Slugify Module Code Injection Vulnerability  
  **Description:**  
  - The extension customizes markdown header rendering (in `markdownEngine.ts`) by passing raw heading text directly to the `slugify()` function.  
  - When the user's configuration selects the Zola mode, `slugify()` (in `slugify.ts`) calls into a WebAssembly module (compiled from the [zola‑slug](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown/) crate) without performing any extra sanitization, bounds checking, or error handling.  
  - A threat actor can supply a specially crafted markdown file (for example, one with extremely long headings or headings containing boundary‑challenging Unicode sequences) so that the input triggers unexpected behavior—such as a memory corruption or buffer overflow—inside the WebAssembly module.  
  - Such memory corruption may be exploited for code injection, leading to remote code execution in the VS Code extension host.  

  **Impact:**  
  - Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the VS Code extension host. This may enable access to sensitive files, system credentials, or further privilege escalation on the host system.  

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The extension processes markdown content using the standard Markdown‑it engine before passing headings to `slugify()`.  
  - However, no custom input sanitization, length checking, or robust error handling (such as try‑catch blocks surrounding the WebAssembly invocation) is applied before calling the module's functions.  

  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Implement strict input sanitization and enforce a maximum allowable heading length before passing the text into the WebAssembly module.  
  - Wrap the call to the WebAssembly slugify function with proper try‑catch error handling to ensure that any memory corruption or unexpected errors are safely managed.  
  - Consider sandboxing or further hardening the WebAssembly module itself so that even if given malformed input it cannot lead to arbitrary code execution.  

  **Preconditions:**  
  - The victim must open a markdown file (or repository containing markdown files) that includes maliciously crafted headings designed to trigger the underlying WebAssembly bug.  
  - The underlying WebAssembly module compiled from the zola‑slug crate must be vulnerable to input‑induced memory corruption (for example, due to insufficient bounds checking).  

  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `markdownEngine.ts`, the function `addNamedHeaders` retrieves the raw heading text from markdown tokens and immediately passes it to the extension's `slugify()` function.  
  - In `slugify.ts`, when the configuration selects `SlugifyMode.Zola`, the code calls  
    ```ts
    if (zolaSlug !== undefined) {
      return zolaSlug.slugify(mdInlineToPlainText(rawContent, env));
    }
    ```  
    without performing extra sanitization or validation on the heading input.  
  - The absence of defensive checks means that an attacker's specially crafted heading may trigger unsafe operations within the WebAssembly module, leading to memory corruption and, ultimately, arbitrary code execution.  

  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Preparation:** Create a malicious markdown file (e.g. `malicious.md`) that contains a heading with either an excessively long string or carefully crafted Unicode payload intended to trigger a buffer overflow within the WebAssembly module.  
  2. **Triggering:** Open this markdown file in VS Code so that the extension processes it (for example, when building the table of contents or rendering a preview).  
  3. **Observation:** Monitor the VS Code developer console, use debugging tools and memory analysis tools to determine whether the slug generation process crashes, exhibits abnormal behavior, or shows signs of memory corruption.  
  4. **Confirmation:** If abnormal behavior (e.g. a crash, memory dump, or unexpected output) is observed when processing the malicious heading, this confirms that the vulnerability is present.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Module Resolution Hijacking in Dynamic Import of "zola‑slug" WebAssembly Module  
  **Description:**  
  - For the Zola slugification mode, the extension dynamically imports the WebAssembly module by calling  
    ```ts
    export async function importZolaSlug() {
      zolaSlug = await import("zola-slug");
    }
    ```  
    in `slugify.ts`.  
  - The module identifier `"zola-slug"` is a bare specifier, which means that Node.js's module resolution algorithm is used without constraining the import to a known, trusted location.  
  - A threat actor can supply a malicious version of the `"zola-slug"` module (for instance, by including a manipulated `node_modules/zola-slug` folder in the repository or by setting the `NODE_PATH` environment variable) so that the dynamic import resolves to the attacker‑controlled module.  
  - Once loaded, the malicious `zola-slug` module may implement a compromised `slugify()` function that executes arbitrary code during processing of markdown headings, thereby enabling code injection and remote code execution.  

  **Impact:**  
  - If exploited, this flaw allows an attacker to hijack the dynamic import process and substitute a malicious module. This may result in arbitrary code execution within the VS Code extension host and could compromise the entire development environment and potentially the underlying system.  

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No explicit measures are taken in `slugify.ts` to validate the origin or integrity of the module resolved by the dynamic import.  
  - The code does not restrict or verify the module resolution path for `"zola-slug"`.  

  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Enforce module resolution security by bundling the `"zola-slug"` dependency with the extension so that the module is loaded only from a trusted, fixed location (for example, by using a bundler or an absolute path).  
  - Implement integrity checks (such as verifying a hash of the module's code) to ensure that the imported module has not been tampered with.  
  - Limit external influence on module resolution (for example, by sanitizing or ignoring environment variables like `NODE_PATH` that might alter the module search path).  

  **Preconditions:**  
  - The extension must not be statically bundled with its dependencies so that the dynamic import of `"zola-slug"` is subject to Node.js's default module resolution.  
  - The attacker must be able to introduce a malicious version of `"zola-slug"` via the workspace (for instance, by providing a manipulated repository with its own `node_modules`) or influence the module resolution environment.  

  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `slugify.ts`, a module‐scoped variable is declared without specifying an absolute path:  
    ```ts
    let zolaSlug: typeof import("zola-slug");
    ```  
  - The function `importZolaSlug()` then calls the dynamic import using a bare module specifier. Because Node.js's resolution algorithm is used, the lookup order may be influenced by the workspace's `node_modules` or environment variables such as `NODE_PATH`.  
  - There is no check to confirm that the resolved module originates from the expected and trusted location, leaving open the possibility of module resolution hijacking by an attacker.  

  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup Malicious Module:** Create a malicious repository that includes a `node_modules/zola-slug` folder containing an altered implementation of the `slugify()` function (for example, one that runs a shell command or writes sensitive data to disk).  
  2. **Environment Manipulation:** Configure the workspace or adjust environment variables (such as `NODE_PATH`) so that the dynamic import in the extension prioritizes the repository's version of `"zola-slug"` over the intended trusted module.  
  3. **Trigger Import:** Open a markdown file that causes the extension to invoke the slugification process (e.g. by generating the table of contents), which in turn triggers a call to `importZolaSlug()`.  
  4. **Observe Effects:** Monitor the behavior of the extension and system logs to determine whether the malicious payload is executed. Successful execution of the payload confirms that the module resolution hijacking vulnerability is valid.
