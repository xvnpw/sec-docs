## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Provider Interactions (React-Admin Specific) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Category]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_provider_interactions__react-admin_specific___high-risk_path___critical_node_-_category_d132dd4c.md)

**1. Exploit Data Provider Interactions (React-Admin Specific) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Category]:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Manipulate Data Provider Requests (Client-Side) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Intercept and Modify Network Requests (Browser DevTools, Proxy) [CRITICAL NODE - Entry Point] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Attackers use browser developer tools or proxy tools to intercept network requests sent by React-Admin to the backend data provider.
            *   **Modify Query Parameters in List/Get/Update/Create/Delete Requests [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   Attackers modify query parameters in API requests (e.g., `filter`, `sort`, `range`, resource IDs) to:
                    *   **Attempt to Bypass Server-Side Authorization via Modified Queries [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Try to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for by altering parameters that the backend might improperly trust or validate.
                    *   **Attempt to Retrieve More Data Than Authorized (Data Leakage) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Request more data than intended or authorized, potentially leaking sensitive information if the backend doesn't enforce proper data scoping.
    *   **Exploit Insecure Data Provider Configuration (React-Admin Facilitated) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Misconfigured Permissions in Data Provider (Backend Issue, React-Admin Exposes) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Backend Weakness]:**
            *   **React-Admin UI Exposes Insecurely Configured Backend Permissions [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** React-Admin UI directly interacts with backend APIs and reflects the backend's permission model. If the backend permissions are misconfigured (e.g., overly permissive roles, broken access control), React-Admin UI becomes a direct tool to exploit these backend flaws.
            *   **Exploit Backend Permission Flaws via React-Admin UI [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers leverage the React-Admin UI to interact with the backend in ways that expose and exploit underlying backend permission vulnerabilities, gaining unauthorized access or data manipulation capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Rendering and Logic Vulnerabilities (React-Admin Context) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Category]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_rendering_and_logic_vulnerabilities__react-admin_context___high-risk_path___crit_b904a37e.md)

**2. Exploit Client-Side Rendering and Logic Vulnerabilities (React-Admin Context) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Category]:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via React-Admin Components [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type]:**
        *   **Stored XSS via Data Input in React-Admin Forms [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Inject Malicious Scripts into Fields Rendered by React-Admin Components (e.g., `<TextField>`, `<RichTextField>`) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into form fields within React-Admin, which are then stored in the backend database.
            *   **Trigger Stored XSS when Admin User Views Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** When an administrator user views the data containing the malicious script through React-Admin components, the script executes in their browser.
            *   **Session Hijacking / Account Takeover / Data Exfiltration [CRITICAL NODE - Impact] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Successful XSS can lead to:
                *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the administrator's session cookie to impersonate them.
                *   **Account Takeover:**  Modifying account credentials or performing actions as the administrator.
                *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive data displayed in the React-Admin interface and sending it to an attacker-controlled server.
        *   **DOM-Based XSS via Client-Side Manipulation (React-Admin Logic):**
            *   **Session Hijacking / Account Takeover / Data Exfiltration [CRITICAL NODE - Impact]:** Similar to Stored XSS, DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability lies in client-side JavaScript manipulating the DOM based on attacker-controlled input, can also lead to session hijacking, account takeover, and data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration or Improper Use of React-Admin (Developer Error) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Category]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration_or_improper_use_of_react-admin__developer_error___high-risk_path___critical_2b5492ca.md)

**3. Exploit Misconfiguration or Improper Use of React-Admin (Developer Error) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Category]:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Customization of React-Admin [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Developer Responsibility]:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Components Developed for React-Admin [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Weak Point]:**
            *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Components via React-Admin UI [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Developers might introduce vulnerabilities (like XSS, logic flaws, insecure data handling) in custom React components built for React-Admin. Attackers can then exploit these vulnerabilities through the React-Admin UI.
    *   **Insecure Configuration of React-Admin Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Misconfigured Authentication/Authorization within React-Admin (Client-Side) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Anti-Pattern]:** Developers might mistakenly implement authentication or authorization logic solely on the client-side within React-Admin. This is a critical anti-pattern as client-side security can be easily bypassed, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   **Exposing Debug/Development Features in Production (React-Admin Application) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Misconfiguration]:**
        *   **Debugging Tools or Information Exposed in Production Build [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Source Maps Exposed in Production Build (Information Disclosure) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Accidentally deploying source maps to production exposes the application's source code, including potentially sensitive information like API endpoints, internal logic, and secrets.
            *   **Debug Logs or Verbose Error Messages Exposed in Production (Information Disclosure) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Leaving debug logging enabled or displaying verbose error messages in production can leak sensitive internal application details, database structure, or even credentials in error messages, aiding attackers in further exploitation.
