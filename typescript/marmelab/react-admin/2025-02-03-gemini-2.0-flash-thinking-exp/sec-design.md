# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open-source project with public code repository, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Location: GitHub repository)
  - security control: Dependency management using npm or yarn, enabling tracking and updating of project dependencies. (Location: package.json, yarn.lock / package-lock.json)
  - security control: Active community and issue tracking system for reporting and addressing bugs and potential security vulnerabilities. (Location: GitHub issues)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party open-source libraries, which may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for security vulnerabilities within the react-admin framework itself, requiring community effort and maintainer response for remediation.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the development pipeline to detect potential security flaws in custom admin application code.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing on deployed admin panels to proactively identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in a live environment.
  - security control: Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate risks of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - security control: Enforce security best practices in the development and configuration of the backend API that react-admin interacts with.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of admin users accessing the panel.
    - Requirement: Support integration with existing organizational identity providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0, SAML) for centralized user management.
    - Requirement: Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) where applicable.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user access to specific features and data based on their roles and responsibilities.
    - Requirement: Define granular permissions for different administrative tasks and data entities.
    - Requirement: Regularly review and update user roles and permissions to maintain least privilege access.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Implement comprehensive input validation on both the client-side (react-admin) and server-side (backend API) to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    - Requirement: Sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the admin interface to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Validate data formats and types to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected application behavior.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Utilize HTTPS for all communication between the admin panel (browser) and the backend API to encrypt data in transit.
    - Requirement: Securely store sensitive data at rest in the backend database, employing encryption where necessary.
    - Requirement: Handle sensitive data in memory securely and avoid storing sensitive information in browser local storage or cookies if possible, or encrypt if necessary.

    style D fill:#DDEEFF,stroke:#000,stroke-width:1px
```

- Build Process Description:
  - The build process starts with a developer committing code changes to a code repository, such as GitHub.
  - A CI/CD pipeline is triggered upon code changes (e.g., push, pull request). This pipeline is typically defined using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.
  - The CI/CD pipeline executes a series of build steps:
    - Dependency Installation: Install project dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn.
    - Build SPA: Build the React-admin Single Page Application, compiling code, bundling assets, and optimizing for production.
    - Run Tests: Execute automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Perform static code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
    - Dependency Scan: Scan project dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
  - Upon successful completion of the build process, build artifacts are generated. These artifacts typically consist of static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) for the React-admin SPA.
  - The build artifacts are then deployed to the target deployment environment, such as a CDN and static hosting service, making the updated admin panel accessible to users.
- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control: Code Review Process: Implement mandatory code reviews for all code changes before merging to the main branch to identify potential security flaws and ensure code quality. (Location: GitHub Pull Requests)
  - security control: Automated Build Process: Utilize a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistency. (Location: CI/CD configuration files, e.g., GitHub Actions workflows)
  - security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning: Integrate dependency scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and report vulnerabilities in project dependencies. (Location: CI/CD pipeline scripts, dependency scanning tool reports)
  - security control: SAST Integration: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically analyze the codebase for security vulnerabilities during the build process. (Location: CI/CD pipeline scripts, SAST tool reports)
  - security control: Secure Build Environment: Ensure the CI/CD build environment is secure and hardened to prevent unauthorized access and tampering. (Location: CI/CD infrastructure security configurations)
  - security control: Artifact Integrity Checks: Implement checks to ensure the integrity of build artifacts before deployment, preventing tampering or corruption during the build and deployment process. (Location: CI/CD pipeline scripts, artifact signing or checksum verification)
  - security control: Access Control to Build System: Restrict access to the CI/CD system and build configurations to authorized personnel only. (Location: CI/CD platform access control settings)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Management of core business data (e.g., customer data, product information, financial records).
  - User and access management for the application and related systems.
  - System configuration and settings management.
  - Monitoring and auditing of system activities.
  - Reporting and analytics based on business data.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of data managed through the admin panel is highly dependent on the specific application. It can range from low sensitivity (publicly available information) to high sensitivity (personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, confidential business data).
  - Classify data based on sensitivity levels (e.g., public, internal, confidential, restricted) and apply appropriate security controls accordingly.
  - Consider regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) based on the type of data being managed.
