# Threat Model Analysis for marmelab/react-admin

## Threat: [Data Injection via List Filters and Search](./threats/data_injection_via_list_filters_and_search.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Injection via List Filters and Search
*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code through React-Admin list filters or search inputs. Unsanitized input is passed to the backend API, leading to injection attacks (e.g., NoSQL injection, command injection) when processing data queries.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, potential remote code execution on the backend server.
*   **Affected React-Admin Component:** `<List>`, `<Datagrid>`, `<SimpleList>`, `<Filter>`, `<SearchInput>`, Data Provider's `getList` method.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory server-side sanitization and validation of all filter and search parameters.**
    *   **Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements in backend data access logic.**
    *   **Avoid dynamic query construction by directly concatenating user input on the backend.**

## Threat: [Insecure Authentication Implementation in Data Provider](./threats/insecure_authentication_implementation_in_data_provider.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Authentication Implementation in Data Provider
*   **Description:** Flawed authentication logic within the React-Admin `dataProvider` (custom implementation) leads to vulnerabilities. This includes insecure token storage, weak authentication schemes, or improper token refresh, enabling authentication bypass or credential theft.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized application access, data breach, account takeover.
*   **Affected React-Admin Component:** `authProvider`, Data Provider's authentication methods (`login`, `logout`, `checkAuth`, `checkError`, `getPermissions`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement secure authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 or JWT.**
    *   **Securely store tokens (HTTP-only cookies or browser memory preferred).**
    *   **Implement robust token refresh mechanisms.**
    *   **Leverage established, secure authentication libraries instead of custom code.**
    *   **Regularly audit `authProvider` implementation for security flaws.**

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Frontend-Only Role Checks](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_frontend-only_role_checks.md)

*   **Threat:** Authorization Bypass due to Frontend-Only Role Checks
*   **Description:** React-Admin frontend uses role-based access control (RBAC) for UI elements, but backend API lacks proper authorization enforcement. Attackers bypass frontend restrictions by directly calling backend API endpoints, gaining unauthorized access to data or actions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionalities, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected React-Admin Component:** `authProvider` (`getPermissions`), `<AdminGuesser>`, `<Resource>`, custom components using role-based UI logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce mandatory authorization checks on the backend API for all sensitive operations.**
    *   **Frontend role checks in React-Admin should be solely for UI/UX, not security.**
    *   **Backend API must always verify user permissions before processing requests.**
    *   **Implement a robust backend authorization framework.**

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsafe Rendering of Data](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsafe_rendering_of_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsafe Rendering of Data
*   **Description:** Backend data is rendered in React-Admin components without sanitization. Attackers inject malicious scripts into backend data, which execute in user browsers when displayed by React-Admin, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or website defacement.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Affected React-Admin Component:** Components rendering backend data: `<TextField>`, `<RichTextField>`, `<SimpleList>`, `<Datagrid>`, custom data display components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory sanitization of all backend data before rendering in React-Admin components.**
    *   **Utilize React's built-in XSS prevention (JSX escaping).**
    *   **Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; if necessary, sanitize rigorously.**
    *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for XSS mitigation.**

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of React-Admin Features](./threats/misconfiguration_of_react-admin_features.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration of React-Admin Features
*   **Description:** Incorrect configuration of React-Admin features (authentication, data providers, CORS, resources) introduces security vulnerabilities. For example, permissive CORS or weak authentication setup weakens application security.
*   **Impact:** Access control bypass, data exposure, various vulnerabilities depending on misconfiguration.
*   **Affected React-Admin Component:** `Admin` component, `authProvider`, `dataProvider`, `<Resource>` components, CORS settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly review and test all React-Admin configurations.**
    *   **Adhere to security best practices for authentication, authorization, and data handling configurations.**
    *   **Utilize secure defaults and understand security implications of each configuration option.**
    *   **Implement backend-side CORS configuration for comprehensive protection.**
