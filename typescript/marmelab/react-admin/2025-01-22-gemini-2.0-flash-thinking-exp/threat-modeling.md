# Threat Model Analysis for marmelab/react-admin

## Threat: [React and React-Admin Component Vulnerabilities](./threats/react_and_react-admin_component_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit critical vulnerabilities within React, React-Admin, or their component libraries. These could be zero-day or known vulnerabilities that haven't been patched. Exploitation might involve crafting malicious data inputs or user interactions that trigger critical flaws in rendering, event handling, or state management within React-Admin components. This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or complete application takeover.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the client-side, potentially leading to full control of the user's browser session and account. Complete application takeover if the vulnerability allows for persistent malicious code injection or manipulation of critical application state. Data breaches through unauthorized access to sensitive information within the application.
*   **Affected React-Admin Component:** React core, React-Admin core components (e.g., `<List>`, `<Edit>`, `<Create>`, `<Datagrid>`, `<SimpleForm>`), and any custom components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately update React and React-Admin versions to the latest releases upon security advisories being published. Implement automated dependency update processes.
    *   Proactively monitor security advisories for React, React-Admin, and all related dependencies. Subscribe to security mailing lists and use vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on React-Admin components and custom code to identify potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block common exploit attempts targeting known React and React-Admin vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass through Data Provider Manipulation](./threats/authorization_bypass_through_data_provider_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers directly manipulate API requests, bypassing React-Admin's intended authorization mechanisms. They might use browser developer tools or intercept network traffic to craft requests that circumvent frontend authorization checks. If the backend API relies on the frontend for authorization or if the `dataProvider` is misconfigured and doesn't properly enforce backend authorization, attackers can gain unauthorized access to data and actions. This is especially critical if sensitive administrative functions are exposed through React-Admin.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, including user information, system configurations, and business-critical data. Privilege escalation allowing attackers to perform administrative actions they are not authorized for, potentially leading to system compromise, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Affected React-Admin Component:** `dataProvider`, authorization mechanisms in React-Admin (e.g., `<Resource>` `access` prop, `authProvider`), backend API authorization logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucially**, enforce strict and robust authorization checks on the backend API for *every* data access and modification operation. Do not rely on frontend authorization for security.
    *   Ensure the `dataProvider` is correctly configured to securely pass authentication and authorization tokens/credentials to the backend API for every request.
    *   Implement comprehensive server-side input validation and authorization for all API endpoints, regardless of the frontend framework used.
    *   Regularly audit and penetration test the backend API authorization logic to ensure it cannot be bypassed.
    *   Educate developers on the critical importance of backend authorization and the dangers of relying solely on frontend security measures.

## Threat: [Insecure Authentication Provider Implementation](./threats/insecure_authentication_provider_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** A custom `authProvider` is implemented with critical security flaws, leading to complete authentication bypass or trivial credential compromise. This could involve weak or flawed authentication logic, insecure token generation or storage, or vulnerabilities in the authentication flow itself. Attackers exploiting these flaws can gain full administrative access to the React-Admin panel and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Impact:** Complete Authentication Bypass allowing unauthorized users to gain full administrative access. Account Takeover enabling attackers to impersonate legitimate administrators and perform malicious actions. Full compromise of the React-Admin application and potentially the backend system due to unauthorized administrative access.
*   **Affected React-Admin Component:** `authProvider` (especially custom implementations), authentication flow logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid implementing custom `authProvider` logic if possible.** Leverage well-established and security-vetted authentication services and libraries (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML). Use existing, community-supported React-Admin `authProvider` implementations for these services.
    *   If a custom `authProvider` is absolutely necessary, engage security experts to design, implement, and thoroughly review the authentication logic.
    *   Follow industry best practices for secure authentication, including strong password policies (if applicable), multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure session management, and protection against common authentication attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).
    *   Perform rigorous security testing and penetration testing of the custom `authProvider` implementation before deploying to production.
    *   Regularly audit and review the `authProvider` code for potential security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data Leading to System Compromise](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data_leading_to_system_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Highly sensitive configuration data, such as database credentials, API keys for critical services, or secrets used for encryption, is exposed due to insecure configuration management practices. This data might be found in publicly accessible JavaScript files, inadvertently committed to version control, or leaked through server logs. Attackers obtaining this data can directly compromise backend systems and gain complete control. While React-Admin itself doesn't directly manage backend config, misconfiguration in how it's deployed or interacts with backend can lead to this.
*   **Impact:** Direct compromise of backend systems and databases. Full control over sensitive data and infrastructure. Potential for widespread data breaches, system destruction, and long-term damage.
*   **Affected React-Admin Component:** Configuration files (if improperly handled), build processes, deployment pipelines, environment variable handling (if mismanaged).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never hardcode sensitive configuration data directly in the frontend code or configuration files that are deployed with the application.**
    *   Utilize secure environment variable management systems or dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and access sensitive configuration data.
    *   Ensure build processes and deployment pipelines are configured to *exclude* sensitive configuration files from the deployed application bundle.
    *   Implement strict access control to environment variable stores, secret management systems, and server logs.
    *   Regularly audit codebase, deployment configurations, and server logs to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently exposed.
    *   Rotate sensitive credentials regularly as a preventative measure.
