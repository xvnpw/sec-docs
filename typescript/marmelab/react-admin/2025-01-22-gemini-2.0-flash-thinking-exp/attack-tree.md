## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Data Provider Interactions (React-Admin Specific) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Category]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_data_provider_interactions__react-admin_specific___high-risk_path___critical_node_-_categ_43d1af96.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Manipulating Client-Side Data Provider Requests:** Attackers leverage browser developer tools or proxies to intercept and modify network requests sent by React-Admin to the backend data provider.
    * **Exploiting Insecure Data Provider Configuration:** Attackers target misconfigurations in the backend data provider that are exposed or facilitated by React-Admin's interaction patterns.

* **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    * **Intercept and Modify Network Requests (Browser DevTools, Proxy) [CRITICAL NODE - Entry Point]:** This is the primary entry point for client-side manipulation. It's trivial for attackers to intercept and alter requests.
    * **Misconfigured Permissions in Data Provider (Backend Issue, React-Admin Exposes) [CRITICAL NODE - Backend Weakness]:**  Backend permission flaws are critical because React-Admin UI directly interacts with and exposes these backend configurations, making exploitation easier.

* **Specific Attack Examples:**
    * **Bypassing Server-Side Authorization via Modified Queries:** Modifying query parameters in requests (e.g., changing user IDs, resource filters) to attempt to access data or perform actions that should be unauthorized.  This relies on weak backend authorization logic that might trust client-provided parameters.
    * **Retrieving More Data Than Authorized (Data Leakage):** Modifying pagination parameters or filters to request and potentially receive more data than the user is intended to access. This exploits backend APIs that don't properly enforce data access limits.
    * **Exploiting Backend Permission Flaws via React-Admin UI:** Using the React-Admin interface to interact with backend resources in ways that expose underlying permission misconfigurations. For example, attempting to edit or delete resources that should be protected due to backend permission flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Client-Side Rendering and Logic Vulnerabilities (React-Admin Context) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Category]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_client-side_rendering_and_logic_vulnerabilities__react-admin_context___high-risk_path___c_e8d10498.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via React-Admin Components:** Injecting malicious scripts into data that is rendered by React-Admin components. Due to React-Admin being a client-side application, XSS vulnerabilities are a significant threat.

* **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via React-Admin Components [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type]:** XSS is the primary client-side vulnerability in web applications, and React-Admin is no exception.
    * **Session Hijacking / Account Takeover / Data Exfiltration [CRITICAL NODE - Impact]:** These are the critical impacts of successful XSS attacks, leading to complete compromise of admin accounts and sensitive data.

* **Specific Attack Examples:**
    * **Stored XSS via Data Input in React-Admin Forms:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into form fields (e.g., text fields, rich text editors) within React-Admin. When this data is saved and later displayed to other admin users (or even the same user), the script executes in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, account takeover, or data exfiltration.
    * **Injecting Malicious Scripts into Fields Rendered by React-Admin Components:** Targeting components like `<TextField>` or `<RichTextField>` that render user-provided data. If these components don't properly handle or sanitize input, they can become XSS vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Misconfiguration or Improper Use of React-Admin (Developer Error) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE - Category]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_misconfiguration_or_improper_use_of_react-admin__developer_error___high-risk_path___criti_cd7284cb.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Insecure Customization of React-Admin:** Vulnerabilities introduced by developers when creating custom React components or modifying React-Admin's default behavior.
    * **Insecure Configuration of React-Admin Features:** Misconfiguring React-Admin's authentication, authorization, or data handling settings, especially if client-side configurations are mistakenly used for security.
    * **Exposing Debug/Development Features in Production:** Leaving debugging tools, source maps, or verbose logging enabled in production deployments, which can leak sensitive information and aid attackers.

* **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    * **Insecure Customization of React-Admin [CRITICAL NODE - Developer Responsibility]:**  Highlights that developers are responsible for the security of custom code they add to React-Admin.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Custom Components Developed for React-Admin [CRITICAL NODE - Weak Point]:** Custom components are often the weakest point in React-Admin applications as they are less likely to be thoroughly reviewed and tested for security compared to core React-Admin code.
    * **Misconfigured Authentication/Authorization within React-Admin (Client-Side) [CRITICAL NODE - Anti-Pattern]:**  Emphasizes the dangerous anti-pattern of relying on client-side authentication or authorization logic for security. Backend security must be the primary control.
    * **Exposing Debug/Development Features in Production [CRITICAL NODE - Misconfiguration]:** A common and easily preventable misconfiguration that can significantly weaken security.

* **Specific Attack Examples:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Custom Components:** Custom React components might contain XSS vulnerabilities, logic flaws, or insecure data handling practices if developers are not security-conscious.
    * **Misconfigured Client-Side Authentication/Authorization:** Developers might mistakenly implement client-side checks to restrict access to features, but these checks can be easily bypassed by manipulating client-side code.  Backend authorization is essential and must not rely on client-side checks.
    * **Source Maps Exposed in Production:** Source maps, intended for debugging, can reveal the application's source code in production, including API endpoints, internal logic, and potentially sensitive information.
    * **Debug Logs or Verbose Error Messages Exposed in Production:**  Production logs or error messages might contain sensitive data or reveal internal application details that can be used by attackers to understand the system and identify vulnerabilities.
