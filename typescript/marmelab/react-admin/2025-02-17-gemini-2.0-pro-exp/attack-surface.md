# Attack Surface Analysis for marmelab/react-admin

## Attack Surface: [Data Provider Manipulation (Bypassing Authentication/Authorization)](./attack_surfaces/data_provider_manipulation__bypassing_authenticationauthorization_.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the `react-admin` Data Provider to interact directly with the backend API, bypassing intended access controls.  This focuses on vulnerabilities *within* the Data Provider's implementation or configuration *within the `react-admin` context*.

**How `react-admin` Contributes:** `react-admin`'s architecture relies entirely on Data Providers for API communication.  Custom Data Providers, a core `react-admin` feature, are a prime target.  Misconfiguration of *any* Data Provider (even pre-built ones) within `react-admin` is a direct vulnerability.

**Example:** A custom Data Provider incorrectly handles authentication tokens, sending them in an insecure way (e.g., as a URL parameter) that can be intercepted.  Or, a pre-built Data Provider is misconfigured to use an insecure protocol (HTTP instead of HTTPS).

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential complete system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Secure Data Provider Implementation:** If using a custom Data Provider, *rigorously* review and test it for security vulnerabilities.  Focus on secure token handling, input validation (of data *from* the backend), and error handling. Use well-vetted libraries for API communication.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Data Provider):** Configure the Data Provider (within `react-admin`) to fetch *only* the data absolutely necessary for the UI.
*   **Input Validation (Data Provider):** Validate *all* data received from the backend *within the Data Provider*, even if the backend is considered trusted. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit the `react-admin` application's Data Provider configuration and any custom Data Provider code.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Permission Bypass (Exploiting `react-admin`'s UI Logic)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_permission_bypass__exploiting__react-admin_'s_ui_logic_.md)

**Description:** Attackers circumvent `react-admin`'s client-side permission checks, which control UI element visibility and access to features *within the `react-admin` interface*. This is distinct from backend authorization bypass.

**How `react-admin` Contributes:** `react-admin` provides features (like `authProvider` integration and resource/field-level permission settings) that are *often* implemented primarily on the client-side.  This reliance on client-side logic for security is the core vulnerability.

**Example:** `react-admin` uses its permission system to hide an "Edit" button from users without edit privileges.  An attacker uses browser developer tools to modify the React component's props or state, making the button visible and enabling them to *attempt* an edit (the backend *should* still block the unauthorized request, but the attacker has bypassed the `react-admin` UI controls).

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to restricted `react-admin` features; potential escalation of privileges if combined with other vulnerabilities (especially backend authorization weaknesses).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Never Trust the Client:** Understand that `react-admin`'s client-side permission checks are *solely* for user experience.  They are *not* a security mechanism.
*   **Consistent Permissions:** Ensure *perfect* synchronization between `react-admin`'s permission definitions (which affect the UI) and the backend's *independent* authorization logic.  Any discrepancy is a potential vulnerability.

## Attack Surface: [Weak `authProvider` Implementation (Within `react-admin`)](./attack_surfaces/weak__authprovider__implementation__within__react-admin__.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities *within* the `react-admin` `authProvider`'s code or configuration, impacting how authentication and authorization are handled *within the `react-admin` application*.

**How `react-admin` Contributes:** The `authProvider` is a *core* `react-admin` component.  Its implementation and configuration are entirely within the scope of `react-admin`'s attack surface.

**Example:** The `authProvider` stores authentication tokens insecurely within the browser (e.g., in `localStorage` without encryption), making them vulnerable to theft.  Or, the `authProvider` fails to properly invalidate sessions on logout, allowing an attacker to reuse a previously valid session.

**Impact:** Complete account takeover within the `react-admin` context; unauthorized access to all `react-admin` resources.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Secure Token Storage:** Use *secure* storage mechanisms for authentication tokens (e.g., HTTP-only, secure cookies).  *Never* store sensitive tokens in `localStorage` without additional protection.
*   **Proper Session Management:** Implement robust session management *within the `authProvider`*, including secure session IDs, timeouts, and *guaranteed* session invalidation on logout.
*   **Follow Best Practices:** Adhere to OWASP guidelines for authentication and authorization *specifically within the context of the `authProvider`'s implementation*.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly Affecting `react-admin`)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_affecting__react-admin__.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in `react-admin` itself or its *direct* dependencies, exploitable through the `react-admin` application.

**How `react-admin` Contributes:** `react-admin` is a software package with its own dependencies.  Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact the security of applications built with `react-admin`.

**Example:** An outdated version of `react-admin` itself contains a known vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass authentication.  Or, a direct dependency of `react-admin` has a critical vulnerability that can be exploited through the `react-admin` interface.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability; can range from XSS to remote code execution, all impacting the `react-admin` application.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Regular Updates:** Keep `react-admin` and *all* its dependencies up-to-date.  Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify vulnerable packages.  This is *crucial*.
*   **Dependency Monitoring:** Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to *continuously* monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities.  This provides proactive protection.
