## Attack Tree Path: [1. DataProvider Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/1__dataprovider_bypass.md)

*   **1a. Improperly Implemented DataProvider `[HIGH RISK]` `[CRITICAL]`**

    *   **Description:** The custom `dataProvider` code contains flaws that allow unauthorized data access or manipulation. This is the most direct attack vector against a React-Admin application's data layer.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The `dataProvider` methods (e.g., `getList`, `getOne`, `update`, `create`, `delete`) do not verify if the requesting user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation on the specified resource. An attacker could request data they shouldn't have access to by manipulating the parameters (e.g., IDs, filters) sent to the `dataProvider`.
        *   **Injection Vulnerabilities:** If the `dataProvider` interacts directly with a database (more common with custom backends), it might be vulnerable to:
            *   **SQL Injection:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `dataProvider`'s queries, allowing them to bypass authentication, retrieve arbitrary data, modify data, or even execute commands on the database server.
            *   **NoSQL Injection:** Similar to SQL injection, but targeting NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB). The attacker injects malicious code into queries to bypass security checks or retrieve unauthorized data.
        *   **Improper File Handling:** If the `dataProvider` handles file uploads or downloads, it might be vulnerable to:
            *   **Path Traversal:** The attacker manipulates file paths to access files outside the intended directory, potentially accessing sensitive system files or configuration files.
            *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The attacker uploads malicious files (e.g., web shells) that can be executed on the server.
        *   **Logic Flaws:** The `dataProvider`'s logic might contain flaws that allow attackers to bypass intended restrictions or access data in unintended ways. This is highly specific to the implementation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. AuthProvider Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/2__authprovider_bypass.md)

*   **2a. Improperly Implemented AuthProvider `[HIGH RISK]` `[CRITICAL]`**

    *   **Description:** The custom `authProvider` code contains flaws that allow attackers to bypass authentication or assume the identity of other users. This is the most direct attack vector against a React-Admin application's authentication and authorization layer.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Weak Authentication Mechanisms:**
            *   **Weak Password Hashing:** Using weak or outdated hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1) or not using salts makes passwords vulnerable to cracking.
            *   **Insecure Password Storage:** Storing passwords in plain text or using reversible encryption.
        *   **Vulnerable Login Flow:**
            *   **Session Fixation:** The attacker sets a user's session ID before they log in, allowing the attacker to hijack the session after the user authenticates.
            *   **Predictable Session IDs:** Using easily guessable session IDs.
            *   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The login form is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery, allowing an attacker to trick a user into logging in with the attacker's credentials.
        *   **Improper Password Reset:**
            *   **Weak Token Generation:** Using predictable or easily guessable tokens for password reset.
            *   **Token Leakage:** Exposing password reset tokens in URLs or logs.
            *   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** Allowing attackers to brute-force password reset tokens.
        *   **Incorrect Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
            *   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with limited privileges can gain higher privileges due to flaws in the RBAC implementation.
            *   **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:** A user can access resources belonging to another user with the same privilege level.
        *   **Improper Token Validation:** The `authProvider` doesn't properly validate authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs), allowing attackers to forge or modify tokens.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Data Provider (Indirect Attack)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_data_provider__indirect_attack_.md)

*   **B1. Bypass Data Provider Auth - Insufficient Auth Checks (e.g., JWT) `[HIGH RISK]`**

    *   **Description:** The backend API that the `dataProvider` interacts with does not properly validate authentication tokens or enforce authorization rules. This is an indirect attack, targeting the backend rather than React-Admin directly, but it's facilitated by the `dataProvider`'s interaction with the API.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Missing or Weak Token Validation:** The backend API doesn't verify the signature, expiration, or issuer of JWTs, allowing attackers to use forged or expired tokens.
        *   **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The API doesn't check if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource or perform the requested action.
        *   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The API allows users to access resources by directly specifying their IDs without proper authorization checks. An attacker could change the ID in a request to access data belonging to another user.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
