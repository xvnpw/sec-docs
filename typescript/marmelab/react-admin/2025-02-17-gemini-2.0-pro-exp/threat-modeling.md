# Threat Model Analysis for marmelab/react-admin

## Threat: [DataProvider Impersonation for Credential Theft](./threats/dataprovider_impersonation_for_credential_theft.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript file that mimics a legitimate DataProvider. They then use a separate vulnerability (e.g., a compromised CDN, a man-in-the-middle attack, or a dependency confusion attack) to replace the legitimate DataProvider with their malicious version. When the `react-admin` application initializes, it loads the attacker's DataProvider, which intercepts authentication requests and sends user credentials to the attacker's server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts. The attacker gains access to all data and functionality available to the compromised users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `DataProvider` (specifically, the loaded JavaScript file implementing the DataProvider interface).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Integrity:** Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all JavaScript files, including the DataProvider.
        *   **Secure Build Pipeline:** Implement a secure build and deployment process.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use a strict CSP to limit script sources.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Carefully vet all dependencies.
        *   **Network Security:** Use HTTPS and consider certificate pinning.

## Threat: [AuthProvider Manipulation for Session Hijacking](./threats/authprovider_manipulation_for_session_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a custom AuthProvider (e.g., improper handling of session tokens, predictable token generation) to either steal a valid user's session token or generate a valid token for themselves. They then use this token to impersonate the user.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application with the privileges of the compromised user. Potential for data breaches, data modification, and other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `AuthProvider` (specifically, the `login`, `checkAuth`, `getPermissions`, and `logout` methods).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Token Handling:** Use a well-vetted library for authentication (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
        *   **HttpOnly and Secure Cookies:** Store tokens securely.
        *   **Token Expiration and Rotation:** Implement short-lived tokens and rotation.
        *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all input to the AuthProvider.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews.

## Threat: [DataProvider Request Modification via MITM (High Severity Case)](./threats/dataprovider_request_modification_via_mitm__high_severity_case_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker uses a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept and modify requests *between* the `react-admin` application and the DataProvider.  They alter `create` or `update` requests to inject malicious data *that bypasses client-side validation* and could exploit vulnerabilities in the backend if the backend is not properly secured.  This is *high* severity because it relies on a combination of a MITM attack *and* a lack of robust server-side validation/sanitization.
    *   **Impact:**  Data corruption/manipulation.  Potential for code execution or other severe vulnerabilities on the backend *if* the backend is not properly secured.
    *   **Affected Component:** `DataProvider` (all methods, but particularly `create`, `update`, `updateMany`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS (Mandatory):** Use HTTPS for all communication.
        *   **Certificate Pinning (Optional, High Security):** Consider certificate pinning.
        *   **Backend Authorization and Validation (Mandatory):** The backend API *must* perform authorization and *thorough input validation and sanitization* on *every* request.  This is the primary defense.

## Threat: [Elevation of Privilege via AuthProvider Bypass](./threats/elevation_of_privilege_via_authprovider_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers a flaw in the custom `AuthProvider`'s `checkAuth` or `getPermissions` methods. For example, the `checkAuth` method might incorrectly return `true` (indicating the user is authenticated) even when the user is not, or the `getPermissions` method might return elevated permissions that the user should not have.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to resources and functionality, potentially with administrative privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:** `AuthProvider` (`checkAuth` and `getPermissions` methods).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices.
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
        *   **Server-Side Authorization (Mandatory):** *Never* rely solely on the `AuthProvider` for authorization. The backend API *must* perform its own checks.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular audits and penetration testing.
