# Threat Model Analysis for marmelab/react-admin

## Threat: [Insecure Data Provider Implementation](./threats/insecure_data_provider_implementation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in a *custom-built* `dataProvider` to access, modify, or delete data they are not authorized to interact with. This directly involves the developer's implementation of React-Admin's data fetching mechanism and how it interacts with the backend. Flaws in this implementation can bypass intended backend security checks.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data corruption, or complete data loss.

**Affected Component:** `dataProvider` (specifically custom implementations).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test custom `dataProvider` implementations.
*   Ensure the `dataProvider` enforces proper authorization and data filtering based on user roles and permissions.
*   Avoid performing complex business logic within the `dataProvider`; delegate this to the backend API.
*   Sanitize and validate data received from the backend API before using it in the React-Admin application.

## Threat: [Insecure Authentication Provider Implementation](./threats/insecure_authentication_provider_implementation.md)

**Description:** A *custom* `authProvider` might be implemented with vulnerabilities, such as storing authentication tokens insecurely (e.g., in local storage without proper protection against XSS) or failing to properly validate tokens. This directly relates to how developers configure React-Admin's authentication mechanism. An attacker could exploit these weaknesses to impersonate legitimate users.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application and its data, potentially leading to data breaches or malicious actions performed under the guise of a legitimate user.

**Affected Component:** `authProvider` (specifically custom implementations).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow security best practices when implementing custom authentication providers.
*   Utilize secure storage mechanisms for authentication tokens (e.g., HttpOnly cookies).
*   Implement robust token validation and revocation mechanisms.
*   Consider using well-established and tested authentication libraries or services.

## Threat: [Insufficient Role and Permission Management](./threats/insufficient_role_and_permission_management.md)

**Description:** If React-Admin's role and permission system (managed through the `authProvider`) is not configured correctly, users might gain access to features or data they are not authorized to use. This directly involves how developers utilize React-Admin's built-in features for access control. An attacker could exploit these misconfigurations to perform actions beyond their intended privileges.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive features or data, potential data modification or deletion.

**Affected Component:** `authProvider`, routing logic, conditional rendering within components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully define and implement roles and permissions within the `authProvider`.
*   Ensure that access control is consistently enforced across all views and actions.
*   Regularly review and audit role assignments and permissions.
*   Implement both frontend and backend authorization checks.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Custom Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_custom_components.md)

**Description:** Developers might introduce XSS vulnerabilities when creating *custom* React components used within the React-Admin interface, especially when rendering user-provided data without proper sanitization. This is directly related to how developers extend React-Admin's UI. An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the application.

**Affected Component:** Custom React components, any component rendering user-provided data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize user-provided data before rendering it in custom components.
*   Utilize React's built-in mechanisms for preventing XSS (e.g., avoiding `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` where possible).
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of User Input in Forms](./threats/insecure_handling_of_user_input_in_forms.md)

**Description:** While React-Admin provides form components, developers need to ensure proper validation and sanitization of user input *before sending it to the backend*. This involves how developers utilize React-Admin's form elements. Failure to do so can lead to vulnerabilities that, while often manifesting on the backend, are facilitated by the frontend's lack of input handling.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data access, potential server-side command execution (depending on backend vulnerabilities).

**Affected Component:** Form components (`<SimpleForm>`, `<Edit>`, `<Create>`, custom input components).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation on both the client-side (using React-Admin's form validation features) and the backend.
*   Sanitize user input on the backend before processing it.
*   Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection on the backend.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in React-Admin Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_react-admin_dependencies.md)

**Description:** React-Admin relies on various third-party libraries, which might contain known vulnerabilities. This is a direct consequence of using the React-Admin framework and its dependency tree. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are not patched.

**Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including XSS, remote code execution, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The entire React-Admin application, as it relies on these dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update React-Admin and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Utilize tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities in the used libraries.
