## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Data Not Intended for UI](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_data_not_intended_for_ui.md)

**Malicious API Response Injection -> Expose Sensitive Data Not Intended for UI (Data Breach):**
*   Attack Vector: An attacker intercepts or manipulates API responses destined for the React-Admin application. By injecting malicious data, they can cause the application to inadvertently display sensitive information that was not intended for the user interface, leading to a data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Unauthorized Requests due to Misconfigured Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/send_unauthorized_requests_due_to_misconfigured_permissions.md)

**GraphQL/REST API Manipulation via React-Admin Features -> Send Unauthorized Requests due to Misconfigured Permissions (Unauthorized Access/Modification):**
*   Attack Vector: Attackers leverage React-Admin's built-in features for filtering, sorting, or pagination to craft API requests that bypass client-side validation or exploit misconfigured backend permissions. This allows them to access or modify data they are not authorized to interact with.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Files](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_files.md)

**Insecure Handling of File Uploads/Downloads -> Upload Malicious Files (Server Compromise/Malware):**
*   Attack Vector: If React-Admin is used to handle file uploads without proper server-side validation and security measures, an attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., scripts, executables) that could compromise the server or be distributed to other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Unauthorized Files](./attack_tree_paths/access_unauthorized_files.md)

**Insecure Handling of File Uploads/Downloads -> Access Unauthorized Files (Data Breach):**
*   Attack Vector: If file download functionality is not properly secured, attackers might be able to manipulate requests to access files they are not authorized to download, leading to a data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Local Storage/Cookies related to Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_local_storagecookies_related_to_authentication.md)

**Bypass Authentication Logic -> Manipulate Local Storage/Cookies related to Authentication (Account Takeover):**
*   Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to manipulate client-side storage mechanisms (like local storage or cookies) where authentication tokens or session identifiers might be stored. By altering or stealing these values, they can bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to a user's account.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Authentication Providers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_authentication_providers.md)

**Bypass Authentication Logic -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Authentication Providers (Account Takeover/System Compromise):**
*   Attack Vector: If the React-Admin application uses a custom-built authentication provider, vulnerabilities within that provider (e.g., flaws in password reset mechanisms, insecure token generation) can be exploited to bypass authentication and potentially compromise user accounts or even the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Admin Functionality without Proper Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/access_admin_functionality_without_proper_authorization.md)

**Privilege Escalation -> Access Admin Functionality without Proper Authorization (System Compromise/Data Breach):**
*   Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to elevate their privileges within the application. This could involve manipulating UI elements, crafting API requests, or exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to administrative functionalities or data they are not supposed to access, potentially leading to system compromise or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Session Tokens through XSS](./attack_tree_paths/steal_session_tokens_through_xss.md)

**Session Hijacking via Client-Side Vulnerabilities -> Steal Session Tokens through XSS (Account Takeover):**
*   Attack Vector: By exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application that can steal users' session tokens (often stored in cookies). With the stolen session token, they can hijack the user's session and impersonate them, leading to account takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Scripts via API Responses](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_scripts_via_api_responses.md)

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Rendered by React-Admin Components -> Inject Malicious Scripts via API Responses (Account Takeover/Data Theft):**
*   Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into data that is subsequently rendered by React-Admin components without proper sanitization. When a user views this data, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, leading to account takeover or data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Handling of User-Generated Content (if displayed via React-Admin)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_handling_of_user-generated_content__if_displayed_via_react-admin_.md)

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Rendered by React-Admin Components -> Exploit Insecure Handling of User-Generated Content (if displayed via React-Admin) (Account Takeover/Data Theft):**
*   Attack Vector: If the React-Admin application displays user-generated content without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious scripts into their submitted content. When other users view this content, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially leading to account takeover or data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [XSS Vulnerabilities in Custom Components](./attack_tree_paths/xss_vulnerabilities_in_custom_components.md)

**Vulnerabilities in Custom React Components -> XSS Vulnerabilities in Custom Components (Account Takeover/Data Theft):**
*   Attack Vector: Security flaws, specifically Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, are present in custom React components developed for the React-Admin application. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to inject malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers, leading to account takeover or data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Checks in Data Fetching Logic](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_checks_in_data_fetching_logic.md)

**Security Flaws in Custom Data Providers or Hooks -> Bypass Security Checks in Data Fetching Logic (Unauthorized Data Access/Manipulation):**
*   Attack Vector: Custom data providers or hooks, responsible for fetching data from the backend, contain security flaws that allow attackers to bypass intended security checks. This enables them to access or manipulate data they should not have access to.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Data through Custom Data Providers](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_data_through_custom_data_providers.md)

**Security Flaws in Custom Data Providers or Hooks -> Expose Sensitive Data through Custom Data Providers (Data Breach):**
*   Attack Vector: Custom data providers or hooks are implemented in a way that inadvertently exposes sensitive data that should not be accessible to the client-side application or is handled insecurely during the data fetching process, leading to a data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Exploit Authentication and Authorization Flaws:**
*   Description: This represents a fundamental weakness in the application's security. Successful exploitation at this node allows attackers to bypass identity verification and access control mechanisms, granting them unauthorized entry and the ability to perform actions as legitimate users or gain elevated privileges. This is a critical point because it unlocks numerous subsequent attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Rendering and Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_rendering_and_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Client-Side Rendering and Logic Vulnerabilities:**
*   Description: This node highlights vulnerabilities in how the React-Admin application renders data and executes client-side logic. Specifically, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within this category are critical because they allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and other severe consequences, making it a critical point of compromise.
