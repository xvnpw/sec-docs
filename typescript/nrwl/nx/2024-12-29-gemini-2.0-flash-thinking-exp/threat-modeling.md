### High and Critical Nx-Specific Threats

*   **Threat:** Cross-Project Build Artifact Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the build process of one project within the Nx monorepo and injects malicious code into its build artifacts. Due to shared build infrastructure or misconfigured dependencies managed by Nx, these tampered artifacts are then used as dependencies by other projects during their build process orchestrated by Nx.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of multiple applications or libraries within the monorepo, potentially leading to widespread service disruption, data breaches, or supply chain attacks within the organization.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx Task Runner, Project Graph, Build Caching
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and isolation for build processes of different projects.
        *   Utilize Nx's project boundaries and enforce them strictly to limit dependency access and build artifact sharing.
        *   Implement integrity checks and signing for build artifacts.
        *   Regularly audit build configurations and dependencies managed by Nx for all projects.
        *   Consider using separate build agents or environments for sensitive projects.
*   **Threat:** Exposure of Secrets via Shared Nx Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a shared Nx configuration file (e.g., `nx.json`, `workspace.json`) that inadvertently contains sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or internal service URLs. This access could be due to misconfigured permissions or a compromised developer environment. The Nx CLI is used to read and interpret these configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, data breaches, or the ability to impersonate internal services.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx Configuration Files (`nx.json`, `workspace.json`), Nx CLI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in Nx configuration files.
        *   Utilize environment variables or dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and reference them in Nx configurations.
        *   Implement strict access controls on Nx configuration files.
        *   Regularly audit Nx configuration files for sensitive information.
        *   Educate developers on secure secret management practices.
*   **Threat:** Malicious Nx Plugin Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability in a third-party or custom Nx plugin used within the monorepo. They exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Nx CLI or the build process managed by Nx.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the development environment, injection of malicious code into build artifacts, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx Plugins system, specific vulnerable plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit third-party Nx plugins before installation.
        *   Prefer well-established and reputable plugins with active maintenance.
        *   Keep Nx and its plugins updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing plugin code changes and security advisories.
        *   Consider using a plugin security scanner if available.
*   **Threat:** Build Script Injection via Nx Task Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the configuration of an Nx task (e.g., within `project.json`) to inject malicious commands that are executed during the task's execution by the Nx Task Runner. This could be achieved through compromising a developer's environment or exploiting a vulnerability in a tool that modifies these configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the build environment, injection of malicious code into build artifacts, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx Task Runner, Project Configuration (`project.json`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate any user-provided input used in Nx task commands or arguments.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when defining custom Nx tasks.
        *   Implement code review for changes to Nx task configurations.
        *   Restrict permissions for modifying project configuration files.
