**Threat Model: NX Monorepo Application - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes**

**Attacker Goal:** Execute arbitrary code on the build/development environment or deployed application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the NX framework or its configuration.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise NX Application **CRITICAL NODE**
    * OR
        * Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities **HIGH RISK PATH START**
            * OR
                * Inject Malicious Code During Build **CRITICAL NODE**
                    * AND
                        * Compromise Build Scripts (e.g., `project.json`, `package.json`, custom scripts) **CRITICAL NODE**
                        * Inject Malicious Dependencies **HIGH RISK PATH CONTINUES**
        * Exploit NX Plugin Vulnerabilities **HIGH RISK PATH START**
        * Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities **HIGH RISK PATH START**
            * OR
                * Manipulate `nx.json` Configuration **CRITICAL NODE**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise NX Application:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved control over the application or its environment.
* **Inject Malicious Code During Build:** This is a critical point because successfully injecting malicious code during the build process can directly lead to the attacker's goal. The injected code can be executed in the build environment or become part of the final application artifact.
* **Compromise Build Scripts (e.g., `project.json`, `package.json`, custom scripts):** Build scripts define the steps and dependencies involved in building the application. Compromising these scripts allows the attacker to insert malicious commands, modify dependencies, or alter the build process in other harmful ways.
* **Manipulate `nx.json` Configuration:** The `nx.json` file is the central configuration file for an NX workspace. Gaining write access and manipulating this file allows an attacker to change critical settings, potentially introducing vulnerabilities like insecure caching mechanisms or enabling remote code execution capabilities.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities:** This path focuses on compromising the integrity of the application build process. Attackers can leverage various techniques within this path:
    * **Inject Malicious Code During Build:** As detailed above, this involves inserting malicious code into the build pipeline.
    * **Inject Malicious Dependencies:** This involves introducing malicious or compromised third-party libraries into the project's dependencies. This can be done through:
        * **Exploiting Dependency Confusion:**  Tricking the build system into downloading a malicious package from a public repository instead of the intended private one.
        * **Introducing Vulnerable Dependencies:** Intentionally adding dependencies with known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited later.
        * **Tampering with Lock Files:** Modifying lock files to force the installation of specific, potentially malicious, versions of dependencies.
* **Exploit NX Plugin Vulnerabilities:** NX is extensible through plugins. This high-risk path involves exploiting vulnerabilities within these plugins.
    * **Identify Vulnerable NX Plugin:** The attacker first needs to identify a plugin used by the application that has known security flaws.
    * **Trigger Vulnerability During Build or Development:** Once a vulnerable plugin is identified, the attacker attempts to trigger the vulnerability during the build or development process, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious actions.
* **Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities:** This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the application's configuration.
    * **Manipulate `nx.json` Configuration:** As detailed above, this involves gaining unauthorized access to and modifying the `nx.json` file to introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Exploit Environment-Specific Configuration Issues:** This involves targeting vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations in the development, testing, or CI/CD environments. This can include:
        * **Target Development or CI/CD Environment:** Attackers may specifically target these less hardened environments as stepping stones to compromise the production application.
        * **Leverage Misconfigured Environment Variables or Secrets Management:** Exploiting insecurely stored secrets or misconfigured environment variables to gain access or influence the application's behavior.
