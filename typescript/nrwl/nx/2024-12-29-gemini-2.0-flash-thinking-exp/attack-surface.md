- **Attack Surface:** Manipulation of Nx build scripts (`project.json`)
    - **Description:** Attackers modify the build, test, or lint scripts within `project.json` files to inject malicious commands.
    - **How Nx Contributes:** Nx relies heavily on `project.json` for defining build processes and task execution. This central configuration point becomes a prime target.
    - **Example:** An attacker modifies the build script to download and execute a malicious script before the actual build process starts.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or build server, potentially leading to data theft, supply chain compromise, or deployment of backdoors.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement strict code review processes for changes to `project.json` files.
        - Utilize version control and track changes to these files meticulously.
        - Restrict write access to `project.json` files to authorized personnel only.
        - Consider using tooling to validate the integrity and contents of build scripts.

- **Attack Surface:** Compromised Nx Plugins (Custom or Third-Party)
    - **Description:** Vulnerabilities or malicious code within custom or third-party Nx plugins are exploited to gain control over the build process or access sensitive information.
    - **How Nx Contributes:** Nx's extensibility through plugins allows for custom functionality, but also introduces the risk of relying on potentially insecure external code.
    - **Example:** A vulnerable plugin used for code generation is exploited to inject malicious code into generated files.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, access to sensitive data, manipulation of build outputs, and potential compromise of the entire application.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Thoroughly vet and audit all custom and third-party Nx plugins before use.
        - Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        - Implement a process for reviewing plugin code and understanding their functionality.
        - Consider using only well-established and reputable plugins with active maintenance.
        - Employ sandboxing or isolation techniques for plugin execution if feasible.

- **Attack Surface:** Cache Poisoning (Local or Remote)
    - **Description:** Attackers inject malicious build artifacts into the Nx cache, which are then used in subsequent builds, potentially deploying compromised code.
    - **How Nx Contributes:** Nx's caching mechanism, designed for performance optimization, can become a vector for injecting malicious artifacts if not properly secured. This applies to both local and remote (e.g., Nx Cloud) caching.
    - **Example:** An attacker gains access to the local or remote cache and replaces a legitimate build output with a backdoored version.
    - **Impact:** Deployment of compromised code, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further exploitation of the production environment.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Secure access to the local Nx cache directory with appropriate file system permissions.
        - If using remote caching (e.g., Nx Cloud), ensure strong authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.
        - Implement integrity checks or signatures for cached artifacts to detect tampering.
        - Regularly clear the cache or implement a cache invalidation strategy if suspicious activity is detected.

- **Attack Surface:** Dependency Confusion Attacks
    - **Description:** Attackers introduce malicious packages with the same name as internal dependencies, leading to the inclusion of compromised code during the build process.
    - **How Nx Contributes:** Nx manages dependencies within the monorepo. If internal package names are not carefully managed and protected, they can be targeted by dependency confusion attacks.
    - **Example:** An attacker publishes a malicious package on a public registry with the same name as an internal Nx library, and the build system inadvertently pulls the malicious version.
    - **Impact:** Inclusion of malicious code in the application, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized access, or other security breaches.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Utilize private package registries for internal dependencies.
        - Implement strong naming conventions and prefixes for internal packages to avoid naming collisions.
        - Configure package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm) to prioritize private registries and restrict access to public registries for internal dependencies.
        - Employ dependency scanning tools to detect and prevent the inclusion of unexpected or malicious packages.
