# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nrwl/nx

## Mitigation Strategy: [Centralized Dependency Auditing using Nx Workspace](./mitigation_strategies/centralized_dependency_auditing_using_nx_workspace.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1: Run Audit at Workspace Root:** Execute `npm audit` or `yarn audit` from the root of your Nx workspace. This command will analyze the entire dependency tree of your monorepo, including all applications and libraries.
    2.  **Step 2: Analyze Workspace-Wide Audit Report:** Review the generated audit report, which provides a consolidated view of vulnerabilities across all projects in the workspace.
    3.  **Step 3: Leverage Nx Affected Commands for Targeted Updates:** Utilize Nx's `nx affected:dep-graph` or `nx affected:apps` commands to identify which applications and libraries are affected by a vulnerable dependency. This allows for targeted updates and testing, minimizing the scope of changes and regression risks.
    4.  **Step 4: Update Dependencies and Re-audit:** Update vulnerable dependencies using `npm update <package-name>` or `yarn upgrade <package-name>` and re-run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to verify the vulnerabilities are resolved across the workspace.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies in Monorepo (High Severity):** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in shared dependencies used across multiple applications and libraries within the Nx monorepo. This centralized vulnerability can have a widespread impact.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies in Monorepo:** Significantly Reduces risk by providing a centralized and efficient way to identify and remediate vulnerabilities across the entire Nx workspace, leveraging Nx tooling to target affected projects.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially Partially Implemented. Developers might be running `npm audit` or `yarn audit` locally, but it might not be a formalized process or integrated into CI/CD pipelines for workspace-wide auditing. Nx affected commands might not be consistently used for targeted updates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated workspace-wide dependency auditing in CI/CD. Formalized process for reviewing and addressing workspace audit reports. Consistent use of Nx affected commands to manage updates and minimize regression risks when fixing vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Nx Cloud Configuration and Access (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_nx_cloud_configuration_and_access__if_applicable_.md)

    *   **Data Breaches via Nx Cloud (Medium Severity):** While Nx Cloud is a managed service, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in access control could potentially lead to data breaches or exposure of sensitive build information.
    *   **Compromised Nx Cloud API Tokens (High Severity):**  Compromised API tokens can grant attackers full access to the Nx Cloud workspace, allowing them to potentially manipulate builds, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Nx Cloud Workspace:** Moderately Reduces risk by controlling access and monitoring activity within Nx Cloud.
    *   **Data Breaches via Nx Cloud:** Moderately Reduces risk by implementing proper access controls and staying informed about Nx Cloud security practices.
    *   **Compromised Nx Cloud API Tokens:** Significantly Reduces risk by enforcing secure management of Nx Cloud API tokens and secrets.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially Partially Implemented (If Nx Cloud is used). Basic access control might be configured, but more granular RBAC, secure API token management, and active log monitoring might be missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of granular RBAC in Nx Cloud. Secure secret management for Nx Cloud API tokens in CI/CD. Regular review of Nx Cloud access logs and audit trails. Formal process for staying updated on Nx Cloud security best practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Workspace Configuration Files (nx.json, workspace.json)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_workspace_configuration_files__nx_json__workspace_json_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Step 1: Restrict Access to Configuration Files:** Limit write access to `nx.json` and `workspace.json` (or `angular.json` for Angular workspaces) to authorized personnel only. Use file system permissions and version control access controls to enforce this.
    2.  **Step 2: Code Review Changes to Configuration Files:** Implement mandatory code reviews for any changes to `nx.json` and `workspace.json`. Focus on reviewing changes for unintended security implications, such as modified build scripts, altered task configurations, or changes to plugin configurations.
    3.  **Step 3: Avoid Storing Secrets in Configuration Files:** Never store sensitive information like API keys, credentials, or environment-specific secrets directly in `nx.json` or `workspace.json`. Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management systems for sensitive data.
    4.  **Step 4: Regularly Audit Configuration Files:** Periodically audit `nx.json` and `workspace.json` to ensure they are configured securely and according to best practices. Look for any unexpected or unauthorized modifications.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Workspace Configuration Tampering (Medium to High Severity):** Malicious actors or compromised accounts could modify `nx.json` or `workspace.json` to inject malicious build scripts, alter task execution, or disable security features, potentially compromising the entire monorepo and its applications.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Configuration Files (High Severity):**  Accidental or intentional storage of secrets in configuration files can lead to direct exposure of sensitive credentials if these files are accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Workspace Configuration Tampering:** Moderately to Significantly Reduces risk by controlling access and reviewing changes to critical workspace configuration files.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Configuration Files:** Significantly Reduces risk by preventing the storage of secrets in configuration files, eliminating a direct exposure vector.
