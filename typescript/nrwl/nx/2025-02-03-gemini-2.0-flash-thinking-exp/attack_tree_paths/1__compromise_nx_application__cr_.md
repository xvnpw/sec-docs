### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise NX Application [CR]

**Attack Tree Path:**

**1. Compromise NX Application [CR]**

This high-level goal represents the attacker's ultimate objective: gaining unauthorized control over the NX application.  To achieve this, the attacker needs to exploit vulnerabilities at various levels. We will decompose this path into more specific attack vectors.

**Decomposed Attack Paths & Vectors:**

To compromise an NX application, an attacker could target various aspects. We can categorize these into several key areas:

**1.1. Exploit Application-Level Vulnerabilities [CR]**

* **1.1.1. Web Application Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) [CR]:**
