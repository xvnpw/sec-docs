# Threat Model Analysis for nrwl/nx

## Threat: [Shared Build Artifacts & Cache Poisoning](./threats/shared_build_artifacts_&_cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the shared Nx build cache. They might inject malicious artifacts into the cache, which are then used in subsequent builds of different applications. This could be done by gaining access to the build server, compromising a build agent, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the caching mechanism itself. This threat is directly related to Nx's caching feature.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into multiple application builds, supply chain compromise, potential for widespread application compromise.
*   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx Build Cache, Build Infrastructure
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the build environment and infrastructure, including access controls and monitoring.
    *   Implement integrity checks for build artifacts and caches (e.g., checksums, signatures).
    *   Regularly audit and clean build caches.
    *   Consider using isolated build environments for sensitive projects to minimize cache sharing.
    *   Implement access controls to the build cache storage.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Nx CLI or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_nx_cli_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in the Nx CLI itself or its dependencies (Node.js, npm/yarn, etc.). This could be done by targeting developers' machines or the build environment. Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution during development or build processes. This threat is directly related to the Nx CLI and its dependency management.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of developer machines, build environment compromise, potential for injecting malicious code into applications during build.
*   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx CLI, Nx Dependencies, Development Environment, Build Environment
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Nx CLI and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Regularly scan Nx CLI and project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   Use dependency management tools to ensure consistent and secure dependency versions.
    *   Educate developers on the risks of outdated dependencies and the importance of keeping their development environments secure.

## Threat: [Command Injection in Nx Scripts or Tasks](./threats/command_injection_in_nx_scripts_or_tasks.md)

*   **Description:** If Nx scripts or custom tasks dynamically construct commands using external inputs without proper sanitization, they become vulnerable to command injection. An attacker could manipulate these inputs to execute arbitrary commands on the build server or developer machine. This threat is directly related to how Nx allows defining and executing custom scripts and tasks.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, compromise of build server or developer machine, potential for data breaches or service disruption.
*   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx Scripts, Custom Tasks, Task Runners
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamically constructing commands based on external inputs whenever possible.
    *   If dynamic command construction is necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent command injection.
    *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell command execution where applicable.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization libraries within Nx scripts and tasks.
