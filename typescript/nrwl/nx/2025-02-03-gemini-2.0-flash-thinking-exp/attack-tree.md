## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise NX Application [CR]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_nx_application__cr_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control over the application and potentially its infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit NX Configuration Vulnerabilities [CR], [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_nx_configuration_vulnerabilities__cr____hr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in how NX configurations (`nx.json`, `workspace.json`, `project.json`) are set up and managed.
    * **Breakdown:**
        * **Misconfigured nx.json [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Targeting the main NX configuration file (`nx.json`) for vulnerabilities.
            * **Breakdown:**
                * **Insecure script execution in tasks [CR], [HR]:**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code into task configurations within `nx.json`, specifically targeting script execution features like pre/post hooks or custom commands.
                    * **How it works:** An attacker could modify `nx.json` (if they gain write access, or through a supply chain attack) to include malicious scripts in task definitions. When these tasks are executed by NX, the malicious scripts will run, potentially granting the attacker code execution on the server or build environment.

        * **Misconfigured workspace.json/angular.json/project.json [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Targeting project-specific configuration files (`workspace.json`, `angular.json`, `project.json`) for vulnerabilities, especially related to build processes.
            * **Breakdown:**
                * **Insecure build configurations [CR], [HR]:**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Modifying build configurations within these files to inject malicious code into the build process.
                    * **How it works:** Attackers could alter build scripts, build steps, or dependency configurations within these files. This could lead to malicious code being injected into the application during the build process, resulting in compromised build artifacts and potentially backdoored applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit NX Code Generation/Schematic Vulnerabilities [CR], [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_nx_code_generationschematic_vulnerabilities__cr____hr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to NX's code generation capabilities, specifically targeting schematics.
    * **Breakdown:**
        * **Malicious Schematics [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Using intentionally malicious or compromised schematics to inject malicious code during code generation.
            * **Breakdown:**
                * **Using untrusted or compromised schematics [CR], [HR]:**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Installing and executing schematics from untrusted sources (e.g., public npm registry without verification, compromised custom repositories).
                    * **How it works:** Attackers could create or compromise schematics and distribute them through package registries or other channels. If developers unknowingly use these malicious schematics, the schematic execution could inject backdoors, steal secrets, or perform other malicious actions during the code generation process.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit NX Dependency Management Vulnerabilities [CR], [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_nx_dependency_management_vulnerabilities__cr____hr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in how NX manages dependencies, particularly in a monorepo context.
    * **Breakdown:**
        * **Vulnerable Dependencies in Monorepo [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies used within the NX monorepo.
            * **Breakdown:**
                * **Shared vulnerable dependencies across multiple projects [CR], [HR]:**
                    * **Attack Vector:** A vulnerability in a dependency that is shared across multiple applications or libraries within the monorepo.
                    * **How it works:** In a monorepo, dependencies are often shared to reduce duplication. If a shared dependency has a vulnerability, it can impact multiple projects simultaneously. Attackers can exploit this single vulnerability to compromise multiple parts of the application at once, amplifying the impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit NX Plugin Vulnerabilities [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_nx_plugin_vulnerabilities__hr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within NX plugins, especially community plugins.
    * **Breakdown:**
        * **Vulnerabilities in NX Community Plugins:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities in plugins developed and maintained by the community.
            * **Breakdown:**
                * **Known vulnerabilities in popular community plugins [CR], [HR]:**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in widely used NX community plugins.
                    * **How it works:** Attackers can monitor public vulnerability databases and security advisories for known vulnerabilities in popular NX plugins. If an application uses a vulnerable plugin version and hasn't applied patches, attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit NX Build/Task Runner Vulnerabilities [CR], [HR]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_nx_buildtask_runner_vulnerabilities__cr____hr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in NX's build and task runner components.
    * **Breakdown:**
        * **Build Process Manipulation [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Gaining control over or manipulating the NX build process to inject malicious code.
            * **Breakdown:**
                * **Inject malicious code into build scripts or tasks [CR], [HR]:**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Directly modifying build scripts or task configurations to inject malicious code that executes during the build process.
                    * **How it works:** Attackers could gain access to build scripts or configuration files (e.g., through compromised developer accounts or CI/CD pipeline vulnerabilities). By modifying these scripts, they can inject malicious code that gets executed as part of the build process, leading to compromised build artifacts and potentially backdoored applications.
