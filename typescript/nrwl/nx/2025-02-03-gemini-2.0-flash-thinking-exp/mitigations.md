# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nrwl/nx

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strict Project Boundaries](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strict_project_boundaries.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Project Boundaries:** Clearly identify and document the intended boundaries between applications and libraries within your Nx workspace.
    2.  **Implement Dependency Constraints in `nx.json`:**  Utilize the `targetDependencies` configuration within `nx.json` to define rules that restrict dependencies between projects.
        *   Use tags to categorize projects.
        *   Define constraints based on these tags to specify allowed dependencies.
        *   Set `enforceBuildableLibDependency: true`.
    3.  **Verify Constraints Locally:** Use the `nx workspace-lint` command locally during development.
    4.  **Enforce Constraints in CI/CD:** Integrate `nx workspace-lint` into your CI/CD pipeline as a mandatory step.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Boundaries:** Periodically review and update project boundaries and dependency constraints.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Lateral Movement (High Severity):** Prevents easy lateral movement within the monorepo after a compromise.
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Accidental Exposure (Medium Severity):** Prevents unintended dependencies between isolated projects.
        *   **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Controls dependency graph and reduces risk from uncontrolled dependencies.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Significantly Reduces.
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Accidental Exposure:** Moderately Reduces.
        *   **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:** Moderately Reduces.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Basic dependency constraints in `nx.json`.
        *   Local `nx workspace-lint` checks are encouraged but not consistently enforced.
        *   CI/CD pipeline includes basic linting, but `nx workspace-lint` for dependency constraints is not yet mandatory.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Full and comprehensive definition of project boundaries.
        *   Mandatory enforcement of `nx workspace-lint` in CI/CD.
        *   Regular scheduled reviews and updates of project boundaries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Dependency Allow Lists and Deny Lists](./mitigation_strategies/implement_dependency_allow_lists_and_deny_lists.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Dependencies:**  For each project, explicitly define a list of allowed dependencies.
    2.  **Implement Allow Lists using Nx Constraints:** In `nx.json`, use `targetDependencies` to create allow lists.
    3.  **Define Deny Lists (if needed):**  Create deny lists to explicitly prevent usage of specific dependencies using negation in `onlyDependOnLibsWithTags` or custom linting rules.
    4.  **Enforce Allow/Deny Lists in CI/CD:** Integrate `nx workspace-lint` (or custom linting scripts) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for violations.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Lists:**  Periodically review and update dependency allow/deny lists.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Limits attack surface by restricting allowed dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Accidental Exposure (Medium Severity):** Prevents unintentional introduction of insecure dependencies.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:** Moderately Reduces.
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Accidental Exposure:** Moderately Reduces.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Implicit allow lists through project boundaries, but explicit allow/deny lists for specific libraries/dependencies are not widely used.
        *   No automated enforcement of dependency allow/deny lists in CI/CD.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Systematic definition of dependency allow lists for critical applications and libraries.
