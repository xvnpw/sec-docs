## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom Generator/Executor Development and Review (Nx-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_generatorexecutor_development_and_review__nx-specific_aspects_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Custom Generator/Executor Development and Review (Nx-Specific Aspects)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Nx-Specific Coding Standards:** Create a document outlining secure coding practices *specifically* for Nx generators and executors, focusing on Nx APIs and functionalities. This should cover:
        *   Safe use of Nx's `exec` and `runExecutor` functions (avoiding command injection).
        *   Proper handling of user-provided inputs within generators (using Nx's schema validation and sanitization features).
        *   Restricted file system access using Nx's utilities (e.g., `readProjectConfiguration`, `updateProjectConfiguration`, `workspaceLayout`).
        *   Secure interaction with the Nx dependency graph (avoiding unintended modifications).
    2.  **Mandatory Code Reviews (Nx-Focused):** Implement mandatory code reviews for all custom generators and executors, with a specific focus on how they interact with Nx APIs and the workspace.
    3.  **Code Review Checklist (Nx-Specific):** Create a checklist for code reviews, focusing on Nx-related security aspects:
        *   Are Nx's `exec` or `runExecutor` used safely (with proper escaping and validation of arguments)?
        *   Are generator inputs properly validated and sanitized using Nx's schema features?
        *   Is file system access limited to necessary locations using Nx's utility functions?
        *   Are modifications to the Nx dependency graph intentional and safe?
        *   Are there any potential code injection vulnerabilities related to how Nx processes user input or configuration?
    4.  **Leverage Nx's Built-in Security Features:** Utilize Nx's built-in features for security, such as:
        *   Schema validation for generator inputs.
        *   `@nrwl/devkit` utilities for safe file system and workspace interactions.
        *   Nx's dependency graph analysis to understand the impact of changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Execution via Generators/Executors (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into generators or executors, which could be executed on developer machines or build servers *through Nx's mechanisms*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (within Nx context) (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage if a generator or executor is compromised, by ensuring it interacts with the Nx workspace in a controlled manner.
    *   **Unintended Workspace Modifications (Medium Severity):** Prevents generators/executors from making unintended or unsafe changes to the Nx workspace configuration or dependency graph.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Code Execution:** Significantly reduces risk (70-80% reduction) with thorough code reviews and secure coding practices focused on Nx APIs.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Nx context):** Reduces risk (40-60% reduction) by limiting the scope of generator/executor actions within the Nx workspace.
    *   **Unintended Workspace Modifications:** Reduces risk (60-70%) by ensuring proper use of Nx's APIs and dependency graph management.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Basic Code Reviews:** Code reviews are performed, but they don't have a specific Nx security focus or checklist.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Nx-Specific Coding Standards Document:** No specific document outlining secure coding practices for generators/executors *in the context of Nx* exists.
    *   **Nx-Focused Code Review Checklist:** The code review process lacks a dedicated security checklist *focused on Nx APIs and features*.
    *   **Full Utilization of Nx's Security Features:**  Not all of Nx's built-in security features (e.g., schema validation) are consistently used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Use of `nx affected` Commands](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_use_of__nx_affected__commands.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Controlled Use of `nx affected` Commands**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Precise Target Specification (with Nx understanding):** Train developers to use specific targets with `nx affected` commands, emphasizing the understanding of Nx's dependency graph and how targets relate to it (e.g., `nx affected:build --target=my-project` instead of `nx affected:build --all`).  Explain how Nx determines affected projects.
    2.  **Documentation and Examples (Nx-Specific):** Provide clear documentation and examples of how to use `nx affected` commands correctly and safely, *specifically within the context of the Nx workspace and its dependency graph*.
    3.  **CI/CD Pipeline Checks (Leveraging Nx):** Implement checks in the CI/CD pipeline to validate the output of `nx affected` commands *using Nx's tools*:
        *   Use `nx affected:graph --file=affected-graph.json` to generate a JSON representation of the affected projects.
        *   Compare the generated graph to an expected baseline or use a script to analyze it for unexpected changes.
        *   Fail the build if an unexpected number of projects are affected or if specific critical projects are unexpectedly included.
        *   Require manual approval for deployments that affect critical projects, *as determined by `nx affected`*.
    4. **`nx.json` Configuration:** Review and refine the `nx.json` configuration, specifically the `targetDefaults` and `tasksRunnerOptions`, to ensure they are optimized for security and efficiency.  For example:
        *   Use `cacheableOperations` carefully to avoid caching operations that should not be cached for security reasons.
        *   Configure `inputs` and `namedInputs` precisely to ensure that `nx affected` correctly identifies affected projects.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Deployments (triggered by Nx) (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidentally deploying untested or broken code to production *due to misusing `nx affected`*.
    *   **Accidental Execution of Malicious Scripts (via Nx) (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of running malicious scripts on a wider range of projects than intended *because of incorrect `nx affected` usage*.
    *   **Performance Degradation (related to Nx builds) (Low Severity):** Avoids unnecessary builds and tests of unaffected projects, improving build times *within the Nx environment*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Deployments:** Reduces risk (50-70% reduction) with careful target specification and CI/CD checks that leverage Nx's output.
    *   **Accidental Execution of Malicious Scripts:** Reduces risk (40-60% reduction) by limiting the scope of `nx affected` commands and validating their output.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Improves build times (variable impact, depending on the size and complexity of the workspace).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Basic Usage:** Developers use `nx affected` commands, but there's no formal training or strict guidelines *specific to Nx's dependency graph*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Precise Target Specification (Consistent Enforcement, Nx-Aware):** Developers are not consistently using precise targets *with a full understanding of Nx's behavior*.
    *   **Documentation and Examples (Comprehensive, Nx-Specific):** Documentation on `nx affected` is limited and doesn't fully explain its interaction with the workspace.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Checks (Leveraging Nx Output):** The CI/CD pipeline doesn't have specific checks to validate the output of `nx affected` commands *using Nx's tools (e.g., `nx affected:graph`)*.
    *  **`nx.json` Optimization:** The `nx.json` configuration is not fully optimized for security and efficiency in relation to `nx affected`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Plugin Selection and Management (Nx Plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_plugin_selection_and_management__nx_plugins_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Plugin Selection and Management (Nx Plugins)**

* **Description:**
    1. **Prefer Official Plugins:** Prioritize using official Nx plugins (`@nrwl/*`) whenever possible. These plugins are generally more thoroughly vetted and maintained.
    2. **Vet Community Plugins (Nx-Specific Focus):** Before using a community plugin:
        * **Examine Source Code:** Review the plugin's source code, paying close attention to how it interacts with Nx APIs, the file system, and external commands. Look for any suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.
        * **Check for Nx-Specific Security Issues:** Search for known vulnerabilities or security issues related to the plugin, specifically in the context of Nx.
        * **Assess Author Reputation:** Investigate the plugin author's reputation and track record within the Nx community.
        * **Review Dependencies:** Analyze the plugin's dependencies for any known vulnerabilities, paying attention to how those dependencies might interact with Nx.
    3. **Regular Plugin Updates (Controlled):** Establish a process for regularly updating Nx plugins, including:
        * Reviewing release notes and changelogs for security fixes *related to Nx*.
        * Testing updates in a development environment *with a focus on Nx functionality*.
        * Updating the lockfile and committing the changes.
        * Running the full CI/CD pipeline, paying close attention to any changes in Nx behavior.
    4. **Monitor Plugin Usage:** Track which plugins are used in your Nx workspace and regularly review this list to ensure that all plugins are still necessary and secure.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Malicious Code Execution via Plugins (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of installing and using a malicious Nx plugin that could execute arbitrary code.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks via Plugins (High Severity):** Limits the attack surface by ensuring that only vetted and trusted plugins are used.
    * **Unintended Workspace Modifications (via Plugins) (Medium Severity):** Prevents plugins from making unintended or unsafe changes to the Nx workspace.

* **Impact:**
    * **Malicious Code Execution:** Significantly reduces risk (70-80% reduction) by carefully vetting and selecting plugins.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Reduces risk (50-70% reduction) by limiting the use of untrusted plugins.
    * **Unintended Workspace Modifications:** Reduces risk (60-70%) by ensuring plugins are well-behaved and interact with Nx safely.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * **Some Official Plugins:** Official `@nrwl/*` plugins are used for core functionality.
* **Missing Implementation:**
    * **Formal Vetting Process for Community Plugins:** No structured process exists for vetting community plugins before use.
    * **Regular Plugin Updates (Controlled, Nx-Focused):** Plugin updates are not performed regularly or with a specific focus on Nx-related security.
    * **Plugin Usage Monitoring:** No formal tracking of which plugins are used and their security status.
