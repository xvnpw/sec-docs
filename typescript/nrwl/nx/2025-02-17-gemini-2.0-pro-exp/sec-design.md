Okay, let's create a design document for the Nx project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Nx is a build system and development tool, aiming to improve developer productivity and code quality, particularly in monorepo setups.  The business priorities and goals it addresses are:

*   Faster Build Times: Reducing the time it takes to build, test, and deploy software. This directly impacts developer productivity and time-to-market.
*   Improved Code Quality: Enforcing consistency, best practices, and code standards across large projects and teams. This reduces bugs and technical debt.
*   Simplified Monorepo Management: Providing tools and structure to manage large, complex codebases in a single repository. This enables code sharing and collaboration.
*   Scalability: Allowing projects to grow without significant performance degradation in build and development processes.
*   Enhanced Collaboration: Facilitating collaboration between developers working on different parts of a large application.
*   Ecosystem Integration: Seamlessly integrating with popular frontend and backend frameworks and tools.

Based on these, the most important business risks that need to be addressed are:

*   Compromise of the Build System: An attacker gaining control of the Nx build system could inject malicious code into applications, leading to widespread compromise.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Vulnerabilities in Nx itself or its dependencies could be exploited to compromise projects using Nx.
*   Data Leakage: Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) stored insecurely within the monorepo or exposed during the build process could be leaked.
*   Unauthorized Code Modification: Developers (or attackers) making unauthorized changes to the codebase, bypassing established controls.
*   Denial of Service: Attacks targeting the build system or its infrastructure, preventing developers from building and deploying software.
*   Inconsistent Security Practices: Different teams or projects within the monorepo applying inconsistent security controls, leading to vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls and accepted risks (based on the public repository and common practices):

*   security control: Code Reviews: Nx promotes code reviews through its structure and tooling (e.g., affected commands). Implemented through pull request workflows in GitHub.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Nx uses package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm) to manage dependencies.  Security relies on the security practices of these package managers and the vigilance of developers in updating dependencies. Described in package.json files and lock files.
*   security control: Linting and Static Analysis: Nx integrates with linters (e.g., ESLint) and static analysis tools to enforce code quality and identify potential security issues. Configured through project configuration files.
*   security control: Testing: Nx encourages unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, which can help identify security vulnerabilities. Configured through project configuration files and testing frameworks.
*   security control: Open Source: Nx is open source, allowing for community scrutiny and contributions to security.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies: Nx relies on numerous third-party dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could impact Nx and projects using it.
*   accepted risk: User Configuration: Nx provides extensive configuration options. Misconfiguration by users could introduce security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Local Development Environment: Nx operates within the developer's local environment. The security of this environment is outside the direct control of Nx.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Integrate SCA tools to automatically scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and provide remediation guidance.
*   Enforce Signed Commits: Require developers to sign their commits, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of code changes.
*   Harden CI/CD Pipelines: Secure the CI/CD pipelines used to build and deploy projects using Nx, including access controls, secret management, and vulnerability scanning.
*   Provide Security Guidelines: Offer clear and comprehensive security guidelines for users on how to securely configure and use Nx.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Not directly applicable to Nx itself, as it's a local development tool. However, authentication is crucial for accessing the source code repository (e.g., GitHub) and any CI/CD systems.
*   Authorization:
    *   Not directly applicable to Nx itself. Authorization is relevant for accessing the source code repository and CI/CD systems, as well as any cloud resources used during deployment.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Nx itself should validate user inputs (e.g., command-line arguments, configuration files) to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Projects built with Nx should implement robust input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
*   Cryptography:
    *   Nx should use secure cryptographic practices when handling sensitive data (e.g., API keys, credentials), if applicable. This is more relevant to projects built *with* Nx than to Nx itself.
    *   Projects built with Nx should use appropriate cryptographic libraries and algorithms for secure communication and data storage.

2.  Containerized Deployment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
3.  Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions)

## BUILD

The build process for Nx projects typically involves the following steps:

1.  Developer writes code and commits changes to the source code repository (GitHub).
2.  A CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered by the commit.
3.  The CI/CD system checks out the code and installs Nx.
4.  Nx analyzes the changes and determines which projects are affected.
5.  Nx runs the build targets for the affected projects (e.g., build, test, lint).
6.  Nx uses its caching mechanism to speed up the build process.
7.  If the build is successful, Nx may create build artifacts (e.g., Docker images, compiled code).
8.  The CI/CD system may then deploy the artifacts to the target environment.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"]
    GitHub["GitHub (Source Code)"]
    CI_CD["CI/CD System (e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    Nx["Nx Build System"]
    Cache["Cache (Local/Remote)"]
    Artifacts["Build Artifacts (e.g., Docker Image)"]
    SCA["SCA Tool"]
    SAST["SAST Tool"]

    Developer -- Commits code --> GitHub
    GitHub -- Triggers --> CI_CD
    CI_CD -- Runs --> Nx

    Nx -- Generates --> Artifacts
    CI_CD -- Scans with --> SCA
    CI_CD -- Scans with --> SAST
    SCA -- Analyzes --> Artifacts
    SAST -- Analyzes --> GitHub

```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyzes source code for potential security issues.
*   Signed Commits: Ensures the integrity and authenticity of code changes.
*   Secure CI/CD Pipeline: Access controls, secret management, pipeline security.
*   Build Artifact Integrity: Ensuring the integrity of build artifacts (e.g., using checksums, signing).
*   Least Privilege: Running build processes with the minimum necessary privileges.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Software Development Lifecycle: The entire process of building, testing, and deploying software.
    *   Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: Automated pipelines for building and deploying software.
    *   Monorepo Management: Managing a large codebase in a single repository.

*   Data to Protect:
    *   Source Code: The intellectual property of the organization. (Sensitivity: High)
    *   Configuration Files: May contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials. (Sensitivity: High)
    *   Build Artifacts: Could contain vulnerabilities or be tampered with. (Sensitivity: High)
    *   Dependencies: Vulnerabilities in dependencies can be exploited. (Sensitivity: High)
    *   Developer Credentials: Access to source code repositories, CI/CD systems, and cloud providers. (Sensitivity: High)

    *   The organization has a process for responding to security vulnerabilities.
    *   The local development environments of developers are reasonably secure.
    *   The deployment environments (e.g., cloud providers) are configured with appropriate security controls.
