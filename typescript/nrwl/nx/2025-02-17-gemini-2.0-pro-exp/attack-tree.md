## Attack Tree Path: [[[Gain Unauthorized Code Execution via Nx]]](./attack_tree_paths/__gain_unauthorized_code_execution_via_nx__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching objective of the attacker. All other nodes in the tree represent steps towards achieving this goal.
*   **Likelihood:** N/A (This is the goal, not an attack step)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies depending on the chosen attack path.
*   **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the chosen attack path.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the chosen attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [==Abuse Nx Task Configuration==](./attack_tree_paths/==abuse_nx_task_configuration==.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that involve manipulating the Nx project or workspace configuration files (e.g., `project.json`, `workspace.json`) to alter the build process or execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [==Overwrite Task==](./attack_tree_paths/==overwrite_task==.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker modifies a task definition in the configuration file to replace it with a malicious command.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strict access controls on configuration files.
    *   Code reviews for all changes to configuration files.
    *   Use Git hooks to enforce policies.
    *   Configuration management system for version control.

## Attack Tree Path: [==Hijack Task==](./attack_tree_paths/==hijack_task==.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious code into an *existing* task's command or arguments, rather than replacing the entire task.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Same as "Overwrite Task."
    *   Sanitize user-provided input used in task configurations.
    *   Avoid direct shell commands; use safer alternatives.

## Attack Tree Path: [==Malicious Dependency==](./attack_tree_paths/==malicious_dependency==.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker introduces a compromised or malicious package as a project dependency, which is then used by an Nx task, leading to code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
    *   Strict dependency vetting process.
    *   Private package registries.
    *   Regular dependency audits.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Compromise Nx Plugins/Executors]]](./attack_tree_paths/__compromise_nx_pluginsexecutors__.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks targeting the Nx plugin ecosystem, either by exploiting vulnerabilities in plugins or compromising the plugin supply chain.
*   **Likelihood:** Varies (Low for supply chain, Medium for vulnerable plugins)
*   **Impact:** Very High (for supply chain attacks), Medium (for vulnerable plugins)
*   **Effort:** Varies (Very High for supply chain, Medium for exploiting vulnerabilities)
*   **Skill Level:** Varies (Expert for supply chain, Intermediate for exploiting vulnerabilities)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (Very Hard for supply chain, Medium for vulnerable plugins)

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Supply Chain Attack on Plugin]]](./attack_tree_paths/__supply_chain_attack_on_plugin__.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker compromises the plugin's source code, build process, or distribution mechanism to inject malicious code. This is a critical, though low-likelihood, threat.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use plugins from trusted sources.
    *   Verify plugin integrity (checksums, signatures).
    *   Monitor plugin repositories for suspicious activity.
    *   Consider private plugin registries.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Compromise Plugin Repo]]](./attack_tree_paths/__compromise_plugin_repo__.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized control of the plugin's source code repository.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Strong access controls, multi-factor authentication, regular security audits for repository access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Social Eng. Plugin Author]]](./attack_tree_paths/__social_eng__plugin_author__.md)

*   **Description:** Tricking the plugin author into committing malicious code or granting access.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Educate authors about social engineering, implement code review processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Plugin Build Process]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_plugin_build_process__.md)

*   **Description:** Compromising the build pipeline or infrastructure used to create and distribute the plugin.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Secure the build pipeline (access controls, monitoring), use a secure build environment.
