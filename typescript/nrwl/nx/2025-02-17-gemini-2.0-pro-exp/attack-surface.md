# Attack Surface Analysis for nrwl/nx

## Attack Surface: [1. Supply Chain Attacks via Dependencies (Nx-Managed)](./attack_surfaces/1__supply_chain_attacks_via_dependencies__nx-managed_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party npm packages managed by Nx within the monorepo.
*   **Nx Contribution:** Nx's dependency management across multiple projects, and its caching mechanisms, directly increase the potential impact and propagation of a compromised package.  Nx's `package.json` handling is central to this risk.
*   **Example:** A project uses a vulnerable version of a library, installed and managed via Nx. An attacker exploits this to gain RCE on the build server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Audits (Automated):** Use `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or `snyk` within the Nx workspace, automated as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Strict Dependency Locking:** Enforce lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) to ensure consistent dependency resolution.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Integrated):** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) into the Nx build process.
    *   **Private Package Registry (Controlled):** Use a private registry to control and vet packages used within the Nx monorepo.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious Code Injection in Nx Build Scripts](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_code_injection_in_nx_build_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into Nx's build configuration files or custom executors.
*   **Nx Contribution:** This is *directly* related to Nx's core functionality of executing build tasks defined in `project.json`, `nx.json`, and custom executors.  The attack surface is the configuration and execution of these scripts.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a `project.json` file within the Nx workspace to include a malicious command that exfiltrates data during the build.
*   **Impact:** RCE, data exfiltration, build system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Code Reviews (Nx Configs):** Enforce rigorous reviews for *all* changes to `project.json`, `nx.json`, and custom executor code.
    *   **Input Validation (Build Scripts):** Sanitize and validate any user-provided or external input used within Nx build scripts.
    *   **Least Privilege (Build Execution):** Run Nx build processes with the least privilege necessary.
    *   **Static Analysis (Nx Configs):** Use static analysis tools to detect potential injection vulnerabilities in Nx configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [3. Compromised Nx Cloud (or Self-Hosted Equivalent)](./attack_surfaces/3__compromised_nx_cloud__or_self-hosted_equivalent_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Nx Cloud or a self-hosted Nx distributed task execution environment.
*   **Nx Contribution:** This attack surface is *entirely* specific to the use of Nx Cloud (or a self-hosted equivalent) for distributed builds.  The vulnerability lies in the communication, authentication, and authorization mechanisms of Nx Cloud.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises an Nx Cloud API key and triggers malicious builds or accesses build artifacts.
*   **Impact:** RCE on build agents, data breaches, build artifact tampering.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication (Nx Cloud):** Use strong passwords and MFA for Nx Cloud accounts.
    *   **API Key Rotation (Nx Cloud):** Regularly rotate Nx Cloud API keys and store them securely.
    *   **Network Security (HTTPS):** Ensure secure communication (HTTPS) between the local environment and Nx Cloud.
    *   **Build Agent Security (Self-Hosted):** Harden the security of self-hosted build agents.
    *   **Least Privilege (Nx Cloud Access):** Configure Nx Cloud access controls to grant only necessary permissions.
    *   **Audit Logging (Nx Cloud):** Enable and monitor audit logs in Nx Cloud.

## Attack Surface: [4. Vulnerable Custom Nx Executors/Generators](./attack_surfaces/4__vulnerable_custom_nx_executorsgenerators.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in custom Nx executors or generators.
*   **Nx Contribution:** This risk is *directly* tied to Nx's extensibility features.  The attack surface is the code within custom executors and generators created for the Nx workspace.
*   **Example:** A custom Nx executor contains a command injection vulnerability, allowing RCE.
*   **Impact:** RCE, data breaches, system compromise (depending on the executor's functionality).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices (Executors/Generators):** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Nx extensions.
    *   **Code Reviews (Nx Extensions):** Thoroughly review all custom executors and generators for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Management (Nx Extensions):** Manage dependencies of custom executors/generators carefully.
    *   **Testing (Nx Extensions):** Write comprehensive tests for custom executors and generators.
    *   **Sandboxing (Consideration):** Consider sandboxing custom executors to limit their access.
