# Threat Model Analysis for nrwl/nx

## Threat: [Malicious Nx Plugin](./threats/malicious_nx_plugin.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Nx Plugin

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious plugin to npm or convinces a developer to install a compromised plugin. The plugin could then inject malicious code during the build, modify project configurations, steal secrets, or perform other harmful actions. The attacker might use social engineering or exploit vulnerabilities in other dependencies to achieve this.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, compromised builds, system compromise.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** `plugins`, `executors`, `generators`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet third-party plugins before installation (source code review, author reputation, security audits).
        *   Use a private registry for internal plugins.
        *   Regularly update plugins.
        *   Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify vulnerabilities.
        *   Employ supply chain security tools (e.g., Socket.dev).

## Threat: [Compromised Nx Core Package](./threats/compromised_nx_core_package.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Nx Core Package

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official `nx` package itself (e.g., through a compromised npm account).  This is a supply chain attack targeting the core of Nx.  The attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed by all users of the compromised version.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread code execution, data breaches, complete system compromise for all users of the affected version.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** `nx` core package, all related modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) for dependency pinning.
        *   Monitor Nx security advisories.
        *   Use package integrity verification tools.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Modification of Configuration Files](./threats/unauthorized_modification_of_configuration_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Modification of Configuration Files

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the repository and modifies `workspace.json`, `nx.json`, or `project.json`. They could change build targets, add malicious dependencies, alter executors, or redirect builds to compromised infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised builds, deployment of malicious code, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** `workspace.json`, `nx.json`, `project.json`, build configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict access controls on the repository (branch protection, code reviews).
        *   Git hooks for configuration file validation.
        *   Regular audits of configuration file changes.
        *   Configuration-as-code approach.

## Threat: [Poisoned Build Cache](./threats/poisoned_build_cache.md)

*   **Threat:** Poisoned Build Cache

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the build cache (local or remote) and replaces legitimate build artifacts with compromised ones.  Subsequent builds using the poisoned cache will incorporate the malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious code, compromised application.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx caching mechanism (local or remote).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure remote cache provider with strong access controls.
        *   Secure local cache directory permissions.
        *   Cache key strategies including source file and dependency hashes.
        *   Regular cache clearing.
        *   Integrity checks on retrieved artifacts (if supported).

## Threat: [Dependency Hijacking within Monorepo](./threats/dependency_hijacking_within_monorepo.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Hijacking within Monorepo

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises one project within the monorepo and modifies its code or dependencies.  Other projects that depend on the compromised project will be affected, leading to a cascading compromise.  This leverages the interconnected nature of projects *within* the Nx monorepo.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised builds, deployment of malicious code, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** Inter-project dependencies, `nx graph`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict code review policies for all projects.
        *   Visualize dependencies with `nx graph`.
        *   Strong project isolation where possible.
        *   Regular audits of inter-project dependencies.
        *   Circular dependency detection.

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure in Configuration](./threats/secrets_exposure_in_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Secrets Exposure in Configuration

    *   **Description:** Developers accidentally commit secrets (API keys, credentials) to the repository within `workspace.json`, `nx.json`, or `project.json`.  This is a direct threat because these are core Nx configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to services, financial loss.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** `workspace.json`, `nx.json`, `project.json`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** store secrets in configuration files.
        *   Use environment variables.
        *   Use a secrets management solution.
        *   Git hooks and pre-commit checks for secret detection.
        *   Tools like `git-secrets` or truffleHog.

## Threat: [Executor with Excessive Permissions](./threats/executor_with_excessive_permissions.md)

*   **Threat:** Executor with Excessive Permissions

    *   **Description:** A custom executor runs with unnecessary high privileges (e.g., root), creating a potential escalation of privilege vulnerability. This is specific to the customizability offered by Nx executors.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** Custom `executors`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Principle of least privilege.
        *   Avoid running executors as root.
        *   Containerization (Docker) for isolation.
        *   Code review of executors.

## Threat: [Command Injection in `run-commands` Executor](./threats/command_injection_in__run-commands__executor.md)

*  **Threat:** Command Injection in `run-commands` Executor

    *   **Description:**  An attacker crafts malicious input that is passed to the `run-commands` executor, leading to arbitrary command execution on the build server. This happens when user input is directly concatenated into shell commands without proper sanitization. This is a direct threat due to the nature of the `run-commands` executor within Nx.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** `run-commands` executor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user input directly in `run-commands`.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user input.
        *   Prefer more specific executors.
        *   Use parameterized commands instead of string concatenation.
