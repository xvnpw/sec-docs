## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_process.md)

This attack path focuses on manipulating the application's build process, which is centrally managed by NX. Success here allows the attacker to inject malicious code that will be executed during the build, potentially affecting all deployments of the application.

*   **Critical Node: Modify NX Configuration Files (nx.json, project.json)**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to the NX configuration files. This could be achieved through:
        *   **Gaining Write Access to Repository:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the version control system, compromising developer credentials, or insider threats.
        *   **Exploiting CI/CD Pipeline Vulnerability:**  Compromising the CI/CD pipeline to directly modify files during the build process.
        *   **Social Engineering Developer with Admin Access:** Tricking a developer with administrative privileges into making malicious changes.
    *   **Impact:** By modifying these files, the attacker can alter build targets, add malicious scripts to be executed during the build, or change how dependencies are handled. This can lead to the injection of backdoors, malware, or the exfiltration of sensitive information during the build process.

*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Build Targets/Scripts**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious code directly into the build process. This can happen by:
        *   **Modifying Existing Build Targets:** Altering the commands or scripts associated with existing build targets to include malicious actions.
        *   **Introducing New Malicious Build Targets:** Adding entirely new build targets that execute attacker-controlled code.
    *   **Impact:** Successful injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the build environment. This code can be used to install backdoors, modify application code, steal secrets, or disrupt the build process itself. Since the build process is often trusted, this injected code can be deployed to production environments without raising immediate suspicion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Monorepo Structure and Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_monorepo_structure_and_dependencies.md)

This attack path leverages the monorepo structure managed by NX and the inherent trust placed in project dependencies. By compromising dependencies, an attacker can introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code into the application.

*   **Critical Node: Tamper with Project Dependencies**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the dependencies of one or more projects within the NX monorepo. This can be done by:
        *   **Modifying Root `package.json`:** Gaining write access to the root `package.json` file and adding malicious dependencies or altering existing ones to point to compromised versions. This affects all projects in the monorepo.
        *   **Modifying Project-Specific `package.json`:** Gaining write access to the `package.json` file of individual projects and making similar malicious changes to their specific dependencies.
        *   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependency Management (NX's handling):**  Leveraging weaknesses in how NX manages dependencies, potentially allowing the introduction of malicious packages or the substitution of legitimate packages with compromised ones during installation or updates.
    *   **Impact:** Tampering with dependencies can introduce known vulnerabilities into the application, inject malicious code that gets executed when the dependencies are used, or create supply chain attacks where trusted packages are replaced with malicious versions. This can lead to data breaches, remote code execution, and other forms of compromise.
