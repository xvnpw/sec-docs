# Threat Model Analysis for nrwl/nx

## Threat: [Malicious Task Injection](./threats/malicious_task_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Task Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to modify `project.json` files (or similar task configuration files) and injects malicious commands or scripts into task definitions (e.g., build, test, lint). When these tasks are executed using `nx run`, the malicious code is executed on the developer's machine, CI/CD server, or other environments.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, deployment of backdoors, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** `nx run` command, `project.json` (task definitions), potentially Nx plugins involved in task execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and permissions on repository files, especially `project.json` and related configuration files.
        *   Utilize code review processes for any changes to task definitions.
        *   Employ integrity checks or digital signatures for task configuration files to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   Run CI/CD pipelines in isolated and ephemeral environments to limit the impact of compromised tasks.
        *   Avoid constructing shell commands directly from user input or external data within task definitions.

## Threat: [Nx Cache Poisoning](./threats/nx_cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Threat:** Nx Cache Poisoning
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Nx build cache (either local or remote) and injects malicious artifacts or manipulates cached outputs. When developers or the CI/CD system retrieve these poisoned artifacts, they are unknowingly using compromised code, potentially leading to the deployment of vulnerable or backdoored applications.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised applications, introduction of vulnerabilities, potential for supply chain attacks.
    *   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx Cache mechanism, potentially remote cache storage (if used), `nx build` command.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to the Nx build cache, both locally and remotely. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Use integrity checks (e.g., checksums, cryptographic signatures) for cached artifacts to detect tampering.
        *   Regularly audit and clean the build cache.
        *   Consider using immutable infrastructure for build environments to minimize the risk of cache compromise.
        *   Implement monitoring for unusual activity related to the build cache.
