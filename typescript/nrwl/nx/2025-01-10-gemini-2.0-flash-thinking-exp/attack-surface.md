# Attack Surface Analysis for nrwl/nx

## Attack Surface: [Nx CLI Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/nx_cli_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Surface: Nx CLI Vulnerabilities**
  - Description: Exploits within the Nx Command Line Interface (CLI) itself, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.
  - How Nx Contributes: Nx provides the CLI as the primary tool for interacting with the workspace, making it a central point of control.
  - Example: A vulnerability in the argument parsing of an Nx command could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands.
  - Impact: Complete compromise of developer machines or CI/CD environments, potentially leading to code injection, data theft, or supply chain attacks.
  - Risk Severity: **Critical**
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Keep the Nx CLI updated to the latest stable version.
    - Monitor for security advisories related to Nx and its dependencies.
    - Implement security scanning tools for development dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Workspace Configuration File Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/workspace_configuration_file_manipulation.md)

- **Attack Surface: Workspace Configuration File Manipulation**
  - Description: Attackers gaining write access to critical Nx configuration files (e.g., `nx.json`, `angular.json`, project configurations) to modify build processes or introduce malicious scripts.
  - How Nx Contributes: Nx relies heavily on these configuration files to define build targets, dependencies, and project structures.
  - Example: An attacker modifies `nx.json` to add a malicious script that runs during the build process, exfiltrating environment variables.
  - Impact: Introduction of backdoors, data theft, compromised build artifacts, and potential supply chain attacks.
  - Risk Severity: **High**
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Implement strict access controls on workspace configuration files.
    - Utilize version control for these files and enforce code review processes for changes.
    - Consider using immutable infrastructure for build environments to prevent modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Nx Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_nx_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Surface: Custom Nx Plugin Vulnerabilities**
  - Description: Security flaws within custom Nx plugins developed for specific project needs.
  - How Nx Contributes: Nx's extensibility through plugins allows for custom functionality, but these plugins can introduce vulnerabilities if not securely developed.
  - Example: A custom plugin that handles user input without proper sanitization, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.
  - Impact:  Compromise of the build process, access to sensitive data within the workspace, or potential remote code execution if the plugin interacts with external systems.
  - Risk Severity: **High**
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Apply secure coding practices when developing custom plugins.
    - Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom plugins.
    - Manage plugin dependencies carefully and scan for vulnerabilities.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege when designing plugin permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Code Generation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/code_generation_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Surface: Code Generation Vulnerabilities**
  - Description: Vulnerabilities introduced through the use of Nx's code generation capabilities (e.g., `nx generate`) if the underlying schematics or generators are compromised or insecurely designed.
  - How Nx Contributes: Nx provides powerful code generation tools that rely on schematics to automate code creation. Flaws in these schematics can lead to insecure code.
  - Example: A compromised schematic injects a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability into newly generated components.
  - Impact: Introduction of vulnerabilities into the application codebase, potentially leading to various security issues depending on the nature of the injected flaw.
  - Risk Severity: **High**
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Review and audit custom schematics for security vulnerabilities.
    - Ensure that built-in schematics are used responsibly and understand their potential impact.
    - Implement static analysis tools to scan generated code for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning.md)

- **Attack Surface: Cache Poisoning**
  - Description: Attackers manipulating Nx's caching mechanism to introduce malicious artifacts or influence the build process.
  - How Nx Contributes: Nx utilizes caching to optimize build times, but this cache can become a target for malicious manipulation.
  - Example: An attacker poisons the cache with a compromised version of a dependency, which is then used in subsequent builds.
  - Impact: Introduction of vulnerabilities or malicious code into build artifacts, affecting developers and potentially production deployments.
  - Risk Severity: **High**
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Ensure the integrity of the cache storage and implement access controls.
    - Implement mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of cached artifacts.
    - Consider using signed caches to prevent unauthorized modifications.
