## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise NX Application [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_nx_application__cr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal. Any successful exploitation of the sub-nodes leads to this compromise.
    * **Impact:** Full control over the NX application, data breach, service disruption, reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit NX Configuration Vulnerabilities [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nx_configuration_vulnerabilities__cr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigurations in NX configuration files (`nx.json`, `workspace.json`, `project.json`).
    * **Impact:** Code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, build process manipulation.

    * **2.1. Misconfigured nx.json [CR]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting misconfigurations within the `nx.json` file.
        * **Impact:** Insecure task execution, path traversal, potential secret exposure.

        * **2.1.1. Insecure script execution in tasks [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into task configurations (e.g., pre/post hooks, custom commands) within `nx.json`.
            * **Exploit:** Modifying `nx.json` (if attacker has write access or via a vulnerability) to include malicious commands in task definitions. When these tasks are executed by NX, the malicious code runs.
            * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or developer machines running NX tasks.

    * **2.2. Misconfigured workspace.json/angular.json/project.json [CR]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Targeting misconfigurations within workspace or project specific configuration files.
        * **Impact:** Insecure build process, vulnerable dependency introduction, potential secret exposure.

        * **2.2.1. Insecure build configurations [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Modifying build configurations within `workspace.json`, `angular.json`, or `project.json` to inject malicious code during the build process.
            * **Exploit:**  Manipulating build scripts or build steps defined in these configuration files to include malicious commands. During the build process, these commands are executed, injecting code into build artifacts or the build environment.
            * **Impact:** Code injection into the application build, potentially leading to compromised deployments or build infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit NX Code Generation/Schematic Vulnerabilities [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nx_code_generationschematic_vulnerabilities__cr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to NX code generation and schematics.
    * **Impact:** Code injection, generation of vulnerable code, supply chain compromise.

    * **3.1. Malicious Schematics [CR]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Using malicious or compromised NX schematics.
        * **Impact:** Code injection, backdoors, generation of vulnerable application components.

        * **3.1.1. Using untrusted or compromised schematics [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Installing and executing schematics from untrusted sources (e.g., public npm registry without verification, compromised custom repositories).
            * **Exploit:**  An attacker creates or compromises a schematic and distributes it. Developers unknowingly install and run this schematic. The schematic contains malicious code that executes during the code generation process.
            * **Impact:**  Immediate code execution upon schematic execution, potential for persistent backdoors or vulnerabilities injected into the generated codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit NX Dependency Management Vulnerabilities [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nx_dependency_management_vulnerabilities__cr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how NX manages dependencies within a monorepo.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerable code, dependency confusion attacks, supply chain compromise.

    * **4.1. Vulnerable Dependencies in Monorepo [CR]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies used within the NX monorepo.
        * **Impact:** Widespread vulnerabilities across multiple applications in the monorepo.

        * **4.1.1. Shared vulnerable dependencies across multiple projects [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** A vulnerability exists in a dependency that is shared and used by multiple projects within the NX monorepo.
            * **Exploit:**  Attackers target a known vulnerability in a shared dependency. Because the dependency is shared across multiple projects in the monorepo, exploiting this vulnerability can impact many applications simultaneously.
            * **Impact:**  Large-scale compromise across multiple applications within the monorepo from a single dependency vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit NX Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nx_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within NX plugins, especially community plugins.
    * **Impact:** Code execution, backdoors, compromised NX functionality.

    * **5.1. Vulnerabilities in NX Community Plugins:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in plugins sourced from the NX community.
        * **Impact:** Plugin malfunction, code execution, backdoors introduced by plugins.

        * **5.1.1. Known vulnerabilities in popular community plugins [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in widely used NX community plugins.
            * **Exploit:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities (e.g., from security advisories, vulnerability databases) in popular NX plugins. If the target application uses a vulnerable version of such a plugin, it becomes susceptible to attack.
            * **Impact:**  Compromise through known plugin vulnerabilities, potentially affecting many applications using the same vulnerable plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit NX Build/Task Runner Vulnerabilities [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nx_buildtask_runner_vulnerabilities__cr_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the NX build and task runner processes.
    * **Impact:** Build process manipulation, code injection, denial of service.

    * **6.1. Build Process Manipulation [CR]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the NX build process to inject malicious code.
        * **Impact:** Code injection into build artifacts, compromised deployments, supply chain compromise.

        * **6.1.1. Inject malicious code into build scripts or tasks [CR]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Modifying build scripts or task configurations to inject malicious code that executes during the build process.
            * **Exploit:** Attackers gain access to build scripts or task configurations (e.g., through compromised accounts, insecure storage). They modify these scripts to include malicious commands that are executed as part of the build process.
            * **Impact:**  Code injection into the final application build, allowing for persistent compromise of deployed applications.
