# Threat Model Analysis for nrwl/nx

## Threat: [Cross-Project Code Exposure](./threats/cross-project_code_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, either internal or external with compromised developer credentials, could exploit misconfigured access controls or processes within the monorepo to gain unauthorized access to code and configurations of projects they shouldn't have access to. This could involve reading sensitive files, exfiltrating secrets, or modifying configurations to their advantage.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, information disclosure, compromised credentials, potential for lateral movement and further attacks within the monorepo.
*   **Affected Nx Component:** Monorepo structure, workspace configuration, task runners, CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access control policies within the development environment and CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Utilize separate service accounts with least privilege for different projects and processes.
    *   Regularly audit permissions and access configurations within the monorepo.
    *   Employ environment variables and secrets management tools to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in code or configurations.
    *   Enforce code review processes to detect accidental exposure of sensitive information.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion within Monorepo](./threats/dependency_confusion_within_monorepo.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could create a malicious public package with a name similar to an internal library within the Nx monorepo. Developers or automated build processes might mistakenly install this malicious package instead of the intended internal library, leading to the execution of malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Code execution within the application, data compromise, supply chain attack, application malfunction or instability.
*   **Affected Nx Component:** Dependency management, package resolution, `npm/yarn/pnpm` integration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize private package registries for internal libraries to prevent public access and confusion.
    *   Enforce strict dependency whitelisting to only allow installation from trusted registries.
    *   Implement package checksum verification to ensure package integrity.
    *   Carefully choose names for internal packages to minimize the risk of collision with public package names.
    *   Employ dependency scanning tools to detect and prevent the installation of malicious or vulnerable packages.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Nx CLI Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_nx_cli_itself.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit security vulnerabilities present in the Nx CLI tool itself. This could be achieved through crafted input, malicious plugins, or exploiting known weaknesses in the CLI's code. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to compromise developer machines or CI/CD systems.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, compromised development environment, supply chain compromise if the CLI is used in deployment processes.
*   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx CLI core, command parsing, task execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Nx CLI updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.
    *   Monitor for security advisories related to the Nx CLI and its dependencies.
    *   Use official Nx distributions and avoid using potentially compromised or unofficial versions.
    *   Limit access to the Nx CLI in production environments and restrict its usage to authorized personnel and processes.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization where the Nx CLI processes external data or user input.

## Threat: [Insecure Task Configurations](./threats/insecure_task_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Custom Nx tasks or scripts that are not securely implemented can introduce vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities, such as command injection flaws or insecure API calls within tasks, to execute arbitrary code or compromise the build process.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data breach, compromised build process, potential for further attacks and supply chain compromise.
*   **Affected Nx Component:** Custom Nx tasks, task runner, `project.json` task definitions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely implement custom Nx tasks, following secure coding practices.
    *   Sanitize inputs and validate data within tasks to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Avoid executing untrusted code or commands within tasks.
    *   Use secure coding practices and security libraries when writing task scripts.
    *   Regularly review and audit custom tasks for potential security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Code Injection in Custom Generators](./threats/code_injection_in_custom_generators.md)

*   **Description:** Custom Nx generators, if not implemented securely, could be vulnerable to code injection attacks. Attackers could inject malicious code into generator scripts, which would then be executed during project generation, potentially compromising new projects.
*   **Impact:** Code injection, compromised project generation process, supply chain compromise if the generator is widely used, potential for widespread impact on projects generated with the malicious generator.
*   **Affected Nx Component:** Custom Nx generators, generator scripts, input handling in generators.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely implement custom Nx generators, prioritizing security in code design and implementation.
    *   Sanitize inputs and validate data received by generators to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Avoid dynamic code construction based on untrusted input within generator scripts.
    *   Regularly review and audit custom generators for potential security vulnerabilities and injection flaws.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms within custom generators.

## Threat: [Malicious Nx Plugins](./threats/malicious_nx_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could create or compromise Nx plugins to intentionally introduce malicious functionality. Developers might unknowingly install and use these malicious plugins, leading to backdoors, data exfiltration, or disruption of development processes.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, code injection, supply chain compromise, compromised development environment, application malfunction, potential for long-term persistent compromise.
*   **Affected Nx Component:** Nx plugin system, Nx plugins (official and community), plugin installation process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Nx plugins only from highly trusted and verified sources, exercising extreme caution with community plugins.
    *   Thoroughly verify plugin publishers and developers before installation.
    *   Review plugin code and dependencies before installation to identify any suspicious or malicious code.
    *   Utilize plugin scanning tools and security analysis techniques to detect potentially malicious plugins.
    *   Implement a plugin approval process to control and vet plugins before they are used within projects.
