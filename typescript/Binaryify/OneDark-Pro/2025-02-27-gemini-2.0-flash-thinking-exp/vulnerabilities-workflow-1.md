## Consolidated Vulnerability List

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Changelog Webview

- **Description:**
    - An attacker with write access to the GitHub repository of the One Dark Pro theme (achieved through compromised maintainer account or repository vulnerabilities) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `CHANGELOG.md` file. This can be done by inserting an iframe or script tag containing the malicious script within the markdown content.
    - When a user installs or updates the One Dark Pro VSCode extension and subsequently executes the `oneDarkPro.showChangelog` command, the extension loads and renders the `CHANGELOG.md` content in a webview.
    - The injected malicious JavaScript within `CHANGELOG.md` then executes within the webview's context. This allows the attacker to potentially perform various malicious actions, such as stealing user tokens, accessing local resources (depending on webview context and Content Security Policy - CSP), or redirecting the user to a malicious external website.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the VSCode extension's webview context. This can lead to:
        - Stealing sensitive information if accessible from the webview context.
        - Performing actions within VSCode on behalf of the user.
        - Redirecting the user to malicious external websites.
        - Potentially gaining deeper access to the user's VSCode environment or system, depending on the webview's capabilities and any exploitable VSCode vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability rank:** high

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The project utilizes `marked.parse` to render markdown content in the webview. `marked` is known to sanitize HTML by default, providing a baseline level of protection against basic XSS attacks.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implementation of a CSP for the webview is missing. A CSP would restrict the webview's capabilities, preventing the execution of inline scripts and limiting the loading of external resources.
    - **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** SRI is not implemented for any external resources loaded by the webview. While no external resources are apparent in the provided code, implementing SRI is a good security practice to ensure the integrity of loaded resources.
    - **Regular Security Audits:** Regular security audits of `CHANGELOG.md` and other markdown files are not explicitly mentioned. These audits are crucial to proactively prevent accidental or malicious injection of harmful content.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must gain write access to the GitHub repository to modify the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
    - The user must install a compromised version of the extension and execute the `oneDarkPro.showChangelog` command.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - **`src/webviews/Changelog.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import { ChangelogWebview } from './Webview'
        import { Uri, workspace } from 'vscode'
        import { TextDecoder } from 'util'
        import * as path from 'path'
        import { marked } from 'marked'

        export class ChangelogWebview extends WebviewController {
          // ...
          get content(): Promise<string> {
            const changelogPath = Uri.file(
              path.join(__dirname, '../../', 'CHANGELOG.md')
            )
            return Promise.resolve(workspace.fs.readFile(changelogPath))
              .then((data) => new TextDecoder().decode(data))
              .then((content) => marked.parse(content))
          }
        }
        ```
        - The `ChangelogWebview` class is responsible for displaying the changelog in a webview.
        - It reads the `CHANGELOG.md` file from the extension's directory.
        - The `marked.parse` function is used to convert the markdown content of `CHANGELOG.md` into HTML.
        - The resulting HTML content is then set as the HTML content of the webview using `this.panel.webview.html = fullHtml;` in the `src/webviews/Webview.ts` file.
        - **Vulnerability Trigger:** If an attacker can modify the `CHANGELOG.md` file to include malicious JavaScript code, and if the sanitization provided by `marked.parse` is insufficient to remove or neutralize this code, then the malicious script will be executed when the webview is rendered. This is because the HTML generated by `marked.parse` is directly loaded into the webview without additional security measures like CSP.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup:** Configure a local development environment for VSCode extension development.
    2. **Modify `CHANGELOG.md`:**  Locate the `CHANGELOG.md` file within the local repository of the One Dark Pro extension and add the following malicious markdown at the end of the file:
        ```markdown
        ## Malicious Section
        <script>
            // Malicious JavaScript code to demonstrate XSS
            alert('XSS Vulnerability in Changelog!');
        </script>
        ```
    3. **Package and Install:** Package the modified extension into a `.vsix` file. Install this `.vsix` file in VSCode using the "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." command.
    4. **Execute Changelog Command:** Open VSCode and execute the command `One Dark Pro: Show Changelog` from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    5. **Verify XSS:** Observe if an alert box appears with the message "XSS Vulnerability in Changelog!". The appearance of this alert confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability, indicating that the injected JavaScript code has been executed within the webview.
