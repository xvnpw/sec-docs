### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Write via Theme Configuration
- **Description:**
    An attacker can craft a malicious VSCode workspace configuration that, when applied, leads to arbitrary file write outside of the intended extension's directories. This is achieved by manipulating the theme settings to control the output file path during theme generation. Specifically, by altering the `editorTheme` setting to include path traversal sequences, the generated theme files can be written to locations outside the extension's designated `themes` folder.
    1. Attacker creates a malicious VSCode workspace configuration file (`.vscode/settings.json`).
    2. In this configuration, the attacker sets `oneDarkPro.editorTheme` to a string containing path traversal sequences, like `"../../../../malicious_path/malicious_theme"`.
    3. The user opens a workspace with this malicious configuration and activates the One Dark Pro extension.
    4. The `updateTheme` function is triggered, either automatically on extension activation or when the user changes theme settings.
    5. The `writeTheme` function in `updateTheme.ts` uses the attacker-controlled `editorTheme` value as part of the output file path without sufficient sanitization.
    6. The `generateTheme.fromSettings` function, called within `writeTheme`, processes the configuration including the malicious `editorTheme`.
    7. The `Theme.init` function, and subsequently `createEditorTokens`, does not sanitize the theme name before using it to construct file paths for dynamic imports.
    8. The `workspace.fs.writeFile` function is called with the crafted path, resulting in writing the generated theme file (e.g., `OneDark-Pro.json`) to the attacker-specified location.
- **Impact:**
    Arbitrary file write can have severe consequences. An attacker could overwrite critical system files, configuration files, or inject malicious code into executable files if the VSCode process has sufficient permissions. In the context of a VSCode extension, this could lead to privilege escalation or complete compromise of the user's environment, depending on what files are overwritten and the user's system configuration.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The code directly uses the configuration value for `editorTheme` in file path construction without any validation or sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization for the `editorTheme` configuration setting. Validate that the provided theme name does not contain any path traversal characters (e.g., `..`, `/`, `\`) or restrict the allowed characters to alphanumeric and hyphens.
    - Path validation in `writeTheme` function to ensure the output file path remains within the intended `themes` directory. Use path joining functions that prevent traversal outside of the base directory.
- **Preconditions:**
    - User must have the One Dark Pro extension installed.
    - User must open a workspace with a malicious VSCode configuration file (`.vscode/settings.json`) that sets the `oneDarkPro.editorTheme` to a path containing traversal sequences.

    workspace.fs.writeFile(THEME_PATH, ...) // File written outside themes directory
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Inside the workspace, create a `.vscode` folder if it doesn't exist.
    3. Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a `settings.json` file.
    4. Add the following JSON configuration to `settings.json`:
    ```json
    {
        "oneDarkPro.editorTheme": "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/malicious_theme"
    }
    ```
    5. Open VSCode in this workspace. Ensure the One Dark Pro theme is activated (if not, activate it).
    6. Observe if a file named `malicious_theme` is created in the `/tmp/` directory on your system.
    7. To further confirm arbitrary content write, you can check the content of `/tmp/malicious_theme`. It should contain a JSON structure representing a VSCode theme file, starting with `{"name": "One Dark Pro", "type": "dark", ...}`.
    8. **Expected Result:** A file named `malicious_theme` is created in `/tmp/` directory, proving arbitrary file write vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Webview Content Injection via Unsanitized Markdown in Changelog
- **Description:**
    - The extension’s changelog feature reads the local file `CHANGELOG.md` and decodes its content.
    - This content is converted into HTML using the third‑party library `marked` via a call to `marked.parse(content)` without any sanitization.
    - The resulting HTML is then directly injected into a VSCode webview (via assignment to `this.panel.webview.html` in `src/webviews/Webview.ts`), without applying a strict Content Security Policy.
    - An external attacker who is able to modify or replace the `CHANGELOG.md` file (for example, by compromising the update channel or obtaining write‑access to the extension’s installation directory) can inject a malicious payload (for example, `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`).
    - When an unsuspecting user executes the command (such as via the command palette using `oneDarkPro.showChangelog`), the manipulated HTML is rendered in the webview and the payload executes.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation results in cross‑site scripting (XSS) within the webview.
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the extension’s context, potentially leading to interface manipulation, exfiltration of configuration data, or further compromise of the user’s VSCode environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The conversion of markdown to HTML is performed directly through `marked.parse(content)` without further processing.
    - No strict Content Security Policy (CSP) is enforced on the webview to restrict the execution of inline scripts.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **HTML Sanitization:** Before injecting the HTML into the webview, it should be processed with a sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to strip or escape dangerous elements and attributes.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** The webview should enforce a strict CSP (for example, disallowing inline scripts) so that even if malicious HTML is injected, its script execution potential is limited.
    - **File Integrity Validation:** Implement integrity or signature verification measures to ensure that critical local files like `CHANGELOG.md` have not been tampered with.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have a means to modify or replace the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the extension’s installation directory.
    - The extension’s changelog display command (such as `oneDarkPro.showChangelog`) must be executed by the user, triggering the rendering of the unsanitized HTML in the webview.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `src/webviews/Changelog.ts`, the path to the changelog file is constructed as follows:
      ```ts
      const changelogPath = Uri.file(path.join(__dirname, '../../', 'CHANGELOG.md'))
      ```
    - The file is then read and its contents decoded:
      ```ts
      workspace.fs.readFile(changelogPath)
        .then((data) => new TextDecoder().decode(data))
      ```
    - The decoded content is converted to HTML without sanitization:
      ```ts
      .then((content) => marked.parse(content))
      ```
    - In `src/webviews/Webview.ts`, the HTML is directly injected into the webview:
      ```ts
      this.panel.webview.html = fullHtml
      ```
    - The absence of sanitization and CSP enforcement means that any malicious payload embedded in `CHANGELOG.md` will be executed when rendered.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - **Preparation:**
      - Locate the extension’s `CHANGELOG.md` file within its installation directory.
      - Modify the file to include a test payload, for example:
        ```markdown
        # Changelog

        <script>alert('XSS');</script>
        ```
    - **Execution:**
      - Launch Visual Studio Code with the extension installed.
      - Open the command palette and invoke the command `oneDarkPro.showChangelog`.
    - **Verification:**
      - A webview should appear displaying the changelog.
      - The appearance of an alert box with the message `XSS` confirms that the unsanitized HTML rendered the test payload, thereby triggering script execution.
    - **Conclusion:**
      - The successful display of the alert verifies that the extension is vulnerable to webview content injection via unsanitized markdown.
