- Vulnerability name: Command Injection via Alias in `ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh`

- Description:
    1. The `ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh` script, executed during project environment startup, dynamically creates shell aliases for commands located in the `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`.
    2. The script iterates through subfolders within `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER` and uses the `basename` of each folder to define the alias name.
    3. The script utilizes `eval` to construct and execute a string that defines a shell function acting as the alias. The folder name is directly incorporated into this `eval` string without proper sanitization.
    4. An attacker can create a folder with a malicious name containing backticks or other shell injection characters within `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`.
    5. When the `ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh` script is executed, the `eval` command interprets the malicious folder name, leading to the execution of arbitrary shell commands injected by the attacker.
    6. This results in arbitrary code execution on the user's machine during project environment startup.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine upon starting the VSCode extension project environment.
    - This can lead to:
        - Data theft from the developer's machine.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
        - Complete compromise of the developer's system.

- Vulnerability rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The project directly uses `eval` to create aliases without any input sanitization or validation.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize folder names before using them in `eval` to create aliases. Remove or escape shell-sensitive characters like backticks, semicolons, and command substitution characters.
    - Avoid `eval`: Replace the usage of `eval` with safer alternatives for creating shell aliases. Consider direct manipulation of shell alias commands or using safer string interpolation methods that prevent command injection.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the names of folders within the `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`. This could be achieved through:
        - Submitting a malicious pull request that includes a command or extension with a specially crafted folder name.
        - Exploiting another vulnerability that allows writing files or creating folders within the project's `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`.

- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/settings/during_manual_start/081_000__ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh` (and `/code/settings/during_start/081_000__ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh`)
    2. The relevant code snippet responsible for the vulnerability is within the `for` loop that iterates through folders in `$FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`:
    ```bash
    for_each_item_in="$FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER"
    ...
    while read -d $'\0' each
    do
        # if its a folder
        if [[ -d "$each" ]]
        then
            name="$(basename "$each")"
            eval '
            '"$name"' () {
                # ... alias definition ...
            }
            __autocomplete_for__'"$name"' () {
                # ... autocomplete definition ...
            }
            compdef __autocomplete_for__'"$name"' '"$name"'
            ' > /dev/null
        fi
    done < "$__temp_var__temp_folder/pipe_for_while_$__NESTED_WHILE_COUNTER";__NESTED_WHILE_COUNTER="$((__NESTED_WHILE_COUNTER - 1))"
    ```
    3. The variable `$name`, which is derived from `basename "$each"` (a folder path within `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`), is directly used within the `eval` command to define the alias function name.
    4. No sanitization or escaping is performed on the `$name` variable before its use in `eval`.
    5. Visualization:
    ```
    FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER --> Folder Iteration --> basename extraction ($name) --> eval command construction --> eval execution (Vulnerability!)
    ```
    6. An attacker can create a folder with a name like `malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\`` inside the commands folder. The `basename` extraction will result in `$name` being `malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\``.
    7. The `eval` command then becomes:
    ```bash
    eval '
        'malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\``' () {
            # ... alias definition ...
        }
        __autocomplete_for__'malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\``' () {
            # ... autocomplete definition ...
        }
        compdef __autocomplete_for__'"$name"' '"$name"'
        ' > /dev/null
    ```
    8. During execution of `eval`, the backticks in the alias name cause command substitution, executing `touch /tmp/pwned` on the system.

- Security test case:
    1. Prerequisite: Ensure you have the project environment set up as described in `documentation/setup.md`.
    2. Step 1: Navigate to the commands directory of a standard extension, for example, the `nodejs` extension:
       ```bash
       cd code/settings/extensions/nodejs/
       ```
    3. Step 2: Create a malicious folder within the `commands` directory. This simulates an attacker adding a malicious command or extension:
       ```bash
       mkdir "commands/tools/malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\`"
       ```
    4. Step 3: Start the project environment. From the project root directory (`code/`):
       ```bash
       commands/start
       ```
    5. Step 4: Verify command execution. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.
       ```bash
       ls -l /tmp/pwned
       ```
       If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists and you see its details (e.g., permissions, timestamp), it indicates successful arbitrary command execution due to the vulnerability.
    6. Step 5: Clean up (optional). Remove the malicious folder:
       ```bash
       rm -rf code/settings/extensions/nodejs/commands/tools/malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\`
       ```
