## Combined Vulnerability List

This document combines the identified vulnerabilities into a single list, removing duplicates and maintaining the original descriptions for each vulnerability.

### 1. Command Injection via Alias in `ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh`

- **Description:**
    1. The `ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh` script, executed during project environment startup, dynamically creates shell aliases for commands located in the `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`.
    2. The script iterates through subfolders within `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER` and uses the `basename` of each folder to define the alias name.
    3. The script utilizes `eval` to construct and execute a string that defines a shell function acting as the alias. The folder name is directly incorporated into this `eval` string without proper sanitization.
    4. An attacker can create a folder with a malicious name containing backticks or other shell injection characters within `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`.
    5. When the `ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh` script is executed, the `eval` command interprets the malicious folder name, leading to the execution of arbitrary shell commands injected by the attacker.
    6. This results in arbitrary code execution on the user's machine during project environment startup.

- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine upon starting the VSCode extension project environment.
    - This can lead to:
        - Data theft from the developer's machine.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
        - Complete compromise of the developer's system.

- **Vulnerability rank:** high

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The project directly uses `eval` to create aliases without any input sanitization or validation.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize folder names before using them in `eval` to create aliases. Remove or escape shell-sensitive characters like backticks, semicolons, and command substitution characters.
    - Avoid `eval`: Replace the usage of `eval` with safer alternatives for creating shell aliases. Consider direct manipulation of shell alias commands or using safer string interpolation methods that prevent command injection.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the names of folders within the `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`. This could be achieved through:
        - Submitting a malicious pull request that includes a command or extension with a specially crafted folder name.
        - Exploiting another vulnerability that allows writing files or creating folders within the project's `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`.

- **Source code analysis:**
    1. File: `/code/settings/during_manual_start/081_000__ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh` (and `/code/settings/during_start/081_000__ensure_all_commands_executable__.sh`)
    2. The relevant code snippet responsible for the vulnerability is within the `for` loop that iterates through folders in `$FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`:
    ```bash
    for_each_item_in="$FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER"
    ...
    while read -d $'\0' each
    do
        # if its a folder
        if [[ -d "$each" ]]
        then
            name="$(basename "$each")"
            eval '
            '"$name"' () {
                # ... alias definition ...
            }
            __autocomplete_for__'"$name"' () {
                # ... autocomplete definition ...
            }
            compdef __autocomplete_for__'"$name"' '"$name"'
            ' > /dev/null
        fi
    done < "$__temp_var__temp_folder/pipe_for_while_$__NESTED_WHILE_COUNTER";__NESTED_WHILE_COUNTER="$((__NESTED_WHILE_COUNTER - 1))"
    ```
    3. The variable `$name`, which is derived from `basename "$each"` (a folder path within `FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER`), is directly used within the `eval` command to define the alias function name.
    4. No sanitization or escaping is performed on the `$name` variable before its use in `eval`.
    5. Visualization:
    ```
    FORNIX_COMMANDS_FOLDER --> Folder Iteration --> basename extraction ($name) --> eval command construction --> eval execution (Vulnerability!)
    ```
    6. An attacker can create a folder with a name like `malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\`` inside the commands folder. The `basename` extraction will result in `$name` being `malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\``.
    7. The `eval` command then becomes:
    ```bash
    eval '
        'malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\``' () {
            # ... alias definition ...
        }
        __autocomplete_for__'malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\``' () {
            # ... autocomplete definition ...
        }
        compdef __autocomplete_for__'"$name"' '"$name"'
        ' > /dev/null
    ```
    8. During execution of `eval`, the backticks in the alias name cause command substitution, executing `touch /tmp/pwned` on the system.

- **Security test case:**
    1. Prerequisite: Ensure you have the project environment set up as described in `documentation/setup.md`.
    2. Step 1: Navigate to the commands directory of a standard extension, for example, the `nodejs` extension:
       ```bash
       cd code/settings/extensions/nodejs/
       ```
    3. Step 2: Create a malicious folder within the `commands` directory. This simulates an attacker adding a malicious command or extension:
       ```bash
       mkdir "commands/tools/malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\`"
       ```
    4. Step 3: Start the project environment. From the project root directory (`code/`):
       ```bash
       commands/start
       ```
    5. Step 4: Verify command execution. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created.
       ```bash
       ls -l /tmp/pwned
       ```
       If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists and you see its details (e.g., permissions, timestamp), it indicates successful arbitrary command execution due to the vulnerability.
    6. Step 5: Clean up (optional). Remove the malicious folder:
       ```bash
       rm -rf code/settings/extensions/nodejs/commands/tools/malicious\`touch /tmp/pwned\`
       ```

### 2. Arbitrary Code Execution via `prim_importNative`

- **Description:**
    1. The `prim_importNative` function in `primops.hh` is used to load and execute native code from shared libraries (`.so` or `.dylib` files).
    2. This function takes two arguments: a path to the shared library and a symbol name.
    3. The function uses `dlopen` to load the shared library from the provided path and `dlsym` to resolve the specified symbol within the loaded library.
    4. If an attacker can control the path argument to `prim_importNative`, they can specify a path to a malicious shared library.
    5. When `prim_importNative` is called with the attacker-controlled path, the malicious library will be loaded into the VSCode extension's process.
    6. Subsequently, `dlsym` will resolve a symbol (also potentially attacker-influenced or a known symbol in the malicious library), and the code at that symbol will be executed within the context of the VSCode extension.
    7. This allows for arbitrary code execution, as the attacker can craft a shared library to perform any action they desire.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can gain full control over the machine running the VSCode extension, potentially stealing sensitive data, installing malware, or performing other malicious activities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None apparent from the provided code snippets. The code directly uses `dlopen` with a path derived from user input without explicit validation or sanitization beyond path canonicalization and store path checks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Path Validation**: The path provided to `prim_importNative` must be strictly validated to ensure it originates from a trusted source and conforms to a safe format. A whitelist of allowed directories or store paths should be enforced. User-provided arbitrary paths should be strictly disallowed.
    - **Symbol Name Validation**: While less critical than path validation, validating the symbol name can add an additional layer of defense. However, controlling the path is the primary attack vector here.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation**: Ideally, native code execution should be sandboxed or isolated to limit the impact of a compromised native library. However, this might be a more complex mitigation to implement.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. An attacker must be able to control the arguments passed to the `prim_importNative` function within a Nix expression that is evaluated by the VSCode extension. This could potentially be achieved through various injection points, depending on how the extension processes user-provided Nix code.
    2. The `evalSettings.enableNativeCode` setting must be enabled, allowing the use of `prim_importNative`.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```cpp
    static void prim_importNative(EvalState &state, const PosIdx pos, Value **args, Value &v) {
      auto path = realisePath(state, pos, *args[0]);
      std::string sym = sym(state, forceStringNoCtx(*args[1], pos));
      ...
      void *handle = dlopen(path.c_str(), RTLD_LAZY | RTLD_LOCAL); // [VULNERABILITY] Path from user input is directly used in dlopen
      if (!handle) {
        state.debugThrowLastTrace(EvalError {
            .msg = hintfmt("could not open `%1%': %2%", path, dlerror()),
            .errPos = state.positions[pos]});
      }
      dlerror(); /* clear error */
      ValueInitializer func = (ValueInitializer) dlsym(handle, sym.c_str()); // Symbol name also from user input
      if (!func) {
        char *message = dlerror();
        if (message)
          state.debugThrowLastTrace(EvalError {
              .msg = hintfmt("could not load symbol `%1%' from `%2%': %3%", sym, path, message),
              .errPos = state.positions[pos]});
        else
          state.debugThrowLastTrace(EvalError {
              .msg = hintfmt("symbol `%1%' from `%2%' resolved to NULL when a function pointer was expected", sym, path),
              .errPos = state.positions[pos]});
      }
      (func)(state, v); // Execution of loaded code
      /* We don't dlclose because v may be a primop referencing a function in the shared object file */
    }
    ```
    - The code snippet shows that `prim_importNative` directly uses the `path` variable, which is derived from the `args[0]` (user-controlled input), in the `dlopen` function. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows loading arbitrary shared libraries.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites**:
        - Ensure a VSCode extension using this code is running and vulnerable.
        - Create a malicious shared library (e.g., `malicious.so`) that executes a simple command like creating a file in `/tmp/pwned`.
        - Make the malicious shared library accessible via a path, either locally or remotely (e.g., via a web server).
    2. **Craft a Nix expression**:
        ```nix
        { pkgs }:
        pkgs.mkShell {
          buildScript = ''
            nix eval -E '
              builtins.importNative "/path/to/malicious.so" "init"
            '
          '';
        }
        ```
        - Replace `/path/to/malicious.so` with the actual path to your malicious shared library. If hosting it remotely, you would need to fetch it first using `fetchurl` and then use the local path in the store. For local testing, you can directly use a local path.
    3. **Trigger Evaluation**:
        - Open a Nix file in VSCode and trigger evaluation in a way that executes the crafted Nix expression (this step depends on the specific extension's functionality and how it triggers evaluations).
    4. **Verify Execution**:
        - Check if the malicious command (e.g., file creation in `/tmp/pwned`) was executed on the system. If successful, this confirms arbitrary code execution.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to achieve arbitrary code execution by supplying a crafted Nix expression to the vulnerable VSCode extension, which is a critical security risk.
