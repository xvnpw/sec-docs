## Vulnerability List

There are no high or critical vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that meet the specified criteria.

After a thorough source code analysis, focusing on vulnerabilities introduced by the project and excluding those caused by insecure code patterns, missing documentation, or denial of service, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were identified.

The extension primarily focuses on providing code snippets for React and related technologies. The core functionalities include:

- Snippet generation and management: The extension reads snippet definitions from source files, processes them, and generates a `generated.json` file.
- Snippet formatting: It uses Prettier for code formatting if enabled in the settings.
- Snippet search and insertion: Users can search for snippets using a command, and the extension inserts the selected snippet into the active text editor.

The code base is relatively straightforward and doesn't involve complex operations or interactions with external systems that are typically prone to high-severity vulnerabilities. The use of Prettier for formatting, while adding complexity, also helps in maintaining code consistency and reducing the likelihood of certain types of code injection issues.

The extension's configuration settings are limited to features like enabling Prettier, controlling language scopes, and import behavior, which do not directly expose any high-risk attack surfaces.

Given these considerations and the constraints outlined in the prompt, there are no vulnerabilities to list that satisfy the criteria of being high rank and introduced by the project's code itself.
