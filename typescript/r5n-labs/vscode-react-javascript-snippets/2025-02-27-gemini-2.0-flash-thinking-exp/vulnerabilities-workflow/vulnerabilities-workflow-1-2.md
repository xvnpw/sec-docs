- **Vulnerability Name**: Untrusted Prettier Configuration Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution

- **Description**:
  The extension’s snippet‐formatting feature optionally relies on Prettier when the user enables the “prettierEnabled” setting. In the helper function `getPrettierConfig`, the code calls
  ```js
  prettier.resolveConfig('', { editorconfig: true })
  ```
  without any additional validation or sandboxing. This call causes Prettier to load configuration (e.g. from a local `.prettierrc` file or editorconfig) from the current workspace. An attacker who can supply a malicious Prettier configuration file may inject unsafe plugins or options. When the extension later calls
  ```js
  prettier.format(snippetString, getPrettierConfig())
  ```
  in the `formatSnippet` function (located in `helpers/formatters.ts`), the malicious configuration will be used during snippet formatting. In effect, if a user opens a workspace that contains a crafted (malicious) Prettier configuration file, the extension will load it and execute its logic—potentially allowing arbitrary code execution within the VS Code extension host.

  *Step-by-step trigger:*
  1. An attacker places a specially crafted `.prettierrc` (or equivalent) file into a workspace that the victim later opens.
  2. The victim’s VS Code has the extension installed and the “prettierEnabled” setting is true.
  3. When a snippet is generated (or when the configuration changes, triggering a snippet regeneration), the extension calls `formatSnippet`. This function calls `prettier.format` with configuration loaded from `getPrettierConfig`.
  4. The malicious Prettier configuration is applied, causing the execution of arbitrary code specified by the attacker.

- **Impact**:
  An attacker who succeeds in this exploitation may execute arbitrary code in the context of the VS Code extension host. This can lead to full compromise of the editor’s process—allowing access to sensitive user data and the potential to manipulate or exfiltrate information from the host system.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
  - There is no validation or sandboxing performed on the configuration loaded via Prettier. The extension simply calls `prettier.resolveConfig` with the `{ editorconfig: true }` option and passes the result directly to Prettier’s formatting API.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - **Validation/Sanitization:** No checks ensure that the Prettier configuration does not load unsafe plugins or options.
  - **Sandboxing/Restriction:** There is no mechanism to restrict or sandbox the effect of externally provided configuration files.
  - **Opt-out Option:** The extension does not offer a way to disable external configuration loading (for example, by disallowing editorconfig integration or external .prettierrc lookup) when formatting snippets.

- **Preconditions**:
  - The extension is configured with `prettierEnabled` set to true.
  - The user opens a workspace that contains a malicious Prettier configuration file (e.g. a compromised `.prettierrc` that loads a dangerous plugin).
  - The attacker must have been able to get the malicious configuration into a workspace that is later opened by a victim (for example, via a pull request or through a shared workspace in an untrusted environment).

- **Source Code Analysis**:
  1. In **`helpers/getPrettierConfig.ts`**, the function calls:
     ```js
     prettier.resolveConfig('', { editorconfig: true })
         .then((config) => (prettierConfig = config));
     ```
     This call uses an empty string as the file path and enables editorconfig, causing Prettier to search for configuration files (such as `.prettierrc`) in the workspace. There is no verification of the loaded configuration.
  2. In **`helpers/formatters.ts`**, the `formatSnippet` function checks the `prettierEnabled` flag (obtained via `extensionConfig()`) and then directly calls:
     ```js
     prettier.format(snippetString, getPrettierConfig())
     ```
     Without sanitizing or restricting the configuration options loaded.
  3. With no additional checks, any malicious plugin or unsafe option present in the workspace’s Prettier configuration will be executed when formatting is applied, thereby opening the door for arbitrary code execution.

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. **Setup a Test Workspace:** Create a test workspace that includes a malicious `.prettierrc` file. For example, the file might include a plugin that, upon initialization, writes a secret file to disk or logs a distinctive message indicating code execution.
  2. **Enable Prettier Formatting:** Ensure that the VS Code extension configuration for `reactSnippets.settings` has `prettierEnabled` set to true.
  3. **Open the Workspace in VS Code:** Launch VS Code with this workspace so that the extension will attempt to load the Prettier configuration.
  4. **Trigger Snippet Generation:** Either change the extension configuration to force a restart or manually invoke the snippet search command so that the `formatSnippet` function is called.
  5. **Verify Exploitation:** Check for the side effect caused by the malicious Prettier configuration (e.g., the secret file is created, a command output is logged, or any other controlled behavior). This will confirm that the extension is executing untrusted configuration code.
