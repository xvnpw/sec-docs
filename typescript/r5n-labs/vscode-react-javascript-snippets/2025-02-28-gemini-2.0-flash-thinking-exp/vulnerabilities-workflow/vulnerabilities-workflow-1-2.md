### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Prettier Configuration Injection leading to potential Code Execution
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious repository. This repository includes a Prettier configuration file (e.g., `.prettierrc.js`, `.prettierrc.json`, or similar) at the root of the workspace.
    2. The malicious Prettier configuration is designed to load and execute a malicious Prettier plugin. This plugin can contain arbitrary JavaScript code.
    3. The victim user is tricked into opening this malicious repository in VS Code. This could be achieved through social engineering, such as sending a link to the repository with a plausible pretext.
    4. The victim user has the "ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets" extension installed, and the extension setting `prettierEnabled` is set to `true`. This setting is likely enabled by default or easily turned on by users expecting code formatting benefits.
    5. The victim user opens a JavaScript or TypeScript file within the compromised workspace.
    6. The victim user triggers a snippet insertion from the extension, for example by using the snippet search command or typing a snippet prefix and pressing tab.
    7. When a snippet is inserted, the extension's code attempts to format the inserted snippet using Prettier. The `formatSnippet` function in `/code/src/helpers/formatters.ts` is responsible for this formatting.
    8. The `getPrettierConfig` function in `/code/src/helpers/getPrettierConfig.ts` is called to retrieve the Prettier configuration. This function uses `prettier.resolveConfig('', { editorconfig: true })`, which searches for and loads Prettier configuration files from the workspace, including the malicious configuration provided by the attacker.
    9. Prettier loads and executes the malicious plugin specified in the workspace configuration during the formatting process.
    10. The malicious plugin executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can lead to full system compromise depending on the nature of the malicious code.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. An attacker can potentially gain full control over the victim's system, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The extension currently does not implement any specific mitigations against Prettier configuration injection. It relies on the assumption that users will only open trusted workspaces.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Sandboxing or disabling Prettier plugin execution:** The extension could disable the execution of Prettier plugins altogether to eliminate this attack vector. While this might reduce Prettier's functionality, it would significantly enhance security.
    - **Workspace Trust Warning:** The extension could detect if Prettier is enabled and a workspace configuration is being used, and display a prominent warning to the user about the risks of running code from untrusted workspaces. VS Code's Workspace Trust feature might mitigate this if properly utilized and communicated to the user in the context of this extension.
    - **Disabling Prettier integration by default:**  The `prettierEnabled` setting could be set to `false` by default, requiring users to explicitly enable it and be aware of the associated risks.
    - **Input Sanitization:** While likely not feasible for Prettier configurations, input sanitization is generally a good practice. However, in this case, the vulnerability lies in the execution of arbitrary code from configuration, not necessarily in the snippet content itself.
- Preconditions:
    - The "ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets" extension is installed and activated in VS Code.
    - The extension setting `prettierEnabled` is set to `true`.
    - The victim user opens a malicious repository in VS Code.
    - The malicious repository contains a malicious Prettier configuration file (e.g., `.prettierrc.js`) that specifies a malicious plugin.
    - The victim user inserts a snippet from the extension in a JavaScript or TypeScript file within the malicious repository.
- Source code analysis:
    1. **`/code/src/helpers/formatters.ts`**: The `formatSnippet` function is responsible for formatting the snippet string.
    ```typescript
    export const formatSnippet = (snippetString: string) => {
      return extensionConfig().prettierEnabled
        ? prettier.format(snippetString, getPrettierConfig())
        : snippetString;
    };
    ```
    This code snippet shows that if `prettierEnabled` is true, the `prettier.format` function is called, passing the snippet string and the Prettier configuration obtained from `getPrettierConfig()`.
    2. **`/code/src/helpers/getPrettierConfig.ts`**: The `getPrettierConfig` function retrieves the Prettier configuration.
    ```typescript
    import prettier, { Options } from 'prettier';
    import extensionConfig from './extensionConfig';

    let prettierConfig: prettier.Options | null;
    prettier
      .resolveConfig('', { editorconfig: true })
      .then((config) => (prettierConfig = config));

    const getPrettierConfig = (): Options => {
      const { prettierEnabled } = extensionConfig();

      return {
        parser: 'typescript',
        ...(prettierEnabled && prettierConfig),
      };
    };

    export default getPrettierConfig;
    ```
    The critical line is `prettier.resolveConfig('', { editorconfig: true })`. This function from the `prettier` library is used to resolve the Prettier configuration. The `editorconfig: true` option and the empty string as the first argument (which resolves to the current workspace root) instruct Prettier to look for configuration files in the workspace, including `.prettierrc.js`, `.prettierrc.json`, `prettier.config.js`, and others. This is where the external configuration is loaded, potentially including malicious plugins.
- Security test case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Repository:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-repo`.
        - Navigate into this directory: `cd malicious-repo`.
        - Initialize a Node.js project (optional, but can help with plugin setup): `npm init -y`.
        - Create a file named `.prettierrc.js` at the root of `malicious-repo` with the following content:
        ```javascript
        module.exports = {
          plugins: [
            {
              parsers: {
                'typescript': require('typescript').parse, // Use typescript parser to ensure plugin loads for .ts files
                'babel-ts': require('typescript').parse,
                'babel': require('typescript').parse,
                'flow': require('typescript').parse,
                'espree': require('typescript').parse,
                'meriyah': require('typescript').parse,
                'acorn': require('typescript').parse,
                'acorn-loose': require('typescript').parse,
              },
              format: (code, options) => {
                // Malicious code execution - creates a file in /tmp
                const fs = require('fs');
                fs.writeFileSync('/tmp/vscode-extension-pwned', 'Successfully PWNED by malicious Prettier plugin!');
                return code; // Return original code to avoid breaking formatting
              }
            }
          ]
        };
        ```
    2. **Open Malicious Repository in VS Code:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Use "File" > "Open Folder..." and select the `malicious-repo` directory you created.
        - Trust the workspace if VS Code prompts for workspace trust. (In a real attack, the attacker would rely on users trusting workspaces or bypassing workspace trust).
    3. **Enable Prettier Setting in Extension:**
        - Go to VS Code settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings on macOS).
        - Search for "reactSnippets prettier".
        - Ensure the "React Snippets â€º Settings: Prettier Enabled" setting is checked (set to `true`).
    4. **Create a JavaScript/TypeScript File and Insert Snippet:**
        - Create a new file in the `malicious-repo` folder, for example `test.ts`.
        - In `test.ts`, trigger a snippet insertion. You can do this by typing `rcc` and pressing Tab, or by using the "ES7 snippet search" command (`CMD + Shift + R` or `CTRL + ALT + R`). Select any component snippet.
    5. **Verify Code Execution:**
        - After inserting the snippet, check if the file `/tmp/vscode-extension-pwned` exists.
        - Open a terminal and run: `ls /tmp/vscode-extension-pwned`
        - If the file exists, the test is successful, and arbitrary code execution has occurred due to Prettier configuration injection.
