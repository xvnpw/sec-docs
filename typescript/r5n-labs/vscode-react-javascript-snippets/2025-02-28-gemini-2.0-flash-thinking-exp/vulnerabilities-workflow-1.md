### Vulnerability List:

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Prettier Configuration Injection leading to Arbitrary Code Execution

*   **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace. This workspace includes a Prettier configuration file (e.g., `.prettierrc.js`, `prettier.config.js`, `.prettierrc.json`, or similar) at the root of the workspace. This configuration is designed to execute arbitrary code when Prettier is invoked.
    2. A user, with the "es7-react-js-snippets" extension installed and the `prettierEnabled` option set to `true`, opens this malicious workspace in VSCode.
    3. The extension, during snippet formatting (triggered by user actions like using a snippet, changing extension settings that regenerate snippets, or opening a JavaScript/TypeScript file in the workspace), utilizes Prettier for code formatting.
    4. The `prettier.resolveConfig` function within `/code/src/helpers/getPrettierConfig.ts` is used to resolve Prettier configuration. This function searches for and loads Prettier configuration files from the workspace, including the malicious configuration provided by the attacker.
    5. When Prettier formats the snippet string using `prettier.format` in `/code/src/helpers/formatters.ts`, the malicious configuration file is processed. If the malicious configuration contains executable JavaScript (e.g., via a plugin or in `.prettierrc.js` itself), this code is executed within the VSCode extension's context.
    6. This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.

*   **Impact:**
    Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's context. This can lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information: Access to workspace files, environment variables, VSCode API tokens, and other data accessible by the VS Code process.
    - Modifying workspace files:  Attackers can alter project code, settings, or inject backdoors.
    - Installing malicious extensions or tools: Further compromising the user's VS Code environment.
    - Data exfiltration to external servers or establishing reverse shells:  Gaining persistent access or control over the victim's machine.
    - Potential full system compromise: Depending on the nature of the malicious code and the privileges of the VS Code process, an attacker could potentially gain full control over the victim's system.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The extension directly uses Prettier's configuration resolution mechanism without any sanitization, validation, or restrictions. The extension relies on the assumption that users will only open trusted workspaces.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Disable Prettier Configuration Resolution from Workspace:** The extension should not load Prettier configuration files from the workspace. It should either use a safe default configuration or only allow configuration through VS Code settings.
    - **Sandboxing or disabling Prettier plugin execution:** The extension could disable the execution of Prettier plugins altogether to eliminate this attack vector.
    - **Workspace Trust Warning:** The extension could detect if Prettier is enabled and a workspace configuration is being used, and display a prominent warning to the user about the risks of running code from untrusted workspaces. Leverage VS Code's Workspace Trust feature and communicate its importance to the user in the context of this extension.
    - **Disabling Prettier integration by default:** The `prettierEnabled` setting could be set to `false` by default, requiring users to explicitly enable it and be aware of the associated risks.
    - **Input Sanitization:** While likely not feasible for Prettier configurations due to their complexity and potential for code execution, consider if any parts of the configuration loading process can be sanitized. However, sanitizing complex JavaScript configuration files is generally unreliable and not recommended as a primary mitigation for code execution vulnerabilities.

*   **Preconditions:**
    - User has the "es7-react-js-snippets" extension installed in VS Code.
    - User has the `prettierEnabled` setting enabled in the extension's configuration (or it is enabled by default).
    - User opens a malicious workspace in VS Code that contains a malicious Prettier configuration file (e.g., `.prettierrc.js`, `prettier.config.js`).
    - The extension performs snippet formatting, which can be triggered by:
        - Using any snippet provided by the extension (e.g., via snippet search or typing a snippet prefix).
        - Changing any setting of the extension in VS Code settings (which triggers `onDidChangeConfiguration` and snippet regeneration).
        - Opening a JavaScript or TypeScript file within the compromised workspace if the extension formats on file open.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    1.  **`/code/src/helpers/getPrettierConfig.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import prettier, { Options } from 'prettier';
        import extensionConfig from './extensionConfig';

        let prettierConfig: prettier.Options | null;
        prettier
          .resolveConfig('', { editorconfig: true }) // Vulnerable line: Resolves Prettier config from workspace
          .then((config) => (prettierConfig = config));

        const getPrettierConfig = (): Options => {
          const { prettierEnabled } = extensionConfig();

          return {
            parser: 'typescript',
            ...(prettierEnabled && prettierConfig), // Returns workspace config if prettierEnabled
          };
        };

        export default getPrettierConfig;
        ```
        - The `prettier.resolveConfig('', { editorconfig: true })` function is the core of the vulnerability. It instructs Prettier to search for configuration files starting from the workspace root directory (represented by the empty string '').
        - The `{ editorconfig: true }` option further expands configuration resolution to include `.editorconfig` files.
        - If Prettier finds a configuration file like `.prettierrc.js` or `prettier.config.js`, it will execute the JavaScript code within to resolve the configuration. This is the injection point.

    2.  **`/code/src/helpers/formatters.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import prettier from 'prettier';
        import extensionConfig from './extensionConfig';
        import getPrettierConfig from './getPrettierConfig';
        import {
          replaceSnippetPlaceholders,
          revertSnippetPlaceholders,
        } from './snippetPlaceholders';

        export const formatSnippet = (snippetString: string) => {
          return extensionConfig().prettierEnabled
            ? prettier.format(snippetString, getPrettierConfig()) // Vulnerable line: Formats snippet using config from getPrettierConfig
            : snippetString;
        };

        export const parseSnippet = (body: string | string[]) => {
          const snippetBody = typeof body === 'string' ? body : body.join('\n');

          return replaceSnippetPlaceholders(
            formatSnippet(revertSnippetPlaceholders(snippetBody)),
          );
        };
        ```
        - The `formatSnippet` function retrieves the Prettier configuration by calling `getPrettierConfig()`.
        - It then passes this configuration, along with the `snippetString`, to `prettier.format()`.
        - If `prettierEnabled` is true and `getPrettierConfig` has loaded a malicious configuration from the workspace, `prettier.format` will utilize this malicious configuration during the formatting process, leading to code execution.

    3.  **Snippet Trigger Points:** Snippet insertion via `snippetSearch.ts`, snippet regeneration on settings change in `index.ts`, and potentially on file open or other extension features all rely on `formatSnippet` to format the inserted or regenerated code. Any of these actions can trigger the vulnerability if the preconditions are met.

    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**

    1.  **Setup Malicious Workspace:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-workspace`.
        - Navigate into `malicious-workspace` in your terminal.
        - Create a file named `.prettierrc.js` with the following content:
            ```javascript
            module.exports = {
              semi: false,
              trailingComma: 'all',
              singleQuote: true,
              plugins: [
                {
                  parsers: {
                    typescript: parser => ({
                      ...parser,
                      parse: (...args) => {
                        // Malicious code execution - display an error message and create a file
                        const { window } = require('vscode');
                        window.showErrorMessage('Malicious Prettier Config Executed!');
                        const fs = require('fs');
                        fs.writeFileSync('/tmp/vscode-extension-pwned', 'PWNED!');
                        return parser.parse(...args);
                      }
                    })
                  },
                  format: (code) => code,
                }
              ]
            };
            ```
            This configuration will display an error message in VS Code and create a file `/tmp/vscode-extension-pwned` when loaded and used by Prettier. Ensure the user running VS Code has write permissions to `/tmp`.

    2.  **Open Malicious Workspace in VS Code:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Use "File" > "Open Folder..." and select the `malicious-workspace` directory.
        - Trust the workspace if VS Code prompts for workspace trust (for testing purposes, in a real attack scenario, the attacker relies on users trusting workspaces or bypassing trust features).

    3.  **Enable Prettier Setting in Extension:**
        - Go to VS Code settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings on macOS).
        - Search for "reactSnippets prettier".
        - Ensure the "React Snippets › Settings: Prettier Enabled" setting is checked (set to `true`).

    4.  **Create a JavaScript/TypeScript File and Trigger Snippet Formatting:**
        - Create a new file in the `malicious-workspace` folder, for example `test.ts`.
        - Open `test.ts`.
        - Trigger snippet formatting. This can be done by:
            - Changing any setting of the extension in VS Code settings.
            - Using the "ES7 snippet search" command (`CMD + Shift + R` or `CTRL + ALT + R`) and inserting any snippet.
            - Typing a snippet prefix (like `rcc`) and pressing Tab to insert a snippet.

    5.  **Verify Code Execution:**
        - After triggering snippet formatting, observe if the error message "Malicious Prettier Config Executed!" is displayed by VS Code.
        - Check if the file `/tmp/vscode-extension-pwned` exists. Open a terminal and run: `ls /tmp/vscode-extension-pwned`.
        - If both the error message is shown and the file `/tmp/vscode-extension-pwned` exists, the test is successful, confirming arbitrary code execution due to Prettier configuration injection.
