## Vulnerability List

There are no high-rank vulnerabilities found in the provided code according to the specified filtering criteria.

The provided code is very basic and mainly focuses on setting up the extension and its dependencies. It lacks any complex functionality that could introduce significant security vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker. The extension primarily relies on the Dart extension for core functionalities.

The `SdkCommands` class is currently a placeholder and does not implement any potentially vulnerable features. The commented-out code suggests future functionality related to creating sample projects, but this is not currently active and therefore does not introduce any vulnerabilities in the current codebase.

The extension correctly checks for the Dart extension dependency and handles potential API mismatches, which are good defensive programming practices.

Therefore, based on the provided code and after applying the specified filtering criteria, there are no vulnerabilities that meet the criteria of being valid, not mitigated, and having a vulnerability rank of at least high.
