## Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Missing Input Sanitization in Future Command Arguments (Potential High Rank in Future)
- **Description:** The current code base is very minimal and does not directly process external input. However, the `SdkCommands` class is designed to interact with the Dart extension API, and the commented out command `flutter.createSampleProject` suggests that future commands might be registered that take user-provided input (e.g., project name, path). If these future commands and their arguments are not properly sanitized before being passed to underlying Dart or Flutter SDK commands or shell executions, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft malicious input as arguments to these commands to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This could lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Medium (Currently), Potential High (in Future if input sanitization is missed in future commands)
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None in the current code base as no commands are registered that process external input. The `runFunctionIfSupported` is a safe way to call API functions but does not address input sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:** Input sanitization and validation should be implemented for all user-provided inputs that are used as arguments to commands or passed to external SDKs or shell commands. This should be done in the functions that handle command execution within `SdkCommands` or similar classes when new commands are added.
- **Preconditions:** This vulnerability is currently theoretical as no commands taking user input are implemented in the provided code. It will become exploitable if future versions of the extension introduce commands that process user input without proper sanitization. An attacker would need to trigger a vulnerable command and provide malicious input as an argument.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`src/commands/sdk.ts`**: The `SdkCommands` class is designed to interact with the Dart extension API.
    2. The constructor is currently empty except for the commented-out command registration:
        ```typescript
        // context.subscriptions.push(vs.commands.registerCommand("flutter.createSampleProject",
        // 	(_) => this.runFunctionIfSupported(dartExtensionApi.flutterCreateSampleProject)));
        ```
    3. If the `flutter.createSampleProject` or similar commands are implemented in the future and they accept user inputs (e.g., project name, path) without sanitization, it could become a vulnerability.
    4. The `runFunctionIfSupported` function itself is safe, but it doesn't address the potential vulnerability of the function `f` (Dart extension API function) being called with unsanitized arguments.
    5. Imagine if `dartExtensionApi.flutterCreateSampleProject` in the future, when actually implemented, executes a shell command using the project name provided by the user. If this project name is not sanitized, an attacker could inject shell commands.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** This test case is for a hypothetical future version of the extension where `flutter.createSampleProject` command is implemented and takes project name as input. Assume this command is registered and implemented in `SdkCommands` like this (hypothetical code):
        ```typescript
        constructor(context: vs.ExtensionContext, private dartExtensionApi: any) {
            context.subscriptions.push(vs.commands.registerCommand("flutter.createSampleProject",
                (projectName) => this.runFunctionIfSupported(() => dartExtensionApi.flutterCreateSampleProject(projectName))));
        }
        ```
        And assume `dartExtensionApi.flutterCreateSampleProject` (hypothetically) executes a shell command like: `flutter create <projectName>`.
    2. **Trigger:**
        - Open VS Code with the Flutter extension installed (hypothetical future version).
        - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
        - Execute the command `flutter.createSampleProject`.
        - When prompted for the project name, enter a malicious payload like: `testproject ; touch /tmp/pwned`.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created. If it is, it indicates that the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` was executed, confirming the command injection vulnerability.
    4. **Expected Result:** The file `/tmp/pwned` should NOT be created. The extension should either sanitize the input or reject malicious input to prevent command injection.
    5. **Note:** This is a test case for a potential vulnerability in future implementations. The current code is not vulnerable to this as the command is commented out and no input processing is present.
