## Vulnerability Report: Command Injection via Custom Tool Scripts

This report details a command injection vulnerability found in the Dart Code extension related to the use of custom tool scripts in debug configurations.

- **Vulnerability Name**: Command Injection via Custom Tool Scripts

- **Description**:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious `launch.json` configuration for a Dart or Flutter debug session.
    2. This malicious configuration can specify a `customTool` script and `customToolReplacesArgs` within the debug configuration. This vulnerability affects configurations for Dart, Flutter, and WebDev tools where custom scripts can be defined.
    3. If the `customToolReplacesArgs` is set to a value that includes user-controlled arguments (like the target program or other arguments passed to the debugger), and the `customTool` script does not properly sanitize these arguments, it can lead to command injection.
    4. When a user starts a debug session using this crafted `launch.json`, the VS Code extension will execute the malicious script with attacker-controlled arguments, as defined by the `customTool` and `customToolReplacesArgs` settings. The extension uses `safeSpawn` and `usingCustomScript` functions to execute these custom scripts.

- **Impact**:
    - **High**: Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the machine running VS Code with the privileges of the VS Code process. This severe impact can lead to:
        - **Data exfiltration**: Access and theft of sensitive project files, user credentials, or other data accessible to the VS Code process.
        - **Installation of malware**: Introduction of persistent malware or backdoors to the user's system.
        - **Privilege escalation**: Potential to escalate privileges within the user's system, depending on the VS Code process's permissions and the attacker's crafted commands.
        - **Further compromise of the user's system**: Complete compromise of the development environment and potentially the user's entire machine, depending on the executed commands.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None. The code in `src/shared/utils/processes.ts` and `src/debug/dart_debug_impl.ts` does not implement any sanitization or validation of arguments passed to the custom tool script. While the project uses `safeSpawn` to execute commands, this function's argument quoting is insufficient to prevent command injection when user-controlled arguments are directly incorporated into the command execution, especially with complex shell commands or direct user control over parts of the command string.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Input sanitization**: The project must sanitize all user-provided arguments before passing them to the `customTool` script execution. Effective sanitization strategies include:
        - **Argument whitelisting**: Define and enforce a whitelist of allowed characters and argument structures.
        - **Encoding/escaping special characters**: Properly encode or escape special characters that could be interpreted by the shell to prevent command injection.
        - **Argument structure and content validation**: Implement robust validation of argument structure and content to ensure they conform to expected безопасны patterns.
    - **Restrict custom scripts from untrusted sources**: Implement security measures to restrict the use of custom scripts, especially from untrusted sources. This could involve:
        - **Workspace trust**: Only allow custom scripts from workspaces explicitly trusted by the user.
        - **User warnings**: Display clear warnings to users when custom scripts are being used, especially if they originate from shared or untrusted workspaces or repositories.

- **Preconditions**:
    1. An attacker must be able to influence the `launch.json` configuration used by the user. This can be achieved through various attack vectors:
        - **Social engineering**: Tricking a user into opening a workspace or project that contains a malicious `launch.json` configuration.
        - **Supply chain attacks**: Compromising a workspace, project template, or extension that users might download and use, injecting the malicious configuration.
        - **Compromised workspace settings**: If user or workspace settings are compromised, an attacker could directly modify the `launch.json` file.
    2. The user must initiate a debug session using a launch configuration that includes the malicious `customTool` and `customToolReplacesArgs` settings.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/shared/utils/processes.ts`
        ```typescript
        export function safeSpawn(workingDirectory: string | undefined, binPath: string, args: string[], env: { [key: string]: string | undefined } | undefined): SpawnedProcess {
            ...
            return child_process.spawn(binPath, args, { cwd: workingDirectory, env: customEnv }) as SpawnedProcess;
        }
        ```
        The `safeSpawn` function directly utilizes `child_process.spawn` with the provided `binPath` and `args` without any input sanitization. This function is intended to enhance security by managing process spawning, but it does not address command injection vulnerabilities arising from unsanitized arguments.

    2. **File:** `/code/src/debug/dart_debug_impl.ts`
        ```typescript
        private buildExecutionInfo(binPath: string, args: DartLaunchArgs): ExecutionInfo {
            ...
            const customTool = {
                replacesArgs: args.customToolReplacesArgs,
                script: args.customTool,
            };
            const execution = usingCustomScript(
                binPath,
                allArgs,
                customTool,
            );
            allArgs = execution.args;
            ...
        }
        ```
        The `buildExecutionInfo` function within `DartDebugSession` prepares execution details and calls `usingCustomScript`. It directly incorporates user-provided `customTool` and `customToolReplacesArgs` from the launch configuration into the execution parameters.

    3. **File:** `/code/src/shared/utils.ts`
        ```typescript
        export function usingCustomScript(
            binPath: string,
            binArgs: string[],
            customTool: CustomScript | undefined,
        ): ExecutionInfo {
            if (customTool?.script) {
                binPath = customTool.script;
                if (customTool.replacesArgs)
                    binArgs = binArgs.slice(customTool.replacesArgs);
            }

            return {
                args: allArgs,
                executable: execution.executable,
            };
        }
        ```
        The `usingCustomScript` function is the core of the vulnerability. It directly replaces the `binPath` and modifies `binArgs` based on the user-supplied `customTool` and `customToolReplacesArgs` settings from `launch.json`. Critically, it performs no sanitization of these user-provided values before constructing the command that will be executed by `safeSpawn`.

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. **Setup:** Create a new Dart project in VS Code.
    2. **Malicious Script Creation:** Create a new script file in the project root named `malicious_script.sh` (for Linux/macOS) or `malicious_script.bat` (for Windows).
        - For `malicious_script.sh`:
            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash
            mkdir -p `dirname "$0"`/has_run && touch `dirname "$0"`/has_run/pwned
            dart "$@"
            ```
        - For `malicious_script.bat`:
            ```batch
            @echo off
            mkdir "%~dp0has_run" 2>nul
            echo > "%~dp0has_run\has_run.txt"
            dart %*
            ```
        *(Note: For `.bat`, remove the shebang line and adjust the path in `launch.json` accordingly.)*
    3. **Modify `launch.json`:** Edit the `.vscode/launch.json` file to include a new debug configuration that leverages the `customTool` setting:
        ```json
        {
            "version": "0.2.0",
            "configurations": [
                {
                    "name": "Dart: Run Malicious Script",
                    "type": "dart",
                    "request": "launch",
                    "program": "bin/main.dart",
                    "customTool": "${workspaceFolder}/malicious_script.sh", // Adjust to "${workspaceFolder}\\malicious_script.bat" for Windows
                    "customToolReplacesArgs": 1,
                    "toolArgs": ["--arg"]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        *(Ensure the `customTool` path is correctly pointing to the created script for your operating system.)*
    4. **Set Breakpoint & Run:** Open `bin/main.dart`, set a breakpoint, and select the newly created "Dart: Run Malicious Script" debug configuration to start debugging.
    5. **Verification:** After the debug session starts and terminates, check for the indicator of successful command injection.
        - Look for a new folder named `has_run` in the project root.
        - Inside `has_run`, check for the presence of a file named `pwned` (for `.sh`) or `has_run.txt` (for `.bat`).
    6. **Confirmation:** If the `has_run` folder and the respective file within it exist, it confirms that the `malicious_script` was executed, demonstrating successful command injection. This indicates the vulnerability is present and exploitable.
