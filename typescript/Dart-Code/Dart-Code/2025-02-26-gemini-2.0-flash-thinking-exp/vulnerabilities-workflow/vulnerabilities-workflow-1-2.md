- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Content Security Policy in DevTools Webviews
  **Description:**
  The DevTools webviews used by the extension are created with a Content Security Policy (CSP) that is too permissive. An attacker who can influence configuration values or injected project inputs (for example, by modifying a configuration file or a project setting) may be able to control the URL or content loaded in a DevTools webview. Because the CSP still allows inline script execution and loading from non–trusted origins, this can result in execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the extension.
  **Impact:**
  - Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the VS Code extension context.
  - Unauthorized access to internal debugging data and state.
  - Potential privilege escalation that could ultimately compromise the host VS Code environment.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The extension automatically injects a meta tag enforcing a CSP into all DevTools webviews.
  - However, the directives in the policy still permit inline scripts and do not restrict external resource loading sufficiently.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Tighten the CSP by whitelisting only trusted sources.
  - Replace the use of `'unsafe-inline'` with a nonce-based or hash-based mechanism to control script execution.
  **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker must be able to manipulate or supply values (e.g., via configuration files or project settings) that influence the creation and content of the DevTools webview.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The modules that instantiate the DevTools webviews inject a meta tag for applying a CSP.
  - Review reveals that while the policy is present, its directives do not adequately restrict dangerous operations such as inline script execution or the loading of scripts from non–trusted external sources.
  - This leaves the webviews potentially vulnerable if an attacker can supply malicious URLs or configuration values.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Modify an applicable configuration or project file to set the DevTools URL (or similar parameter) to an attacker-controlled value that includes a malicious inline script or reference.
  2. Launch the extension and open the DevTools webview.
  3. Use the browser’s developer tools to inspect the applied CSP; verify that the policy still permits inline scripts and loads resources from external origins.
  4. Attempt to deliver and execute a crafted malicious payload via the webview (for example, by including an inline `<script>` tag in the controlled URL).
  5. Confirm that the malicious script gets executed in the webview’s context, demonstrating the flaw.
  6. Finally, apply the missing mitigations (tightened CSP directives and nonce-/hash–based restrictions) and verify that the malicious payload is blocked.
