* Vulnerability Name: Custom Script Command Injection
    * Description:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious script containing shell commands (e.g., to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code).
        2. The attacker creates a malicious Dart/Flutter project and configures the VS Code launch settings or project settings to use this malicious script as a custom tool for Dart or Flutter commands (e.g., `dart.customTool`, `flutter.customTool`, `dartTest.customTool`, `flutterTest.customTool`, `flutterDaemonScript`, `flutterDevToolsScript`, `flutterDoctorScript`, `flutterRunScript`, `flutterTestScript`, `flutterToolsScript`).
        3. The attacker convinces a developer to open the malicious project in VS Code and start a debug session or run a Dart/Flutter command that utilizes the custom tool setting.
        4. When the Dart Code extension executes the Dart or Flutter tool, it uses the path provided in the custom tool setting without sufficient validation.
        5. The operating system executes the malicious script provided by the attacker.
        6. The injected shell commands within the malicious script are executed on the developer's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.
    * Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, install malware, or compromise the developer's system.
    * Vulnerability Rank: High
    * Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The code uses the user-provided custom script path directly without validation or sanitization. Based on the analyzed files from this batch and previous batches, no mitigations are implemented.
    * Missing Mitigations:
        - Implement robust path validation and sanitization for custom script paths.
        - Consider restricting custom script paths to a predefined safe directory or using a more secure mechanism for custom tool execution.
        - Warn users about the security risks of using custom scripts and recommend caution when using projects from untrusted sources.
    * Preconditions:
        - The attacker can influence the VS Code settings for a Dart/Flutter project, specifically the custom tool settings (e.g., `dart.customTool`, `flutter.customTool`, `dartTest.customTool`, `flutterTest.customTool`, `flutterDaemonScript`, `flutterDevToolsScript`, `flutterDoctorScript`, `flutterRunScript`, `flutterTestScript`, `flutterToolsScript`). This can be achieved by:
            - Socially engineering a developer to open a malicious project.
            - Compromising a project repository and injecting malicious settings into `.vscode/settings.json` or `.vscode/launch.json`.
    * Source Code Analysis:
        1. The `usingCustomScript` function in `src/shared/utils/process.ts` (from previous analysis) takes a `customScript.script` path from configurations and uses it as the executable without sanitization.
        2. Debug session implementations (e.g., `DartDebugSession`, `FlutterTestDebugSession`, `FlutterDebugSession`, `WebDebugSession`) in `src/debug/` use `buildExecutionInfo` to construct command execution details, which eventually leads to the use of `usingCustomScript`. For example, in `flutter_debug_impl.ts` (from previous analysis):
            ```typescript
            let execution = usingCustomScript(
                path.join(args.flutterSdkPath!, flutterPath),
                allArgs,
                customTool,
            );
            ```
            This pattern is repeated in `dart_test_debug_impl.ts`, `flutter_test_debug_impl.ts`, and `web_debug_impl.ts` (from previous analysis).
        3. The `safeSpawn` function in `src/shared/processes.ts` (from previous analysis) then executes the path provided as `executable`, which can be the malicious script.
        4. Examining `config.ts` (from previous analysis) and `debug_config_provider.ts` (from previous analysis), reveals how these settings are read. The `Config` class reads settings using `workspace.getConfiguration("dart")`. Methods like `get customDartDapPath(): undefined | string { return resolvePaths(this.getConfig<null | string>("customDartDapPath", null)); }` show how `customDartDapPath` and similar settings are accessed. The `resolvePaths` function is used, which resolves paths relative to workspace, but does not perform security validation. The file `/code/src/extension/providers/debug_config_provider.ts` (from previous batch) shows the logic for resolving debug configurations but does not introduce any new mitigations for custom scripts.
        5. The file `/code/src/extension/utils.ts` (from previous batch) contains `escapeShell` function. While this function is intended for escaping shell arguments, it is not used to validate or sanitize the path to the custom script itself in the context of `usingCustomScript`. The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation *before* passing the path to `safeSpawn`.
        6. Furthermore, analysis of `/code/src/test/flutter_debug/flutter_run.test.ts` (from current batch), `/code/src/test/dart_debug/dart_test.test.ts` (from current batch), `/code/src/test/web_debug/debug/web.test.ts` (from previous analysis), `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/debug/flutter_run.test.ts` (from current batch), `/code/src/test/flutter_test_debug/debug/flutter_test.test.ts` (from current batch) and `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/extension.test.ts` (from current batch) shows test cases and configurations that explicitly utilize the `customTool` functionality and other custom script settings, confirming that this feature is actively used within the extension's debugging capabilities and other functionalities. The file `/code/src/test/dart_test_debug/dart_test.test.ts` in the current batch contains the test case:
            ```typescript
            it("can run using a custom tool", async () => {
                const root = fsPath(helloWorldFolder);
                const hasRunFile = prepareHasRunFile(root, "dart_test");

                const config = await startDebugger(dc, helloWorldTestMainFile, {
                    customTool: path.join(root, `scripts/custom_test.${customScriptExt}`),
                    // Replace "run --no-spawn-devtools test:test"
                    customToolReplacesArgs: 3,
                    enableAsserts: false,
                    noDebug: true,
                });
                // ...
            });
            ```
            This test case demonstrates the usage of the `customTool` setting in debug configurations, highlighting the potential attack vector. Similar test cases are also present in `/code/src/test/flutter_debug/flutter_run.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/debug/flutter_run.test.ts` and `/code/src/test/flutter_test_debug/debug/flutter_test.test.ts` from the current batch.
        7. Reviewing the files in the current batch, specifically `/code/src/extension/sdk/utils.ts` (from previous batch), it uses `runToolProcess` function. This function, along with `safeSpawn` from previous analysis, is central to understanding how external commands are executed. The `runToolProcess` function is used in `SdkUtils.runCustomGetSDKCommand` to execute user-defined SDK commands.  This command execution also uses `runToolProcess`. Although the arguments are likely controlled by the extension, the `executable` path is derived from user configuration via `config.getDartSdkCommand` or `config.getFlutterSdkCommand`, similar to the custom tool scripts and therefore is also potentially vulnerable if user-provided SDK commands are not validated properly.
        8. The file `/code/src/test/debug_helpers.ts` from the current batch shows the usage of `extApi.safeToolSpawn`:
            ```typescript
            export function spawnDartProcessPaused(program: Uri, cwd: Uri, ...vmArgs: string[]): DartProcess {
                // ...
                const process = extApi.safeToolSpawn(
                    cwdPath,
                    dartPath,
                    allArgs,
                );
                // ...
            }
            ```
            This confirms that `safeToolSpawn` is still the function used to execute external commands, and if the `executable` argument is not validated, command injection is possible.
        9. The file `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/extension.test.ts` shows that Bazel projects utilize custom scripts for various Flutter commands via configuration settings like `flutterDaemonScript`, `flutterDevToolsScript`, `flutterDoctorScript`, `flutterRunScript`, `flutterTestScript`, and `flutterToolsScript`. These settings, similar to `customTool`, are read from workspace configuration and if pointing to malicious scripts, can lead to command injection when these commands are executed by the extension. For example:
            ```typescript
            assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterDaemonScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_daemon.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
            assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterDevToolsScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_devtools.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
            assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterDoctorScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_doctor.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
            assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterRunScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_run.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
            assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterTestScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_test.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
            assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterToolsScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_tools.sh"), replacesArgs: 0 });
            ```

        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            subgraph Debug Session

            subgraph SDK Commands
                H[VS Code Configuration (dart.getDartSdkCommand/flutter.getFlutterSdkCommand)] --> I(SdkUtils.runCustomGetSDKCommand);

                J --> F;

            end
        ```
    * Security Test Case:
        1. Create a malicious script (e.g., `malicious_script.sh` on Linux/macOS or `malicious_script.bat` on Windows) that executes harmful commands (e.g., exfiltrates environment variables, creates a backdoor).
        2. Create a new Dart or Flutter project.
        3. In the `.vscode/launch.json` or user settings, configure one of the custom script settings (e.g., `dart.customTool`, `flutter.customTool`, `dartTest.customTool`, `flutterTest.customTool`, `flutterDaemonScript`, `flutterDevToolsScript`, `flutterDoctorScript`, `flutterRunScript`, `flutterTestScript`, `flutterToolsScript`) to point to the malicious script's absolute path. For Bazel specific settings like `flutterDaemonScript`, you may need to create a Bazel Flutter project to test these configurations.
        4. Open the project in VS Code and trigger the functionality that uses the configured custom script. For example:
            - For `dart.customTool`/`flutter.customTool`/`dartTest.customTool`/`flutterTest.customTool`: Start a debug session (e.g., Flutter Launch, Dart Test).
            - For `flutterDaemonScript`: Reload the VS Code extension or trigger a daemon-related command.
            - For `flutterDoctorScript`: Execute the "Flutter: Doctor" command.
        5. Observe that the malicious script executes when the corresponding action is triggered, confirming command injection. For example, verify the exfiltration of environment variables to a remote server or the creation of a backdoor file. You can verify this test case manually by following these steps or by creating an automated test using VS Code extension testing framework, where you programmatically create a workspace, configure settings, and trigger debug sessions/commands to observe the execution of the malicious script. The existing test files like `/code/src/test/flutter_debug/flutter_run.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/dart_debug/dart_test.test.ts` and `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/extension.test.ts` provide examples of how to programmatically configure and run debug sessions and test extension configurations for testing purposes, which can be adapted to create an automated security test case.
