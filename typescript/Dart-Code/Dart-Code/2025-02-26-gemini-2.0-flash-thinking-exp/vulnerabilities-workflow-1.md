## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines a list of identified vulnerabilities in the Dart Code extension for VS Code. Each vulnerability is detailed with its description, impact, severity, current mitigation status, suggested missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and a security test case to validate the vulnerability.

### 1. Command Injection in Debug Configurations via Program Arguments

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Debug Configurations via Program Arguments
- **Description:**
  The Dart debug adapter, specifically in `dart_debug_impl.ts`, allows users to define program arguments in debug configurations (`launch.json`). These arguments are passed directly to the Dart VM or Flutter command execution via `safeSpawn`. If a malicious workspace provides a crafted debug configuration with malicious arguments, it could lead to command injection when the user starts debugging with that configuration. This vulnerability is similar to "Command Injection in Flutter Task Provider via Task Arguments", but in the context of VS Code Debug Configurations.

  Step-by-step trigger:
  1. An attacker creates a malicious Dart/Flutter project.
  2. The attacker crafts a malicious debug configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` within the project. This debug configuration targets a Dart or Flutter launch type and injects malicious commands into the `args` array within the configuration. For example, for a Dart launch configuration:
     ```json
     {
         "version": "0.2.0",
         "configurations": [
             {
                 "name": "Dart-Code-Pwned",
                 "type": "dart",
                 "request": "launch",
                 "program": "bin/main.dart",
                 "args": [
                     "&& touch /tmp/dartcode_debug_pwned.txt"
                 ]
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
  3. The attacker distributes this malicious project (e.g., via a public repository or by tricking a user into downloading it).
  4. A victim user opens the malicious Dart/Flutter project in VSCode with the Dart Code extension installed.
  5. The victim user opens the Run and Debug view in VSCode (e.g., by clicking on the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar).
  6. The victim user selects the malicious debug configuration (e.g., "Dart-Code-Pwned") from the dropdown.
  7. The victim user starts debugging by clicking the "Start Debugging" button (or pressing F5).
  8. The Dart Code extension's debug adapter executes the Dart VM or Flutter command with the attacker-controlled arguments without proper sanitization.
  9. The injected commands (e.g., `&& touch /tmp/dartcode_debug_pwned.txt`) are executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the machine running VSCode with the Dart Code extension. This could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, or any other malicious actions the attacker desires.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code directly uses the provided debug configuration arguments without any sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for program arguments in debug configurations in `DartDebugSession` and `FlutterDebugSession`. This should prevent the injection of shell commands or any potentially harmful characters.
  - Workspace Trust: Leverage VSCode's Workspace Trust feature to restrict the execution of debug configurations from untrusted workspaces. VSCode should prompt users to explicitly trust workspaces before allowing the execution of debug configurations defined within them.
  - User Confirmation: Before executing any debug configuration with custom program arguments, especially those defined in workspace configurations, display a prompt to the user, clearly warning about the potential security risks and asking for explicit confirmation to proceed.
  - Principle of Least Privilege: If custom debug configurations are absolutely necessary, consider running the debuggee in a sandboxed environment with restricted privileges to minimize the potential damage from malicious scripts.
- **Preconditions:**
  - The user must open a workspace that contains a malicious `.vscode/launch.json` file that defines a malicious debug configuration with command injection in the arguments or the user manually configures a debug configuration with malicious arguments.
  - The user must execute this malicious debug configuration through VSCode's debug system.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - `/code/src/debug/dart_debug_impl.ts`: The `launchRequest` method in `DartDebugSession` (and similarly in `FlutterDebugSession` and `WebDebugSession`) calls `spawnProcess` or `spawnRemoteEditorProcess` to start the debuggee process.
  - `/code/src/debug/dart_debug_impl.ts`: The `buildExecutionInfo` method is responsible for constructing the command line arguments for the spawned process. It takes arguments from `DartLaunchArgs`, including `args.args` which is derived from the `launch.json` configuration.
  - `/code/src/shared/processes.ts`: The `safeSpawn` function executes the command with the provided arguments. There is no sanitization of the arguments before being passed to `safeSpawn`.
  ```typescript
  // /code/src/debug/dart_debug_impl.ts
  protected async spawnProcess(args: DartLaunchArgs): Promise<SpawnedProcess> {
      let dartPath = path.join(args.dartSdkPath, dartVMPath);
      const execution = this.buildExecutionInfo(dartPath, args);
      dartPath = execution.executable;
      const appArgs = execution.args; // appArgs is constructed with user-controlled args

      this.log(`Spawning ${dartPath} with args ${JSON.stringify(appArgs)}`);
      if (args.cwd)
          this.log(`..  in ${args.cwd}`);
      const env = Object.assign({}, args.toolEnv, args.env);
      const process = safeSpawn(args.cwd, dartPath, appArgs, env); // Vulnerability: appArgs is not sanitized

      this.log(`    PID: ${process.pid}`);

      return process;
  }

  // /code/src/debug/dart_debug_impl.ts
  private buildExecutionInfo(binPath: string, args: DartLaunchArgs): ExecutionInfo {
      let allArgs: string[] = [];

      if (args.vmAdditionalArgs)
          allArgs = allArgs.concat(args.vmAdditionalArgs);

      // ... other args ...

      if (args.args) // Vulnerability: args.args from launch.json is used directly
          allArgs = allArgs.concat(args.args);

      return {
          args: allArgs,
          executable: execution.executable,
      };
  }
  ```
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Create a malicious Dart project (e.g., `flutter create malicious_debug_project` or `dart create malicious_debug_project`).
  2. Navigate to the newly created project directory in your terminal.
  3. Create a `.vscode` directory inside the project root if it doesn't exist: `mkdir .vscode`
  4. Create a `launch.json` file inside the `.vscode` directory and add the following configuration for Dart project (for Flutter project change "type" to "flutter" and "program" to "lib/main.dart"):
  ```json
  {
      "version": "0.2.0",
      "configurations": [
          {
              "name": "Dart-Code-Pwned",
              "type": "dart",
              "request": "launch",
              "program": "bin/main.dart",
              "args": [
                  "&& touch /tmp/dartcode_debug_pwned.txt"
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
  5. Open the `malicious_debug_project` in VSCode with the Dart Code extension installed.
  6. Open the Run and Debug view in VSCode. You should see the "Dart-Code-Pwned" configuration.
  7. Select the "Dart-Code-Pwned" configuration and start debugging.
  8. After the debug session starts (and likely fails to run the actual program due to command injection), check if the file `/tmp/dartcode_debug_pwned.txt` has been created.
  9. If the file exists, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed. The malicious arguments in `launch.json` were successfully executed by the Dart Code extension when starting the debug session.

### 2. Command Injection in Flutter Task Provider via Task Arguments

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Flutter Task Provider via Task Arguments
- **Description:**
  The Flutter Task Provider in `flutter_task_provider.ts` allows users to define Flutter tasks with custom arguments. These arguments are passed directly to the `flutter` command execution. If a malicious workspace provides a crafted task definition with malicious arguments, it could lead to command injection when the user executes the task. This is similar to the "Command Injection via Custom Debug Scripts" vulnerability, but in the context of VS Code Tasks.

  Step-by-step trigger:
  1. An attacker creates a malicious Dart/Flutter project.
  2. The attacker crafts a malicious task definition in `.vscode/tasks.json` within the project. This task definition targets the `flutter` task type and injects malicious commands into the `args` array. For example:
     ```json
     {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "type": "flutter",
                "command": "flutter",
                "args": [
                    "build",
                    "apk",
                    "&& touch /tmp/dartcode_task_pwned.txt"
                ],
                "problemMatcher": []
            }
        ]
     }
     ```
  3. The attacker distributes this malicious project (e.g., via a public repository or by tricking a user into downloading it).
  4. A victim user opens the malicious Dart/Flutter project in VSCode with the Dart Code extension installed.
  5. The victim user opens the Tasks explorer in VSCode (e.g., by running "Tasks: Run Task").
  6. The victim user executes the malicious Flutter task defined in `.vscode/tasks.json`.
  7. The Dart Code extension's `FlutterTaskProvider` executes the `flutter` command with the attacker-controlled arguments without proper sanitization.
  8. The injected commands (e.g., `&& touch /tmp/dartcode_task_pwned.txt`) are executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the machine running VSCode with the Dart Code extension. This could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, installation of malware, or any other malicious actions the attacker desires.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code directly uses the provided task arguments without any sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization for task arguments in `FlutterTaskProvider`. This should prevent the injection of shell commands or any potentially harmful characters.
  - Workspace Trust: Leverage VSCode's Workspace Trust feature to restrict the execution of tasks from untrusted workspaces. VSCode should prompt users to explicitly trust workspaces before allowing the execution of tasks defined within them.
  - User Confirmation: Before executing any Flutter task with custom arguments, especially those defined in workspace tasks, display a prompt to the user, clearly warning about the potential security risks and asking for explicit confirmation to proceed.
  - Principle of Least Privilege: If custom tasks are absolutely necessary, consider running them in a sandboxed environment with restricted privileges to minimize the potential damage from malicious scripts.
- **Preconditions:**
  - The user must open a workspace that contains a malicious `.vscode/tasks.json` file that defines a malicious Flutter task with command injection in the arguments or the user manually configures a task with malicious arguments.
  - The user must execute this malicious Flutter task through VSCode's task system.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - `/code/src/extension/flutter/flutter_task_provider.ts`: The `createTask` method in `BaseTaskProvider` (extended by `FlutterTaskProvider`) is responsible for creating VS Code tasks. It takes arguments directly from the task definition and passes them to the `flutter` command.
  - `/code/src/extension/dart/dart_task_provider.ts`: The `createTask` function in `BaseTaskProvider` directly uses the provided `definition.args` to construct the `ProcessExecution`. There is no sanitization of these arguments.
  ```typescript
  // /code/src/extension/dart/dart_task_provider.ts
  protected createTask(workspaceFolder: vs.WorkspaceFolder, projectFolder: vs.Uri, command: string, args: string[], definition?: DartTaskDefinition): vs.Task {
      definition = definition || {
          args,
          command,
          projectPath: fsPath(projectFolder),
          type: this.type,
          workspaceFolder: workspaceFolder.name,
      };

      const task = new vs.Task(
          definition,
          workspaceFolder,
          definition.command,
          FlutterTaskProvider.type, // Incorrect, should be this.type, but not critical for vuln
          new vs.ProcessExecution(definition.command, definition.args, { // Vulnerability here: definition.args is not sanitized
              cwd: fsPath(projectFolder),
              env: this.getEnvVars(definition),
          }),
          definition.problemMatcher,
      );
      task.group = vs.TaskGroup.Build;
      return task;
  }
  ```
  - The `provideTasks` method in `FlutterTaskProvider` uses `createTask` to generate tasks based on predefined commands and arguments. However, if a user were to define their own tasks in `tasks.json` with type "flutter", these tasks would also be created using `createTask` and be vulnerable if malicious arguments are provided.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Create a malicious Flutter project (e.g., `flutter create malicious_flutter_task_project`).
  2. Navigate to the newly created project directory in your terminal.
  3. Create a `.vscode` directory inside the project root if it doesn't exist: `mkdir .vscode`
  4. Create a `tasks.json` file inside the `.vscode` directory and add the following configuration:
  ```json
  {
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "tasks": [
          {
              "type": "flutter",
              "command": "flutter",
              "args": [
                  "build",
                  "apk",
                  "&& touch /tmp/dartcode_task_pwned.txt"
              ],
              "problemMatcher": []
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
  5. Open the `malicious_flutter_task_project` in VSCode with the Dart Code extension installed.
  6. Open the Tasks explorer in VSCode (e.g., by running "Tasks: Run Task"). You should see a task named "flutter".
  7. Run the "flutter" task.
  8. After the task execution completes, check if the file `/tmp/dartcode_task_pwned.txt` has been created.
  9. If the file exists, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed. The malicious arguments in `tasks.json` were successfully executed by the Dart Code extension when running the Flutter task.

### 3. Insecure Content Security Policy in DevTools Webviews

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Content Security Policy in DevTools Webviews
- **Description:**
  The DevTools webviews used by the extension are created with a Content Security Policy (CSP) that is too permissive. An attacker who can influence configuration values or injected project inputs (for example, by modifying a configuration file or a project setting) may be able to control the URL or content loaded in a DevTools webview. Because the CSP still allows inline script execution and loading from non–trusted origins, this can result in execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the extension.
- **Impact:**
  - Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the VS Code extension context.
  - Unauthorized access to internal debugging data and state.
  - Potential privilege escalation that could ultimately compromise the host VS Code environment.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The extension automatically injects a meta tag enforcing a CSP into all DevTools webviews.
  - However, the directives in the policy still permit inline scripts and do not restrict external resource loading sufficiently.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Tighten the CSP by whitelisting only trusted sources.
  - Replace the use of `'unsafe-inline'` with a nonce-based or hash-based mechanism to control script execution.
- **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker must be able to manipulate or supply values (e.g., via configuration files or project settings) that influence the creation and content of the DevTools webview.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The modules that instantiate the DevTools webviews inject a meta tag for applying a CSP.
  - Review reveals that while the policy is present, its directives do not adequately restrict dangerous operations such as inline script execution or the loading of scripts from non–trusted external sources.
  - This leaves the webviews potentially vulnerable if an attacker can supply malicious URLs or configuration values.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Modify an applicable configuration or project file to set the DevTools URL (or similar parameter) to an attacker-controlled value that includes a malicious inline script or reference.
  2. Launch the extension and open the DevTools webview.
  3. Use the browser’s developer tools to inspect the applied CSP; verify that the policy still permits inline scripts and loads resources from external origins.
  4. Attempt to deliver and execute a crafted malicious payload via the webview (for example, by including an inline `<script>` tag in the controlled URL).
  5. Confirm that the malicious script gets executed in the webview’s context, demonstrating the flaw.
  6. Finally, apply the missing mitigations (tightened CSP directives and nonce-/hash–based restrictions) and verify that the malicious payload is blocked.

### 4. Custom Script Command Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Custom Script Command Injection
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious script containing shell commands (e.g., to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code).
    2. The attacker creates a malicious Dart/Flutter project and configures the VS Code launch settings or project settings to use this malicious script as a custom tool for Dart or Flutter commands (e.g., `dart.customTool`, `flutter.customTool`, `dartTest.customTool`, `flutterTest.customTool`, `flutterDaemonScript`, `flutterDevToolsScript`, `flutterDoctorScript`, `flutterRunScript`, `flutterTestScript`, `flutterToolsScript`).
    3. The attacker convinces a developer to open the malicious project in VS Code and start a debug session or run a Dart/Flutter command that utilizes the custom tool setting.
    4. When the Dart Code extension executes the Dart or Flutter tool, it uses the path provided in the custom tool setting without sufficient validation.
    5. The operating system executes the malicious script provided by the attacker.
    6. The injected shell commands within the malicious script are executed on the developer's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, install malware, or compromise the developer's system.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code uses the user-provided custom script path directly without validation or sanitization. Based on the analyzed files from this batch and previous batches, no mitigations are implemented.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust path validation and sanitization for custom script paths.
    - Consider restricting custom script paths to a predefined safe directory or using a more secure mechanism for custom tool execution.
    - Warn users about the security risks of using custom scripts and recommend caution when using projects from untrusted sources.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker can influence the VS Code settings for a Dart/Flutter project, specifically the custom tool settings (e.g., `dart.customTool`, `flutter.customTool`, `dartTest.customTool`, `flutterTest.customTool`, `flutterDaemonScript`, `flutterDevToolsScript`, `flutterDoctorScript`, `flutterRunScript`, `flutterTestScript`, `flutterToolsScript`). This can be achieved by:
        - Socially engineering a developer to open a malicious project.
        - Compromising a project repository and injecting malicious settings into `.vscode/settings.json` or `.vscode/launch.json`.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The `usingCustomScript` function in `src/shared/utils/process.ts` (from previous analysis) takes a `customScript.script` path from configurations and uses it as the executable without sanitization.
    2. Debug session implementations (e.g., `DartDebugSession`, `FlutterTestDebugSession`, `FlutterDebugSession`, `WebDebugSession`) in `src/debug/` use `buildExecutionInfo` to construct command execution details, which eventually leads to the use of `usingCustomScript`. For example, in `flutter_debug_impl.ts` (from previous analysis):
        ```typescript
        let execution = usingCustomScript(
            path.join(args.flutterSdkPath!, flutterPath),
            allArgs,
            customTool,
        );
        ```
        This pattern is repeated in `dart_test_debug_impl.ts`, `flutter_test_debug_impl.ts`, and `web_debug_impl.ts` (from previous analysis).
    3. The `safeSpawn` function in `src/shared/processes.ts` (from previous analysis) then executes the path provided as `executable`, which can be the malicious script.
    4. Examining `config.ts` (from previous analysis) and `debug_config_provider.ts` (from previous analysis), reveals how these settings are read. The `Config` class reads settings using `workspace.getConfiguration("dart")`. Methods like `get customDartDapPath(): undefined | string { return resolvePaths(this.getConfig<null | string>("customDartDapPath", null)); }` show how `customDartDapPath` and similar settings are accessed. The `resolvePaths` function is used, which resolves paths relative to workspace, but does not perform security validation. The file `/code/src/extension/providers/debug_config_provider.ts` (from previous batch) shows the logic for resolving debug configurations but does not introduce any new mitigations for custom scripts.
    5. The file `/code/src/extension/utils.ts` (from previous batch) contains `escapeShell` function. While this function is intended for escaping shell arguments, it is not used to validate or sanitize the path to the custom script itself in the context of `usingCustomScript`. The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation *before* passing the path to `safeSpawn`.
    6. Furthermore, analysis of `/code/src/test/flutter_debug/flutter_run.test.ts` (from current batch), `/code/src/test/dart_debug/dart_test.test.ts` (from current batch), `/code/src/test/web_debug/debug/web.test.ts` (from previous analysis), `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/debug/flutter_run.test.ts` (from current batch), `/code/src/test/flutter_test_debug/debug/flutter_test.test.ts` (from current batch) and `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/extension.test.ts` (from current batch) shows test cases and configurations that explicitly utilize the `customTool` functionality and other custom script settings, confirming that this feature is actively used within the extension's debugging capabilities and other functionalities. The file `/code/src/test/dart_test_debug/dart_test.test.ts` in the current batch contains the test case:
        ```typescript
        it("can run using a custom tool", async () => {
            const root = fsPath(helloWorldFolder);
            const hasRunFile = prepareHasRunFile(root, "dart_test");

            const config = await startDebugger(dc, helloWorldTestMainFile, {
                customTool: path.join(root, `scripts/custom_test.${customScriptExt}`),
                // Replace "run --no-spawn-devtools test:test"
                customToolReplacesArgs: 3,
                enableAsserts: false,
                noDebug: true,
            });
            // ...
        });
        ```
        This test case demonstrates the usage of the `customTool` setting in debug configurations, highlighting the potential attack vector. Similar test cases are also present in `/code/src/test/flutter_debug/flutter_run.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/debug/flutter_run.test.ts` and `/code/src/test/flutter_test_debug/debug/flutter_test.test.ts` from the current batch.
    7. Reviewing the files in the current batch, specifically `/code/src/extension/sdk/utils.ts` (from previous batch), it uses `runToolProcess` function. This function, along with `safeSpawn` from previous analysis, is central to understanding how external commands are executed. The `runToolProcess` function is used in `SdkUtils.runCustomGetSDKCommand` to execute user-defined SDK commands.  This command execution also uses `runToolProcess`. Although the arguments are likely controlled by the extension, the `executable` path is derived from user configuration via `config.getDartSdkCommand` or `config.getFlutterSdkCommand`, similar to the custom tool scripts and therefore is also potentially vulnerable if user-provided SDK commands are not validated properly.
    8. The file `/code/src/test/debug_helpers.ts` from the current batch shows the usage of `extApi.safeToolSpawn`:
        ```typescript
        export function spawnDartProcessPaused(program: Uri, cwd: Uri, ...vmArgs: string[]): DartProcess {
            // ...
            const process = extApi.safeToolSpawn(
                cwdPath,
                dartPath,
                allArgs,
            );
            // ...
        }
        ```
        This confirms that `safeToolSpawn` is still the function used to execute external commands, and if the `executable` argument is not validated, command injection is possible.
    9. The file `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/extension.test.ts` shows that Bazel projects utilize custom scripts for various Flutter commands via configuration settings like `flutterDaemonScript`, `flutterDevToolsScript`, `flutterDoctorScript`, `flutterRunScript`, `flutterTestScript`, and `flutterToolsScript`. These settings, similar to `customTool`, are read from workspace configuration and if pointing to malicious scripts, can lead to command injection when these commands are executed by the extension. For example:
        ```typescript
        assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterDaemonScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_daemon.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
        assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterDevToolsScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_devtools.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
        assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterDoctorScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_doctor.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
        assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterRunScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_run.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
        assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterTestScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_test.sh"), replacesArgs: 1 });
        assert.deepStrictEqual(workspaceContext.config?.flutterToolsScript, { script: path.join(fsPath(flutterBazelRoot), "scripts/custom_tools.sh"), replacesArgs: 0 });
        ```

        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            subgraph Debug Session
                A[VS Code Launch Request (with customTool setting)] --> B(FlutterDebugSession.launchRequest);
                B --> C(FlutterDebugSession.spawnProcess);

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious script (e.g., `malicious_script.sh` on Linux/macOS or `malicious_script.bat` on Windows) that executes harmful commands (e.g., exfiltrates environment variables, creates a backdoor).
    2. Create a new Dart or Flutter project.
    3. In the `.vscode/launch.json` or user settings, configure one of the custom script settings (e.g., `dart.customTool`, `flutter.customTool`, `dartTest.customTool`, `flutterTest.customTool`, `flutterDaemonScript`, `flutterDevToolsScript`, `flutterDoctorScript`, `flutterRunScript`, `flutterTestScript`, `flutterToolsScript`) to point to the malicious script's absolute path. For Bazel specific settings like `flutterDaemonScript`, you may need to create a Bazel Flutter project to test these configurations.
    4. Open the project in VS Code and trigger the functionality that uses the configured custom script. For example:
        - For `dart.customTool`/`flutter.customTool`/`dartTest.customTool`/`flutterTest.customTool`: Start a debug session (e.g., Flutter Launch, Dart Test).
        - For `flutterDaemonScript`: Reload the VS Code extension or trigger a daemon-related command.
        - For `flutterDoctorScript`: Execute the "Flutter: Doctor" command.
    5. Observe that the malicious script executes when the corresponding action is triggered, confirming command injection. For example, verify the exfiltration of environment variables to a remote server or the creation of a backdoor file. You can verify this test case manually by following these steps or by creating an automated test using VS Code extension testing framework, where you programmatically create a workspace, configure settings, and trigger debug sessions/commands to observe the execution of the malicious script. The existing test files like `/code/src/test/flutter_debug/flutter_run.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/dart_debug/dart_test.test.ts` and `/code/src/test/flutter_bazel/extension.test.ts` provide examples of how to programmatically configure and run debug sessions and test extension configurations for testing purposes, which can be adapted to create an automated security test case.
