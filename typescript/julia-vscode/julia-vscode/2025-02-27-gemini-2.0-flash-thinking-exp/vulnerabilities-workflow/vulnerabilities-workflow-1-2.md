Based on your instructions and the provided vulnerability list, here's the updated list after applying the filters:

```markdown
```

**Explanation of why the list is empty:**

The provided text explicitly states:

> **No New High‑Risk Vulnerabilities Detected**

and

> After integrating the new project files into the overall review, we confirm that the existing secure coding practices and design choices ... continue to mitigate against high‑risk, externally exploitable attack vectors. **No additional vulnerabilities meeting the external attacker and high/critical impact criteria have been identified.**

The single item in the original list, "No New High‑Risk Vulnerabilities Detected", is not a vulnerability itself, but rather a report stating the absence of new high-risk vulnerabilities after a security review.

Applying the filtering criteria:

* **Vulnerability Rank at least: high**: The provided item has a "Vulnerability Rank: None", which is below "high".
* **Valid and not already mitigated**:  The item describes a situation where high-risk vulnerabilities are *not* present or are mitigated.

Therefore, based on your instructions to include only valid, unmitigated vulnerabilities with a rank of at least "high" and to exclude vulnerabilities that are not applicable to external attackers or are DoS, the provided list, which essentially states the absence of such vulnerabilities, results in an empty filtered list.
