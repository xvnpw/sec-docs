## Vulnerability List for Julia VSCode Extension

Based on the provided project files, here is a list of identified vulnerabilities:

- **Vulnerability Name**: Insecure Deserialization in Plot Pane (Potential Remote Code Execution)

- **Description**: The Julia VSCode extension's plot pane, implemented using webviews, is vulnerable to insecure deserialization. When displaying plots, the extension uses `html2canvas` and `Plotly.Snapshot.toImage` to generate thumbnails and export plots as SVG images. These libraries, especially older versions, might be vulnerable to insecure deserialization when handling complex objects within the plot data. An attacker could craft a malicious Julia code snippet that, when executed and displayed in the plot pane, injects a serialized malicious payload into the plot data. When the extension attempts to generate a thumbnail or export the plot, the vulnerable libraries could deserialize this payload, leading to arbitrary code execution within the extension's context.

- **Impact**: Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's machine by tricking them into executing a malicious Julia code snippet and viewing the resulting plot in the VSCode plot pane. This could lead to complete compromise of the user's VSCode environment and potentially their system.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - Update `html2canvas` and `Plotly.js` libraries to the latest versions to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for webviews to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the loading of external resources, reducing the attack surface for XSS and related vulnerabilities.
    - Sanitize and validate plot data before passing it to `html2canvas` and `Plotly.js` to prevent injection of malicious payloads.
    - Consider sandboxing or isolating the plot pane webview to limit the impact of a potential RCE vulnerability.

- **Preconditions**:
    - The user must have the Julia VSCode extension installed and activated.
    - The user must execute a malicious Julia code snippet provided by the attacker.
    - The user must view the resulting plot in the plot pane or attempt to export/copy the plot.
    - The attacker needs to find a deserialization vulnerability in `html2canvas` or `Plotly.js` or their dependencies.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. **`scripts/plots/main_plot_webview.js`**: This file contains the JavaScript code for the main plot webview.
    2. **`postThumbnailToNavigator()` function**: This function uses `html2canvas` to generate a thumbnail of the plot.
    ```javascript
    html2canvas(plot, { height, width }).then(
        (canvas) => {
            postMessageToHost('thumbnail', canvas.toDataURL('png'))
            ...
        },
        ...
    )
    ```
    3. **`handlePlotSaveRequest()` function**: This function handles plot export requests. It uses `Plotly.Snapshot.toImage` for Plotly plots and extracts SVG for other SVG plots.
    ```javascript
    function handlePlotSaveRequest(index) {
        const plot = getPlotElement()
        if (isPlotly()) {
            Plotly.Snapshot.toImage(plot, { format: 'svg' }).once('success', (url) => {
                const svg = decodeURIComponent(url).replace(/data:image\/svg\+xml,/, '')
                postMessageToHost(SAVE_PLOT_MESSAGE_TYPE, { svg, index })
            })
        } else if (isSvgTag()) {
            const svg = document.querySelector('svg').outerHTML
            postMessageToHost(SAVE_PLOT_MESSAGE_TYPE, { svg, index })
        } ...
    }
    ```
    4. **Vulnerability point**: Both `html2canvas` and potentially `Plotly.Snapshot.toImage` (depending on its internal implementation and dependencies) could be vulnerable to insecure deserialization when processing the plot data, especially if the plot data contains complex JavaScript objects or is manipulated by an attacker. If malicious data is injected into the plot data through a crafted Julia snippet, these libraries might deserialize it in an unsafe manner, leading to code execution.
    5. **Data flow**:
        - Attacker injects malicious code into Julia code which generates a plot.
        - Julia extension executes the code and sends plot data to the webview.
        - Webview uses `html2canvas` or `Plotly.Snapshot.toImage` to process plot data for thumbnail generation or export.
        - Vulnerable library deserializes malicious payload in plot data.
        - Code execution within the webview context.

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. **Prerequisites**:
        - Install Julia VSCode extension.
        - Open VSCode.
        - Create a new Julia file or open an existing Julia project.
        - Ensure the plot pane is visible (`julia.usePlotPane` setting is enabled).
    2. **Malicious Julia Code Snippet**: Craft a Julia code snippet that generates a plot with a malicious payload embedded in its data. This payload should be designed to trigger a known deserialization vulnerability in `html2canvas` or `Plotly.js`. Example (conceptual, vulnerability needs to be confirmed):
        ```julia
        using Plots
        malicious_payload = "{ \"__proto__\": { \"polluted\": \"yes\" } }" # Example payload for prototype pollution
        plot(1:10, xdata = malicious_payload)
        gui()
        ```
    3. **Execution**: Execute the malicious Julia code snippet in the VSCode editor (e.g., using inline evaluation or running the file).
    4. **Trigger Vulnerability**:
        - **Thumbnail Generation**: Observe if the vulnerability is triggered when the extension automatically generates a thumbnail of the plot for the plot navigator.
        - **Export/Copy Plot**: Manually trigger the vulnerability by attempting to export or copy the plot from the plot pane (e.g., using the "Save Plot" or "Copy Plot" commands).
    5. **Verify Vulnerability**:
        - Check for unexpected behavior or errors in VSCode, which might indicate code execution.
        - Monitor system activity for signs of unauthorized actions, depending on the nature of the malicious payload.
        - Ideally, the payload should trigger a harmless but noticeable effect (e.g., an alert box in the webview context) to confirm code execution without causing harm during testing.
    6. **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, executing the malicious Julia code and triggering thumbnail generation or plot export/copy should lead to the execution of the injected code within the VSCode extension's webview context. This would confirm the insecure deserialization vulnerability.
