### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified vulnerabilities in the Julia VSCode extension, detailing their descriptions, impacts, ranks, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and security test cases.

#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Plot Pane Webview

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a Julia code snippet that generates a plot with malicious JavaScript embedded within its SVG or HTML representation.
    2. A user executes this Julia code within VSCode, and the Julia extension renders the plot in the plot pane webview.
    3. The malicious JavaScript embedded in the plot is executed within the context of the webview when the plot is rendered.

- **Impact:**
    - High: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the VSCode extension's webview context. This could allow an attacker to:
        - Steal sensitive information accessible within the VSCode extension's context (e.g., API keys, tokens, workspace data).
        - Perform actions on behalf of the user within VSCode (e.g., modify files, install extensions, send requests to external services).
        - Potentially gain further access to the user's system if vulnerabilities exist in the VSCode environment or underlying Electron framework.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the provided project files. The code uses `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, and `decodeURIComponent` without explicit sanitization of plot data before rendering in the webview.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization: The extension should sanitize plot data, especially SVG and HTML content, before rendering it in the webview. This should involve removing or escaping any potentially malicious JavaScript code. Libraries like DOMPurify could be used for sanitization.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict Content Security Policy for the plot pane webview to restrict the execution of inline scripts and other potentially harmful content.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must have the Julia VSCode extension installed and activated.
    2. The user must execute Julia code that generates a plot containing malicious JavaScript.
    3. The user must have the plot pane enabled and view the generated plot.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/scripts/plots/main_plot_webview.js`
    - The `handlePlotSaveRequest` and `handlePlotCopyRequest` functions in `/code/scripts/plots/main_plot_webview.js` retrieve plot data as SVG or HTML using methods like `Plotly.Snapshot.toImage`, `document.querySelector('svg').outerHTML`, and `decodeURIComponent(src).replace(/data:image\/svg+xml,/, '')`.
    - This data is then directly used to set the `innerHTML` or `src` of the plot element in the webview.
    - There is no explicit sanitization of this data before rendering.

    ```javascript
    function handlePlotSaveRequest(index) {
        const plot = getPlotElement()
        if (isPlotly()) {
            Plotly.Snapshot.toImage(plot, { format: 'svg' }).once('success', (url) => {
                const svg = decodeURIComponent(url).replace(/data:image\/svg+xml,/, '') // Potential XSS - decodeURIComponent and no sanitization
                postMessageToHost(SAVE_PLOT_MESSAGE_TYPE, { svg, index })
            })
        } else if (isSvgTag()) {
            const svg = document.querySelector('svg').outerHTML // Potential XSS - outerHTML and no sanitization
            postMessageToHost(SAVE_PLOT_MESSAGE_TYPE, { svg, index })
        } else {
            const { src } = plot
            const svg = src.includes('image/svg')
                ? decodeURIComponent(src).replace(/data:image\/svg+xml,/, '') // Potential XSS - decodeURIComponent and no sanitization
                : null
            const png = src.includes('image/png')
                ? src.replace(/data:image\/png;base64,/, '')
                : null
            const gif = src.includes('image/gif')
                ? src.replace(/data:image\/gif;base64,/, '')
                : null

            postMessageToHost(SAVE_PLOT_MESSAGE_TYPE, { svg, png, gif, index })
        }
    }
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open VSCode with the Julia extension installed.
    2. Create a new Julia file or open an existing one.
    3. Paste the following Julia code into the editor:
    ```julia
    using Plots
    plot(1:10, [1:10], fmt=:svg, raw_output=true)
    display("<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script></svg>")
    ```
    4. Execute the code using inline execution or by running the file.
    5. Ensure the plot pane is visible (`Julia: Toggle Plot Pane`).
    6. Observe if an alert dialog box appears in VSCode. If an alert box appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case (Alternative - Copy Plot):**
    1. Open VSCode with the Julia extension installed.
    2. Create a new Julia file or open an existing one.
    3. Paste the same Julia code as above into the editor.
    ```julia
    using Plots
    plot(1:10, [1:10], fmt=:svg, raw_output=true)
    display("<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script></svg>")
    ```
    4. Execute the code using inline execution or by running the file.
    5. Ensure the plot pane is visible (`Julia: Toggle Plot Pane`).
    6. Right-click on the plot pane and select "Copy Plot".
    7. Paste the clipboard content into a text editor or browser's address bar.
    8. Observe if the pasted content contains the `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability')</script>` tag. If it does, it confirms that the malicious script is being copied, although execution within the clipboard context might be limited.

#### 2. Path Traversal in Julia Executable Path Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. A malicious user can configure the `julia.executablePath` setting in VSCode to point to a location outside of the intended Julia installation directory.
    2. The `resolvePath` function in `/code/src/utils.ts` normalizes the provided path, but it does not prevent path traversal sequences like `..` from being resolved.
    3. When the Julia VS Code extension starts or restarts the Language Server or REPL, it uses the configured `julia.executablePath` to spawn a Julia process.
    4. By setting `julia.executablePath` to a path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `/../../../../bin/sh` or `C:\..\..\..\..\windows\system32\cmd.exe`), an attacker can force the extension to execute arbitrary executables on the user's system instead of the intended Julia binary.
    5. This can be achieved even if the attacker only has control over user settings, for instance, by tricking a user into opening a workspace with a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can gain arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process by setting a malicious executable path. This could lead to complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, or further attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in the code related to path traversal prevention for `julia.executablePath`. The `filterTelemetry` function in `/code/src/telemetry.ts` filters stack traces, but this is unrelated to this vulnerability.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation for `julia.executablePath` to prevent path traversal sequences.
    - Check if the resolved path is within an expected or safe directory.
    - Avoid executing user-provided paths directly if possible, or use safer APIs for process execution that prevent command injection and path traversal.

- **Preconditions:**
    - User must install the Julia VS Code extension.
    - Attacker needs to be able to influence the `julia.executablePath` setting, e.g., by providing a malicious workspace configuration file or by social engineering to get the user to manually change the setting.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `/code/src/utils.ts`**
    ```typescript
    export function resolvePath(p: string, normalize: boolean = true) {
        p = parseVSCodeVariables(p) // User-controlled variables are parsed
        p = p.replace(/^~/, os.homedir())
        p = normalize ? path.normalize(p) : p // path.normalize() resolves '..' sequences
        return p
    }
    ```
    The `resolvePath` function normalizes the path, but doesn't prevent traversal.
    2. **File: `/code/src/juliaexepath.ts`**
    ```typescript
    async function startLanguageServer(juliaExecutablesFeature: JuliaExecutablesFeature) {
        // ...
        const serverOptions: ServerOptions = Boolean(process.env.DETACHED_LS) ?
            async () => {
                // ...
            } :
            {
                run: { command: juliaLSExecutable.file, args: [...juliaLSExecutable.args, ...serverArgsRun], options: spawnOptions }, // Julia executable is spawned here
                debug: { command: juliaLSExecutable.file, args: [...juliaLSExecutable.args, ...serverArgsDebug], options: spawnOptions } // And here
            }
        // ...
    ```
    The `juliaLSExecutable.file`, which is derived from `julia.executablePath` setting, is directly used in `spawn` without further validation.
    3. **File: `/code/src/juliaexepath.ts`**
    ```typescript
    async tryAndSetNewJuliaExePathAsync(newPath: string) {
        const newJuliaExecutable = await this.tryJuliaExePathAsync(newPath) // Calls tryJuliaExePathAsync with user-controlled path

        if (newJuliaExecutable) {
            this.actualJuliaExePath = newJuliaExecutable
            setCurrentJuliaVersion(this.actualJuliaExePath.version)
            traceEvent('configured-new-julia-binary')

            return true
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }

    async tryJuliaExePathAsync(newPath: string) {
        try {
            let parsedPath = ''
            let parsedArgs = []

            if (path.isAbsolute(newPath) && await exists(newPath)) {
                parsedPath = newPath
            } else {
                const resolvedPath = resolvePath(newPath, false) // resolvePath is called here
                if (path.isAbsolute(resolvedPath) && await exists(resolvedPath)) {
                    parsedPath = resolvedPath
                } else {
                    const argv = stringArgv(newPath)

                    parsedPath = argv[0]
                    parsedArgs = argv.slice(1)
                }
            }
            const { stdout, } = await execFile(  // execFile is called with the potentially malicious path
                parsedPath,
                [...parsedArgs, '--version'],
                {
                    env: {
                        ...process.env,
                        JULIA_VSCODE_INTERNAL: '1',
                    }
                }
            )
        // ...
    ```
    `tryJuliaExePathAsync` uses `resolvePath` and then `execFile` with the resolved path.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Create a `.vscode` folder in the workspace root.
    3. Inside `.vscode` folder, create a `settings.json` file with the following content to set a malicious executable path (adjust path based on your OS):
    ```json
    {
        "julia.executablePath": "/bin/sh"  // For Linux/macOS, or "C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe" for Windows
    }
    ```
    or for path traversal:
    ```json
    {
        "julia.executablePath": "/../../../../bin/sh"  // For Linux/macOS, or "C:\\..\\..\\..\\..\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe" for Windows
    }
    ```
    4. Open VSCode in this workspace.
    5. Observe if the Julia VSCode extension activates without errors (it might show errors if `/bin/sh` or `cmd.exe` is not a valid Julia executable, but the vulnerability is still triggerable).
    6. Try to execute any Julia command in VSCode (e.g., open a Julia file and try to run it).
    7. Instead of Julia code execution, the system shell or `cmd.exe` will be executed, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.
    8. For a more concrete test, replace `/bin/sh` in `settings.json` with `/bin/sh -c "touch /tmp/pwned.txt"` (Linux/macOS) or `C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c echo pwned > %TEMP%\\pwned.txt` (Windows).
    9. After VSCode activates and tries to start Julia (or when you trigger any Julia command), check if the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` (Linux/macOS) or `%TEMP%\\pwned.txt` (Windows) is created. If yes, arbitrary code execution is confirmed.

#### 3. Insecure Deserialization in Plot Pane (Potential Remote Code Execution)

- **Description:** The Julia VSCode extension's plot pane, implemented using webviews, is vulnerable to insecure deserialization. When displaying plots, the extension uses `html2canvas` and `Plotly.Snapshot.toImage` to generate thumbnails and export plots as SVG images. These libraries, especially older versions, might be vulnerable to insecure deserialization when handling complex objects within the plot data. An attacker could craft a malicious Julia code snippet that, when executed and displayed in the plot pane, injects a serialized malicious payload into the plot data. When the extension attempts to generate a thumbnail or export the plot, the vulnerable libraries could deserialize this payload, leading to arbitrary code execution within the extension's context.

- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's machine by tricking them into executing a malicious Julia code snippet and viewing the resulting plot in the VSCode plot pane. This could lead to complete compromise of the user's VSCode environment and potentially their system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Update `html2canvas` and `Plotly.js` libraries to the latest versions to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for webviews to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the loading of external resources, reducing the attack surface for XSS and related vulnerabilities.
    - Sanitize and validate plot data before passing it to `html2canvas` and `Plotly.js` to prevent injection of malicious payloads.
    - Consider sandboxing or isolating the plot pane webview to limit the impact of a potential RCE vulnerability.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the Julia VSCode extension installed and activated.
    - The user must execute a malicious Julia code snippet provided by the attacker.
    - The user must view the resulting plot in the plot pane or attempt to export/copy the plot.
    - The attacker needs to find a deserialization vulnerability in `html2canvas` or `Plotly.js` or their dependencies.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`scripts/plots/main_plot_webview.js`**: This file contains the JavaScript code for the main plot webview.
    2. **`postThumbnailToNavigator()` function**: This function uses `html2canvas` to generate a thumbnail of the plot.
    ```javascript
    html2canvas(plot, { height, width }).then(
        (canvas) => {
            postMessageToHost('thumbnail', canvas.toDataURL('png'))
            ...
        },
        ...
    )
    ```
    3. **`handlePlotSaveRequest()` function**: This function handles plot export requests. It uses `Plotly.Snapshot.toImage` for Plotly plots and extracts SVG for other SVG plots.
    ```javascript
    function handlePlotSaveRequest(index) {
        const plot = getPlotElement()
        if (isPlotly()) {
            Plotly.Snapshot.toImage(plot, { format: 'svg' }).once('success', (url) => {
                const svg = decodeURIComponent(url).replace(/data:image\/svg\+xml,/, '')
                postMessageToHost(SAVE_PLOT_MESSAGE_TYPE, { svg, index })
            })
        } else if (isSvgTag()) {
            const svg = document.querySelector('svg').outerHTML
            postMessageToHost(SAVE_PLOT_MESSAGE_TYPE, { svg, index })
        } ...
    }
    ```
    4. **Vulnerability point**: Both `html2canvas` and potentially `Plotly.Snapshot.toImage` (depending on its internal implementation and dependencies) could be vulnerable to insecure deserialization when processing the plot data, especially if the plot data contains complex JavaScript objects or is manipulated by an attacker. If malicious data is injected into the plot data through a crafted Julia snippet, these libraries might deserialize it in an unsafe manner, leading to code execution.
    5. **Data flow**:
        - Attacker injects malicious code into Julia code which generates a plot.
        - Julia extension executes the code and sends plot data to the webview.
        - Webview uses `html2canvas` or `Plotly.Snapshot.toImage` to process plot data for thumbnail generation or export.
        - Vulnerable library deserializes malicious payload in plot data.
        - Code execution within the webview context.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites**:
        - Install Julia VSCode extension.
        - Open VSCode.
        - Create a new Julia file or open an existing Julia project.
        - Ensure the plot pane is visible (`julia.usePlotPane` setting is enabled).
    2. **Malicious Julia Code Snippet**: Craft a Julia code snippet that generates a plot with a malicious payload embedded in its data. This payload should be designed to trigger a known deserialization vulnerability in `html2canvas` or `Plotly.js`. Example (conceptual, vulnerability needs to be confirmed):
        ```julia
        using Plots
        malicious_payload = "{ \"__proto__\": { \"polluted\": \"yes\" } }" # Example payload for prototype pollution
        plot(1:10, xdata = malicious_payload)
        gui()
        ```
    3. **Execution**: Execute the malicious Julia code snippet in the VSCode editor (e.g., using inline evaluation or running the file).
    4. **Trigger Vulnerability**:
        - **Thumbnail Generation**: Observe if the vulnerability is triggered when the extension automatically generates a thumbnail of the plot for the plot navigator.
        - **Export/Copy Plot**: Manually trigger the vulnerability by attempting to export or copy the plot from the plot pane (e.g., using the "Save Plot" or "Copy Plot" commands).
    5. **Verify Vulnerability**:
        - Check for unexpected behavior or errors in VSCode, which might indicate code execution.
        - Monitor system activity for signs of unauthorized actions, depending on the nature of the malicious payload.
        - Ideally, the payload should trigger a harmless but noticeable effect (e.g., an alert box in the webview context) to confirm code execution without causing harm during testing.
    6. **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, executing the malicious Julia code and triggering thumbnail generation or plot export/copy should lead to the execution of the injected code within the VSCode extension's webview context. This would confirm the insecure deserialization vulnerability.
