### High and Critical Recharts Threats

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Tooltip Content
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data that is subsequently displayed within Recharts tooltips. When a user hovers over the affected chart element, the malicious script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, deface the application, or perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
    *   **Affected Recharts Component:** `Tooltip` component, specifically the logic that renders the tooltip content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user-provided data or data from untrusted sources before passing it to the `Tooltip` component.
        *   Utilize browser built-in XSS protection mechanisms (Content Security Policy - CSP).
        *   Employ a robust sanitization library specifically designed to prevent XSS attacks.
        *   Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` within tooltip content if possible.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Labels or Text Elements
    *   **Description:** Similar to tooltip XSS, an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data used for chart labels, axis ticks, or other text elements rendered by Recharts.
    *   **Impact:** Same as tooltip XSS - potential for session hijacking, redirection, and malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Recharts Component:** Components responsible for rendering text elements like `Label`, `Axis`, and potentially custom text rendering logic within chart components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize all data used for text rendering within Recharts components.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   Use secure templating mechanisms that automatically escape potentially harmful characters.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack on Recharts
    *   **Description:**  A malicious actor compromises the Recharts library itself (e.g., through a compromised maintainer account or build process) and injects malicious code into the library.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially severe, as any application using the compromised version of Recharts could be affected, leading to various security breaches.
    *   **Affected Recharts Component:**  The entire library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Monitor security advisories and community discussions related to Recharts.
        *   Verify the integrity of the library when installing or updating it (e.g., using checksums or verifying signatures).
        *   Use a reputable package manager and consider locking dependencies to specific versions.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to detect potential supply chain risks.
