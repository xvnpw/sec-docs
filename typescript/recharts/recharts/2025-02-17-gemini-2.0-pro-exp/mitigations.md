# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for recharts/recharts

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization using DOMPurify (Recharts-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_using_dompurify__recharts-focused_.md)

1.  **Identify Data Points:** Within your React components that use Recharts, pinpoint *every* piece of data that is passed to Recharts components, especially data used for:
    *   `label` props in components like `XAxis`, `YAxis`, `Legend`.
    *   `payload` data within custom `Tooltip` components.
    *   Any custom components you've created that render text based on data.
    *   `formatter` functions that generate text.
2.  **Apply Sanitization:** *Immediately before* passing data to these Recharts props or components, apply `DOMPurify.sanitize()`.
    *   Example (within a React component):
        ```javascript
        import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

        function MyChartComponent({ data }) {
          const sanitizedData = data.map(item => ({
            ...item,
            name: DOMPurify.sanitize(item.name), // Sanitize the 'name' field
            tooltipContent: DOMPurify.sanitize(item.tooltipContent), // Sanitize tooltip content
          }));

          return (
            <LineChart data={sanitizedData}>
              <XAxis dataKey="name" /> {/* Sanitized data is used here */}
              <Tooltip content={<CustomTooltip />} /> {/* Ensure CustomTooltip also sanitizes */}
              {/* ... other components ... */}
            </LineChart>
          );
        }

        function CustomTooltip({ active, payload, label }) {
            if (active && payload && payload.length) {
                return (
                    <div>
                        <p>{DOMPurify.sanitize(label)}</p> {/* Sanitize the label */}
                        <p>{DOMPurify.sanitize(payload[0].value)}</p> {/* Sanitize the value */}
                    </div>
                )
            }
        }
        ```
3.  **Data Type Validation (Client-Side):**  Within the same component logic (or a helper function), validate data types *before* passing them to Recharts.  Ensure numbers are numbers, strings are strings, etc.  This prevents unexpected data from causing errors or being misinterpreted.
4. **Length Limits (Client-Side):** Enforce maximum string lengths *before* passing data to Recharts, especially for labels and tooltips.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript code into the chart's rendered output.
    *   **Data Injection (Client-Side):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of malformed data causing rendering issues within Recharts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:**  Reduces XSS risk to near zero *within the Recharts components*, if implemented comprehensively.
    *   **Data Injection:** Improves the robustness of the Recharts rendering process.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially implemented in `src/components/ChartComponent.js`. Sanitization is applied to the `title` field, but not consistently to all data points used within the chart and its sub-components.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Missing in `src/components/CustomTooltip.js`, where data is directly rendered into the tooltip without sanitization.
    *   Example: Inconsistent application of sanitization across different chart types (e.g., `BarChart`, `PieChart`) in various components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` within Recharts Components](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__dangerouslysetinnerhtml__within_recharts_components.md)

1.  **Code Review (Recharts Focus):**  Specifically examine all React components that render Recharts charts or custom Recharts components (like custom tooltips, labels, etc.).  Look for any use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
2.  **Refactor to JSX:**  Replace any instances of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with standard React JSX element creation.
    *   Instead of:  `<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: someData }} />`
    *   Use:  `<div>{DOMPurify.sanitize(someData)}</div>`  (Note: Sanitization is *still* crucial, even without `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).
3.  **Custom Components:**  Pay close attention to any custom Recharts components you've created.  These are often the most likely places to find `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.  Ensure they are built using safe React practices.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Eliminates a direct pathway for injecting malicious HTML and JavaScript.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS by removing a common vulnerability pattern.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Mostly implemented. A previous code review focused on removing `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` across the project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  Need to re-verify all custom Recharts components (e.g., `src/components/CustomLegend.js`, `src/components/CustomAxis.js`) to ensure no instances have been reintroduced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side Data Size and Complexity Limits (Recharts Rendering)](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_data_size_and_complexity_limits__recharts_rendering_.md)

1.  **Identify Data-Heavy Components:** Determine which Recharts components are most susceptible to performance issues with large datasets (e.g., `LineChart` with thousands of points, `ScatterChart` with complex data).
2.  **Pre-Processing:** *Before* passing data to these components, implement checks:
    *   **Array Length:**  `if (data.length > MAX_DATA_POINTS) { /* handle the excess data */ }`
    *   **Object Complexity:**  Check for excessively nested objects or large string values within the data.
3.  **Handling Excess Data:**  If the data exceeds the limits:
    *   **Truncate:**  Slice the data array to the maximum allowed size: `data = data.slice(0, MAX_DATA_POINTS);`
    *   **Display a Warning:**  Show a message to the user indicating that the data has been truncated.
    *   **Disable Chart:**  Optionally, disable the chart rendering and display an error message if the data is too large to handle safely.
    *   **Trigger Server-Side Aggregation:**  If possible, send a request to the server to fetch aggregated or summarized data.
4. **Configuration:** Store these limits (e.g., `MAX_DATA_POINTS`) in a configuration file for easy adjustment.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Client-Side):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the Recharts rendering process from being overwhelmed by excessively large or complex data, which could crash the user's browser.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Client-Side):** (Severity: Low) - Improves the responsiveness of the application when dealing with large datasets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Reduces the likelihood of client-side DoS attacks that target the Recharts rendering engine.
    *   **Performance:** Maintains acceptable performance even with larger datasets (up to the defined limits).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: No client-side data size limits are currently implemented specifically for Recharts rendering.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Missing in all components that use Recharts, particularly those that handle potentially large datasets (e.g., `src/components/TimeSeriesChart.js`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and use only necessary Recharts features (Direct Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_use_only_necessary_recharts_features__direct_usage_.md)

1.  **Component Inventory:** Within your React codebase, create a list of all *specific* Recharts components and props you are using (e.g., `LineChart`, `XAxis`, `Tooltip`, `ResponsiveContainer`, `formatter` functions, custom components).
2.  **Documentation Check:** For *each* of these components and props, consult the *current* Recharts documentation.
    *   Check for deprecation notices.
    *   Look for any security warnings or best practice recommendations.
    *   Identify if simpler alternatives exist within Recharts.
3.  **Refactor (if needed):** If you are using deprecated components or props, refactor your code to use the recommended alternatives.
4. **Simplify:** If you are using complex configurations or custom components where simpler, built-in Recharts features would suffice, refactor to use the simpler approach. This reduces the potential for errors and vulnerabilities.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Recharts-Specific):** (Severity: Variable) - Reduces the risk of using Recharts features that might have known (but perhaps less publicized) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** (Severity: Low) - Avoids potential issues arising from using deprecated or less-well-tested features.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Minimizes the attack surface within the Recharts library itself.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Improves code maintainability and reduces the risk of unexpected rendering issues.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially implemented. An initial review was done, but a comprehensive audit of all Recharts usage is needed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Needs a systematic review of all components using Recharts, comparing current usage against the latest documentation and best practices. Specifically check for custom components that could be replaced with built-in Recharts features.
