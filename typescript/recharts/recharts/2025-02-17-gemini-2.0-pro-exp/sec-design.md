# BUSINESS POSTURE

Recharts is a composable charting library built on React components. It's designed to make it easy to integrate charts into React applications. Based on the GitHub repository, the following business priorities and goals can be inferred:

Priorities:

*   Provide a reliable and well-maintained charting library for React developers.
*   Offer a flexible and customizable solution for various charting needs.
*   Maintain a low barrier to entry for new users.
*   Foster a community around the project.
*   Ensure the library is performant and doesn't introduce bottlenecks.

Goals:

*   Become a widely adopted charting library within the React ecosystem.
*   Provide comprehensive documentation and examples.
*   Maintain a high level of code quality and test coverage.
*   Regularly release updates and new features.

Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the library could expose applications using Recharts to attacks.
*   Bugs or performance issues could negatively impact the user experience of applications using Recharts.
*   Lack of maintenance or updates could lead to the library becoming obsolete.
*   Competition from other charting libraries could reduce adoption.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could hinder user adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project uses `eslint` with `eslint-plugin-react` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` for code linting, which can help identify potential security issues and enforce coding best practices. Location: `.eslintrc.js`.
*   security control: The project has a `SECURITY.md` file, providing instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities. Location: `SECURITY.md`.
*   security control: The project uses React, which provides some built-in protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when used correctly. Location: Implicit in the use of React.
*   security control: The project has unit tests. Location: `test/`.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The project does not appear to have dedicated security reviews or penetration testing.
*   accepted risk: The project's dependencies may introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The project does not implement any custom input sanitization, relying on React's built-in mechanisms.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a dependency management system to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk).
*   security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to identify potential vulnerabilities early.
*   security control: Conduct regular security reviews and penetration testing.
*   security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.
*   security control: Implement input validation and sanitization where applicable, even if React provides some protection.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as Recharts is a client-side library.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as Recharts is a client-side library.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All data inputs to chart components should be validated to ensure they conform to expected types and formats.
    *   Special characters should be handled appropriately to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a schema validation library to define and enforce data input schemas.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, but if Recharts is used to display sensitive data, the data should be transmitted over secure channels (HTTPS).
*   Output Encoding:
    *   Ensure that any user-provided data rendered in tooltips or labels is properly encoded to prevent XSS.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a reliable and functional charting library for React developers.
*   Maintaining the reputation and trust of the Recharts project.

Data to Protect:

*   Source code: Sensitivity - Medium (public repository, but unauthorized modifications could introduce vulnerabilities).
*   User data (indirectly): Sensitivity - Depends on the application using Recharts. Recharts itself doesn't handle user data directly, but vulnerabilities in Recharts could be exploited to access or manipulate user data within the consuming application.
*   Documentation: Sensitivity - Low (publicly available).
*   Issue tracker and discussions: Sensitivity - Low (publicly available).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that applications using Recharts typically need to adhere to? This would influence recommendations for data handling.
*   What is the expected scale of applications using Recharts (e.g., small internal tools vs. large-scale public-facing applications)? This impacts the severity of potential vulnerabilities.
*   Are there any plans to introduce features that might handle sensitive data directly within Recharts (e.g., user authentication, data input forms)?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a free, open-source charting library. There are no direct monetization or strict service-level agreements.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies primarily on community contributions and built-in React security features for security. There is no dedicated security team or budget.
*   DESIGN: The library is primarily used for client-side rendering of charts. Server-side rendering is possible but not the primary focus. The library is designed to be flexible and customizable, which can introduce complexity and potential security risks if not used carefully.
