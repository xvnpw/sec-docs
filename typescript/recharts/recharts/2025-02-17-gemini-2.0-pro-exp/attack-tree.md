## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 CUSTOM COMPONENTS -> 1.1.1 UNSANITIZED INPUT IN CUSTOM COMPONENT PROPS](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_custom_components_-_1_1_1_unsanitized_input_in_custom_component_props.md)

*   **Description:** Recharts allows developers to extend its functionality by creating custom components. If these custom components do not properly sanitize or validate the data they receive as props, they become a direct injection point for malicious code.
*   **Likelihood:** High. Developers often overlook input validation in custom components, assuming the data will be "safe" because it's coming from within the application.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and further exploitation.
*   **Effort:** Low. Crafting malicious input is relatively easy, especially if the component's expected input format is known.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Requires understanding of JavaScript and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires code review and potentially dynamic analysis to identify missing sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 TOOLTIP MANIPULATION -> 1.2.1 HTML INJECTION IN TOOLTIP CONTENT](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_tooltip_manipulation_-_1_2_1_html_injection_in_tooltip_content.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows user-controlled data to be displayed within Recharts tooltips without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious HTML tags, including `<script>` tags, leading to XSS.
*   **Likelihood:** High. Tooltips are often considered less critical than other UI elements, leading to lax security practices.
*   **Impact:** High. Similar to 1.1.1, successful exploitation leads to XSS and its associated risks.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Simple HTML injection payloads are readily available.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.  Requires understanding of HTML and XSS.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires careful examination of how tooltip content is generated and rendered.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 TOOLTIP MANIPULATION -> 1.2.2 JS INJECTION VIA CALLBACKS](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_tooltip_manipulation_-_1_2_2_js_injection_via_callbacks.md)

*   **Description:** If Recharts tooltips allow the use of JavaScript callbacks for dynamic content generation, and these callbacks are not properly secured, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Developers might use callbacks for complex tooltip behavior without fully considering the security implications.
*   **Impact:** Very High. This provides direct execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript, offering the highest level of control over the victim's browser.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires understanding of JavaScript and how the callbacks are implemented.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced. Requires a deeper understanding of JavaScript execution contexts and potential bypass techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires careful analysis of callback implementations and data flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 XSS IN LABEL/TOOLTIP -> 2.1.2 UNESCAPED OUTPUT IN LABEL/TOOLTIP](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_xss_in_labeltooltip_-_2_1_2_unescaped_output_in_labeltooltip.md)

*   **Description:** This represents a vulnerability *within the Recharts library itself*. If Recharts fails to properly escape data rendered in labels or tooltips, it creates an XSS vulnerability regardless of the application's input validation.
*   **Likelihood:** Low.  Recharts is a popular library and likely undergoes security scrutiny. However, vulnerabilities can still exist.
*   **Impact:** Very High.  A library-level XSS vulnerability affects all applications using that version of Recharts.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  Requires finding and exploiting the specific vulnerability in the library's code.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced. Requires understanding of JavaScript, HTML escaping, and potentially reverse engineering.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard. Requires vulnerability scanning or manual code auditing of the Recharts library.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 PROTOTYPE POLLUTION -> 2.2.1 MANIPULATE CHART PROPS](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_prototype_pollution_-_2_2_1_manipulate_chart_props.md)

*   **Description:**  Prototype pollution is a JavaScript vulnerability where an attacker can modify the properties of an object's prototype. If Recharts is vulnerable, an attacker could inject properties that alter the chart's behavior, potentially leading to XSS or other unexpected outcomes.
*   **Likelihood:** Low.  Requires a specific vulnerability in how Recharts handles object properties.
*   **Impact:** Very High.  Can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service by disrupting the chart's rendering or functionality.
*   **Effort:** High.  Requires a deep understanding of JavaScript's prototype chain and how Recharts uses objects internally.
*   **Skill Level:** Expert. Requires advanced knowledge of JavaScript internals and vulnerability research.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard.  Prototype pollution vulnerabilities are often subtle and difficult to detect without specialized tools and expertise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 PROTOTYPE POLLUTION -> 2.2.2 ABUSE COMPONENT LIFECYCLE METHODS](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_prototype_pollution_-_2_2_2_abuse_component_lifecycle_methods.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 2.2.1, but specifically targeting the component's lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`). By polluting the prototype, an attacker could override these methods with malicious code.
*   **Likelihood:** Low. Requires a specific vulnerability and precise manipulation of the prototype chain.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Can lead to arbitrary code execution when the component's lifecycle methods are invoked.
*   **Effort:** High. Requires in-depth knowledge of Recharts' internal workings and JavaScript.
*   **Skill Level:** Expert. Similar to 2.2.1, requires advanced vulnerability research skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard. Similar to 2.2.1, these vulnerabilities are difficult to detect.
