# Deep Analysis: Recharts Tooltip HTML Injection (1.2.1)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the vulnerability of Recharts-based applications to HTML injection within tooltip content, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  We aim to:

*   Understand the precise mechanisms by which this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Identify specific Recharts configurations and application code patterns that increase the risk.
*   Determine effective mitigation strategies to prevent this vulnerability.
*   Assess the real-world impact and likelihood of exploitation.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for developers to secure their applications.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Library:**  `recharts` (https://github.com/recharts/recharts) -  We will examine the library's documentation, source code (if necessary), and common usage patterns.
*   **Vulnerability:** HTML Injection within tooltip content, specifically leading to XSS.  We will *not* cover other potential tooltip-related issues (e.g., information disclosure of sensitive data *without* HTML injection) unless they directly contribute to the XSS risk.
*   **Attack Vector:** User-supplied data rendered within Recharts tooltips.  This includes data from any source that is ultimately controlled by an attacker (e.g., database entries, API responses, URL parameters, form submissions).
*   **Application Context:**  We assume a typical web application using Recharts for data visualization.  We will consider various ways Recharts might be integrated (e.g., React components, direct DOM manipulation).

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  We will thoroughly examine the official Recharts documentation for any information related to tooltips, data handling, and security considerations.  We'll look for explicit warnings, best practices, or examples that might indicate potential vulnerabilities.

2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  While a full code review of Recharts is outside the scope, we will perform targeted code reviews of relevant sections (e.g., the `Tooltip` component's source code) if the documentation is insufficient or if specific implementation details are crucial to understanding the vulnerability.

3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:**  We will create a simplified, controlled environment (a minimal React application using Recharts) to attempt to reproduce the vulnerability.  This will involve crafting malicious input and observing the application's behavior.  This is crucial for confirming the vulnerability and understanding its exploitability.

4.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Based on the findings from the previous steps, we will analyze the root cause of the vulnerability, identify contributing factors, and assess the likelihood and impact of exploitation.

5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  We will propose and evaluate specific mitigation strategies, prioritizing those that are most effective and least disruptive to application functionality.

6.  **Reporting:**  The findings, analysis, and recommendations will be documented in this comprehensive report.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1 HTML Injection in Tooltip Content

### 2.1 Vulnerability Description and Mechanism

This vulnerability arises when an application using Recharts displays user-controlled data within tooltips without proper sanitization or encoding.  Recharts, like many charting libraries, often provides a mechanism to customize tooltip content.  This customization can involve displaying data points, labels, or other information associated with the chart elements.  If this data is sourced from user input and is not properly handled, an attacker can inject malicious HTML tags, including `<script>` tags, into the tooltip.

**Mechanism:**

1.  **User Input:** The attacker provides malicious input through a vector controlled by the application (e.g., a form field, URL parameter, database entry).  This input contains HTML tags, often including a `<script>` tag with malicious JavaScript code.  Example: `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`.

2.  **Data Propagation:** The application, without proper sanitization, incorporates this malicious input into the data used to generate the Recharts chart, specifically the data associated with the tooltip content.

3.  **Tooltip Rendering:**  When the user hovers over the relevant chart element, Recharts renders the tooltip, including the attacker-supplied HTML.  The browser interprets this HTML, executing any embedded JavaScript code.

4.  **XSS Execution:** The attacker's JavaScript code executes within the context of the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as:
    *   Stealing cookies (session hijacking).
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Modifying the page content (defacement).
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user (e.g., making unauthorized requests).
    *   Keylogging.

### 2.2 Likelihood and Impact Assessment

*   **Likelihood: High.**  As stated in the original attack tree, tooltips are often overlooked in security reviews. Developers might assume that tooltips are less critical or that the data displayed within them is inherently safe.  This leads to a higher probability of insufficient sanitization.  Furthermore, many applications rely on user-generated content for chart data, increasing the attack surface.

*   **Impact: High.**  Successful exploitation results in a full XSS vulnerability, granting the attacker significant control over the victim's interaction with the application.  The consequences can range from session hijacking and data theft to complete account compromise and even potential lateral movement within the application or network.

*   **Effort: Low.**  Basic HTML injection payloads are readily available and well-documented.  An attacker doesn't need sophisticated tools or techniques to craft a working exploit, especially if the application lacks basic input validation.

*   **Skill Level: Intermediate.**  While the basic injection itself is simple, exploiting the resulting XSS to achieve specific malicious goals (e.g., crafting a payload to steal cookies and bypass HttpOnly flags) might require a slightly higher level of skill.  Understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and the DOM is necessary.

*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium.**  Detecting this vulnerability requires a careful examination of how tooltip content is generated and rendered.  Automated scanners might flag potential issues, but manual code review and testing are often necessary to confirm the vulnerability and ensure that all potential injection points are addressed.  Dynamic testing (e.g., using browser developer tools to inspect the rendered tooltip content) is crucial.

### 2.3 Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

Let's assume a simplified React component using Recharts:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { LineChart, Line, Tooltip, XAxis, YAxis } from 'recharts';

const MyChart = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <LineChart width={400} height={300} data={data}>
      <XAxis dataKey="name" />
      <YAxis />
      <Tooltip content={<CustomTooltip />} />
      <Line type="monotone" dataKey="value" stroke="#8884d8" />
    </LineChart>
  );
};

const CustomTooltip = ({ active, payload, label }) => {
  if (active && payload && payload.length) {
    return (
      <div className="custom-tooltip">
        <p className="label">{`${label} : ${payload[0].value}`}</p>
        {/* VULNERABLE LINE: Directly rendering user-provided data */}
        <p className="desc">{payload[0].payload.description}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return null;
};

export default MyChart;
```

Now, let's assume the `data` prop is populated from user input, like this:

```javascript
const maliciousData = [
  {
    name: 'Page A',
    value: 10,
    description: '<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS!")>', // Malicious payload
  },
  { name: 'Page B', value: 20, description: 'Safe description' },
];

<MyChart data={maliciousData} />
```

In this scenario, the `description` field within the `maliciousData` array contains an HTML injection payload.  When the user hovers over the data point for "Page A," the `CustomTooltip` component will render this malicious HTML *directly* into the tooltip.  The browser will execute the `onerror` event handler of the `<img>` tag, triggering the `alert("XSS!")` â€“ demonstrating a successful XSS attack.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies

Several mitigation strategies can be employed to prevent this vulnerability:

1.  **Input Validation (Less Preferred, but Important):**  While not a complete solution for XSS, validating user input *before* it enters the application is a crucial first line of defense.  This can involve:
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Allowing only specific characters or patterns (e.g., alphanumeric characters for names).
    *   **Blacklisting:**  Rejecting known malicious characters or patterns (e.g., `<script>`).  This is generally less effective than whitelisting, as attackers can often find ways to bypass blacklists.
    *   **Length Limits:**  Restricting the length of input fields to reasonable values.

    *However, input validation alone is insufficient because it's difficult to anticipate all possible malicious payloads, and it doesn't address the core issue of insecure output handling.*

2.  **Output Encoding/Escaping (Most Effective):**  This is the **primary and most reliable** defense against XSS.  Before rendering user-provided data within the tooltip, it must be properly encoded or escaped.  This converts potentially dangerous characters into their safe HTML entity equivalents.  For example:

    *   `<` becomes `&lt;`
    *   `>` becomes `&gt;`
    *   `"` becomes `&quot;`
    *   `'` becomes `&#39;`
    *   `&` becomes `&amp;`

    In React, you can often achieve this by using the built-in JSX escaping:

    ```javascript
    <p className="desc">{payload[0].payload.description}</p> 
    //Becomes (if description is <script>alert(1)</script>)
    <p className="desc">&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</p>
    ```
    
    However, if you need more control, or if you're not using JSX, you can use a dedicated escaping library like:
        *   **DOMPurify:** A robust and widely used library for sanitizing HTML.  It allows you to specify a whitelist of allowed tags and attributes, providing fine-grained control over the output.
        *   **he:** A lightweight HTML entity encoder/decoder.
        *   **escape-html:** Another simple HTML escaping library.

    **Example using DOMPurify:**

    ```javascript
    import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

    const CustomTooltip = ({ active, payload, label }) => {
      if (active && payload && payload.length) {
        const sanitizedDescription = DOMPurify.sanitize(payload[0].payload.description);
        return (
          <div className="custom-tooltip">
            <p className="label">{`${label} : ${payload[0].value}`}</p>
            {/* Safely rendering the sanitized description */}
            <p className="desc" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: sanitizedDescription }} />
          </div>
        );
      }

      return null;
    };
    ```
     **Important Note on** `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: While `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is generally discouraged in React due to XSS risks, it *can* be used safely *if and only if* the input is properly sanitized using a trusted library like DOMPurify.

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Defense in Depth):**  CSP is a browser security mechanism that allows you to define a whitelist of sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (e.g., scripts, images, stylesheets).  A well-configured CSP can mitigate the impact of XSS even if an injection occurs.  For example, you can prevent inline scripts from executing, even if they are injected into the page.  This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.

    Example CSP header:

    ```
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com;
    ```

    This policy would only allow scripts to be loaded from the same origin (`'self'`) and from `https://trusted-cdn.com`.  It would block any inline scripts, including those injected via XSS.

4.  **Recharts-Specific Configuration (If Available):**  Check the Recharts documentation for any built-in options or props that might provide automatic sanitization or escaping of tooltip content.  If such options exist, they should be used in preference to manual escaping (as they are likely to be more thoroughly tested and maintained). *However, at the time of this analysis, Recharts does not appear to offer built-in sanitization for custom tooltip content.*

### 2.5 Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Output Encoding:**  Implement robust output encoding using a library like DOMPurify for *all* user-provided data rendered within Recharts tooltips.  This is the most critical step.

2.  **Implement Input Validation:**  As a secondary measure, implement input validation to restrict the types of characters and patterns allowed in user input.

3.  **Use a Content Security Policy:**  Configure a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded, providing an additional layer of defense.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including those related to Recharts and other third-party libraries.

5.  **Stay Updated:**  Keep Recharts and all other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches and bug fixes.

6.  **Educate Developers:**  Ensure that all developers working with Recharts are aware of the risks of XSS and the importance of proper sanitization and encoding.

7. **Consider Feature Request to Recharts:** Submit a feature request or contribute to the Recharts project to add built-in sanitization for custom tooltip content. This would benefit the entire Recharts community.

By implementing these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities in their Recharts-based applications and protect their users from potential attacks.
