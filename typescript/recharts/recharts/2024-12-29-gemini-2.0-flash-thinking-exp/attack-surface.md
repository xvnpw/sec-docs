Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Recharts, with high and critical severity:

* **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Input**
    * **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the data used to populate the charts. When Recharts renders the chart, this script is executed in the user's browser.
    * **How Recharts Contributes:** Recharts renders data provided to it within various chart elements like tooltips, labels, and custom components. If this data originates from untrusted sources and is not properly sanitized, Recharts will faithfully render the malicious script.
    * **Example:**  A dataset includes a label like `"User <img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS\")'>"` which, when rendered by Recharts in a tooltip, will execute the JavaScript `alert("XSS")`.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all data received from untrusted sources *before* passing it to Recharts. This involves removing or escaping potentially harmful HTML and JavaScript.
        * **Output Encoding:** Ensure that data rendered by Recharts is properly encoded for the HTML context. This prevents the browser from interpreting the data as executable code. Libraries or browser APIs for escaping HTML entities should be used.

* **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG Rendering**
    * **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is embedded within SVG elements or attributes that are part of the chart configuration or data. Since Recharts renders charts using SVG, this malicious code can be executed by the browser.
    * **How Recharts Contributes:** Recharts uses SVG as its rendering mechanism. If the configuration or data allows for the inclusion of arbitrary SVG elements or attributes (e.g., through custom components or configuration options), attackers can inject `<script>` tags or event handlers (like `onload`) containing malicious JavaScript.
    * **Example:** A chart configuration allows a custom SVG element with an `onload` attribute: `<svg><rect width="100" height="100" fill="red" onload="alert('XSS')"/></svg>`. When Recharts renders this, the `alert('XSS')` will execute.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection, data theft, defacement.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation for SVG:**  If allowing custom SVG elements or attributes, implement strict validation to prevent the inclusion of `<script>` tags or event handlers that can execute JavaScript.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be executed. This can help mitigate XSS even if some malicious SVG is rendered.
        * **Consider SVG Sanitization Libraries:** If you need to allow some level of user-provided SVG, use a reputable SVG sanitization library to remove potentially harmful elements and attributes.
