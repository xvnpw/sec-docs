# Threat Model Analysis for recharts/recharts

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized User Data in Chart Elements](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_user_data_in_chart_elements.md)

*   **Description:** Recharts library fails to properly sanitize user-provided data when rendering chart elements like labels, tooltips, or custom components. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through these data inputs. When Recharts renders the chart, this malicious script executes in the user's browser.

*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, and other malicious actions.

*   **Affected Recharts Component:**
    *   `Label` component
    *   `Tooltip` component
    *   Components accepting user-provided strings for rendering within charts, including potentially custom components.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Ensure all user-provided data displayed by Recharts components is rigorously sanitized and escaped *before* being passed to Recharts. Use secure sanitization libraries or browser APIs.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to significantly reduce the impact of XSS by controlling resource loading and restricting inline JavaScript.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Recharts updated to the latest version to benefit from potential security patches addressing XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Code Reviews:** Conduct focused code reviews to identify any instances where user-provided data is used within Recharts without proper sanitization.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Recharts Package](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_recharts_package.md)

*   **Description:** The official Recharts npm package is compromised on the npm registry. An attacker gains control and injects malicious code into the package. Developers unknowingly install or update to this compromised version, incorporating the malicious code into their applications that use Recharts.

*   **Impact:**  Installation of a compromised Recharts package leads to the execution of malicious code within applications using the library. This can result in severe consequences, including data breaches, backdoors, complete application compromise, and supply chain propagation of the attack.

*   **Affected Recharts Component:**
    *   Potentially all components of Recharts, as malicious code can be injected anywhere within the package structure.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Package Integrity Verification:** Utilize package manager integrity checks (e.g., `npm audit signatures`, `yarn integrity`) to verify the authenticity and integrity of downloaded Recharts packages.
    *   **Reputable Registry Source:**  Download Recharts packages only from trusted and official package registries like npmjs.com.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Stay informed about security advisories and reports related to supply chain attacks and the JavaScript/npm ecosystem.
    *   **Dependency Locking:** Employ dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions.
    *   **Consider Private Registry (Advanced):** For highly sensitive environments, consider using a private npm registry to have greater control over package sources and perform internal security scans before package deployment.
