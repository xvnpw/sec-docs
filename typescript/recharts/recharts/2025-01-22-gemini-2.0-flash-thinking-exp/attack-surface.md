# Attack Surface Analysis for recharts/recharts

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection - Malicious Data Payload](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_-_malicious_data_payload.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into the application's data inputs that are subsequently used by Recharts to render charts. This data is crafted to exploit potential vulnerabilities in Recharts' data processing logic.
*   **Recharts Contribution:** Recharts processes data provided to it to generate visualizations. If the application directly feeds user-controlled data to Recharts without sanitization, Recharts becomes a pathway for processing potentially malicious payloads and exploiting potential vulnerabilities within its data handling.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted JSON payload as chart data. This payload exploits a vulnerability in Recharts' data parsing logic, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the client's browser or server (in SSR scenarios) when rendering the chart.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption, or other severe application malfunctions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Data Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous server-side validation and sanitization of all user-provided data *before* it is used by Recharts. This should include validating data types, formats, ranges, and checking for potentially malicious patterns.
    *   **Input Data Type Enforcement:**  Strictly define and enforce the expected data types and structures for Recharts components. Use schema validation libraries on the server-side to ensure data integrity.
    *   **Regular Recharts Updates and Vulnerability Monitoring:** Keep Recharts library updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Recharts and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side XSS via Chart Elements](./attack_surfaces/client-side_xss_via_chart_elements.md)

*   **Description:** User-controlled data used in chart elements (labels, tooltips, custom components) is not properly encoded, allowing injection of malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser when the chart is rendered by Recharts.
*   **Recharts Contribution:** Recharts renders various text elements and allows custom components within charts. If the application uses user-provided data directly in these elements without encoding, Recharts becomes a vehicle for XSS attacks through its rendering mechanisms.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a chart tooltip through a user input field. When the user hovers over the chart element and the tooltip is rendered by Recharts, the malicious script executes in the browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or performing other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution, and complete compromise of the user's browser session within the application's context.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Output Encoding:**  Always and consistently encode user-provided data before rendering it within Recharts components, especially in text elements like labels, tooltips, and custom components. Use robust HTML encoding functions to neutralize any potentially malicious scripts.
    *   **Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with User Data:**  Absolutely avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` within Recharts components when displaying user-provided data. This practice bypasses standard XSS protection mechanisms and is highly risky.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks. Configure CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources and to disallow inline JavaScript execution where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Known Recharts Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/known_recharts_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Recharts itself, like any software library, might contain publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities that can be directly exploited if not patched.
*   **Recharts Contribution:** Using Recharts introduces the risk of inheriting and being affected by any security vulnerabilities present in the library's code. Exploiting these vulnerabilities directly targets Recharts' functionality.
*   **Example:** A publicly disclosed vulnerability in a specific version of Recharts allows an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow or prototype pollution by providing a specially crafted chart configuration or data input. This could lead to Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, or other critical security breaches.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Can range from Denial of Service (DoS) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can be Critical or High for exploitable vulnerabilities like RCE or XSS.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Recharts Updates:**  Establish a process for regularly updating the Recharts library to the latest stable version. Apply security patches and updates promptly as they are released.
    *   **Continuous Vulnerability Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring for security vulnerabilities affecting Recharts and its dependencies. Subscribe to security advisories, utilize vulnerability scanning tools, and actively track relevant security information sources.
    *   **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of the application's codebase, specifically focusing on the integration and usage of Recharts. Identify and address any potential vulnerabilities or insecure coding practices related to Recharts.
