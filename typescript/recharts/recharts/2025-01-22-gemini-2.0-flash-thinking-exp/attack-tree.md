## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Recharts [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_recharts__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the overall objective of compromising the application that utilizes the Recharts library. Success here means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access, data manipulation, or disruption through exploiting weaknesses related to Recharts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Recharts Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_recharts_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on directly exploiting vulnerabilities that are inherent to or introduced by the Recharts library itself. This is a high-risk area because vulnerabilities in Recharts can directly impact the security of any application using it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Data Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_data_injection__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This attack vector exploits the way Recharts handles and renders data. If the application fails to properly sanitize or validate data before passing it to Recharts, an attacker can inject malicious data to achieve various malicious outcomes.
*   This is a high-risk path due to the common nature of data injection vulnerabilities in web applications and the potential for significant impact, especially Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_data__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This is a specific type of Malicious Data Injection attack. The attacker aims to inject malicious JavaScript code into the data that is then rendered by Recharts in the user's browser. If Recharts or the application using it does not properly sanitize this data, the injected script will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    *   Steal user session cookies and credentials.
    *   Deface the application.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   XSS is a critical vulnerability and this path is marked as high-risk due to its potential for severe impact and relatively low effort and skill required for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script in Chart Data [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_in_chart_data__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This is the most direct step in achieving XSS via data injection. The attacker crafts data payloads specifically designed to include JavaScript code. This can be done by embedding `<script>` tags or using event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) within data labels, tooltips, or other chart elements that Recharts renders.
*   The success of this attack depends on whether Recharts properly sanitizes or escapes these potentially malicious data inputs before rendering them as SVG elements in the DOM.

## Attack Tree Path: [Recharts Library Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/recharts_library_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This path considers vulnerabilities that might exist within the Recharts library's code itself. These can be:
    *   **Known Recharts Vulnerabilities:** Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) or bugs reported in Recharts' issue trackers. Attackers can leverage these known vulnerabilities if the application is using a vulnerable version of Recharts.
    *   **Zero-Day Recharts Vulnerabilities:** Undisclosed vulnerabilities that are not yet publicly known or patched. Discovering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities requires significant effort and expertise but can have a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Recharts relies on other JavaScript libraries, primarily React and potentially others. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect applications using Recharts.
*   This path is high-risk because dependency vulnerabilities are common, and exploiting them can be relatively easy if known exploits are available.
*   **Vulnerable Recharts Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Focuses on vulnerabilities in direct dependencies of Recharts, like React.
*   **Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** Considers vulnerabilities in dependencies of Recharts' dependencies (nested dependencies). These are often overlooked but can be equally exploitable.
