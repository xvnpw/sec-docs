# Attack Surface Analysis for recharts/recharts

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injection - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG Attributes](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injection_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_svg_attributes.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code through chart data that is used to generate SVG attributes. When the SVG is rendered in a browser, the injected script can execute, leading to XSS.
*   **Recharts Contribution:** Recharts renders charts as SVG elements based on provided data. If this data is not properly sanitized, Recharts can include malicious code within the SVG attributes (e.g., in text elements, titles, labels) during SVG generation.
*   **Example:** Providing chart data where a label for a data point is crafted as `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`. When Recharts renders this label in the SVG, the `onerror` event will trigger, executing the `alert('XSS')` script within the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Full Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the application's context. This can result in session hijacking, cookie theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and other harmful actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* chart data originating from untrusted sources (user input, external APIs) *before* it is passed to Recharts.  Escape or remove any HTML or JavaScript code within data strings. Utilize a robust sanitization library specifically designed for preventing XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to significantly reduce the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities. Restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and strictly disable `unsafe-inline` script execution.
    *   **Regular Recharts Updates:**  Maintain Recharts library at its latest version. Security patches and bug fixes in newer versions may address potential XSS vulnerabilities within the library itself.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Configuration Injection - Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_configuration_injection_-_potential_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious or unexpected values into Recharts configuration options (props) that could lead to Cross-Site Scripting. While current Recharts versions might have limited areas for this, future flexibility in configuration could increase this risk if not handled securely.
*   **Recharts Contribution:** Recharts allows customization through props. If application logic dynamically generates these props based on untrusted input without proper validation, malicious configuration could be injected.  While current tooltip implementations are mostly SVG-based and less vulnerable, future features allowing richer content in tooltips or labels could increase XSS risk via configuration.
*   **Example:** (Illustrative of potential future risk) Imagine a hypothetical future version of Recharts that allows rendering custom HTML within tooltips via a configuration prop. If this configuration is built using unsanitized user input, an attacker could inject `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` into the tooltip configuration, leading to XSS when the tooltip is rendered.
*   **Impact:** Potential Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. Depending on the specific configuration vulnerability, attackers could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to similar impacts as described in the "Malicious Data Injection - XSS" attack surface.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to XSS potential)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration Whitelisting:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed configuration options and values, especially when configuration is derived from untrusted sources. Only permit necessary and demonstrably safe configuration options to be dynamically set.
    *   **Secure Configuration Defaults:** Utilize secure default configurations for Recharts components. Avoid exposing overly permissive or advanced configuration options to untrusted users unless absolutely necessary and rigorously secured.
    *   **Sanitize Dynamic Configuration Logic:** If chart configuration is dynamically generated, meticulously sanitize any input used to construct the configuration to prevent injection attacks. Treat configuration data with the same level of security scrutiny as chart data itself.
