# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for recharts/recharts

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Data Validation and Sanitization (Recharts Data)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_data_validation_and_sanitization__recharts_data_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Data Validation and Sanitization (Recharts Data)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Recharts Data Inputs:** Pinpoint all data inputs *specifically* used by Recharts components. This includes data passed to `data` props of charts, series, and other Recharts elements.
    2.  **Define Expected Recharts Data Schema:** Create a schema defining the expected data structure, data types (numbers, dates, strings), and allowed values for data points used in Recharts. Consider the specific data requirements of the chart types you are using (e.g., line charts need x and y values, bar charts might need category and value).
    3.  **Validate and Sanitize Before Recharts:** Implement validation and sanitization *immediately before* passing data to Recharts components. This ensures that only clean, expected data is processed by the library.
        *   Use validation logic to check if data conforms to the defined Recharts data schema.
        *   Sanitize data, especially string values that might be used in labels or tooltips within Recharts, to prevent injection attacks.
    4.  **Data Type Enforcement for Recharts Props:**  Utilize TypeScript or PropTypes to enforce data types for Recharts component props that accept data. This helps catch type-related errors early in development and ensures Recharts receives data in the expected format.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Injection into Recharts (High Severity): Malicious data injected into Recharts data inputs can lead to unexpected chart behavior, rendering errors, or potentially client-side vulnerabilities if Recharts or its dependencies mishandle the data.
*   **Impact:** High. Directly reduces the risk of data injection vulnerabilities specifically within the context of Recharts data processing and rendering.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General server-side validation exists, but specific validation tailored to the data structures and types expected by Recharts components is not explicitly defined or implemented. Sanitization is not currently applied to data before it's used by Recharts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicit data validation and sanitization logic specifically designed for Recharts data inputs, implemented right before data is passed to Recharts components. Data type enforcement using TypeScript or PropTypes for Recharts data props is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Whitelisting and Parameterization (Recharts Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_whitelisting_and_parameterization__recharts_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configuration Whitelisting and Parameterization (Recharts Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Recharts Configurations:** Review your code and identify all Recharts component configurations that are dynamically set or influenced by external factors, including user input or data. Focus on props like `type`, `layout`, `margin`, `axis` configurations, `tooltip` configurations, and any other props that control chart appearance or behavior.
    2.  **Define Recharts Configuration Whitelist:** Create a strict whitelist of allowed configuration options and their permissible values *specifically for Recharts components*. This whitelist should only include configurations necessary for intended chart functionality and considered safe.
    3.  **Parameterize Recharts Configurations:**  Instead of directly using user input or external data to construct Recharts configuration objects, use parameterization. Map user selections or external data to predefined, safe configuration options from the whitelist.
        *   For example, if users can choose chart colors, provide a predefined palette of safe colors and map user choices to these palette colors instead of allowing arbitrary color inputs.
    4.  **Validate Recharts Configuration Input:** If user input or external data influences Recharts configuration, validate this input against the defined whitelist and allowed values *before* constructing the configuration object that is passed to Recharts components.
    5.  **Secure Recharts Configuration Defaults:** Ensure Recharts components use secure default configurations if dynamic configuration parameters are missing or invalid.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Configuration Injection in Recharts (Medium Severity): Attackers might manipulate Recharts configurations to alter chart behavior in unintended ways, potentially leading to unexpected rendering, information disclosure through manipulated tooltips or labels, or client-side issues.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Effectively prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary configurations into Recharts, limiting their ability to manipulate chart behavior maliciously through configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Chart types might be selected from a predefined set, but finer-grained configuration options for Recharts, like visual styling or tooltip formatting, might be dynamically constructed without strict whitelisting or parameterization.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive whitelisting and parameterization for *all* dynamically configurable Recharts options. Currently, there's no explicit validation or restriction on the range of configuration options that can be dynamically set for Recharts components, especially for visual customization and interactive features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Recharts and Dependency Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_recharts_and_dependency_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Recharts and Dependency Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Track Recharts Dependency:** Ensure Recharts is managed as a dependency in your project using a package manager (npm, yarn, etc.).
    2.  **Vulnerability Scanning for Recharts Dependencies:** Include Recharts and its dependencies in your automated vulnerability scanning process. Tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check should be used to identify known vulnerabilities in Recharts and its dependency tree.
    3.  **Update Recharts Regularly:** Establish a schedule for regularly updating Recharts to the latest stable version. Prioritize updates that include security patches for Recharts or its dependencies.
    4.  **Test Recharts Updates:** Thoroughly test Recharts updates in a staging environment before deploying to production to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions in chart rendering or application functionality.
    5.  **Monitor Recharts Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and release notes specifically for Recharts to be aware of any reported vulnerabilities and recommended update actions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Recharts and Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Exploits in Recharts itself or its dependencies can directly impact the application's security, potentially leading to XSS, Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the client-side application, or Denial of Service (DoS) if vulnerabilities exist in Recharts rendering logic.
*   **Impact:** High. Crucial for maintaining a secure application by addressing known vulnerabilities specifically within the Recharts library and its ecosystem.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency updates are performed periodically, but not on a strict schedule prioritizing security updates for Recharts. Automated vulnerability scanning specifically targeting Recharts and its dependencies is not consistently performed or integrated into CI/CD.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated vulnerability scanning that includes Recharts and its dependencies, integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. A defined schedule and process for regularly updating Recharts, especially for security-related updates. Proactive monitoring of security advisories specifically for Recharts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Output Encoding for Dynamic Text in Recharts](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_output_encoding_for_dynamic_text_in_recharts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Context-Aware Output Encoding for Dynamic Text in Recharts
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Text in Recharts:** Locate all instances where user-provided data or external data is dynamically displayed as text *within Recharts components*. This includes labels, tooltips, axis ticks, legend text, and any other text elements rendered by Recharts that might incorporate dynamic data.
    2.  **Rely on React's Encoding for Recharts Text:** Ensure that you are using standard React rendering practices for displaying dynamic text within Recharts components. React's JSX automatically handles output encoding, which is generally sufficient for preventing XSS in text content.
        *   Render dynamic text using JSX expressions like `{dataPoint.label}` within Recharts component props or children.
    3.  **Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in Recharts Text Elements:**  Strictly avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` when rendering text content within Recharts components, especially if this content originates from user input or untrusted sources. This is crucial for maintaining XSS protection in Recharts text elements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Recharts Text Elements (High Severity): If user-provided data is directly rendered into Recharts text elements without proper encoding (or by using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), it can be exploited to inject malicious scripts that execute when the chart is rendered in users' browsers.
*   **Impact:** High. Prevents XSS vulnerabilities specifically related to the dynamic display of user data within text elements rendered by Recharts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. React's default JSX rendering provides encoding. However, a review is needed to confirm that `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is not used in any Recharts component implementations for text rendering, and that standard React practices are consistently followed for dynamic text within charts.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A thorough code review to verify that all dynamic text rendering within Recharts components relies on secure React practices and avoids `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user-provided data. Explicit guidelines for developers to ensure secure text rendering in Recharts should be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Size and Complexity Limits for Recharts Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/data_size_and_complexity_limits_for_recharts_rendering.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Size and Complexity Limits for Recharts Rendering
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Performance Testing with Recharts:** Conduct performance testing of Recharts rendering with varying data sizes and complexities. Specifically test the chart types and configurations used in your application to identify performance bottlenecks and thresholds.
    2.  **Implement Data Limits for Recharts:** Based on performance testing, implement limits on the size and complexity of data that is passed to Recharts components.
        *   Limit the number of data points, series, or categories that can be visualized in a single Recharts chart.
        *   Consider simplifying chart configurations or using less resource-intensive chart types for very large datasets.
    3.  **Server-Side Data Aggregation/Pagination for Recharts:** On the server-side, implement data aggregation or pagination techniques to reduce the amount of data sent to the client for Recharts visualization, especially for large datasets. Send summarized or paginated data to Recharts instead of raw, massive datasets.
    4.  **Client-Side Data Sampling/Truncation (Optional):** As a secondary measure, consider client-side data sampling or truncation if the data size still exceeds acceptable performance limits for Recharts rendering in the browser. Display warnings to users if they are attempting to visualize excessively large datasets.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Recharts Rendering (Medium Severity): Maliciously crafted or excessively large datasets can cause Recharts to consume excessive client-side resources during rendering, leading to browser slowdowns, crashes, or application unresponsiveness specifically due to Recharts performance issues.
*   **Impact:** Medium. Reduces the risk of client-side DoS specifically caused by resource-intensive Recharts rendering of large or complex datasets.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General pagination might exist in APIs, but specific data size and complexity limits tailored for optimal Recharts rendering performance are not defined or enforced. Performance testing specifically focused on Recharts rendering with large datasets has not been conducted.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Performance testing of Recharts rendering with large datasets. Definition and implementation of data size and complexity limits specifically for Recharts data inputs. Server-side data aggregation or pagination strategies tailored for efficient Recharts visualization of large datasets.
