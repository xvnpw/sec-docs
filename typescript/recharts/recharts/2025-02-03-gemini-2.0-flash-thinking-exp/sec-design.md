# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Recharts, aims to provide a composable charting library built on React and SVG. It is designed to be a flexible and reusable tool for developers to create various types of charts and graphs within React applications.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a user-friendly and intuitive API for creating charts in React.
- Offer a wide range of chart types and customization options to meet diverse visualization needs.
- Ensure good performance and responsiveness for smooth user experiences.
- Foster a strong community around the library for ongoing development and support.
- Maintain compatibility with modern React versions and web browsers.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in Recharts could be exploited in applications that use it, potentially leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
- Poor performance or lack of features could lead developers to choose alternative charting libraries, reducing the adoption and value of Recharts.
- Lack of maintenance or community support could result in the library becoming outdated and unusable over time.
- Incompatibility with future React versions or browser updates could break existing applications using Recharts.
- Improper handling of user-provided data within applications using Recharts could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized before being rendered in charts (e.g., in tooltips or labels).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Dependency Management - Recharts relies on npm for dependency management. This provides a standard mechanism for including and updating third-party libraries. (Implemented via `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in the repository)
- security control: Open Source - As an open-source project, the code is publicly accessible and can be reviewed by the community, potentially leading to the identification and resolution of security issues. (Implemented via GitHub repository)
- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party dependencies - Recharts depends on other npm packages, which may contain vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Community-driven development - Security vulnerabilities might be introduced by community contributions if not thoroughly reviewed.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Recharts.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically analyze the Recharts codebase for potential security flaws.
- security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Utilize SCA tools to gain visibility into the open source components used in Recharts and manage associated risks.
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the Recharts codebase by security experts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable to a charting library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that use Recharts.
- Authorization: Not applicable to a charting library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that use Recharts to control access to data being visualized.
- Input Validation: Recharts should be designed to handle various types of input data gracefully and prevent potential injection vulnerabilities. While Recharts primarily renders data, if user-provided strings are used in chart elements like labels or tooltips, proper sanitization should be considered in the consuming application to prevent XSS.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for a charting library. However, if Recharts is used to visualize sensitive data that is encrypted, it should not interfere with the encryption or decryption processes handled by the consuming application. Recharts itself does not need to implement cryptographic functions.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer makes code changes in their local environment.
2. Code changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.
3. GitHub Actions workflow (CI/CD pipeline) is triggered upon code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
4. Build Automation step executes the build process defined in the workflow (e.g., using npm scripts).
5. Security Checks step performs automated security scans, including:
    - Linters: Code linters to enforce code quality and identify potential code style issues that could lead to vulnerabilities.
    - SAST: Static Application Security Testing tools to analyze the codebase for potential security flaws.
    - Dependency Scanning: Tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
6. Unit Tests step executes unit tests to ensure code functionality and prevent regressions.
7. Package Build step packages the library into an npm package (e.g., using `npm pack`).
8. npm Registry Publish step publishes the built npm package to the npm registry. This step typically requires appropriate credentials and may be triggered manually or automatically based on the CI/CD workflow configuration.
9. Build Artifacts are the resulting npm package published to the npm registry, ready for consumption by React developers.

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Automated Build Process - Using GitHub Actions for automated builds ensures a consistent and repeatable build process, reducing the risk of manual errors and inconsistencies.
- security control: Source Code Version Control - GitHub provides version control, ensuring code integrity and traceability of changes.
- security control: Security Checks in CI/CD - Integrating security checks (linters, SAST, dependency scanning) into the CI/CD pipeline helps to identify and address security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Unit Testing - Unit tests help ensure code quality and reduce the risk of introducing bugs, including security-related bugs.
- security control: Package Integrity - npm registry provides mechanisms for package signing and verification to ensure the integrity of published packages.
- security control: Access Control for Publishing - Access control to the npm registry publishing process should be restricted to authorized personnel to prevent unauthorized package releases.
- security control: Secret Management - Securely manage secrets (e.g., npm registry tokens) used in the CI/CD pipeline, using GitHub Secrets or similar secure secret management solutions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing a reliable and secure charting library for React developers.
- Maintaining the reputation and trustworthiness of the Recharts project.
- Ensuring the continued usability and maintainability of the library.

Data to Protect:
- Source code of the Recharts library (low sensitivity, publicly available on GitHub, but integrity is important).
- npm package for distribution (medium sensitivity, integrity and availability are important to prevent supply chain attacks).
- Developer credentials and build pipeline secrets (high sensitivity, compromise could lead to unauthorized releases or malicious code injection).
- User data visualized by applications using Recharts (sensitivity depends on the application, Recharts itself does not store or process this data directly, but vulnerabilities could indirectly expose it).

Data Sensitivity:
- Source Code: Low to Medium (Publicly available, but modifications should be controlled).
- npm Package: Medium (Integrity is crucial for supply chain security).
- Developer Credentials/Secrets: High (Critical for maintaining control and security of the project).
- User Data Visualized by Applications: Variable (Depends on the application context, potentially high).
