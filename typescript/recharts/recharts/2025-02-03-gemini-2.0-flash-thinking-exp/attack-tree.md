## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Recharts [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_recharts__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the root goal and represents the overall objective of the attacker.
*   Success here means the attacker has achieved their aim of compromising the application through Recharts-related vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Recharts Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_recharts_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This is a major attack vector focusing on directly exploiting weaknesses within the Recharts library itself.
*   It encompasses various sub-paths, all considered high-risk due to their potential for significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Data Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_data_injection__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This path highlights the risk of injecting malicious data into the application that is then processed and rendered by Recharts.
*   If Recharts or the application using it does not properly sanitize or validate data, it becomes a prime target for attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_data__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This is a critical sub-path within Malicious Data Injection.
*   It focuses specifically on achieving Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious scripts through chart data.
*   Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script in Chart Data [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_in_chart_data__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This is the most direct attack step to achieve XSS via data.
*   Attackers craft data payloads that include JavaScript code, aiming to have this code executed in the user's browser when Recharts renders the chart.
*   This can be done by embedding `<script>` tags or using event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) within data labels, tooltips, or other chart elements.
*   If Recharts renders this data without proper sanitization, the malicious script will execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [Recharts Library Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/recharts_library_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities that might exist directly within the Recharts library code.
*   These vulnerabilities could be:
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) that attackers can research and exploit if the application uses a vulnerable version of Recharts.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Undisclosed vulnerabilities that are not yet known to the public or the Recharts developers. Discovering and exploiting these requires significant effort and expertise but can have a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This path highlights the risks associated with vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by Recharts.
*   Recharts relies on other libraries, primarily React, and potentially others. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly compromise applications using Recharts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Recharts Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_recharts_dependencies__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This focuses on vulnerabilities in the direct dependencies of Recharts (e.g., React, D3 if directly used).

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerable Dependencies (e.g., React, D3 if directly used) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerable_dependencies__e_g___react__d3_if_directly_used___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   The first step is for attackers to identify vulnerable dependencies.
*   This is often done by analyzing Recharts' `package.json` file and dependency tree to determine the versions of its dependencies.
*   Public vulnerability databases and tools can then be used to check for known vulnerabilities in those specific versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Dependency [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_dependency__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   Once a vulnerable dependency is identified, attackers can attempt to exploit the known vulnerability.
*   Exploits for common dependency vulnerabilities are often publicly available or relatively easy to develop.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/transitive_dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This path addresses vulnerabilities in *transitive* dependencies – dependencies of Recharts' dependencies (nested dependencies).
*   These are often overlooked but can be equally vulnerable and impactful.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerable_transitive_dependencies__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   Similar to direct dependencies, attackers need to identify vulnerable transitive dependencies.
*   This requires more in-depth dependency analysis tools that can traverse the entire dependency tree and identify vulnerabilities in nested dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Transitive Dependency [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_transitive_dependency__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   Once a vulnerable transitive dependency is found, attackers can attempt to exploit it.
*   Exploitation might be slightly more complex than for direct dependencies, but the potential impact remains high.
