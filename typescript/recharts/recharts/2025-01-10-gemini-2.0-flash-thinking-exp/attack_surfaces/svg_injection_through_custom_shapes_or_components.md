        Recharts' flexibility in allowing custom SVG elements and React components
        for rendering chart elements (like markers, shapes, etc.) creates an
        opportunity for injecting malicious SVG code. This occurs when the source
        of these custom SVG elements is not trusted or when user input influences
        their generation without proper sanitization.
        """
        self.example_scenario_details = """
        Consider an application allowing users to upload custom icons to be used
        as markers in a ScatterChart. If the application directly uses the uploaded
        SVG content in the 'symbol' prop without sanitization, a malicious user
        could upload an SVG file containing JavaScript within a <script> tag or
        event handlers (e.g., onload). When Recharts renders the chart, the browser
        will execute this injected script.

        self.impact_details = """
        The impact of successful SVG injection is similar to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
        attacks and can be severe, including:
        - **Account Takeover:** Stealing session cookies or authentication tokens.
        - **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Redirecting users to phishing pages or
          websites hosting malware.
        - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data displayed on the page.
        - **Defacement of the Application:** Altering the visual appearance or
          functionality of the application.
        - **Execution of Arbitrary Code:** Potentially leading to more severe
          compromises depending on the application's privileges and environment.

            "developers": """
            - **Strictly Control SVG Sources:**  Limit the sources from which custom
              SVG shapes and components are loaded. Prefer using a predefined set
              of internal, trusted SVG assets.
            - **Robust Sanitization:** Implement thorough sanitization of any SVG
              content derived from user input or external sources. This should be
              done on the server-side before the SVG is rendered on the client.
            - **Use Secure SVG Sanitization Libraries:** Employ well-vetted and
              actively maintained libraries specifically designed for sanitizing SVG.
              Examples include DOMPurify or svg-sanitizer. Configure the library
              to remove potentially harmful elements and attributes like `<script>`,
              `<iframe>`, and event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`).
            - **Whitelist Safe Elements and Attributes:** Instead of blacklisting
              potentially dangerous elements, consider whitelisting only the SVG
              elements and attributes that are necessary for your application's
              functionality. This provides a more secure approach.
            - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP that restricts
              the execution of inline scripts. This can help mitigate the impact
              of successful SVG injection even if sanitization is bypassed. Consider
              using `script-src 'none'` or a strict policy that doesn't allow
              inline scripts or 'unsafe-inline'.
            - **Input Validation:**  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to
              expected formats and doesn't contain unexpected characters or patterns
              that could be part of a malicious SVG payload.
            - **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and
              penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities related to
              SVG injection and other attack vectors.
