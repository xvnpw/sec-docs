## Deep Analysis: Malicious SVG Injection through Custom Tooltips or Labels in Recharts

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Malicious SVG Injection through Custom Tooltips or Labels" threat identified in the threat model for an application using the Recharts library.

**1. Understanding the Vulnerability:**

This vulnerability hinges on the way Recharts handles custom content within its `Tooltip` and `Label` components. If these components allow rendering of arbitrary user-provided HTML or SVG without proper sanitization *within the Recharts library itself*, it creates an opportunity for attackers to inject malicious SVG code.

**Key Aspects:**

* **SVG as a Delivery Mechanism:** SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format. Crucially, SVG can embed `<script>` tags, allowing for the execution of JavaScript within the context of the web page.
* **Custom Content Rendering:** Recharts offers flexibility by allowing developers to define custom content for tooltips and labels. This often involves passing a function or JSX element that determines what is rendered. If this custom content is derived directly or indirectly from user input without sanitization, it becomes a potential attack vector.
* **Client-Side Rendering:** Recharts primarily operates on the client-side using JavaScript. This means any injected malicious SVG will be rendered and executed within the user's browser.
* **Lack of Built-in Sanitization (Potential):** The core of the vulnerability lies in the assumption that Recharts *might not* automatically sanitize all custom content passed to its `Tooltip` and `Label` components. While Recharts might escape certain characters, it might not be robust enough to prevent the execution of malicious scripts embedded within SVG.

**2. Attack Vectors and Exploitation Scenarios:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through various means, depending on how the application utilizes Recharts and handles user input:

* **Direct Input in Configuration:** If the application allows users to directly configure the content of tooltips or labels (e.g., through a settings panel), an attacker could directly inject malicious SVG code.
* **Data-Driven Injection:** If the content of tooltips or labels is derived from data sources that are influenced by user input (e.g., database records, API responses), an attacker could manipulate this data to include malicious SVG.
* **Indirect Injection through Other Vulnerabilities:** An attacker could leverage other vulnerabilities in the application (e.g., stored XSS in a user profile) to inject malicious SVG that is later displayed within Recharts components.

**Example Attack Scenario:**

Imagine a dashboard application that displays user activity using Recharts. The tooltip for each data point shows the user's name. If the application fetches user names from a database without sanitizing them before passing them to the `Tooltip` component, an attacker could:

1. **Modify their username in the database to include malicious SVG:** `<svg><script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script></svg>`.
2. **When another user hovers over the attacker's data point:** The Recharts `Tooltip` component renders the attacker's username, including the malicious SVG.
3. **The `<script>` tag within the SVG executes:** Displaying an alert box, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability. A real attacker would likely inject more sophisticated malicious code.

**3. Impact Analysis (Deep Dive):**

The impact of a successful malicious SVG injection leading to XSS is significant and aligns with the general consequences of XSS vulnerabilities:

* **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts and sensitive data.
* **Credential Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to create fake login forms or redirect users to phishing sites, tricking them into revealing their credentials.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can access and transmit sensitive data displayed on the page or stored in the browser's local storage or cookies.
* **Account Takeover:** By gaining control of a user's session or credentials, attackers can completely take over their accounts.
* **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content and appearance of the web page, potentially damaging the application's reputation.
* **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Injected scripts can redirect users to malicious websites that could host malware or further exploit their systems.
* **Keylogging:** Attackers can log user keystrokes, capturing sensitive information like passwords and credit card details.
* **Drive-by Downloads:** Malicious scripts can trigger the download of malware onto the user's computer without their knowledge.

**Specific Considerations for Recharts Context:**

* **Context of Execution:** The injected script will execute within the context of the application, having access to the application's JavaScript objects, cookies, and local storage.
* **User Interaction Trigger:** The execution of the malicious script is often triggered by user interaction with the chart, specifically hovering over data points to display tooltips or interacting with labels. This makes the attack subtle and potentially difficult to detect.

**4. Technical Deep Dive and Code Examples:**

Let's illustrate the vulnerability with hypothetical code examples (assuming Recharts doesn't sanitize in these scenarios):

**Vulnerable Code (Illustrative):**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { LineChart, Line, Tooltip } from 'recharts';

const data = [
  { name: 'Page A', uv: 400, pv: 2400, amt: 2400, tooltipContent: '<svg><script>alert("XSS!")</script></svg>' },
  { name: 'Page B', uv: 300, pv: 1398, amt: 2210, tooltipContent: 'Safe Content' },
];

const CustomTooltip = ({ active, payload, label }) => {
  if (active && payload && payload.length) {
    return (
      <div className="custom-tooltip">
        <p className="label">{`${label} : ${payload[0].value}`}</p>
        {/* Potentially vulnerable if payload[0].payload.tooltipContent is unsanitized */}
        <p className="desc" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: payload[0].payload.tooltipContent }} />
      </div>
    );
  }
  return null;
};

const MyChart = () => {
  return (
    <LineChart width={500} height={300} data={data}>
      <Line type="monotone" dataKey="uv" stroke="#8884d8" />
      <Tooltip content={<CustomTooltip />} />
    </LineChart>
  );
};

export default MyChart;
```

**Explanation:**

* In this example, the `tooltipContent` in the `data` array contains malicious SVG.
* The `CustomTooltip` component uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render the `tooltipContent`. If Recharts doesn't sanitize this content before passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, the script will execute.

**Similar vulnerability could exist in `Label` component if custom content is handled unsafely.**

**5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed Implementation):**

The provided mitigation strategies are crucial. Let's elaborate on their implementation:

* **Strict Sanitization of Custom Content *before* passing it to Recharts' `Tooltip` or `Label` components:**
    * **Server-Side Sanitization:** This is the most robust approach. Sanitize user-provided content on the server-side *before* it even reaches the client-side Recharts components. Libraries like DOMPurify, js-xss, or OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer can be used for this purpose.
    * **Client-Side Sanitization (with caution):** While server-side sanitization is preferred, client-side sanitization can be used as an additional layer of defense. However, rely on well-established and regularly updated libraries. Be aware that client-side sanitization can be bypassed if the attacker has control over the client-side code.
    * **Contextual Sanitization:**  Sanitize based on the expected context of the content. For example, if only plain text is expected, strip all HTML tags.

* **Avoid Allowing Arbitrary HTML/SVG *in Recharts configurations*:**
    * **Restrict Input Options:** If possible, limit the types of content allowed in custom tooltips and labels. Offer pre-defined safe elements or formatting options instead of allowing free-form HTML/SVG.
    * **Use Data Transformation:** Transform user input into a safe representation before passing it to Recharts. For example, instead of allowing HTML, allow a simple markup language that is then safely rendered.
    * **Escape Special Characters:** If simple text is the goal, ensure that HTML special characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, and `&` are properly escaped.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Implement a Strong CSP:** A properly configured CSP header can significantly mitigate the impact of injected scripts by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load and execute.
    * **`script-src 'self'`:** This directive restricts script execution to only those originating from the application's own domain, preventing inline scripts injected through SVG from running.
    * **`object-src 'none'`:** This directive prevents the loading of plugins like Flash, which can be exploited for XSS.
    * **`style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (Use with caution):** While inline styles can be convenient, they can also be an attack vector. Consider using a nonce-based or hash-based approach for inline styles if necessary.

**Additional Mitigation Measures:**

* **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data that could potentially influence the content of tooltips or labels. Validate data type, length, and format.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including XSS flaws related to Recharts usage.
* **Stay Updated with Recharts Security Advisories:** Monitor the Recharts project for any reported security vulnerabilities and update the library to the latest version promptly.
* **Educate Developers:** Ensure that the development team is aware of the risks associated with rendering unsanitized user content and understands how to use Recharts securely.

**6. Detection and Monitoring:**

While prevention is key, implementing detection and monitoring mechanisms can help identify potential exploitation attempts:

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can be configured to detect and block requests containing suspicious patterns indicative of XSS attacks, including attempts to inject SVG with `<script>` tags.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** These systems can analyze network traffic and system logs for malicious activity related to XSS.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** SIEM systems can aggregate and analyze security logs from various sources, helping to identify patterns and anomalies that might indicate an ongoing attack.
* **Browser Error Monitoring:** Monitor browser console errors, as these might indicate attempts to execute malicious scripts that are being blocked by the browser or CSP.
* **User Activity Monitoring:** Track user actions and identify unusual behavior that could be associated with account compromise due to XSS.

**7. Developer Guidance and Best Practices:**

For the development team working with Recharts:

* **Treat all user-provided content as untrusted.**
* **Prioritize server-side sanitization.**
* **Use well-established sanitization libraries.**
* **Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user-provided content unless absolutely necessary and after thorough sanitization.**
* **Implement and enforce a strong Content Security Policy.**
* **Educate yourselves on common XSS attack vectors.**
* **Regularly review and update dependencies, including Recharts.**
* **Test your application for XSS vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual penetration testing.**

**8. Considerations for the Recharts Library Itself:**

While the primary responsibility for sanitization lies with the application developers, the Recharts library could potentially enhance its security by:

* **Providing built-in sanitization options for custom content within `Tooltip` and `Label` components.** This could be an opt-in feature or a default behavior.
* **Clearly documenting the security considerations when using custom content rendering.**
* **Offering safer alternatives to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for rendering custom content, if feasible.**

**Conclusion:**

The "Malicious SVG Injection through Custom Tooltips or Labels" threat is a significant security concern for applications using Recharts. Understanding the mechanics of this vulnerability, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and adopting secure development practices are crucial to prevent successful exploitation and protect users from the severe consequences of XSS attacks. A defense-in-depth approach, combining server-side and client-side security measures, is essential to minimize the risk. Regular security assessments and ongoing vigilance are necessary to maintain a secure application.
