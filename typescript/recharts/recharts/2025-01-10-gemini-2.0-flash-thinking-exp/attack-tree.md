# Attack Tree Analysis for recharts/recharts

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) affecting the application's functionality by exploiting weaknesses in the Recharts library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **[CRITICAL]** Compromise Application via Recharts
    *   AND
        *   **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Recharts Vulnerability
        *   **[CRITICAL]** Achieve Desired Impact (Execute Code or Cause DoS)

*   **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Recharts Vulnerability
    *   OR
        *   **[HIGH-RISK]** Malicious Data Injection
            *   AND
                *   Provide Malicious Data to Recharts
                *   Recharts Fails to Sanitize/Escape
                    *   **[HIGH-RISK]** SVG Injection via Data Attributes
                    *   **[HIGH-RISK]** Resource Exhaustion via Complex Data
        *   **[HIGH-RISK]** Client-Side Denial of Service (Rendering)
            *   Force Recharts to render extremely complex SVG, freezing the browser

*   **[CRITICAL]** Achieve Desired Impact (Execute Code or Cause DoS)
    *   OR
        *   **[HIGH-RISK]** Execute Arbitrary JavaScript Code
        *   **[HIGH-RISK]** Cause Client-Side Denial of Service

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Application via Recharts](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_application_via_recharts.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal of successfully leveraging vulnerabilities within the Recharts library to harm the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Recharts Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_recharts_vulnerability.md)

This is the crucial step where the attacker identifies and utilizes a weakness within Recharts' code or functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Malicious Data Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__malicious_data_injection.md)

Attackers provide crafted data to the Recharts library with the intention of exploiting how Recharts processes it.

## Attack Tree Path: [SVG Injection via Data Attributes](./attack_tree_paths/svg_injection_via_data_attributes.md)

Attackers inject malicious SVG code, including `<script>` tags or event handlers, directly into the data attributes that Recharts uses to generate charts. If Recharts fails to properly sanitize these attributes, the injected script can execute in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Data](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_data.md)

Attackers provide extremely large or deeply nested data structures to Recharts. This can overwhelm the client-side rendering process, causing the user's browser to freeze or crash, resulting in a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Client-Side Denial of Service (Rendering)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__client-side_denial_of_service__rendering_.md)

Attackers craft specific data that forces Recharts to generate exceptionally complex SVG structures. Rendering these complex structures consumes significant browser resources, leading to unresponsiveness and a denial of service for the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Achieve Desired Impact (Execute Code or Cause DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__achieve_desired_impact__execute_code_or_cause_dos_.md)

This represents the successful outcome of exploiting a Recharts vulnerability, resulting in either the execution of malicious JavaScript code or a denial-of-service condition.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Execute Arbitrary JavaScript Code](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__execute_arbitrary_javascript_code.md)

Through successful exploitation (e.g., SVG injection), the attacker manages to execute their own JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser. This allows them to perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Cause Client-Side Denial of Service](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__cause_client-side_denial_of_service.md)

Through successful exploitation (e.g., resource exhaustion or rendering overload), the attacker renders the application or the Recharts component unusable for the user due to excessive resource consumption or errors.
