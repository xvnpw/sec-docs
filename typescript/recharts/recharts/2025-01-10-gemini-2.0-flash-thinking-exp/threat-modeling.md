# Threat Model Analysis for recharts/recharts

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_data_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted data to be visualized by Recharts. This data contains malicious JavaScript code that, when rendered by Recharts, executes in the user's browser within the context of the application. The attacker manipulates the data that Recharts directly processes for rendering.

**Impact:** Successful execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected Component:**  Various chart components that render text or allow custom content, such as:

*   `Tooltip` component (if using custom content or formatting)
*   `Label` component
*   `Text` component within SVG elements
*   Potentially data point labels or axis tick labels if not properly sanitized *by Recharts*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization *before* passing data to Recharts:** This is the primary defense.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
*   **Avoid Using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar mechanisms *within custom Recharts components or configurations*:** If unavoidable, extremely careful sanitization is required.
*   **Regularly Update Recharts:** Keep the Recharts library updated to benefit from potential security patches *within the library itself*.

## Threat: [Malicious SVG Injection through Custom Tooltips or Labels](./threats/malicious_svg_injection_through_custom_tooltips_or_labels.md)

**Description:** If Recharts' `Tooltip` or `Label` components are configured to render user-provided content without sufficient sanitization *within the Recharts library itself*, an attacker could inject malicious SVG code. This injected SVG could contain `<script>` tags or other elements that execute arbitrary JavaScript when the tooltip or label is displayed or interacted with.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, leading to the same impacts as described in the "Malicious Data Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)" threat.

**Affected Component:**

*   `Tooltip` component when using custom content rendering.
*   `Label` component when allowing user-defined content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strict Sanitization of Custom Content *before* passing it to Recharts' `Tooltip` or `Label` components:** This is crucial if the library itself doesn't handle this.
*   **Avoid Allowing Arbitrary HTML/SVG *in Recharts configurations*:** If possible, limit the types of content allowed in custom tooltips and labels to simple text or pre-defined safe elements.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
