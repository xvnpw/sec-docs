# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for recharts/recharts

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Provided Data for Chart Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-provided_data_for_chart_rendering.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all data inputs to Recharts components that originate from user input or external, untrusted sources. This includes data used in chart datasets, tooltips, labels, and custom components rendering text within or related to the chart.
    2.  Choose a suitable sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify for JavaScript).
    3.  Implement sanitization functions to process user-provided data *before* it is passed to Recharts components.
    4.  Apply sanitization to data used in:
        *   `data` prop of chart components (e.g., `BarChart`, `LineChart`).
        *   `name` and `value` properties within data objects in the `data` array.
        *   Content of custom tooltips and labels used by Recharts.
    5.  Ensure data is properly encoded for the context where Recharts uses it (e.g., HTML encoding for text content).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Injection into Recharts - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Injection into Recharts: High Risk Reduction - Prevents injection of malicious scripts through user-provided data that Recharts renders.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Input sanitization is implemented on the frontend using DOMPurify for user-provided text fields that are used in chart tooltips and labels rendered by Recharts.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing for data fetched from external APIs that are directly used in Recharts chart datasets without sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Data Structure and Types Before Recharts Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/validate_data_structure_and_types_before_recharts_rendering.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define the expected data structure and types that Recharts components require for your charts.
    2.  Implement data validation logic, both client-side and server-side, to check data *before* it's used by Recharts.
    3.  Validate:
        *   Structure of the `data` prop passed to Recharts components.
        *   Data types of properties within data objects (e.g., ensuring chart values are numbers as expected by Recharts).
    4.  Handle validation failures by preventing Recharts from rendering with invalid data and displaying error messages.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Data to Recharts - Severity: Medium
    *   Unexpected Chart Behavior/Rendering Errors in Recharts - Severity: Low
    *   Potential Exploitation of Parsing Vulnerabilities in Recharts (or its dependencies) - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Data to Recharts: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of crashing Recharts or causing performance issues due to unexpected data formats.
    *   Unexpected Chart Behavior/Rendering Errors in Recharts: High Risk Reduction - Prevents Recharts from rendering incorrectly due to data format issues.
    *   Potential Exploitation of Parsing Vulnerabilities in Recharts: Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Minimizes the attack surface by ensuring data conforms to Recharts' expected formats.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Client-side validation using PropTypes for React components and basic type checking before data is passed to Recharts.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Server-side validation is not fully implemented for all data sources used by Recharts. More robust schema validation on the backend is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for Recharts SVG Output](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__for_recharts_svg_output.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure your web server to send a Content Security Policy (CSP) header.
    2.  Within the CSP, define directives that control the behavior of SVG elements generated by Recharts.
    3.  Focus on:
        *   `script-src 'none'` or `script-src 'self'`: To prevent script execution within Recharts-generated SVG, mitigating SVG-based XSS.
        *   `style-src 'self'`: To restrict styles within Recharts SVG.
    4.  Test CSP to ensure it doesn't break Recharts functionality while mitigating SVG threats.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SVG-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) from Recharts Output - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   SVG-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) from Recharts Output: High Risk Reduction - CSP effectively prevents malicious scripts within Recharts' SVG output.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - A basic CSP is implemented, including `script-src 'self'` and `style-src 'self'`, which applies to Recharts SVG output.
*   **Missing Implementation:** CSP for SVG is not explicitly fine-tuned for Recharts. Directives like `script-src 'none'` specifically for SVG contexts could be more strictly enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Embedding Untrusted Content Directly in Recharts SVG Attributes](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_embedding_untrusted_content_directly_in_recharts_svg_attributes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify where user-provided data might be directly embedded into SVG attributes generated by Recharts or custom SVG components used with Recharts (e.g., `title`, `desc`, custom attributes).
    2.  Sanitize user-provided data *before* embedding it into Recharts SVG attributes.
    3.  Prefer using Recharts' built-in mechanisms for labels, tooltips, and descriptions to minimize direct SVG attribute manipulation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Attribute-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Recharts SVG - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attribute-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Recharts SVG: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces XSS risks from embedding unsanitized data in Recharts SVG attributes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - We primarily use Recharts' built-in components.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Review custom SVG elements used with Recharts for annotations to ensure user-provided text in attributes is sanitized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Recharts and its Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_recharts_and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a schedule to check for updates to Recharts and its dependencies.
    2.  Monitor security advisories for Recharts and its ecosystem (npm, GitHub).
    3.  Use dependency scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities in Recharts and its dependencies.
    4.  Prioritize updating Recharts and its dependencies, especially for security fixes.
    5.  Test after updates to ensure compatibility with Recharts.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Recharts or Dependencies - Severity: Varies
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Recharts or Dependencies: High Risk Reduction - Regularly updating Recharts reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in the library itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Automated dependency checks using `npm audit` in CI.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automate the update process further and establish a more proactive schedule for Recharts dependency updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Recharts Release Notes and Changelogs During Updates](./mitigation_strategies/review_recharts_release_notes_and_changelogs_during_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When updating Recharts, review release notes and changelogs.
    2.  Look for security fixes, bug fixes with security implications, and behavior changes in Recharts.
    3.  Understand security-related changes and their relevance to your Recharts implementation.
    4.  Verify that updating mitigates identified vulnerabilities in Recharts.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Missing Security Patches for Recharts due to Ignorance of Release Notes - Severity: Varies
*   **Impact:**
    *   Missing Security Patches for Recharts due to Ignorance of Release Notes: Medium Risk Reduction - Ensures awareness and application of security patches released by the Recharts maintainers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Developers are generally aware, but a formal security-focused review of Recharts release notes is not consistently followed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalize a step in the update process for security review of Recharts release notes.
