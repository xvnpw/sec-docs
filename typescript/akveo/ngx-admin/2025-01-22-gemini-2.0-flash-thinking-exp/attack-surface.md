# Attack Surface Analysis for akveo/ngx-admin

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Critical and high severity vulnerabilities present in the npm dependencies that ngx-admin directly includes and relies upon.
    *   **ngx-admin Contribution:** ngx-admin's `package.json` defines a set of dependencies. Outdated or vulnerable versions specified here directly introduce risk to applications built with ngx-admin.
    *   **Example:** ngx-admin uses an outdated version of a charting library with a known critical XSS vulnerability. Applications built using this version of ngx-admin inherit this vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Full application compromise, remote code execution, significant data breach, widespread XSS attacks affecting all users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Dependency Management:** Regularly audit `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) for vulnerabilities using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   **Proactive Dependency Updates:** Implement a policy to promptly update ngx-admin dependencies, especially for security patches. Consider automated dependency update tools.
        *   **Monitor ngx-admin Security Advisories:** Track ngx-admin's release notes and community channels for any security advisories related to its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Default Configurations and Insecure Example Code Deployment](./attack_surfaces/default_configurations_and_insecure_example_code_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** Deployment of ngx-admin applications with insecure default configurations or example code that is intended for demonstration purposes but not production security.
    *   **ngx-admin Contribution:** ngx-admin provides example pages, components, and configurations to showcase features. Developers might mistakenly deploy these defaults to production, creating significant security holes.
    *   **Example:** An ngx-admin application is deployed with default, overly permissive API endpoint configurations from example code, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive backend data or functionalities. Or, example authentication mechanisms with weak or hardcoded credentials are left active.
    *   **Impact:**  Direct unauthorized access to backend systems, complete bypass of intended access controls, exposure of sensitive data, potential for full system takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Configuration Review:** Implement a mandatory security review process before deploying any ngx-admin application to production. This review must specifically check for and remove all default configurations and example code.
        *   **Secure Configuration Templates:** Create secure configuration templates for production deployments, ensuring all defaults are hardened and example code is removed.
        *   **Automated Configuration Checks:** Integrate automated checks into the deployment pipeline to detect and flag any remaining default configurations or example code before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side XSS Vulnerabilities within Core ngx-admin Components](./attack_surfaces/client-side_xss_vulnerabilities_within_core_ngx-admin_components.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present within the core components provided directly by ngx-admin framework itself.
    *   **ngx-admin Contribution:** If vulnerabilities exist in the templates or component logic of ngx-admin's core modules, all applications using these components will be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A core ngx-admin table component improperly handles user-provided data in a way that allows for XSS injection. Any application using this table component without modification becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread XSS attacks affecting all users of the application, potential for account takeover, session hijacking, and malicious actions performed on behalf of users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **ngx-admin Updates:**  Keep ngx-admin framework updated to the latest versions. Security patches for core framework vulnerabilities will be released in updates.
        *   **Report Suspected Vulnerabilities:** If you suspect an XSS vulnerability within core ngx-admin components, report it to the ngx-admin maintainers through their official channels.
        *   **Custom Component Review (If Modifying Core Components):** If you are modifying core ngx-admin components, conduct thorough security reviews of your changes to avoid introducing XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Nebular UI Framework Critical Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/nebular_ui_framework_critical_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Critical severity vulnerabilities within the Nebular UI framework, which is a fundamental dependency and UI foundation of ngx-admin.
    *   **ngx-admin Contribution:** ngx-admin's architecture is tightly coupled with Nebular. Critical vulnerabilities in Nebular directly translate to critical vulnerabilities in ngx-admin based applications.
    *   **Example:** A critical XSS or DOM-based vulnerability is discovered in a widely used Nebular component like a form input or navigation element. Applications using ngx-admin and relying on this Nebular component become immediately vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical XSS attacks, DOM-based exploits, potential for full application compromise depending on the nature of the Nebular vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Nebular Updates:**  Prioritize and immediately apply updates to the Nebular UI framework, especially security patches.
        *   **Nebular Security Monitoring (Critical):**  Actively monitor Nebular's security channels and advisories for critical vulnerability announcements. Have a process in place to react swiftly to Nebular security issues.
        *   **Temporary Workarounds (If Necessary):** In case of a critical Nebular vulnerability without an immediate patch, consider temporary workarounds or disabling vulnerable Nebular components if feasible, until an official fix is available.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Customizations and Extensions Introducing Critical Flaws](./attack_surfaces/insecure_customizations_and_extensions_introducing_critical_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Custom components or modules developed to extend ngx-admin that introduce critical security vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.
    *   **ngx-admin Contribution:** ngx-admin is designed for customization. Poorly secured custom code, while not part of ngx-admin itself, is a direct consequence of extending the framework and becomes a critical attack surface of the final application.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication module built for ngx-admin has a critical flaw allowing for authentication bypass. Or, a custom data visualization component introduces a severe SQL injection vulnerability in backend API calls.
    *   **Impact:**  Authentication bypass, full data breaches, remote code execution on backend systems, complete compromise of application and potentially related infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Security Code Reviews (Customizations):** Implement mandatory and rigorous security code reviews for all custom components and extensions developed for ngx-admin.
        *   **Penetration Testing (Custom Features):**  Specifically target penetration testing efforts on custom features and extensions to identify critical vulnerabilities introduced during development.
        *   **Security Training for Developers:** Ensure developers working on ngx-admin customizations receive adequate security training, particularly in secure Angular development practices and common web application vulnerabilities.
