# Threat Model Analysis for akveo/ngx-admin

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation in Core ngx-admin Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation_in_core_ngx-admin_dependencies.md)

**Description:**  A critical vulnerability is discovered and exploited in a core dependency of ngx-admin, such as Angular or Nebular UI.  Attackers leverage publicly available exploits targeting these vulnerabilities. Due to ngx-admin's reliance on these specific versions of dependencies, applications built with ngx-admin become vulnerable. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or client-side, allowing full system compromise or complete control over the user's browser session.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Full application compromise, complete data breach, widespread service disruption, unauthorized administrative access, and severe reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `node_modules` (specifically vulnerable Angular, Nebular, or other core libraries as used by ngx-admin), `package.json`, `package-lock.json`.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Immediately update Angular, Nebular, and all other core dependencies to patched versions as soon as security advisories are released.
*   Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning and patching processes.
*   Proactively monitor security mailing lists and advisories for Angular, Nebular, and ngx-admin related projects.
*   In case of zero-day vulnerabilities, consider temporary mitigations like disabling vulnerable features or applying web application firewall (WAF) rules until patches are available.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom ngx-admin Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_custom_ngx-admin_components.md)

**Description:**  ngx-admin's custom UI components (beyond standard Nebular components) contain vulnerabilities that allow for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Attackers craft malicious input that, when processed or displayed by these ngx-admin specific components, injects and executes arbitrary JavaScript code in users' browsers. This could be through vulnerable form fields, dashboard widgets, or data visualization elements unique to ngx-admin. Exploitation can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, and redirection to malicious websites.

**Impact:** **High**. User account compromise, theft of sensitive user data, website defacement, malware distribution impacting users of the application.

**Affected Component:** Custom ngx-admin components located within `src/app/pages`, `src/app/components`, and potentially custom modules extending ngx-admin's functionality. Components handling user input or displaying dynamic data are particularly at risk.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Conduct rigorous security code reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting custom ngx-admin components.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user inputs processed by these components, both on the client and server-side.
*   Enforce proper output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) when rendering dynamic content within ngx-admin components to prevent script injection.
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is permitted to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Development Configurations Exposed in Production](./threats/insecure_default_development_configurations_exposed_in_production.md)

**Description:** Developers unknowingly deploy an ngx-admin application to production environments with insecure default configurations intended only for development. This includes leaving debugging endpoints enabled, using default or weak API keys (if provided as examples in ngx-admin), or failing to disable development-specific features. Attackers can discover and exploit these exposed configurations to gain unauthorized administrative access, bypass authentication, or access sensitive internal application details and data.

**Impact:** **High to Critical**. Unauthorized administrative access, bypass of authentication mechanisms, exposure of sensitive configuration details and internal application logic, potential data breaches, and service disruption. Severity depends on the level of access granted by the insecure defaults.

**Affected Component:** Application configuration files (e.g., environment files, configuration modules), example code and configurations within the ngx-admin project structure that are not properly hardened for production.

**Risk Severity:** **High to Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Establish a strict hardening process for all configurations before deploying ngx-admin applications to production.
*   Thoroughly review and disable or remove all development-specific features, debugging tools, and example configurations in production builds.
*   Implement secure configuration management practices, utilizing environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive settings, and avoid hardcoding secrets.
*   Automate security checks to detect and flag insecure default configurations before deployment.
