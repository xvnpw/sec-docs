## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application Using ngx-admin [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_using_ngx-admin__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access, control, or disruption of the application.
*   Compromise can manifest in various forms, including data breaches, defacement, denial of service, or complete takeover of the application and its underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ngx-admin Specific Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ngx-admin_specific_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

*   This node represents the attacker's strategy to focus on vulnerabilities that are specifically related to the ngx-admin framework or how it is used.
*   It directs the attacker away from generic web application vulnerabilities and towards weaknesses introduced by or inherent in ngx-admin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities in ngx-admin Components [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_frontend_vulnerabilities_in_ngx-admin_components__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This path highlights the risk associated with vulnerabilities in the frontend components provided by ngx-admin (and Nebular).
*   Frontend vulnerabilities, particularly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), are a significant concern due to their potential for high impact and relative ease of exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in ngx-admin Components [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **DOM-based XSS in ngx-admin Components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts through user-controlled input that is processed and rendered by vulnerable ngx-admin components (e.g., tables, forms, charts).
            *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or redirection.
        *   **Reflected/Stored XSS due to insecure handling of data within ngx-admin components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Reflected XSS via manipulating URL parameters processed by ngx-admin routing or components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious URLs that, when processed by ngx-admin routing or components, reflect malicious scripts back to the user's browser.
                *   **Impact:**  Execution of malicious JavaScript, similar to DOM-based XSS, but often triggered by user interaction with a malicious link.
            *   **Stored XSS by injecting malicious data into backend and displayed by ngx-admin components without proper sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into the backend database through application inputs. When this data is retrieved and displayed by ngx-admin components without proper sanitization, the script executes in the browsers of users viewing the data.
                *   **Impact:** Persistent compromise affecting multiple users who view the malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in ngx-admin Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_ngx-admin_dependencies__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   This path focuses on the risks arising from vulnerabilities in the npm packages that ngx-admin relies upon.
*   The npm ecosystem is vast and constantly evolving, and dependencies can contain known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Vulnerable npm Packages [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated or vulnerable npm packages used by ngx-admin [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Identifying and exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in outdated or vulnerable npm packages included in the ngx-admin project's dependencies.
            *   **Steps:**
                *   **Identify vulnerable npm packages using tools like `npm audit` or vulnerability databases [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Using tools to scan the project's `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to identify dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
                *   **Exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in identified packages (e.g., Prototype Pollution, arbitrary code execution) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Leveraging existing exploits or developing new ones to target the identified vulnerabilities in the vulnerable npm packages.
            *   **Impact:**  Impact can range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the specific vulnerability and the compromised package. RCE can lead to full application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting ngx-admin Users/Developers [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_ngx-admin_usersdevelopers__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path highlights the risk of attackers using social engineering tactics to target individuals associated with ngx-admin applications, particularly developers and administrators.
*   Human error and trust can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or information.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Phishing or Credential Harvesting [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Target developers or administrators of ngx-admin based applications [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Phishing attacks to steal developer credentials and gain access to development/production environments [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Sending deceptive emails, messages, or creating fake login pages to trick developers or administrators into revealing their usernames and passwords for development or production systems.
                *   **Impact:**  Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive environments, potentially leading to code modification, data breaches, or system compromise.
            *   **Social engineering to trick developers into revealing sensitive information or installing malicious packages/tools [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating developers through social interaction (e.g., impersonation, pretexting) to reveal sensitive information like API keys, internal configurations, or to trick them into installing malicious software or packages that could compromise their systems or the application build process.
                *   **Impact:**  Disclosure of sensitive information, introduction of malware into development environments, or compromise of the application through malicious tools.
