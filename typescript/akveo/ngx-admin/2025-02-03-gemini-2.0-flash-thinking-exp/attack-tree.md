## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application Using ngx-admin [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_using_ngx-admin__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing disruption to the application.
*   **Why Critical:** Represents the highest level goal in the attack tree. All successful attack paths lead to this node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ngx-admin Specific Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ngx-admin_specific_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities that are directly related to the ngx-admin framework or how it's used.
*   **Why Critical:**  This is the root node for all ngx-admin specific attack vectors, branching out to the most probable and impactful threats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Frontend Vulnerabilities in ngx-admin Components [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_frontend_vulnerabilities_in_ngx-admin_components__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Targeting vulnerabilities within the frontend components provided by ngx-admin (and Nebular). Primarily focuses on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Why High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Common web vulnerability, especially if developers don't handle user input carefully in components).
    *   **Impact:** High (Account compromise, data theft, defacement, redirection).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Tools and techniques for XSS are readily available).
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Basic understanding of XSS and web development).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be subtle, requires careful input/output analysis).
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in ngx-admin Components [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **DOM-based XSS in ngx-admin Components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious script via user-controlled input rendered by vulnerable ngx-admin component (e.g., tables, forms, charts).
        *   **Reflected/Stored XSS due to insecure handling of data within ngx-admin components [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Reflected XSS via manipulating URL parameters processed by ngx-admin routing or components.
            *   **Attack Vector:** Stored XSS by injecting malicious data into backend and displayed by ngx-admin components without proper sanitization.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize all user inputs before rendering them in ngx-admin components.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Encode output based on the context (HTML, JavaScript, URL).
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Focus on areas where user input is displayed through ngx-admin components.
    *   **Component Updates:** Keep ngx-admin and Nebular updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in ngx-admin Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_ngx-admin_dependencies__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the npm packages that ngx-admin relies upon.
*   **Why High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (npm ecosystem has vulnerabilities, depends on dependency management).
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (DoS, RCE, depending on the vulnerable package).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Tools like `npm audit` make identification easy).
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Using vulnerability databases, potentially adapting public exploits).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Vulnerability scanners and dependency checks can detect known issues).
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Vulnerable npm Packages [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated or vulnerable npm packages used by ngx-admin [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Identify vulnerable npm packages using tools like `npm audit` or vulnerability databases.
            *   **Attack Vector:** Exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in identified packages (e.g., Prototype Pollution, arbitrary code execution).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly use `npm audit` or similar tools.
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep npm dependencies updated.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Consider using SCA tools for continuous monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting ngx-admin Users/Developers [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_ngx-admin_usersdevelopers__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  Using social engineering tactics to target developers or administrators associated with ngx-admin applications.
*   **Why High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Phishing is common, developers are targets).
    *   **Impact:** High (Access to development/production environments, code and data compromise).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Phishing campaigns can be relatively easy to launch).
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Social engineering and basic phishing techniques).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (User awareness training and email security can help, but still challenging).
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Phishing or Credential Harvesting [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Target developers or administrators of ngx-admin based applications [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Phishing attacks to steal developer credentials and gain access to development/production environments.
            *   **Attack Vector:** Social engineering to trick developers into revealing sensitive information or installing malicious packages/tools.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and administrators about phishing and social engineering.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for developer and administrator accounts.
    *   **Phishing Simulations:** Conduct simulations to test awareness.
