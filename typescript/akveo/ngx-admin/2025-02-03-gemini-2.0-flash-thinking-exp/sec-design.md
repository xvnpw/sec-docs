# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a reusable, customizable, and feature-rich Angular admin dashboard template.
  - Accelerate the development of admin panels and back-office interfaces for web applications.
  - Offer a visually appealing and user-friendly interface to manage application data and configurations.
  - Reduce development costs and time-to-market for projects requiring admin dashboards.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities within the ngx-admin template could be inherited by applications built upon it, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
  - Lack of proper customization and security hardening by developers using the template could result in insecure deployments.
  - Over-reliance on the template without understanding its underlying code and security implications can create blind spots in application security.
  - Potential for supply chain attacks if dependencies of ngx-admin are compromised.
  - If used in critical infrastructure or applications handling sensitive data, vulnerabilities could have significant business impact, including financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory fines.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Angular Framework Security - ngx-admin is built using Angular, which provides built-in security features such as protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Implemented within the Angular framework itself.
  - security control: Dependency Management - npm is used for managing project dependencies. Described in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
  - security control: Code Linting -  Likely uses linters (e.g., ESLint, TSLint - deprecated) for code quality and basic static analysis. Configuration files like `.eslintrc.js` might be present.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Components - Using a publicly available template inherently involves trusting the security of the template and its dependencies, which are maintained by external parties.
  - accepted risk: Developer Misconfiguration - Developers using the template might not fully understand or correctly implement security best practices when customizing and deploying applications based on ngx-admin.
  - accepted risk: Outdated Dependencies - Dependencies might become outdated over time, potentially introducing known vulnerabilities if not regularly updated.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Security Audits - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of ngx-admin template to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in npm packages used by ngx-admin.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically analyze the codebase for security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Utilize SCA tools to gain visibility into all open source components and their licenses, and identify security risks associated with them.
  - security control: Secure Development Guidelines - Provide clear and comprehensive security guidelines and best practices for developers using ngx-admin to build secure applications.
  - security control: Security Training - Offer security training to developers on secure coding practices, common web application vulnerabilities, and secure usage of ngx-admin.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: ngx-admin itself does not handle authentication, but it should be designed to easily integrate with various authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JWT).
    - Requirement: Applications built with ngx-admin must implement robust authentication to verify the identity of users accessing the admin panel.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: ngx-admin should support role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and restrict access to specific features and data within the admin panel.
    - Requirement: Applications must implement authorization logic to ensure that authenticated users only have access to the resources and actions they are permitted to perform.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: ngx-admin should implement basic client-side input validation to prevent common input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Applications must perform comprehensive server-side input validation to sanitize and validate all user inputs before processing them.
    - Requirement: Protection against common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS) must be implemented in applications using ngx-admin.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: ngx-admin itself might not directly handle sensitive data, but applications using it will likely need to implement cryptography for data protection.
    - Requirement: Applications should use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.
    - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest should be encrypted using appropriate encryption algorithms and key management practices within the applications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure access and management of application data and configurations through the admin dashboard.
  - Maintaining the availability and integrity of the admin panel to ensure continuous application management.
  - Protecting sensitive data displayed and managed within the admin dashboard from unauthorized access and modification.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data sensitivity depends on the applications built using ngx-admin. It can range from low to high sensitivity.
  - Examples of potentially sensitive data:
    - User credentials and personal information.
    - Financial transactions and data.
    - Business-critical configurations and settings.
    - Application logs and audit trails.
  - Sensitivity level should be determined based on the specific application context and data types managed through the admin panel. Applications handling PII, PHI, or financial data will have high data sensitivity.
