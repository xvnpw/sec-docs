# Threat Model Analysis for akveo/ngx-admin

## Threat: [Outdated npm Dependency Vulnerability](./threats/outdated_npm_dependency_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** ngx-admin relies on numerous npm packages. If these dependencies are not regularly updated, attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these outdated libraries. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by targeting vulnerabilities within ngx-admin's dependency tree.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access, website defacement, or complete system compromise depending on the exploited vulnerability.
    *   **Affected ngx-admin Component:**  `package.json`, `node_modules`, and all modules and components that depend on vulnerable libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update npm dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
        *   Utilize `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and automatically fix known vulnerabilities.
        *   Integrate automated dependency scanning into CI/CD pipelines to proactively detect vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for npm packages used by ngx-admin and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Default Secret Key Exposure](./threats/default_secret_key_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** ngx-admin examples and default configurations might include placeholder or example secret keys, API keys, or other credentials. Developers might mistakenly deploy applications to production without replacing these default secrets. Attackers can discover these publicly known default keys and use them to gain unauthorized access to the application or its backend services.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to application functionalities, data breaches, account takeover, and potential compromise of backend systems due to exposed credentials.
    *   **Affected ngx-admin Component:**  Configuration files within ngx-admin (e.g., environment files, configuration modules), example code provided in the ngx-admin repository.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never use default or example secret keys in production environments.
        *   Employ environment variables or secure configuration management systems to store and manage sensitive secrets.
        *   Implement a process for regularly reviewing and rotating secret keys to minimize the impact of potential compromises.
        *   Thoroughly review and remove or securely configure any example code or configurations before deploying the application.

## Threat: [XSS Vulnerabilities in ngx-admin Components or Templates](./threats/xss_vulnerabilities_in_ngx-admin_components_or_templates.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist within the Angular components or templates provided by ngx-admin itself. If these components are susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), attackers can inject malicious scripts. This could occur if ngx-admin components do not properly handle or sanitize user-provided data when rendering it within the UI. Exploiting these vulnerabilities allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:**  Account hijacking, session theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious websites, and theft of sensitive user information.
    *   **Affected ngx-admin Component:**  Core ngx-admin components, UI components, templates, and any modules that handle user input or display dynamic content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure ngx-admin is updated to the latest version, as updates often include security patches.
        *   Thoroughly review and test ngx-admin components for potential XSS vulnerabilities, especially when handling user input.
        *   Utilize Angular's built-in security features and template sanitization mechanisms.
        *   Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if they exist in ngx-admin components.

## Threat: [Client-Side Logic Vulnerability in Complex ngx-admin Components](./threats/client-side_logic_vulnerability_in_complex_ngx-admin_components.md)

*   **Description:** Complex UI components provided by ngx-admin, such as advanced charts, data tables with intricate filtering/sorting, or complex forms, might contain vulnerabilities in their client-side logic. Attackers could craft specific inputs or interactions to exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) by overloading the client-side, unexpected application behavior, or in certain scenarios, client-side code execution if vulnerabilities allow for it.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (DoS) on the client-side, leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes for users. In more severe cases, potential for unexpected application behavior or limited client-side code execution.
    *   **Affected ngx-admin Component:**  Complex UI components like charts, data tables, advanced forms, and any component with significant client-side data processing or interaction logic provided by ngx-admin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (in DoS scenario, potentially lower if impact is limited to unexpected behavior)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test complex ngx-admin components with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and large datasets, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization even within client-side logic to prevent unexpected behavior or DoS conditions.
        *   Conduct performance testing to ensure complex components can handle expected loads without becoming vulnerable to DoS.
        *   Report any identified vulnerabilities in ngx-admin components to the maintainers for patching.

## Threat: [Insecure Example Authentication/Authorization Implementation in ngx-admin Examples](./threats/insecure_example_authenticationauthorization_implementation_in_ngx-admin_examples.md)

*   **Description:** ngx-admin example applications or documentation might provide simplified or insecure example implementations of authentication and authorization. Developers who directly copy and paste or heavily rely on these examples without proper security hardening can introduce significant vulnerabilities into their applications. Attackers can exploit weaknesses in these example implementations to bypass authentication or authorization controls and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to admin functionalities, data breaches, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of the entire application due to weak or bypassed authentication/authorization.
    *   **Affected ngx-admin Component:**  Example authentication modules, example authorization guards, and any example code related to security provided within ngx-admin demos or documentation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never use example authentication/authorization code from ngx-admin directly in production without a comprehensive security review and significant hardening.
        *   Implement robust and secure authentication and authorization mechanisms tailored to the specific security requirements of the application, following industry best practices.
        *   Consult security experts to design and implement secure authentication and authorization, rather than relying on simplified examples.
        *   Conduct thorough security testing and penetration testing of authentication and authorization implementations to identify and remediate any weaknesses.
