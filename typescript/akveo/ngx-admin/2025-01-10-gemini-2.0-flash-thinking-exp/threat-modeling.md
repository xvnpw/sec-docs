# Threat Model Analysis for akveo/ngx-admin

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities present in the third-party npm packages that ngx-admin relies on. This could involve compromising the application through vulnerable client-side libraries. An attacker might inject malicious scripts or execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data breaches, or complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.
    * **Affected Component:** `package.json` and `node_modules` (Dependency Management)
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update ngx-admin and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        * Implement dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Yarn audit, Snyk) in the development and CI/CD pipelines.
        * Review security advisories for known vulnerabilities in the used dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration and Customization](./threats/insecure_configuration_and_customization.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Configuration and Customization
    * **Description:** Developers might introduce security vulnerabilities by misconfiguring ngx-admin settings or by implementing insecure custom features within the framework's structure. This could involve disabling security features or writing custom code with flaws within the ngx-admin environment. An attacker might leverage these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or manipulate the application's behavior.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to administrative functionalities, privilege escalation, or manipulation of application data.
    * **Affected Component:** Configuration files (e.g., Angular environment files), custom modules and components developed within the ngx-admin structure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow secure coding practices when customizing ngx-admin.
        * Thoroughly review configuration settings and avoid unnecessary modifications that could weaken security.
        * Implement code review processes for all custom code within ngx-admin.

## Threat: [Client-Side Vulnerabilities in ngx-admin UI Components](./threats/client-side_vulnerabilities_in_ngx-admin_ui_components.md)

* **Threat:** Client-Side Vulnerabilities in ngx-admin UI Components
    * **Description:** ngx-admin's pre-built UI components (e.g., forms, tables, charts) might contain inherent client-side vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or DOM-based vulnerabilities. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through input fields or other vectors, exploiting these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in a user's browser.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement of the application, or redirection to malicious websites.
    * **Affected Component:**  ngx-admin's UI modules (e.g., forms module, UI features module), specific components like input fields, data tables, and chart libraries.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep ngx-admin updated to benefit from security patches.
        * Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding on the server-side as a defense-in-depth measure.
        * Utilize Angular's built-in security features to prevent XSS.

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass within ngx-admin Features](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_within_ngx-admin_features.md)

* **Threat:** Authentication and Authorization Bypass within ngx-admin Features
    * **Description:** If ngx-admin provides specific authentication or authorization mechanisms beyond basic UI elements, vulnerabilities in these mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass authentication checks or elevate their privileges. An attacker could gain unauthorized access to restricted parts of the application or perform actions they are not permitted to.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of the entire application.
    * **Affected Component:**  Potentially authentication modules or services provided by ngx-admin (if any), route guards within the ngx-admin structure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and test any authentication or authorization features provided by ngx-admin.
        * Prefer using well-established and secure authentication and authorization libraries implemented independently of the template's basic features.
        * Implement robust server-side validation for all authentication and authorization checks.

## Threat: [Default Credentials and Configurations](./threats/default_credentials_and_configurations.md)

* **Threat:** Default Credentials and Configurations
    * **Description:** ngx-admin might include default credentials or insecure default configurations that are not changed during the application deployment. An attacker could exploit these default settings to gain initial access to administrative panels or sensitive functionalities provided by ngx-admin.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative interfaces, potentially leading to full control over the application and its data.
    * **Affected Component:**  Configuration files, potentially seed data or initial user setup scripts within the ngx-admin structure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Immediately change any default credentials provided by ngx-admin.
        * Review all default configurations and ensure they are securely configured for production environments.

## Threat: [Code Vulnerabilities within ngx-admin Core Logic](./threats/code_vulnerabilities_within_ngx-admin_core_logic.md)

* **Threat:** Code Vulnerabilities within ngx-admin Core Logic
    * **Description:** Bugs or security flaws might exist within the core codebase of ngx-admin itself. An attacker could discover and exploit these vulnerabilities to perform various malicious actions.
    * **Impact:**  Unpredictable, ranging from minor disruptions to complete application compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Affected Component:**  Core modules and services within the ngx-admin framework itself.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay updated with the latest versions of ngx-admin, as security patches are often released.
        * Monitor security advisories and community discussions related to ngx-admin.

## Threat: [Outdated ngx-admin Version](./threats/outdated_ngx-admin_version.md)

* **Threat:** Outdated ngx-admin Version
    * **Description:** Using an outdated version of ngx-admin exposes the application to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers can easily target applications running older versions of the framework with publicly known exploits.
    * **Impact:**  The application becomes vulnerable to all the security flaws that have been addressed in subsequent versions of ngx-admin.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire ngx-admin framework integrated into the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Maintain ngx-admin at the latest stable version.
        * Regularly review release notes and security advisories for ngx-admin.
        * Establish a process for promptly updating the framework.
