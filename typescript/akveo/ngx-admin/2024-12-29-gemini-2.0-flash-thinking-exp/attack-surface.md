**Key Attack Surface List (High & Critical, Directly Involving ngx-admin):**

*   **Attack Surface:** Improper Use of ngx-admin UI Components Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How ngx-admin Contributes:** Ngx-admin provides various UI components (e.g., input fields, data tables, rich text editors) that can render user-supplied data. If developers don't sanitize this data before rendering it using these components, XSS vulnerabilities can be introduced.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a form field that is then displayed in a data table rendered by an ngx-admin component without proper escaping.
    *   **Impact:**  Session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Always sanitize user input before rendering it in ngx-admin components. Utilize Angular's built-in security features like the `DomSanitizer` and avoid bypassing security contexts. Follow secure coding practices for handling user-generated content.

*   **Attack Surface:** Client-Side Authorization Bypass via UI Manipulation
    *   **Description:** Attackers bypass frontend authorization checks to access restricted features or data.
    *   **How ngx-admin Contributes:** Ngx-admin's routing and component visibility can be used for frontend authorization. If the backend doesn't enforce authorization independently, attackers can manipulate the browser's developer tools or craft requests to access components or routes they shouldn't.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the browser's local storage or session storage to change user roles or navigates directly to a restricted route by manipulating the URL, bypassing the ngx-admin's frontend route guards.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical settings, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authorization checks on the backend. Frontend authorization in ngx-admin should be considered a UI convenience, not a security measure. Always verify user permissions on the server-side before granting access to resources or performing actions.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in ngx-admin's Third-Party Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Security flaws exist in the npm packages that ngx-admin relies on.
    *   **How ngx-admin Contributes:** Ngx-admin has a significant number of dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a charting library used by ngx-admin allows for remote code execution if specific data is provided.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and other security compromises depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update ngx-admin and all its dependencies to the latest versions. Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities. Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
