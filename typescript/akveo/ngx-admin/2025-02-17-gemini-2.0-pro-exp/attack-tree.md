## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Vulnerable Nebular Components (e.g., outdated versions) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_vulnerable_nebular_components__e_g___outdated_versions___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the risk of using Nebular components with known vulnerabilities. Nebular is the UI component library used by ngx-admin. If the application uses an outdated version of Nebular, attackers can potentially exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs).
    *   **1.1.2.1 Exploit known CVEs in specific Nebular components (e.g., NbDatepicker, NbDialog, etc.) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Action:** The attacker leverages published exploits (e.g., from Exploit-DB, security advisories) targeting specific vulnerabilities in outdated Nebular components.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if outdated) / Low (if updated)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (depending on the specific CVE exploited)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low to Medium (depending on the availability and complexity of the exploit)
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (depending on the sophistication of the exploit and the presence of logging and intrusion detection systems)
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Nebular and all related dependencies updated to the latest versions. Use automated dependency scanning tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Improper Use of ngx-admin Features](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_improper_use_of_ngx-admin_features.md)

    *   **1.1.3.1 Misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACL) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Action:** The attacker exploits overly permissive or incorrectly configured ACL rules within ngx-admin to gain access to pages, features, or data they should not have access to.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (potential for complete administrative access)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with proper auditing and access logs)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly configure ACLs following the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and audit ACL configurations. Implement robust access logging and monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_dependency-related_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the risk of vulnerabilities within the dependencies of ngx-admin, including Angular itself and any third-party libraries used.
    *   **1.2.1 Outdated Angular Version [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Action:** The attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Angular used by the ngx-admin project.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if outdated) / Low (if updated)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (depending on the specific CVE)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low to Medium (depending on exploit availability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Angular updated to the latest stable version. Use automated dependency scanning.
    *   **1.2.2 Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries (within ngx-admin's dependencies) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Action:** The attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries included as dependencies of ngx-admin (e.g., charting libraries, utility libraries).
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if outdated) / Low (if updated)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (depending on the specific CVE)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low to Medium (depending on exploit availability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep all third-party libraries updated. Use automated dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Backend Integration Vulnerabilities (if ngx-admin features are used for backend communication)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_backend_integration_vulnerabilities__if_ngx-admin_features_are_used_for_backend_communica_ac95f488.md)

    *   **2.1 Improper API Security Configuration (using ngx-admin's provided services) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** This node represents vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration of the backend API, particularly if ngx-admin's built-in services are used for communication.
        *   **2.1.1 Weak Authentication/Authorization on API Endpoints [HIGH RISK]**
            *   **Action:** The attacker bypasses authentication or accesses API endpoints with insufficient authorization due to misconfiguration of ngx-admin's API interaction services or flaws in the backend API itself.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High (potential for data breaches, unauthorized actions)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with proper API monitoring and logging)
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0) and authorization mechanisms on all API endpoints.  Enforce the principle of least privilege.  Regularly review and test API security.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Social Engineering / Phishing (Targeting ngx-admin Users/Admins)](./attack_tree_paths/3__social_engineering__phishing__targeting_ngx-admin_usersadmins_.md)

    *   **3.1 Credential Theft [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Action:** The attacker tricks users (especially administrators) into revealing their ngx-admin credentials through phishing emails, fake login pages, or other social engineering techniques.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (potential for complete system compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (with user awareness training, email filtering, and multi-factor authentication)
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).  Conduct regular security awareness training for users, focusing on phishing and social engineering.  Use email filtering and anti-phishing tools.
