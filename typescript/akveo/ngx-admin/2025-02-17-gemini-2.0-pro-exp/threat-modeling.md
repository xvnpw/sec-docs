# Threat Model Analysis for akveo/ngx-admin

## Threat: [Malicious Package Substitution (Dependency Hijacking)](./threats/malicious_package_substitution__dependency_hijacking_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a legitimate npm package that `ngx-admin` *directly* depends on (not just a transitive dependency, but a package listed in `ngx-admin`'s `package.json`). The attacker publishes a malicious version. When developers update `ngx-admin` or its direct dependencies, the malicious code is pulled in.  This injected code could target `ngx-admin` components specifically, altering their behavior to steal data, bypass security controls, or redirect users.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application compromise. Data breaches, user account takeovers, complete loss of control over the application's frontend, potential for backend compromise through the compromised frontend.
    *   **ngx-admin Component Affected:** Potentially *any* `ngx-admin` component, as the malicious code could be injected into any part of the framework itself. This is a fundamental threat to the integrity of the entire `ngx-admin` framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Dependency Pinning (ngx-admin itself):** Pin the version of `ngx-admin` itself to a specific, thoroughly vetted version. Do *not* use version ranges that allow automatic updates. This requires a very rigorous process for evaluating new `ngx-admin` releases.
        *   **Strict Dependency Pinning (ngx-admin's dependencies):** Pin *all* of `ngx-admin`'s *direct* dependencies to specific, vetted versions. This is crucial and requires careful management.
        *   **Regular Dependency Audits (Focus on ngx-admin):** Run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` specifically targeting `ngx-admin` and its direct dependencies *very* frequently (ideally on every build and before any dependency updates).
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use an SCA tool to continuously monitor `ngx-admin` and its direct dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Private npm Registry (Highest Security):** For extremely high-security applications, host a private npm registry containing only vetted versions of `ngx-admin` and its dependencies. This provides the strongest defense against supply chain attacks.
        *   **Source Code Review (ngx-admin updates):** Before updating `ngx-admin`, *carefully* review the changes in the `ngx-admin` repository (on GitHub) for any suspicious code or unusual commits. This is a manual, time-consuming process, but it's essential for high-security environments.
        * **Forking and Maintaining a Private Version (Extreme Measure):** In very specific, high-security scenarios, consider forking the `ngx-admin` repository and maintaining your own private, vetted version. This gives you complete control but requires significant ongoing effort.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via `NbAuthModule` Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_via__nbauthmodule__vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A *direct* vulnerability exists within the `NbAuthModule` code itself (not just a misconfiguration, but a flaw in the `ngx-admin` code). This could be a logic error in token validation, a bypass of authentication checks, or a vulnerability in how the module handles user sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access without needing to guess credentials or exploit misconfigurations.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, potential for privilege escalation, data breaches, impersonation of legitimate users. The severity depends on the specific vulnerability, but a direct flaw in the authentication module is inherently high-risk.
    *   **ngx-admin Component Affected:** `NbAuthModule`, `NbAuthService`, `NbTokenService`, and related core authentication components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Update to Patched Version:** If a vulnerability is discovered and patched by the `ngx-admin` maintainers, update to the patched version *immediately*. This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and release notes for `ngx-admin` to be aware of any reported vulnerabilities.
        *   **Contribute to Security Audits (Community Effort):** If possible, contribute to security audits of the `ngx-admin` codebase (or encourage the community to do so) to help identify and fix vulnerabilities proactively.
        *   **Temporary Workarounds (If No Patch Available):** If a vulnerability is discovered and no patch is immediately available, consider implementing temporary workarounds (e.g., disabling affected features, adding extra validation checks). *This is a last resort and should be done with extreme caution.*
        * **Custom Authentication Module (High Effort):** As an extreme measure, consider developing a custom authentication module *from scratch*, replacing `NbAuthModule` entirely. This is a very significant undertaking and should only be considered if the risk is deemed unacceptable and no other mitigations are sufficient.

## Threat: [Data Exposure via Vulnerability in `NbListComponent` or `NbTreeGridComponent`](./threats/data_exposure_via_vulnerability_in__nblistcomponent__or__nbtreegridcomponent_.md)

*   **Description:** A *direct* vulnerability exists within the `NbListComponent` or `NbTreeGridComponent` code itself (not a misconfiguration, but a flaw in how these components handle or display data). This could be a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass intended data filtering or access control mechanisms, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, violation of privacy, potential regulatory non-compliance. The severity depends on the sensitivity of the data exposed.
    *   **ngx-admin Component Affected:** `NbListComponent`, `NbTreeGridComponent`, and potentially other data-displaying components within `ngx-admin`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Update to Patched Version:** If a vulnerability is discovered and patched, update to the patched version of `ngx-admin` *immediately*.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and release notes for `ngx-admin`.
        *   **Temporary Workarounds (If No Patch Available):** If a vulnerability is discovered and no patch is immediately available, consider implementing temporary workarounds. This might involve disabling the affected component, restricting its use, or adding extra client-side data filtering (though this is *not* a reliable security measure on its own).
        * **Backend Data Protection is Paramount:** Remember that the *primary* defense against data exposure is robust authorization and data filtering on the *backend*. Even if a frontend component has a vulnerability, the backend should prevent unauthorized data access.
