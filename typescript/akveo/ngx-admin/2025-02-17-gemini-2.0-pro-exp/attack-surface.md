# Attack Surface Analysis for akveo/ngx-admin

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass/Privilege Escalation via Nebular Auth Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypassprivilege_escalation_via_nebular_auth_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigured authentication flows or weak security settings within Nebular Auth to gain unauthorized access or elevated privileges.
*   **ngx-admin Contribution:** Nebular Auth, *part of ngx-admin*, provides the authentication framework. Its flexibility and numerous options increase the potential for misconfigurations if not carefully implemented.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a poorly configured social login provider (e.g., missing redirect URI validation) within Nebular Auth to impersonate a legitimate user or gain administrator access. Weak password reset token generation allows token guessing.
*   **Impact:** Complete account takeover, data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test *all* Nebular Auth configurations (social logins, custom backends, password resets).
        *   Use strong, randomly generated secrets for all integrations.
        *   Enforce strict validation of redirect URIs after authentication.
        *   Implement strong password policies and secure password reset mechanisms (time-limited, cryptographically secure tokens).
        *   Follow OWASP authentication and session management guidelines.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Token Hijacking (XSS or Storage Issues with Nebular Auth)](./attack_surfaces/token_hijacking__xss_or_storage_issues_with_nebular_auth_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers steal authentication tokens managed by Nebular Auth, allowing them to impersonate users.
*   **ngx-admin Contribution:** Nebular Auth handles token management.  The default storage (often local storage) can be vulnerable to XSS *if other vulnerabilities exist*, making token theft possible.  The framework's handling of tokens is the direct contributor.
*   **Example:** An XSS vulnerability (even if introduced elsewhere) allows an attacker to read the Nebular Auth token from local storage.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data breaches, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Strongly consider using HTTP-only, secure cookies for Nebular Auth token storage if appropriate. This mitigates XSS-based token theft.
        *   Implement robust token expiration and revocation within Nebular Auth. Invalidate tokens server-side on logout, password change, or suspicious activity.
        *   Use short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens with appropriate security controls (e.g., refresh token rotation) as supported by Nebular Auth.
        *   Sanitize all user input to prevent XSS that could lead to token theft.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access via RBAC Misconfiguration (Nebular Security)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_via_rbac_misconfiguration__nebular_security_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit incorrectly configured roles and permissions within Nebular Security's ACL system.
*   **ngx-admin Contribution:** Nebular Security, *part of ngx-admin*, provides the RBAC framework. Its effectiveness depends entirely on the developer's configuration within the ngx-admin context.
*   **Example:** A user with a "viewer" role accesses an API endpoint intended for "editors" due to a missing permission check in the Nebular Security ACL configuration.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement a least-privilege approach within Nebular Security.
        *   Carefully define roles and permissions, ensuring granularity.
        *   Thoroughly test *all* Nebular Security access control rules (including edge cases and negative testing).
        *   Regularly audit roles and permissions.
        *   Ensure "fail-close" behavior for permission checks.
        *   Use a consistent naming convention for roles and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [XSS via Custom Components or Theme Modifications within ngx-admin](./attack_surfaces/xss_via_custom_components_or_theme_modifications_within_ngx-admin.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious scripts through vulnerabilities in custom components or theme modifications *built on top of ngx-admin*.
*   **ngx-admin Contribution:**  `ngx-admin`'s extensibility (custom components, theme modifications) creates the *opportunity* for developers to introduce XSS vulnerabilities if they don't follow secure coding practices *while using the framework*.  The framework provides the context for these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A custom component within an `ngx-admin` dashboard, displaying user comments without sanitization, allows `<script>` tag injection.
*   **Impact:** Cookie theft, session hijacking, defacement, phishing, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Strictly adhere to Angular's security guidelines for preventing XSS *when building within ngx-admin*.
        *   Use Angular's `DomSanitizer` for user-supplied data displayed in the UI.
        *   Avoid direct DOM manipulation; use Angular's features.
        *   Thoroughly review and test *all* custom components and theme modifications for XSS.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).
