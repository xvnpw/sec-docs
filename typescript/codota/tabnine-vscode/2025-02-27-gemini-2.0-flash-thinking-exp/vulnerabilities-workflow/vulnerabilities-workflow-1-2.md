* Vulnerability Name: Secret Exposure via GCS Bucket
* Description: The GitHub workflow `tmp.yml` uploads sensitive secrets (API keys, tokens, webhook URLs) to a Google Cloud Storage bucket named `tabnine`. If this bucket has insecure permissions (e.g., publicly readable), or if an attacker can intercept the upload process, these secrets can be exposed.
* Impact: Exposure of secrets could lead to unauthorized access to Tabnine's infrastructure, including the ability to publish malicious extension updates, access internal services, and send unauthorized notifications.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the provided code.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure GCS bucket permissions: Ensure the GCS bucket `tabnine` is NOT publicly readable. Access should be restricted to authorized CI/CD processes only.
    - Secret management: Secrets should be managed securely, ideally using a dedicated secret management system instead of directly uploading them to GCS.
    - Secure upload process: Ensure the upload to GCS is performed over HTTPS and is protected from interception.
* Preconditions:
    - Insecure GCS bucket permissions OR ability to intercept GCS upload.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/.github/workflows/tmp.yml`
    - Steps:
        1. Secrets are written to `vscode-vars` file using `echo ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} > vscode-vars`.
        2. Google Cloud authentication is performed using `secrets.GCS_RELEASE_KEY`.
        3. `vscode-vars` file is uploaded to GCS bucket `tabnine` using `google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v1` action with `destination: tabnine` and `content-type: text/plain`.
    - Vulnerability is in the upload step if GCS bucket permissions are misconfigured or upload is intercepted.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Identify the GCS bucket `tabnine` used in the workflow (this may require access to internal CI/CD configuration).
    2. Attempt to access the GCS bucket `tabnine` publicly.
    3. If access is granted, check if the file `vscode-vars` or similar files containing secrets are present and readable.
    4. If secrets are readable, the vulnerability is confirmed.

* Vulnerability Name: Open Redirect in Hub URLs
* Description: The extension constructs Hub URLs based on configurations fetched from the Tabnine binary. The `asExternal` function processes these URLs and remaps local URLs to external ones. However, if the base URL or query parameters containing URLs are not properly validated, an attacker could potentially craft a malicious Hub URL that, after being processed by `asExternalUri`, redirects users to an external, attacker-controlled website.
* Impact: An attacker could potentially use this open redirect to perform phishing attacks or other malicious activities by tricking users into visiting a legitimate-looking Tabnine Hub link that redirects them to a harmful website.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None in the provided code specifically for open redirect protection. The `asExternalUri` function provides some level of URL remapping for local addresses, but it doesn't prevent open redirects for externally-facing URLs.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - URL validation: Validate the base URL and any URL parameters fetched from the binary to ensure they are within an expected domain or a whitelist of safe domains.
    - Input sanitization: Sanitize or encode URL parameters to prevent injection of malicious URLs.
    - Origin checks: If redirection is necessary, implement origin checks to ensure the redirection target is a trusted domain.
* Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to influence the configuration returned by the Tabnine binary to inject a malicious URL. This could potentially be achieved if the binary's configuration source is compromised or through other means of manipulating the binary's behavior.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/utils/asExternal.ts`, `/code/src/hub/hubUri.ts`, `/code/src/hub/createHubWebView.ts`, `/code/src/webview/openGettingStartedWebview.ts`
    - Flow:
        1. `hubUri` fetches configuration from binary, including a base URL.
        2. `asExternal` is called with the base URL and optional path.
        3. `asExternal` parses the URL and processes `TABNINE_URL_QUERY_PARAM` and `TABNINE_RETURN_URL_QUERY_PARAM` using `asExternalUri`.
        4. `asExternalUri` remaps local URLs to external ones but doesn't fully validate external URLs.
        5. The resulting URL is used to load a webview in `createHubWebView` or `openGettingStartedWebview`.
    - Vulnerability lies in the lack of validation and sanitization of the base URL and URL parameters in `asExternal` and `asExternalUri`, which could allow an open redirect.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Modify the Tabnine binary's configuration (this might require internal access or specific testing setup) to return a malicious base URL for the Hub, e.g., `https://attacker.com/?redirect=`.
    2. Trigger the opening of the Tabnine Hub (e.g., via command palette or status bar).
    3. Observe if the webview redirects to `attacker.com` or a similar malicious domain, confirming the open redirect vulnerability.
