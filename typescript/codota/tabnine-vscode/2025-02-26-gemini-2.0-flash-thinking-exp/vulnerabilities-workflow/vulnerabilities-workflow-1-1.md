### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Proxy Configuration
- Description:
    1. The `getProxySettings` function in `/code/src/proxyProvider.ts` retrieves proxy settings from VS Code configuration (`http.proxy`) and environment variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `http_proxy`).
    2. The `getHttpsProxyAgent` function uses these settings to create an `HttpsProxyAgent` instance.
    3. An attacker can control the proxy settings by modifying VS Code configuration or environment variables if they have access to the user's machine or can influence the environment in which the extension runs (e.g., in a shared workspace or a cloud environment where environment variables can be manipulated).
    4. If an attacker sets the proxy to a malicious server under their control, the `HttpsProxyAgent` will direct network requests made by the Tabnine extension through this attacker-controlled proxy.
    5. This can lead to SSRF, where the Tabnine extension, acting as a proxy, can be made to access internal resources or interact with external systems as dictated by the attacker via proxy settings.
    6. For example, an attacker could set `http.proxy` to `http://malicious-proxy.com:8080` or to an internal server like `http://internal-server:80`. When Tabnine makes HTTP requests, the proxy mechanism will be used for outbound requests initiated from extension context, such as downloading the assistant binary in `/code/src/assistant/utils.ts` or fetching diagnostics in `/code/src/assistant/diagnostics.ts` and their request modules.
    7. The vulnerability is triggered when the Tabnine extension initiates an outbound network request and the proxy settings are in effect.

- Impact:
    - **High**: An attacker can potentially use the Tabnine extension as a proxy to:
        - Scan internal networks that are not directly accessible from the external internet.
        - Access internal services and resources behind a firewall.
        - Exfiltrate sensitive information by routing requests through their proxy and logging the traffic.
        - Potentially achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) if internal services vulnerable to exploitation are reachable and interactable via HTTP requests.
        - Launch further attacks originating from the victim's environment, making it harder to trace back to the original attacker.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly uses proxy settings without validation or sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize the proxy URL obtained from VS Code settings and environment variables to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious payloads. Consider using a whitelist of allowed proxy protocols and hostnames if feasible.
    - **Restrict Proxy Usage**: Evaluate if proxy support is essential for all functionalities of the extension. If not, limit proxy usage to only necessary operations and bypass proxy for sensitive internal communications.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**:  Ensure the extension operates with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact if SSRF is exploited. However, this is more of a general security principle and less of a direct mitigation for this specific vulnerability.
    - **Network Segmentation**: While not a mitigation in the extension itself, network segmentation on the user's infrastructure can limit the impact of SSRF by restricting access to sensitive internal resources. This is an organizational security measure.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the proxy settings used by VS Code, either by:
        - Directly modifying the VS Code `http.proxy` setting (requires some level of access to the user's VS Code configuration).
        - Setting environment variables like `HTTPS_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, or `http_proxy` in the environment where VS Code and the Tabnine extension are running.

      let proxy: string | undefined = workspace
        .getConfiguration()
        .get<string>("http.proxy"); // [4] Get from VS Code config
      if (!proxy) {
        proxy =
          process.env.HTTPS_PROXY || // [5] Get from environment variables
          process.env.https_proxy ||
          process.env.HTTP_PROXY ||
          process.env.http_proxy;
      }
      if (proxy?.endsWith("/")) {
        proxy = proxy.substr(0, proxy.length - 1);
      }
      return proxy; // [6] Return proxy string
    }

        I -- Error --> K[Return undefined];
    ```
    **Step-by-step explanation:**
    1. `getProxySettings()` function is called to retrieve proxy configuration.
    2. It first tries to get proxy settings from VS Code configuration using `workspace.getConfiguration().get<string>("http.proxy")`.
    3. If no proxy is configured in VS Code settings, it checks environment variables `HTTPS_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `http_proxy`.
    4. The retrieved proxy string is returned without any validation.
    5. `getHttpsProxyAgent()` receives the proxy string.
    6. It checks if `proxySettings` is not empty and if `tabnineExtensionProperties.useProxySupport` is enabled. If not, it returns `undefined`.
    7. If proxy settings are to be used, it creates a `URL` object from the `proxySettings` string. This can throw an error if the proxy string is malformed, which is caught, and `undefined` is returned.
    8. `HttpsProxyAgentOptions` are constructed from the parsed URL and other options.
    9. An `HttpsProxyAgent` instance is created using `proxyOptions`. This step is where the vulnerability manifests, as it directly uses the potentially attacker-controlled proxy URL.
    10. The created `HttpsProxyAgent` is returned, which will be used for subsequent network requests, potentially leading to SSRF.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a controlled HTTP server (e.g., using `netcat` or a simple Python HTTP server) to act as a malicious proxy at `http://attacker-controlled-proxy:8080`. This server will simply log incoming requests.
        - Install the Tabnine VS Code extension in a test environment.
    2. **Configuration:**
        - In VS Code settings, set `http.proxy` to `http://attacker-controlled-proxy:8080`.
        - Ensure `tabnine.useProxySupport` is enabled (or defaults to enabled).
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Trigger an action in the Tabnine extension that initiates an outbound network request. For instance, attempt to refresh the Tabnine Hub (if such an action is readily available without specific coding in extension). If not, it might be necessary to instrument the extension to force a network request that uses proxy. Since the provided code doesn't directly show explicit network requests from extension side other than fetching chat application assets in build workflows, we should assume that Tabnine extension *does* initiate outbound requests for core functionalities like code completion or status updates (though not explicitly visible in provided snippets). For test purposes, we can assume a function call that uses proxy is triggered. For example, triggering assistant binary download by toggling assistant on and off (if this triggers download) or any other feature that makes outbound calls.
    4. **Verification:**
        - Check the logs of the attacker-controlled proxy server.
        - Verify that the Tabnine extension's network request was routed through `http://attacker-controlled-proxy:8080` by observing the logged request details (headers, URL, etc.) on the malicious proxy server.
        - If the request appears in the proxy logs, it confirms that the extension is using the attacker-specified proxy, demonstrating SSRF vulnerability.
    5. **Cleanup:**
        - Reset the `http.proxy` setting in VS Code to its original or default value.
        - Stop the attacker-controlled proxy server.

This test case proves that an external attacker who can control the proxy settings can redirect the Tabnine extension's network traffic through a proxy they control, validating the SSRF vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure TLS Configuration via `ignoreCertificateErrors`
- Description:
    1. The Tabnine extension allows users to disable TLS certificate verification for HTTPS requests by setting `tabnineExtensionProperties.ignoreCertificateErrors` to `true`. This setting is configurable via VS Code settings (`tabnine.ignoreCertificateErrors`).
    2. The `downloadResource` function in `/code/src/utils/download.utils.ts` uses `tabnineExtensionProperties.ignoreCertificateErrors` to control the `rejectUnauthorized` option in HTTPS requests. When `ignoreCertificateErrors` is true, `rejectUnauthorized` is set to `false`, effectively disabling TLS certificate validation.
    3. An attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack can exploit this insecure configuration. If a user disables certificate verification, the extension will accept any certificate presented by the server, including self-signed or invalid certificates from a malicious server.
    4. The attacker can intercept and modify network traffic between the Tabnine extension and Tabnine servers without being detected because the extension will not validate the server's identity.
    5. This vulnerability can be triggered when the Tabnine extension makes HTTPS requests, such as downloading binary updates as seen in `/code/src/assistant/utils.ts`, communicating with backend services for assistant features (like diagnostics in `/code/src/assistant/diagnostics.ts` and related request modules), or during authentication processes, if these use HTTPS.

- Impact:
    - **High**: Disabling TLS certificate verification significantly weakens the security of HTTPS connections. An attacker can:
        - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: Intercept and inspect network traffic between the Tabnine extension and Tabnine servers.
        - **Data Breach**: Steal sensitive information transmitted over HTTPS, such as user credentials, API keys, or code snippets being sent for analysis (if any).
        - **Malware Injection**: Inject malicious code or responses into the communication stream, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine if the extension processes downloaded content without sufficient validation. For example, a malicious binary could be injected during the assistant binary download process.
        - **Phishing**: Redirect the extension's requests to a fake Tabnine server, tricking users into providing credentials or other sensitive information to the attacker.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the code directly address the risk of disabling certificate verification. The `ignoreCertificateErrors` setting is directly passed to the `https.request` options without any warnings or security considerations in the code itself.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Remove or Deprecate `ignoreCertificateErrors` Setting**: The most secure approach is to remove the option to disable certificate verification entirely. If there's a valid use case (e.g., for testing in controlled environments), this setting should be deprecated and strongly discouraged for production use.
    - **Security Warning**: If the `ignoreCertificateErrors` setting must be kept, implement a prominent security warning in the settings UI and in the extension's logs when this option is enabled. The warning should clearly explain the severe security risks associated with disabling certificate verification.
    - **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Implement HSTS to ensure that browsers/clients (in this case, the extension acting as an HTTP client) always connect to the Tabnine servers over HTTPS. While HSTS is more relevant for web servers and browsers, the principle of enforcing HTTPS can be applied to the extension's network requests as well, making it harder for attackers to downgrade connections to HTTP.
    - **Certificate Pinning**: Consider certificate pinning to further enhance TLS security. This involves hardcoding or securely configuring the expected certificate or public key of the Tabnine servers within the extension. This would prevent MitM attacks even if the user's trusted root CA store is compromised, but introduces operational complexity with certificate rotation.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must explicitly enable the `tabnine.ignoreCertificateErrors` setting in VS Code. This is not enabled by default but is available as a configuration option.
    - The attacker needs to be in a network position to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack between the user's machine and Tabnine servers. This could be on a public Wi-Fi network, a compromised local network, or through DNS spoofing.

        response: IncomingMessage,
        resolve: (value: T | PromiseLike<T>) => void,
        reject: (error: Error) => void
      ) => void
    ): Promise<T> {

        ? await readCaCerts(tabnineExtensionProperties.caCerts)
        : undefined;
      const parsedUrl = typeof url === "string" ? new URL(url) : url;
      const agent = await getHttpAgent(parsedUrl);
      return new Promise<T>((resolve, reject) => {

          {

        caCerts,
        useProxySupport,
      } = tabnineExtensionProperties;
      const ca = caCerts ? await readCaCerts(caCerts) : undefined;
      const proxyAgent = getHttpsProxyAgent({ ignoreCertificateErrors, ca });

      const httpModule = getHttpModule(url);
      return useProxySupport && proxyAgent
        ? proxyAgent
        : new httpModule.Agent({
            ca,
            rejectUnauthorized: !ignoreCertificateErrors, // [3] Insecure TLS config
          });
    }
    ```
    **Step-by-step explanation:**
    1. The `downloadResource` function is responsible for making HTTP/HTTPS requests to download resources.
    2. Inside `downloadResource`, the `https.request` options are configured. Notably, `rejectUnauthorized` is set to the negation of `tabnineExtensionProperties.ignoreCertificateErrors` ([1]).
    3. The `getHttpAgent` function, used by `downloadResource`, also uses `tabnineExtensionProperties.ignoreCertificateErrors` ([2], [3]) when creating either `HttpsProxyAgent` or default `https.Agent`.
    4. `tabnineExtensionProperties.ignoreCertificateErrors` is directly derived from the VS Code configuration setting `tabnine.ignoreCertificateErrors`.
    5. If a user sets `tabnine.ignoreCertificateErrors` to `true`, `rejectUnauthorized` becomes `false`, disabling certificate validation for HTTPS requests made by these functions.
    6. This insecure configuration allows MitM attacks as the extension will trust any server, regardless of certificate validity, as long as the user has enabled this setting.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a malicious server with a self-signed or invalid SSL certificate. Let's say the malicious server is at `https://malicious-server.com`.
        - Configure DNS or `hosts` file on the test machine so that a legitimate Tabnine domain (e.g., `update.tabnine.com` if used in download URLs, like in `/code/src/assistant/utils.ts`) resolves to the IP address of `malicious-server.com`. This simulates a DNS spoofing MitM attack.
        - Install the Tabnine VS Code extension in a test environment.
    2. **Configuration:**
        - In VS Code settings, set `tabnine.ignoreCertificateErrors` to `true`.
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Trigger an action in the Tabnine extension that initiates an HTTPS request to a Tabnine server domain that you've redirected to your `malicious-server.com`. For example, force an update check (if possible via a command, or by manipulating extension state to trigger an automatic update check). Toggling the assistant feature in settings or restarting VSCode might trigger a binary download, which would use HTTPS. If update check is not easily triggered, any HTTPS request initiated by the extension (even if not explicitly shown in provided files, assume extension has HTTPS communication for core features) can be targeted.
    4. **Verification:**
        - On `malicious-server.com`, set up a simple HTTPS server that logs incoming requests and serves a basic response (to avoid crashing the extension due to unexpected responses).
        - Observe if the Tabnine extension successfully connects to `https://malicious-server.com` without any certificate errors. The request should be logged on your malicious server.
        - If the connection is successful and no certificate errors are reported by VS Code or the extension (check extension logs if available for certificate rejections, though with `ignoreCertificateErrors=true` no rejection is expected), it confirms that the extension is indeed ignoring certificate errors and vulnerable to MitM.
    5. **Cleanup:**
        - Reset the `tabnine.ignoreCertificateErrors` setting in VS Code to `false` or its default value.
        - Revert any DNS or `hosts` file changes made for redirection.
        - Stop the malicious server.

This test case proves that when `tabnine.ignoreCertificateErrors` is enabled, the Tabnine extension is vulnerable to MitM attacks due to insecure TLS configuration, allowing an attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate HTTPS communication.

Based on the provided PROJECT FILES, no new high-rank vulnerabilities were identified. The existing vulnerabilities related to SSRF via proxy configuration and Insecure TLS Configuration via `ignoreCertificateErrors` remain valid and are not mitigated within the provided code. Further analysis with more project files is recommended to ensure complete vulnerability coverage.
