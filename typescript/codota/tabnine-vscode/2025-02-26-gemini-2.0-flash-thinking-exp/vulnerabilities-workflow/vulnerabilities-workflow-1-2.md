- **Vulnerability Name:** Zip Slip in Bundle Extraction
  **Description:**
  • In `/code/src/binary/binaryFetcher/bundleDownloader.ts` the update/download workflow fetches a ZIP “bundle” and immediately extracts it using the third‑party library `extract‑zip` via a call such as `await extract(bundle, { dir: bundleDirectory })`.
  • No checks are performed on the internal file paths contained in the ZIP. An attacker who can control the update server (or intercept the connection when certificate verification is disabled) can supply a crafted ZIP file with directory‑traversal entries (for example, `../malicious.txt`).
  **Impact:**
  • This may result in files being written outside the intended location, allowing overwriting of critical files or planting of malicious executables. In a worst‑case scenario, it can lead to remote code execution under the privileges of the running extension.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • Extraction is performed using the default behavior of `extract‑zip` and TLS certificate checks are enabled by default.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Explicitly validate and sanitize each entry within the bundle prior to extraction.
  • Enforce that the resolved output paths for all entries remain within the designated bundle directory.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The attacker must be able to control, modify, or intercept the update server response (or force the extension to disable certificate checks).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • The file `/code/src/binary/binaryFetcher/bundleDownloader.ts` downloads and then extracts the ZIP archive via a simple call to `extract(bundle, { dir: bundleDirectory })` without validating the file paths inside the archive.
  **Security Test Case:**
  • Set up a controlled update server that serves a crafted ZIP file containing at least one file whose internal path includes directory‑traversal (e.g. `"../../malicious.txt"`).
  • Configure the extension’s update URL to point to this server and trigger the update.
  • Verify that files are extracted outside the intended bundle directory.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Proxy Configuration and Certificate Verification Bypass
  **Description:**
  • In `/code/src/proxyProvider.ts` the extension obtains proxy settings (from user configuration or environment variables) and creates an HTTPS proxy agent.
  • The agent is configured with `rejectUnauthorized: !options.ignoreCertificateErrors` so that if a user explicitly disables certificate verification, HTTPS validation is entirely bypassed even when using a proxy that may be controlled by an attacker.
  **Impact:**
  • An attacker intercepting traffic or controlling a proxy server can perform man‑in‑the‑middle attacks. This can lead to injection of malicious update bundles or sensitive data leakage.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • TLS certificate verification is enabled by default unless the user explicitly bypasses it via a configuration setting.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Enforce stricter validation of proxy settings such as whitelisting approved proxy hosts.
  • Alert the user when proxy settings may result in insecure certificate validation.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The user must have configured the extension (or set environment variables) to ignore certificate errors while using a proxy that could be attacker‑controlled.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • The file `/code/src/proxyProvider.ts` creates an HTTPS agent with `rejectUnauthorized` set to the inverse of an insecure option without performing additional checks on the proxy’s trustworthiness.
  **Security Test Case:**
  • Configure the extension with certificate verification disabled and set proxy settings to an attacker‑controlled server.
  • Intercept and modify HTTPS requests (such as an update bundle download) to serve malicious content.
  • Confirm that the extension accepts the modified content without certificate warnings.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unrestricted Server URL Scheme Allowing SSRF and Local File Access
  **Description:**
  • In `/code/src/enterprise/update/serverUrl.ts` the update server URL is read from configuration and parsed using `Uri.parse(url, true)` without enforcing safe protocols.
  • This permits dangerous schemes (e.g. `file://` or internal IP addresses) that are later used by the update task without additional protocol validation.
  **Impact:**
  • An attacker able to influence the configuration or exploit bypassed certificate checks might supply a URL that triggers SSRF attacks or unauthorized local file access.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The URL is parsed using VS Code’s `Uri.parse` but no scheme‑based restrictions are applied.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Enforce strict allowlists for URL schemes (for example, allowing only `https://`).
  • Sanitize or reject URLs with dangerous or unexpected schemes.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The update or API configuration is modifiable by an attacker or is misconfigured to accept dangerous URL schemes.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In `/code/src/enterprise/update/serverUrl.ts` the URL is read directly from settings and parsed without check on the scheme. Later, in update routines (e.g. `/code/src/enterprise/update/updateTask.ts`), the URL is used to build download endpoints.
  **Security Test Case:**
  • Configure the update server URL with a dangerous value such as `file:///etc/passwd` or with an internal IP URL.
  • Trigger the update process and use network or log monitoring to verify that the extension attempts to access the malicious URL.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) in Webview Iframe Content
  **Description:**
  • The extension constructs HTML for various webviews (e.g. in `/code/src/hub/createHubTemplate.ts` and `/code/src/hub/createHubWebView.ts`) by directly interpolating a URL into an iframe’s `src` attribute using template literals.
  • This URL, derived from external configuration or network responses, is not rigorously sanitized before being embedded in the webview HTML.
  **Impact:**
  • An attacker who manipulates the URL (for example, by injecting a `javascript:` scheme) can trigger the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the extension’s webview.
  • This can result in leakage of authentication tokens or manipulation of extension state.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The extension relies on VS Code’s default webview security settings and constructs the HTML using template literals without additional sanitization.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Validate and sanitize the URL before injecting it into the webview HTML.
  • Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit allowable script sources within the webview.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The attacker must be able to manipulate the external URL source (via network manipulation or misconfiguration).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In the webview creation files (e.g. `/code/src/hub/createHubTemplate.ts`), the URL is directly embedded in an iframe’s `src` attribute.
  **Security Test Case:**
  • In a controlled environment, supply a URL containing a malicious payload (using a `javascript:` scheme or clickable HTML/JS payload) into the update configuration.
  • Open the webview and use developer tools to confirm that the injected script is executed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Extension Installation via Insecure vsix Update Mechanism
  **Description:**
  • In the enterprise update task (in `/code/src/enterprise/update/updateTask.ts`), the extension checks for a new version by downloading a version string and then constructs a download URL for a VSIX package.
  • The downloaded VSIX package is saved to a temporary location and the VS Code command `commands.executeCommand(INSTALL_COMMAND, Uri.file(path))` is invoked immediately without performing any integrity or digital signature verification.
  • Additionally, the update server URL is taken directly from configuration without restrictions on allowed protocols.
  **Impact:**
  • An attacker who can manipulate the update server or intercept communications (especially when certificate verification is bypassed) may force the installation of a malicious VSIX file.
  • This can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or full compromise of the user’s environment.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • TLS certificate verification is enabled by default; insecure behavior occurs only when certificate errors are explicitly ignored.
  • Progress notifications inform the user of an update in progress, but no verification is performed on the downloaded file.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Implement integrity verification (through checksums or digital signatures) for the downloaded VSIX package.
  • Validate the update server URL against a whitelist of safe domains and protocols.
  • Request additional user confirmation before performing an automatic installation.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The attacker must be able to control the update server response or exploit environments where certificate verification has been disabled.
  • The extension must be running in enterprise mode and using the VSIX update mechanism.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In `/code/src/enterprise/update/updateTask.ts`, after fetching the version string and constructing the VSIX download URL, the file is downloaded and immediately passed to the install command without performing integrity or authenticity checks.
  **Security Test Case:**
  • In a testing environment, set up an update server that returns a malicious VSIX file along with a version string that indicates an available update.
  • Configure the extension’s update URL to point to the malicious server and trigger the update.
  • Verify that the extension downloads and passes the malicious VSIX to the installation command without checking its integrity.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unvalidated Hover Command Registration Leading to Arbitrary Command Invocation
  **Description:**
  • In `/code/src/hovers/hoverActionsHandler.ts` the function `registerHoverCommands(hover)` dynamically registers commands by iterating over `hover.options` and calling
  `commands.registerCommand(option.key, () => { void sendHoverAction(hover.id, option.key, option.actions, hover.notification_type, hover.state); });`
  • The command identifier (`option.key`) is taken directly from the hover response without any sanitization or validation.
  • An attacker able to manipulate the backend (or intercept binary responses) can supply a crafted hover payload with a malicious command key that either collides with sensitive built‐in commands or triggers unintended behavior when executed.
  **Impact:**
  • Triggering such a maliciously registered command may lead to arbitrary command execution within the extension’s host context.
  • This increases the risk of privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, or further lateral attacks within the user’s VS Code environment.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The extension relies on the assumed integrity of the binary hover responses and TS type safety without performing any sanitization on command identifiers.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Sanitize and validate all dynamic command identifiers (`option.key`) to ensure they conform to an allowlist of safe characters and do not conflict with reserved command namespaces.
  • Implement integrity checks on remote hover payloads before using their data in command registration.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The attacker must be able to manipulate the binary’s hover response (for example, via a compromised update server or bypassing certificate validation).
  • The user must interact with the hover such that the malicious command is executed.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In `/code/src/hovers/hoverActionsHandler.ts`, no sanitization is applied to `option.key` when dynamically registering commands.
  • The registered commands directly call `sendHoverAction` using parameters supplied from the attacker-controlled hover payload.
  **Security Test Case:**
  • Simulate a malicious hover response containing an `option.key` that is known to conflict with sensitive commands.
  • Load this hover payload into the extension and display the hover UI.
  • Click on the malicious hover option and observe that the registered command is executed with attacker‑controlled parameters, confirming the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Custom Token Sign-In URL Handling
  **Description:**
  • In `/code/src/authentication/loginWithCustomTokenCommand.ts` the function `SignInUsingCustomTokenCommand` initiates a custom token sign‑in flow.
  • It calls `signInUsingCustomTokenUrl()` to obtain an external URL, which is then directly parsed with `Uri.parse(url)` and, depending on the user’s selection, passed to `env.openExternal()` to launch an external browser window.
  • No validation or sanitization is performed on the returned URL, leaving the path and protocol unchecked.
  **Impact:**
  • If an attacker can manipulate the response from `signInUsingCustomTokenUrl()` (for example, via a man‑in‑the‑middle attack when certificate validation is bypassed), they may supply a malicious URL.
  • This may result in the user being redirected to a phishing site or a page hosting malicious content, potentially compromising user credentials or allowing further attacks in the user environment.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The extension uses VS Code’s default URL parsing and external launching via `env.openExternal`.
  • There is reliance on the integrity of the binary sign‑in response but no additional validation is performed.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Validate and sanitize the URL returned by `signInUsingCustomTokenUrl()` by enforcing a strict whitelist of acceptable protocols (e.g. only allow `https://`) and domains.
  • Log and reject any URLs that do not conform to the expected format prior to launching an external process.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The attacker must be able to intercept or manipulate the response from `signInUsingCustomTokenUrl()`.
  • The user must choose the “Get auth token” option in the sign‑in prompt, triggering `env.openExternal(Uri.parse(url))`.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In `/code/src/authentication/loginWithCustomTokenCommand.ts`, the URL is obtained and immediately parsed using `Uri.parse(url)` and then passed to `env.openExternal` without any further checks.
  **Security Test Case:**
  • In a controlled environment, configure `signInUsingCustomTokenUrl()` to return a malicious URL (for example, one using a `javascript:` scheme or pointing to a phishing domain).
  • Trigger the sign‑in flow and select the “Get auth token” option.
  • Verify that the extension opens the malicious URL, confirming that improper URL validation is taking place.
