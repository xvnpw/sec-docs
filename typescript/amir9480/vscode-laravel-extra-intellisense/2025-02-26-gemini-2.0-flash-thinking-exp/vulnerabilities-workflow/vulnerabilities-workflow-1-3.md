### Vulnerability List for Laravel Extra Intellisense VSCode Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `phpCommand` setting

* Description:
    1. The extension allows users to configure the `phpCommand` setting, which defines the command used to execute PHP code for Laravel project analysis.
    2. This setting is directly used in `child_process.exec` within the `runPhp` function in `helpers.ts` without sufficient sanitization.
    3. An attacker can craft a malicious `phpCommand` that injects arbitrary shell commands alongside the intended PHP code.
    4. When the extension executes PHP code (e.g., to provide autocompletion suggestions), the injected commands will also be executed on the developer's machine.

* Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine.
    - Depending on the injected commands and the developer's system privileges, this could lead to:
        - Data theft from the developer's machine or the Laravel project.
        - Installation of malware.
        - System compromise.
        - Privilege escalation if the developer is running VSCode with elevated privileges.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the `phpCommand` setting in `child_process.exec` without any input validation or sanitization.
    - The README.md contains a "Security Note" warning users about potential issues, but this is not a technical mitigation.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for the `phpCommand` setting.
    - Validation of the `phpCommand` setting to ensure it only contains the expected PHP command and arguments, preventing injection of arbitrary commands.
    - Consider using safer alternatives to `child_process.exec` if possible, or restrict the command execution environment.
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for the extension's webview, if any, to limit the capabilities of executed scripts.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to trick a developer into using a malicious workspace configuration or settings file that modifies the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting.
    - The developer must have the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension installed and activated in VSCode.
    - The extension must be triggered to execute PHP code, which happens automatically when using autocompletion features.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/helpers.ts`
    2. Function: `runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null)`
    3. Line: `let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";` - Retrieves the `phpCommand` setting from user configuration.
    4. Line: `let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);` - Constructs the command by directly replacing `{code}` with the PHP code to execute, without any sanitization of `commandTemplate` or `code`.
    5. Line: `cp.exec(command, ...)` - Executes the constructed command using `child_process.exec`.

    ```typescript
    // Visualization of vulnerable code path in /code/src/helpers.ts

    graph LR
        A[getConfiguration('phpCommand')] --> B[commandTemplate];
        B --> C[replace("{code}", code)];
        C --> D[cp.exec(command)];
        D --> E[Execute PHP code and potentially injected commands];
    ```

    The `phpCommand` setting, controlled by the user, is directly incorporated into the command executed by `cp.exec`. If a malicious user provides a `phpCommand` containing shell injection characters, these will be interpreted by the shell during command execution, leading to arbitrary command execution.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Open VSCode.
        - Install the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension.
        - Open any Laravel project in VSCode (or create a dummy Laravel project).
    2. **Modify User Settings:**
        - Go to VSCode Settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        - Select "Workspace Settings" or "User Settings" depending on where you want to apply the malicious configuration.
        - Search for "Laravel Extra Intellisense phpCommand".
        - Modify the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting to the following malicious command:
          ```json
          "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r '{code}; touch /tmp/pwned_by_laravel_intellisense'"
          ```
          or for windows:
          ```json
          "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "php -r \"{code}; New-Item -ItemType file -Path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\pwned_by_laravel_intellisense.txt\""
          ```
    3. **Trigger Autocompletion:**
        - Open any PHP file within your Laravel project (e.g., a controller or a route file).
        - Start typing `Route::` or `config(` to trigger the autocompletion feature of the extension. This will cause the extension to execute PHP code using the configured `phpCommand`.
    4. **Verify Command Execution:**
        - **Linux/macOS:** Open a terminal and check if the file `/tmp/pwned_by_laravel_intellisense` has been created:
          ```bash
          ls -l /tmp/pwned_by_laravel_intellisense
          ```
          If the file exists, the command injection is successful.
        - **Windows:** Open PowerShell and check if the file `C:\Windows\Temp\pwned_by_laravel_intellisense.txt` has been created:
          ```powershell
          Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows\Temp\pwned_by_laravel_intellisense.txt
          ```
          If the file exists, the command injection is successful.

    If the file is created, it confirms that arbitrary commands injected through the `phpCommand` setting are being executed by the extension.
