### Vulnerability List for Laravel Extra Intellisense VSCode Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `phpCommand` configuration

* Description:
    1. The extension allows users to configure the `phpCommand` setting, which defines the command used to execute PHP code for Laravel project analysis.
    2. This setting is directly used in `child_process.exec` within the `runPhp` function in `helpers.ts` without sufficient sanitization.
    3. An attacker can craft a malicious `phpCommand` that injects arbitrary shell commands alongside the intended PHP code.
    4. When the extension executes PHP code (e.g., to provide autocompletion suggestions), the injected commands will also be executed on the developer's machine.

* Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine.
    - Depending on the injected commands and the developer's system privileges, this could lead to:
        - Data theft from the developer's machine or the Laravel project.
        - Installation of malware.
        - System compromise.
        - Privilege escalation if the developer is running VSCode with elevated privileges.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `Helpers::runPhp` function attempts to escape double quotes (`"`) in the PHP code using `code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"")`. It also includes platform-specific escaping for Unix-like systems, escaping `$`, single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`). However, this mitigation is insufficient as it only applies to the `{code}` placeholder's content and not the `phpCommand` template itself.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for the `phpCommand` setting.
    - Parameterization of commands or safer command execution methods than `child_process.exec`.
    - Restricting shell execution by exploring `child_process.spawn` with `shell: false`.
    - Security warnings within VSCode when configuring `phpCommand`.

* Preconditions:
    - User has the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension installed in VSCode.
    - User has configured or is about to configure the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting with a malicious command.
    - User reloads or activates the extension after setting the malicious `phpCommand`.
    - The extension attempts to use `Helpers::runPhp`, triggered by normal extension functionality (e.g., autocompletion).

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/helpers.ts`
    2. Function: `runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null)`
    3. Line: `let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";` - Retrieves the `phpCommand` setting from user configuration.
    4. Line: `let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);` - Constructs the command by directly replacing `{code}` with the PHP code to execute, without adequate sanitization of `commandTemplate`.
    5. Line: `cp.exec(command, ...)` - Executes the constructed command using `child_process.exec`.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[getConfiguration('phpCommand')] --> B[commandTemplate];
        B --> C[replace("{code}", code)];
        C --> D[cp.exec(command)];
        D --> E[Execute PHP code and potentially injected commands];
    ```

    The `phpCommand` setting, controlled by the user, is directly incorporated into the command executed by `cp.exec`. If a malicious user provides a `phpCommand` containing shell injection characters, these will be interpreted by the shell during command execution, leading to arbitrary command execution.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites**:
        - VSCode with Laravel Extra Intellisense extension installed.
        - A Laravel project opened in VSCode.
        - Access to VSCode settings (settings.json).

    2. **Steps**:
        a. Open VSCode settings (JSON).
        b. Configure `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` to: `"php -r '{code}; system(\"touch /tmp/pwned_laravel_extension\")'"` (or `"php -r \"{code}; New-Item -ItemType file -Path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\pwned_by_laravel_intellisense.txt\""` for Windows).
        c. Save settings and reload VSCode.
        d. Open a PHP or Blade file to trigger autocompletion.
        e. Check for the creation of `/tmp/pwned_laravel_extension` (or `C:\Windows\Temp\pwned_by_laravel_intellisense.txt` on Windows).

    3. **Expected Result**:
        - The file `/tmp/pwned_laravel_extension` (or Windows equivalent) is created, indicating successful command injection.

### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Laravel Application Bootstrapping

* Description:
  The extension automatically boots the Laravel application to gather autocompletion data by requiring critical files (such as `vendor/autoload.php` and `bootstrap/app.php`) via the helper method `runLaravel` (in `helpers.ts`). An attacker who can inject malicious PHP code into the Laravel project—for example by compromising a service provider or modifying bootstrap files—can force the extension to execute that code.
  **Step by step how to trigger:**
  1. An attacker inserts malicious PHP code into a service provider or directly into the bootstrap file of the Laravel project.
  2. When the user opens the Laravel project in VSCode with the extension enabled, the extension calls `Helpers.runLaravel` to bootstrap the application.
  3. During bootstrapping, the compromised bootstrap code is loaded and executed, causing the attacker’s payload to run.

* Impact:
  Arbitrary PHP code execution in the same context as the extension host. This could result in complete system compromise, disclosure of sensitive data, or further persistence of malicious code on the host.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  The project’s README includes a security note warning users to disable the extension when writing or testing sensitive code. However, this is a user–awareness mitigation only.

* Missing Mitigations:
  - Sandboxing or isolation between the Laravel bootstrap code and the extension’s host environment.
  - Code validation or integrity checking before including sensitive bootstrap files.
  - Verification that the Laravel project has not been tampered with.

* Preconditions:
  - The workspace opened by the user contains a Laravel project.
  - Malicious code has been introduced into critical Laravel files (e.g. a compromised service provider or bootstrap file).

* Source Code Analysis:
  - In `helpers.ts`, the `runLaravel` function first checks for the existence of files using `fs.existsSync(Helpers.projectPath("vendor/autoload.php"))` and `fs.existsSync(Helpers.projectPath("bootstrap/app.php"))`.
  - It then constructs a long command string that requires these files (bootstrapping the Laravel application), and appends the PHP code (passed as the argument) inside a marker that is later parsed from the output.
  - Finally, the command is executed via `cp.exec`, so any PHP code already present in the Laravel project will run in the same OS process.

* Security Test Case:
  1. Create or modify a Laravel project so that one of its service providers (or the bootstrap file) contains a payload (for example, PHP code that writes a file named `pwned.txt` into a known location).
  2. Open this Laravel project in VSCode with the Laravel Extra Intellisense extension enabled.
  3. Allow the extension to run (which automatically calls `runLaravel`).
  4. Verify that the malicious payload executed (check for the presence of `pwned.txt` or other expected malicious activity).

### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Automatic Inclusion in Eloquent Provider

* Description:
  The extension’s `EloquentProvider` scans directories listed in the configuration (typically `app` and `app/Models`, plus optionally the `database/migrations` folder) and includes each PHP file found using a raw `include_once` call. If an attacker can add a malicious PHP file to one of these directories (for instance via a malicious commit or compromised repository), the extension will automatically include and run that file.
  **Step by step how to trigger:**
  1. An attacker introduces a malicious PHP file (for example, named `evil.php`) in one of the monitored directories.
  2. When the extension’s model loader (in `EloquentProvider.ts`) runs, it iterates over the PHP files and runs `include_once` on each one.
  3. The malicious file is executed within the extension’s process.

* Impact:
  Arbitrary PHP code execution inside the extension host process. This can lead to execution of attacker–controlled commands with the same privileges as the user’s VSCode process, thereby potentially compromising the system.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  The scanning logic simply iterates over files ending with `.php` found under the configured directories; no safeguards are implemented to check file authenticity or restrict which files may be included.

* Missing Mitigations:
  - Validation or sanitization of the PHP files before inclusion.
  - Sandboxing of the inclusion process.
  - Whitelist or integrity checking for files scanned from the project.

* Preconditions:
  - The attacker must have a way to inject or commit a malicious PHP file into one of the monitored directories (e.g. via a compromised commit or a public repository).
  - The workspace is reloaded in VSCode so that the `EloquentProvider.loadModels()` function runs and includes the file.

* Source Code Analysis:
  - In `EloquentProvider.ts`, inside the `loadModels()` method the extension calls: `include_once base_path("$modelPath/$sourceFile");` for every file where the filename ends with `.php` in the configured paths.
  - There is no check (beyond a basic filename filter) to verify whether the file originates from a trusted source before inclusion.

* Security Test Case:
  1. Create a file (e.g. `evil.php`) in one of the model directories with a payload that—for example—writes a file or prints a unique string.
  2. Open the project in VSCode so that the EloquentProvider’s file scanning executes.
  3. Verify that the payload runs by checking the expected output (such as the file written or the alert message).
