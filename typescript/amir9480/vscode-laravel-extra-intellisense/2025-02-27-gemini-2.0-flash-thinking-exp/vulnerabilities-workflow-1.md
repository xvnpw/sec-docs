### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure PHP Code Execution via `phpCommand` Configuration

* Description:
    1. The "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension enhances Laravel development in VSCode by providing autocompletion and other features. To achieve this, it executes PHP code from the user's Laravel project to gather information about routes, views, configurations, and more.
    2. The extension uses the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting, configurable in VSCode settings, to define the command for executing PHP code. This setting is intended for customization in different environments like Docker or Laravel Sail.
    3. An attacker can compromise a user's VSCode configuration by various means, such as social engineering, supply chain attacks on VSCode settings synchronization, or compromising other VSCode extensions.
    4. By modifying the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting, the attacker can inject arbitrary system commands. For example, they could set it to execute shell commands before or after the intended PHP code execution.
    5. When the extension subsequently executes PHP code for features like autocompletion, it uses the attacker-modified `phpCommand`, leading to the execution of the injected commands alongside the intended PHP code.
    6. Even without direct malicious modification of `phpCommand`, the inherent design of executing PHP code from the workspace introduces risk. If a user opens a compromised Laravel project containing malicious code, or if there are vulnerabilities in the extension's PHP code generation, unintended and harmful code execution within the user's development environment can occur.
    7. The extension's README.md includes a "Security Note" warning users about the risks of PHP code execution. However, this warning may be easily overlooked, and users might not fully understand the security implications, especially when VSCode configurations are centrally managed or shared across teams.
    8. A malicious attacker can also craft a Laravel project that includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file with a malicious `phpCommand` configuration. If a victim opens this project in VSCode with the extension installed, the malicious command will be executed when the extension activates and attempts to use PHP.

* Impact:
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By manipulating the `phpCommand` setting or exploiting potential issues in the extension's PHP code execution, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode user.
    - **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to complete control over the developer's machine, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, including source code, credentials, and API keys, install malware, or use the compromised machine as a stepping stone for further attacks within a network.
    - **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can use RCE to access and exfiltrate sensitive project data, environment variables, and other confidential information accessible from the development environment.
    - **Malware Installation:** RCE can be leveraged to install persistent malware on the developer's machine, leading to long-term compromise and potential data breaches.
    - **Denial of Service:** Injected commands could be used to cause a denial of service by consuming system resources or disrupting critical processes on the developer's machine.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Security Note in `README.md`:** The extension's `README.md` file includes a "Security Note" that warns users about the extension's behavior of running the Laravel application to provide autocompletion. It advises users to be cautious and temporarily disable the extension if sensitive code is present in service providers or if they observe unknown errors in logs.
    - **Error Alerts:** The extension displays error alerts within VSCode when it fails to retrieve data, which might indirectly alert users if something unexpected happens due to a malicious configuration.
    - **Basic Input Escaping:** The `runPhp` function in `/code/src/helpers.ts` attempts to escape double quotes, dollar signs, and backslashes in the PHP code before execution. This is a rudimentary attempt to prevent command injection, but it is insufficient to protect against malicious modifications of the `phpCommand` setting itself. Specifically, the following replacements are performed:
        ```typescript
        code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\""); // Escape double quotes
        code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");   // Escape dollar signs (for Linux/macOS)
        code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\''); // Escape escaped single quotes
        code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"'); // Escape escaped double quotes
        ```

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization for `phpCommand` setting:**  Implement robust validation and sanitization for the `phpCommand` setting to prevent the injection of arbitrary commands. This could involve:
        - Whitelisting allowed commands and parameters.
        - Restricting the characters allowed in the `phpCommand` setting.
        - Parsing and validating the structure of the command to ensure it conforms to expected patterns.
    - **Prominent In-Editor Security Warnings:** Display a more prominent warning within VSCode itself when a user configures or modifies the `phpCommand` setting, explicitly highlighting the Remote Code Execution risks. This warning should be more visible than a note in the README and should be presented directly in the user interface when the setting is changed.
    - **Workspace Trust Mechanism Integration:** Leverage VSCode's Workspace Trust feature. When opening a workspace with a custom `phpCommand`, especially from an untrusted source, display a warning banner prompting the user to explicitly trust the workspace and its settings, emphasizing the security implications of executing code defined in workspace settings.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation of PHP Execution:** Implement a sandboxed environment for PHP code execution to limit the potential damage from malicious code. This could involve using containerization or other isolation techniques to restrict the privileges and access of the PHP execution environment. While technically complex for a VSCode extension, it would significantly enhance security.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for PHP Execution:** Review and minimize the PHP code executed by the extension to the absolute minimum required for functionality. Ensure that the generated PHP code does not inadvertently create opportunities for code injection or execution of untrusted data. Carefully audit the PHP code generation logic to prevent any unintended execution paths.
    - **Secure Command Execution Methods:** Explore using safer methods for executing PHP code from Node.js that avoid shell command injection vulnerabilities. Investigate if Node.js's `child_process` module offers options for parameterized commands or if alternative PHP execution methods can be employed that are less susceptible to injection attacks.

* Preconditions:
    - User has installed the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" VSCode extension.
    - User has opened a Laravel project in VSCode.
    - An attacker has the ability to modify the user's VSCode configuration settings. This can occur through:
        - The user opening a malicious Laravel project provided by the attacker, which includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file with a malicious `phpCommand`.
        - Social engineering tactics to trick the user into manually changing the `phpCommand` setting.
        - Supply chain attacks targeting VSCode settings synchronization mechanisms.
        - Compromising other VSCode extensions that have the ability to modify settings.
        - Gaining unauthorized access to the user's machine and directly modifying VSCode settings files.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/helpers.ts`
    2. **Function:** `Helpers.runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null)`
    3. **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
       ```typescript
       static async runPhp(code: string, description: string|null = null) : Promise<string> {
           code = code.replace(/\"/g, "\\\"");
           if (['linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', 'darwin'].some(unixPlatforms => os.platform().includes(unixPlatforms))) {
               code = code.replace(/\$/g, "\\$");
               code = code.replace(/\\\\'/g, '\\\\\\\\\'');
               code = code.replace(/\\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\\\"');
           }
           let commandTemplate = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand') ?? "php -r \"{code}\"";
           let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);
           // ... execution using cp.exec(command, ...)
           return new Promise(function (resolve, error) {
               cp.exec(command, { ... }, (err, stdout, stderr) => {
                   // ... handle response
               });
           });
       }
       ```
       - **`vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<string>('phpCommand')`**: This line retrieves the `phpCommand` setting directly from VSCode workspace configuration. This setting is user-configurable and can be modified by a malicious actor.
       - **`let command = commandTemplate.replace("{code}", code);`**:  This line constructs the command string by directly replacing the `{code}` placeholder in the `commandTemplate` (which is derived from the `phpCommand` setting) with the `$code` variable, which contains the PHP code to be executed. No sanitization is performed on the `commandTemplate` itself, allowing for injection if the `phpCommand` setting is malicious.
       - **`cp.exec(command, ...)`**: This line executes the constructed `command` using `child_process.exec`. The `cp.exec` function executes commands in a shell, making it vulnerable to command injection if the `command` string is not properly sanitized. In this case, because the `phpCommand` setting is directly incorporated into the command without validation, it becomes the injection point.

    4. **Control Flow Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[VSCode Settings (LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand)] --> B(getConfiguration);
        B --> C{phpCommand Value};
        C -- User-Defined Command --> D[commandTemplate Variable];
        C -- Default "php -r \\"{code}\\"" --> D;
        D --> E{String Replace "{code}" with PHP code};
        E --> F[command Variable];
        F --> G(cp.exec(command));
        G --> H[System Shell Execution];
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Ensure you have VSCode installed with the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension in a safe testing environment (e.g., a virtual machine or isolated test project).
        - Open a Laravel project in VSCode or create a new dummy Laravel project for testing.
    2. **Modify `phpCommand` to inject a malicious command:**
        - Open VSCode settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings, or Code -> Settings -> Settings on macOS).
        - Switch to the "Workspace" settings tab to modify project-specific settings.
        - Search for "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand".
        - Click the "Edit in settings.json" icon next to the setting to open your workspace `settings.json` file.
        - Add or modify the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` setting to inject a command to create a marker file.  For Linux/macOS:
          ```json
          "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "echo '; touch /tmp/vscode_extension_pwned; php -r \"{code}\"'"
          ```
          For Windows PowerShell:
          ```json
          "LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand": "powershell -Command \"php -r '{code}'; New-Item -ItemType File -Path C:\\\\temp\\\\vscode_extension_pwned.txt\""
          ```
        - Save the `settings.json` file.
    3. **Trigger Extension Functionality:**
        - Open any PHP file within your Laravel project (e.g., a controller or route file).
        - Place your cursor within a PHP context where autocompletion is expected (e.g., inside a string argument of a Laravel function like `route('`) or `config('`).
        - Type a character or trigger autocompletion (e.g., by typing `route('` and waiting for suggestions). This action will cause the extension to execute PHP code to fetch autocompletion data, using the modified `phpCommand`.
    4. **Verify Command Execution:**
        - Open a terminal or PowerShell on your system, depending on your OS.
        - Check if the marker file has been created.
            - On Linux/macOS, run: `ls /tmp/vscode_extension_pwned`
            - On Windows, check if the file `C:\temp\vscode_extension_pwned.txt` exists.
        - If the marker file exists, it confirms that the injected command (`touch /tmp/vscode_extension_pwned` or `New-Item ...`) was successfully executed when the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension ran PHP code, demonstrating the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

This test case effectively demonstrates that a malicious actor who can influence the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.phpCommand` configuration can achieve Remote Code Execution on a user's machine when the extension attempts to execute PHP code for its intended features.
