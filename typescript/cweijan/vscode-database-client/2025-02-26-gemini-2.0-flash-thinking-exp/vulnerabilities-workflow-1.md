Here is the combined list of vulnerabilities, with duplicates removed, formatted in markdown as requested:

### Combined Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure SSH Tunnel Default Username

    - Description:
    The Database Client extension provides SSH tunneling functionality. By default, the extension pre-fills the username field with "root" in the SSH tunnel configuration when establishing a connection. If a user proceeds with this default configuration and attempts to connect to an SSH server that allows root login with password authentication (which is a bad security practice but sometimes exists), it increases the risk of unauthorized access. An attacker who gains access to the SSH server (e.g., through brute-force password attack if password authentication for root is enabled) can then potentially pivot and access the database server behind the tunnel.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Open the Database Client extension in VSCode.
    2. Initiate a new database connection that requires SSH tunneling.
    3. In the SSH Tunnel configuration section, observe that the "Username" field is pre-filled with "root".
    4. Proceed to configure the SSH tunnel with default username "root" and other necessary connection details (host, port, password or private key).
    5. If the target SSH server allows root login and is vulnerable (e.g., weak password), an attacker could potentially compromise the SSH tunnel.

    - Impact:
    If an attacker successfully compromises the SSH tunnel due to the insecure default username and weak SSH server configuration, they can gain unauthorized access to the database server. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities on the database.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No direct mitigations are implemented in the project to prevent the use of "root" as the default username for SSH tunnels. The extension relies on users to change the default username to a more secure, non-privileged account.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    The extension should change the default SSH username from "root" to a less privileged and more secure default, such as the current system username or simply leave the field empty, prompting the user to enter a username explicitly. Alternatively, provide a warning or recommendation against using "root" as the SSH username in the UI or documentation.

    - Preconditions:
    1. User must utilize the SSH tunneling feature of the Database Client extension.
    2. User must not change the default username "root" in the SSH tunnel configuration.
    3. The target SSH server must be configured to allow SSH login for the "root" user, preferably with password authentication enabled and potentially with a weak password. (This precondition relies on insecure SSH server configuration, which is external to the extension but made more risky by the insecure default in the extension).

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/tunnel/config.js` and `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js`
    2. Analyze `createConfig` function in both files.
    3. Observe the default value assignment for `username`:
       ```javascript
       defaults(config || {}, {
           username: env.TUNNELSSH_USER || env.USER || env.USERNAME || 'root',
           // ... other defaults
       });
       ```
    4. The code prioritizes environment variables for username configuration, but if none are set, it defaults to 'root'.
    5. This default 'root' username is then used in the SSH connection attempt when the user does not explicitly provide a different username in the extension's UI.
    6. No code exists to validate or warn against using 'root' as username.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        a. Set up a test SSH server that allows SSH login for the 'root' user with password authentication. Use a weak password for the 'root' user for testing purposes only (in a real-world scenario, root login with password should be disabled).
        b. Install the Database Client extension in VSCode.
    2. **Test Steps:**
        a. Open the Database Client extension and attempt to create a new database connection (e.g., MySQL) that requires SSH tunneling.
        b. In the connection configuration, navigate to the SSH Tunnel settings.
        c. Observe that the "Username" field is pre-filled with "root". Leave this default username as is.
        d. Enter the host, port, and the weak password for the 'root' user of the test SSH server.
        e. Attempt to establish the SSH tunnel and database connection.
        f. If the SSH server is configured as described in step 1a, the connection will likely succeed using the default "root" username.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        The SSH tunnel and database connection are successfully established using the default "root" username. This demonstrates that the extension, by defaulting to "root", facilitates connection attempts using a potentially insecure username, especially if users do not change it and connect to vulnerable SSH servers.
    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        The test case passes if the connection is established with the default "root" username, indicating the vulnerability exists.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential FTP Command Injection in `listSafe` function

    - Description:
    The `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function in `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/connection.js` is potentially vulnerable to FTP command injection. This function takes a `path` argument, which, if not properly sanitized, could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary FTP commands. The `path` is used in `CWD` and `LIST` commands sent to the FTP server. By crafting a malicious `path`, an attacker might be able to execute unintended FTP commands, potentially leading to unauthorized file access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions on the FTP server.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Identify a feature in the Database Client extension that uses the `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function and allows user-controlled input to be passed as the `path` argument. (Further code analysis is needed to pinpoint the exact entry point within the extension.)
    2. Craft a malicious `path` string containing FTP commands. For example, a path like `"directoryA\r\nDELE malicious_file.txt"` could attempt to change the working directory to "directoryA" and then delete "malicious_file.txt".
    3. Use the identified extension feature to trigger the `listSafe` function with the crafted malicious `path`.
    4. Observe the FTP server's behavior to see if the injected commands are executed.

    - Impact:
    Successful FTP command injection could allow an attacker to:
        - Delete or rename files and directories on the FTP server.
        - Upload files to the FTP server.
        - Retrieve files from the FTP server.
        - Potentially execute other FTP commands depending on the server's capabilities and the injection technique.
        The impact severity depends on the permissions of the FTP user account used by the extension and the capabilities of the FTP server. In a worst-case scenario, it could lead to data loss, unauthorized data access, or server compromise.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No explicit sanitization or validation of the `path` argument in `FTP.prototype.listSafe` or related functions (`cwd`, `list`, `_send`) is apparent in the provided code snippets. The code directly constructs FTP commands using the provided path.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    Input sanitization is missing for the `path` argument in `FTP.prototype.listSafe` and related functions. The extension should implement robust sanitization to prevent FTP command injection. This could involve:
        - Validating the `path` to ensure it only contains allowed characters and directory separators.
        - Encoding or escaping special characters in the `path` before constructing FTP commands.
        - Ideally, avoid directly using user-controlled input to construct FTP commands. If possible, use parameterized commands or safer APIs if available in the FTP library.

    - Preconditions:
    1. The Database Client extension must use the `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function or any function that internally uses `FTP.prototype.cwd` or `FTP.prototype.list` with user-controlled path input.
    2. The extension must not sanitize or validate the user-provided path before passing it to the FTP client functions.
    3. The FTP server must be vulnerable to command injection (i.e., it executes commands embedded in path arguments).

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/connection.js`
    2. Analyze `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function:
       ```javascript
       FTP.prototype.listSafe = function(path, zcomp, cb) {
           if (typeof path === 'string') {
               var self = this;
               // store current path
               this.pwd(function(err, origpath) {
                   if (err) return cb(err);
                   // change to destination path
                   self.cwd(path, function(err) { // <--- path is used here
                       if (err) return cb(err);
                       // get dir listing
                       self.list(zcomp || false, function(err, list) { // <--- path might be used internally in list
                           // change back to original path
                           if (err) return self.cwd(origpath, cb);
                           self.cwd(origpath, function(err) {
                               if (err) return cb(err);
                               cb(err, list);
                           });
                       });
                   });
               });
           } else
               this.list(path, zcomp, cb); // <--- path might be used here
       };
       ```
    3. Analyze `FTP.prototype.cwd` function:
       ```javascript
       FTP.prototype.cwd = function(path, cb, promote) {
           this._send('CWD ' + path, function(err, text, code) { // <--- path is directly used in command
               if (err)
                   return cb(err);
               var m = RE_WD.exec(text);
               cb(undefined, m ? m[1] : undefined);
           }, promote);
       };
       ```
    4. Analyze `FTP.prototype.list` function (path usage not explicitly shown but might be used internally by server based on current directory):
       ```javascript
       FTP.prototype.list = function(path, zcomp, cb) {
           // ...
           function sendList() {
               // this callback will be executed multiple times, the first is when server
               // replies with 150 and then a final reply to indicate whether the
               // transfer was actually a success or not
               self._send(cmd, function(err, text, code) { // <--- cmd is constructed based on path in listSafe
                   // ...
               }, true);
           }
           // ...
       };
       ```
    5. Analyze `FTP.prototype._send` function:
       ```javascript
       FTP.prototype._send = function(cmd, cb, promote) {
           // ...
           if (!this._curReq && queueLen && this._socket && this._socket.readable) {
               this._curReq = this._queue.shift();
               // ...
               this._debug&&this._debug('[connection] > ' + inspect(this._curReq.cmd));
               this._socket.write(this._curReq.cmd + '\r\n'); // <--- Command is written directly to socket
           }
           // ...
       };
       ```
    6. Visualization:
       ```
       User Input (path) --> FTP.prototype.listSafe --> FTP.prototype.cwd/list --> FTP.prototype._send --> _socket.write (FTP Command sent without sanitization) --> FTP Server
       ```
    7. The code shows that the `path` argument from `listSafe` is directly incorporated into FTP commands (`CWD`, potentially `LIST`) and sent to the server via `_send` without any sanitization. This creates a potential FTP command injection vulnerability if user-controlled input can reach the `path` parameter of `listSafe`.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        a. Set up a test FTP server.
        b. Identify a feature in the Database Client extension that uses the `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function and allows providing a path (e.g., browsing FTP directories, file operations). For example, if the extension allows browsing directories, this would be a good entry point.
        c. Install the Database Client extension in VSCode and configure it to connect to the test FTP server.
    2. **Test Steps:**
        a. Using the identified extension feature, provide a malicious path as input. For instance, if the feature is directory browsing, try to browse to a directory path like `"test\r\nDELE malicious_file.txt"`. The exact path and injected command will depend on the feature and FTP server. A simple test is to inject `LIST` command. Try to list a directory with path `"\r\nLIST -al /etc\r\n"` if the server supports it.
        b. Monitor the FTP server logs or network traffic to see the commands received by the server.
        c. Observe if the injected FTP commands are executed by the server in addition to the intended commands.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        If the FTP server executes the injected commands, and you can observe unintended actions (like listing a different directory, deleting a file if you set up a more dangerous command), the vulnerability is confirmed. For example, if you inject `\r\nLIST -al /etc\r\n` and the server responds with a listing of `/etc` directory instead of the intended directory, it indicates successful command injection.
    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        The test case passes if injected FTP commands are successfully executed by the server, demonstrating the FTP command injection vulnerability. Fail if only intended commands are executed, indicating path sanitization or server-side protection. (Note: success here means vulnerability is found, so "pass" indicates a negative security outcome).

- Vulnerability Name: SSH File Download Path Traversal

    - Description:
    When downloading files or folders from an SSH connection, the extension constructs the local file path by concatenating the user-selected download directory with the remote file/folder name. If the remote file/folder name (obtained from the SSH server) is maliciously crafted to include path traversal characters (e.g., "../"), it could allow writing files outside the intended download directory. This vulnerability is also applicable to FTP file download.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Connect to an SSH or FTP server using the extension.
    2. Navigate to a directory in the SSH/FTP file explorer.
    3. On the SSH/FTP server, create a file or folder with a malicious name, for example, "../../../malicious_file.txt".
    4. In the extension, right-click on the directory containing the malicious file/folder and select "Download".
    5. Choose a download location on your local machine.
    6. The extension will attempt to download all files and folders, including the maliciously named one. Due to lack of sanitization, the file might be written to an unexpected location outside of the intended download directory, potentially overwriting system files or sensitive data.

    - Impact:
    Path traversal vulnerability could allow an attacker who controls filenames on the SSH/FTP server to write files to arbitrary locations on the user's local file system when the user attempts to download files using the extension. This can lead to local file overwrite, potentially including sensitive system files, or placing executable files in startup directories for persistence.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No input sanitization or validation is performed on the remote file/folder names before constructing the local download path for both SSH and FTP file downloads.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    The extension should sanitize or validate the remote file/folder names before using them to construct local file paths during download operations. Specifically, it should:
        - Remove or replace path traversal characters (e.g., "..", ".").
        - Validate that the constructed path remains within the intended download directory.
        - Consider using a safer path joining mechanism that prevents traversal.

    - Preconditions:
    1. Attacker needs to have the ability to create files or folders with arbitrary names on the SSH/FTP server that the user connects to.
    2. User must attempt to download a directory or file from the SSH/FTP server that contains a maliciously named file or folder.
    3. User must select a local download directory.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts`, `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`, `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpFileNode.ts`, `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpConnectionNode.ts`
    2. Analyze `downloadByPath` function in `FileNode.ts` and `SSHConnectionNode.ts` for SSH, and `download` function in `FTPFileNode.ts` and `FTPConnectionNode.ts` (indirectly via folder download) for FTP.
    3. In `FileNode.ts`:
       ```typescript
       public async downloadByPath(path: string) {
           const targetPath = path + "/" + this.file.filename;
           const content = await this.getContent();
           await FileManager.record(targetPath, content, FileModel.WRITE);
           vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`${this.file.filename} download success, save in ${targetPath}`)
       }
       ```
    4. In `SSHConnectionNode.ts`:
       ```typescript
       public async downloadByPath(path: string) {
           const childs = await this.getChildren()
           for (const child of childs) {
               const childPath = path + "/" + child.label;
               if (child instanceof FileNode) {
                   child.downloadByPath(childPath)
               } else if (child instanceof SSHConnectionNode) {
                   if (!existsSync(childPath)) {
                       mkdirSync(childPath)
                   }
                   child.downloadByPath(childPath)
               }
           }
       }
       ```
    5. In `FTPFileNode.ts`:
       ```typescript
       download(): any {
           vscode.window.showSaveDialog({ defaultUri: vscode.Uri.file(this.file.name), filters: { "Type": [extName] }, saveLabel: "Select Download Path" })
               .then(async uri => {
                   if (uri) {
                       const client = await this.getClient()
                       // ...
                       const outStream = createWriteStream(uri.fsPath); // uri.fsPath is user selected download location
                       fileReadStream.pipe(str).pipe(outStream);
                       // ...
                   }
               })
       }
       ```
    6. In `FTPConnectionNode.ts`, folder download logic iterates children and calls `download` on `FTPFileNode` instances and recursively calls `FTPConnectionNode` for subfolders. The local path is constructed in `FTPFileNode.download` using `uri.fsPath` and filename from remote.
    7. In all cases, `targetPath` or `childPath` is constructed by directly concatenating user-provided `path` and `this.file.filename`/`child.label` (for SSH) or using `uri.fsPath` directly with remote filename (for FTP) without sanitization. This leads to path traversal vulnerability.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        a. Set up a test SSH or FTP server.
        b. Create a directory on the SSH/FTP server, e.g., `/home/test_user/test_dir` or `/ftp_root/test_dir`.
        c. Inside `/home/test_user/test_dir` or `/ftp_root/test_dir`, create a file named `../../../malicious_file.txt` (or a folder).
        d. Install the Database Client extension in VSCode and configure an SSH/FTP connection to the test server.
    2. **Test Steps:**
        a. In VSCode, connect to the test SSH/FTP server using the Database Client extension.
        b. Navigate to the `/home/test_user/test_dir` or `/ftp_root/test_dir` directory in the SSH/FTP file explorer.
        c. Right-click on the `/home/test_user/test_dir` or `/ftp_root/test_dir` directory and select "Download".
        d. Choose your home directory or any safe directory as the download location on your local machine.
        e. After the download completes, check your local file system.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        A file named `malicious_file.txt` should be created outside the directory you selected for download, indicating path traversal.
    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        The test case passes if the file `malicious_file.txt` is created outside the intended download directory, demonstrating the path traversal vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Import Services

    - Description:
    The import services for MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL in the Database Client extension are vulnerable to command injection. These services use the `child_process.exec` function to execute command-line import utilities (`mongoimport`, `mysql`, `psql`). The file path provided by the user for import is directly incorporated into the command string without sufficient sanitization. A malicious user could craft a file path that, when processed by the extension, would inject and execute arbitrary shell commands on the user's system.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. In VSCode, open the Database Client extension.
    2. Connect to a MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL database.
    3. Initiate an import operation for the connected database type.
    4. In the file selection dialog, instead of selecting a legitimate SQL or JSON import file, enter a malicious file path designed to inject commands. For example, for Linux/macOS, a path like `/tmp/test.sql & touch /tmp/pwned` or for Windows, `C:\import.sql & calc.exe`.  A more realistic scenario would involve chaining commands like `; rm -rf /tmp/important_files;` on Linux/macOS or `& del C:\important_files /f /q &` on Windows.
    5. Execute the import operation.
    6. The `exec` command will be executed with the malicious file path. If the path is crafted correctly, arbitrary commands will be executed.

    - Impact:
    Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to:
        - Data exfiltration: Sensitive files can be read and sent to a remote server.
        - Malware installation: Malicious software can be downloaded and executed on the user's system.
        - System compromise: The attacker can gain full control over the user's machine.
        - Data deletion or modification: Important files can be deleted or altered.

    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No input sanitization or validation is performed on the `importPath` before it is used in the `exec` commands within `mongoImportService.ts`, `mysqlImportService.ts`, and `postgresqlImortService.ts`.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    The extension must sanitize the `importPath` to prevent command injection. Mitigations should include:
        - Validating the `importPath`: Ensure the path is a valid file path and does not contain any characters that could be used for command injection (e.g., semicolons, ampersands, backticks, pipes).
        - Using parameterized commands or safer APIs: Instead of constructing shell commands using string concatenation, use parameterized command execution if the command-line tools support it, or utilize safer APIs that prevent command injection. However, command-line tools like `mysql`, `psql`, and `mongoimport` might not directly support parameterized commands in the way database drivers do for SQL queries. In this case, robust path validation and sanitization are crucial.
        - Consider using shell-escape functions: If direct sanitization is complex, consider using shell-escape functions provided by libraries to escape the file path before passing it to `exec`. However, proper validation is still preferred.
        - Principle of least privilege: While not a direct mitigation for command injection, running the extension with the least necessary privileges can limit the impact of a successful attack.

    - Preconditions:
    1. User must initiate an import operation for MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL databases within the Database Client extension.
    2. User must provide a malicious file path during the import file selection step.
    3. The system must have the respective command-line tools (`mongoimport`, `mysql`, `psql`) installed and accessible in the system's PATH environment variable.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/import/mongoImportService.ts`, `/code/src/service/import/mysqlImportService.ts`, `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`
    2. Analyze the `importSql` functions in these files.
    3. In `mongoImportService.ts`:
       ```typescript
       exec(command, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... })
       ```
       where `command` is constructed as:
       ```typescript
       const command = `mongoimport -h ${host}:${port} --db ${node.database} --jsonArray -c identitycounters --type json ${importPath}`
       ```
       `importPath` is directly appended to the command string.
    4. In `mysqlImportService.ts`:
       ```typescript
       exec(command, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... })
       ```
       where `command` is constructed as:
       ```typescript
       const command = `mysql -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} ${node.password ? `-p${node.password}` : ""} ${node.schema || ""} < ${importPath}`
       ```
       `importPath` is used with redirection `<` and directly appended to the command string.
    5. In `postgresqlImortService.ts` (File: `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`):
       ```typescript
       exec(`${prefix} "PGPASSWORD=${node.password}" && ${command}`, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... })
       ```
       where `command` is constructed as:
       ```typescript
       const command = `psql -h ${host} -p ${port} -U ${node.user} -d ${node.database} < ${importPath}`
       ```
       `importPath` is used with redirection `<` and directly appended to the command string.
    6. In all three files, the `importPath`, which is derived from user input through file selection dialog, is incorporated into the command string passed to `exec` without any sanitization or validation to prevent command injection.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        a. Install the Database Client extension in VSCode.
        b. Ensure that `mongoimport`, `mysql`, and `psql` command-line tools are installed and in your system's PATH (depending on which database type you want to test).
        c. Have a running instance of MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL server for testing.
    2. **Test Steps (Example for PostgreSQL, repeat for others):**
        a. Connect to a PostgreSQL database using the Database Client extension.
        b. Right-click on the database and select "Import SQL File".
        c. In the file selection dialog, instead of choosing a file, in the file name input, type: `test.sql & touch /tmp/pwned_psql_import` (for Linux/macOS) or `test.sql & echo pwned > C:\pwned_psql_import.txt` (for Windows). Note: `test.sql` is a dummy file name, the important part is the injected command after `&`.
        d. Click "Open" or proceed with the import.
        e. After the import operation attempts to run (it might fail to import SQL, but the command injection is what we are testing), check if the injected command was executed. For Linux/macOS, check if a file named `pwned_psql_import` exists in the `/tmp` directory. For Windows, check if `C:\pwned_psql_import.txt` file was created and contains "pwned".
    3. **Expected Result:**
        The injected command (`touch /tmp/pwned_psql_import` or `echo pwned > C:\pwned_psql_import.txt`) should be executed on the system, indicating successful command injection. The file `/tmp/pwned_psql_import` or `C:\pwned_psql_import.txt` should be created.
    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        The test case passes if the injected command is executed, demonstrating the command injection vulnerability in the import service.

- Vulnerability Name: Redis Key/Folder Delete Operations Missing Sanitization

    - Description:
    The `RedisFolderNode.delete()` and `KeyNode.delete()` functions in `/code/src/model/redis/folderNode.ts` and `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts` do not perform sufficient sanitization or validation of the `label` (key/folder name) before using it in Redis `DEL` command. If the `label` is maliciously crafted, it might be possible to inject Redis commands or delete unintended keys. Although Redis `DEL` command arguments are generally treated as keys and not commands themselves, unexpected characters or patterns in the key names could still lead to unintended behavior depending on how keys are managed and displayed in the UI.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Connect to a Redis database using the extension.
    2. Create a Redis key or folder with a malicious name. For example, a key named `"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n *"` or a folder with a similar name.
    3. Attempt to delete this maliciously named key or folder using the extension's UI (e.g., right-click and select "Delete").
    4. Observe the Redis server's behavior. Depending on how the Redis client and server handle the crafted key name, it might be possible to inject commands or cause unintended deletions beyond the targeted key/folder.

    - Impact:
    While direct command injection into the `DEL` command itself is unlikely in standard Redis usage, a maliciously crafted key name could potentially lead to unintended data loss. In a worst-case scenario, depending on Redis server configuration and how the extension handles key names, it might be possible to flush all databases if a key name like `"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n *"` is processed without proper sanitization and somehow interpreted by the server in an unexpected way. This is highly dependent on Redis server version and configuration and is less likely to be a direct command injection but more of an abuse of key naming combined with potential parsing issues.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No sanitization or validation is performed on the `this.label` value in `RedisFolderNode.delete()` and `KeyNode.delete()` before it's used in the `client.del()` command.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    The extension should sanitize or validate the key/folder names (`this.label`) before using them in Redis commands, especially in delete operations. While direct command injection is less likely in `DEL`, sanitization is still a good practice to prevent unexpected behavior from unusual key names.  Consider validating the `label` to ensure it only contains allowed characters for Redis keys, or escaping special characters if necessary. However, for `DEL` command, simple validation to prevent control characters like `\r\n` might be sufficient to prevent any unexpected parsing issues.

    - Preconditions:
    1. Attacker needs to be able to create Redis keys or folders with arbitrary names, including potentially malicious names.
    2. User (or attacker) needs to attempt to delete a maliciously named key or folder using the extension's delete functionality.
    3. The Redis server's behavior when handling unusual key names in `DEL` command might contribute to the vulnerability's exploitability (though standard `DEL` is designed to be safe against command injection).

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/redis/folderNode.ts` and `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts`
    2. Analyze `delete()` functions in both files.
    3. In `RedisFolderNode.ts`:
       ```typescript
       public async delete() {
           Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete folder ${this.label} ? `, async () => {
               const client = await this.getClient();
               for (const child of this.childens) {
                   await client.del(child)  // <--- this.childens contains keys derived from labels, not sanitized
               }
               this.provider.reload()
           })
       }
       ```
    4. In `KeyNode.ts`:
       ```typescript
       public async delete() {
           Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete key ${this.label} ? `, async () => {
               const client = await this.getClient();
               await client.del(this.label) // <--- this.label is directly used as key, not sanitized
               this.provider.reload()
           })
       }
       ```
    5. In both cases, `this.label` (and `this.childens` which are derived from labels) are directly used as arguments to `client.del()` without any sanitization. If a malicious user can create a key or folder with a specially crafted name, this name will be directly passed to the `DEL` command.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        a. Set up a test Redis server.
        b. Connect to the Redis server using the Database Client extension.
        c. Create a Redis key with a malicious name, e.g., `"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n test_key"`. You might need to use redis-cli or another tool to create such a key directly, as the extension UI might prevent creating keys with such names.
        d. In the extension, navigate to the Redis key list and locate the maliciously named key.
    2. **Test Steps:**
        a. Right-click on the maliciously named key (`"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n test_key"`) and select "Delete".
        b. Confirm the deletion in the confirmation dialog.
        c. After the operation, check the Redis server to see if unintended actions occurred, such as flushing all databases (which would be a severe outcome, indicating command injection). In a less severe scenario, check if the intended key and *only* the intended key is deleted.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        Ideally, only the key `"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n test_key"` should be deleted, and no other Redis operations should be performed. If `FLUSHALL` or other unintended commands are executed, it indicates a vulnerability. Even if `FLUSHALL` is not executed, if the deletion fails or causes errors due to the unusual key name, it still highlights a lack of robustness in handling key names.
    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        The test case passes if unintended Redis commands are executed (like `FLUSHALL`), or if the deletion operation fails or causes errors due to the malicious key name, indicating a vulnerability in key name handling. Fail if only the intended key is deleted without any side effects or errors, suggesting safe handling of unusual key names in `DEL` operation (or that Redis `DEL` inherently prevents such injection). (Note: "pass" here means vulnerability is found).

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in External Process Execution

    - Description:
    The extension uses functions to spawn or execute external processes (for example, when starting an SSH tunnel or launching a terminal) by constructing shell command strings with user‑controlled configuration values (such as host, port, username, private‑key path, etc.) without proper sanitization. An attacker able to supply or alter these values (for instance by modifying a malicious workspace file or extension configuration) may include shell metacharacters and inject extra commands.

    - Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the host system
    - Full system compromise, data exfiltration, and lateral movement

    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The code uses Node’s `child_process` APIs in argument‑array mode in some branches but does not consistently validate or escape all user‑supplied values

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Validate and escape all configuration inputs before interpolating them into command strings
    - Where possible, use APIs that separate command names from arguments

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must have the ability to supply or modify connection configuration values (for example, via a malicious workspace file)
    - The vulnerable functionality (e.g. launching an SSH tunnel/terminal) must be invoked

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In files such as `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`, command strings are built by directly embedding configuration values—for example:
      ```js
      if (this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath) {
        exec(`cmd /c start ssh -i ${this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath} -qTnN -D 127.0.0.1:1080 root@${this.sshConfig.host}`)
      } else {
        exec(`cmd /c start ssh -qTnN -D 127.0.0.1:1080 root@${this.sshConfig.host}`)
      }
      ```
      Both the private key path and the host are inserted without proper sanitization.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Modify a connection configuration (for example, set the `sshConfig.host` to
       ```
       example.com && echo hacked > /tmp/hacked.txt
       ```
       ).
    2. Trigger the vulnerable functionality (e.g. start the SOCKS proxy or open a terminal from the extension).
    3. Monitor the host system for evidence (such as checking for a created file `/tmp/hacked.txt`).
    4. After applying input validation and safer API usage, confirm that command injection is no longer possible.

- Vulnerability Name: Directory Traversal in Local File Management Operations

    - Description:
    The file‑management routine (specifically in the `FileManager.record()` function) concatenates a user‑supplied file name with a fixed storage path after applying only minimal regex stripping (which removes a few forbidden special characters) but does not remove directory traversal sequences (such as `../`). An attacker controlling the file name (e.g. via a “new file” command) could supply a name like `"../../evil.txt"` to write files outside the intended directory.

    - Impact:
    - Unauthorized file creation, modification or overwrite outside the designated storage directory
    - Potential privilege escalation or further exploitation on the host

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - A regular expression is used to strip characters like `: * ? " < >`

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Normalize and validate the final file path (using Node’s `path.normalize`) and ensure it remains within the allowed storage directory

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to supply an arbitrary file name via the file management UI

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/common/filesManager.ts`, the file name is sanitized only by removing some special characters and then concatenated to the storage path:
      ```js
      fileName = fileName.replace(/[\:\*\?"\<\>]*/g,"")
      const recordPath = `${this.storagePath}/${fileName}`;
      ```
      This process does not remove directory traversal sequences like `"../"`.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Trigger the “new file” command in the file management view
    2. Enter a file name such as `"../../malicious.txt"`
    3. Verify on disk that `malicious.txt` is not created outside of the designated storage directory
    4. After applying proper path normalization, re-run the test to confirm that traversal input is blocked

- Vulnerability Name: Remote Directory Traversal in SFTP Operations

    - Description:
    In SSH‑based file management (for example, when creating new files on a remote server), the extension builds remote file paths by concatenating a base path with user-provided file names without restraining directory traversal characters. An attacker controlling the file name can use traversal sequences (e.g. `"../"`) to access or modify files outside the designated folder on the remote SSH server.

    - Impact:
    - Creation, modification, or deletion of arbitrary files on the remote server
    - Potential unauthorized access to sensitive system files or data

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No proper sanitization or normalization is applied to user‑supplied remote file names

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Normalize remote file paths and strictly reject names that contain traversal patterns

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to supply file or folder names (for example, via the “new file” command in the remote file management view) and trigger the SSH file operation

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`, methods like `newFile()` concatenate unsanitized input (obtained via `vscode.window.showInputBox()`) with a base remote path, forming a path vulnerable to traversal

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Use the SSH file management UI to create a new file
    2. Enter an input such as `"../../malicious.txt"`
    3. Verify on the remote host whether the file is erroneously created outside the intended directory
    4. After path sanitization is implemented, repeat the test to confirm that traversal input is rejected

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Eval in MongoConnection Query Handling

    - Description:
    Within the MongoDB connection implementation, the `query()` method (in `/code/src/service/connect/mongoConnection.ts`) concatenates `"this.client."` with a user‑supplied query string and then passes the resulting string to the JavaScript `eval()` function. Because the query text is not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker able to supply arbitrary query text may inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed within the extension’s context.

    - Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension context
    - Possible full system compromise, data theft, or unauthorized database manipulation

    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No input validation or safeguards are applied around the use of `eval()`

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Remove the use of `eval()` entirely and replace it with safe, parameterized logic
    - Enforce a strict whitelist of allowed query commands

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to supply query text via the extension’s query field (or by manipulating workspace configuration)

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/service/connect/mongoConnection.ts`, when the query is not a simple “show dbs”, the code performs:
      ```js
      const result = await eval('this.client.' + sql)
      ```
      This direct concatenation without sanitization enables injection of arbitrary code.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Connect to a MongoDB instance via the extension and in the query input, supply a malicious payload (for example:
       ```
       constructor('fs.writeFileSync("/tmp/hacked.txt", "hacked")')()
       ```
       )
    2. Execute the query and verify that the injected code executes (for example, by checking for the presence of `/tmp/hacked.txt`)
    3. After replacing `eval()` with a safe alternative, repeat the test to ensure no code execution occurs

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Unvalidated Input in Forward Service Exec Command

    - Description:
    The SSH forwarding service (in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/forwardService.ts`) listens for a `"cmd"` event and directly interpolates the associated user‑supplied payload into a shell command which is executed by calling `exec()`. Because the payload is not sanitized, an attacker can embed additional commands using shell metacharacters, thereby executing arbitrary commands via the forwarding service.

    - Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the host system
    - Full system compromise with subsequent data exfiltration and remote code execution

    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No validation or escaping is applied to the payload received from the webview event

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Validate and escape all input from the forwarding service before including it in the command
    - Consider restricting or removing the functionality that allows sending arbitrary commands

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to trigger the `"cmd"` event (for example, through the forwarding service UI) and supply malicious input

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/forwardService.ts`, the code includes:
      ```js
      }).on("cmd", (content) => {
          exec(`cmd.exe /C start cmd /C ${content}`)
      })
      ```
      Here, the unsanitized `content` is directly passed to `exec()`, allowing injection (for example, a payload like `echo hacked && notepad.exe`).

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Use the forwarding service UI to trigger the `"cmd"` event
    2. Supply a payload such as:
       ```
       echo hacked && notepad.exe
       ```
    3. Verify that the malicious command is executed (for example, Notepad is launched)
    4. After applying input validation, re-test to ensure that injection is blocked

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Unsanitized mysqldump Command in MySQL Dump Service

    - Description:
    In the MySQL dump service (in `/code/src/service/dump/mysqlDumpService.ts`), the shell command to invoke the `mysqldump` utility is built by concatenating various connection parameters (host, port, user, password, schema, table list, etc.) directly into the command string without proper escaping. An attacker able to tamper with these configuration parameters may inject additional shell commands.

    - Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the host machine
    - Full system compromise and potential data exfiltration

    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No sanitization or escaping is applied when constructing the mysqldump command

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Sanitize and escape all arguments prior to insertion into the shell command
    - Use APIs that separate command and arguments rather than concatenating strings

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to supply or modify database connection parameters via a malicious configuration

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/service/dump/mysqlDumpService.ts`, the mysqldump command is built as:
      ```js
      const command = `mysqldump -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} -p${node.password}${data} --skip-add-locks ${node.schema} ${tables}>${folderPath.fsPath}`
      ```
      Unsanitized parameters allow shell metacharacter injection.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Modify a MySQL connection configuration (for example, set the password to
       ```
       secret&&echo hacked > C:\temp\hacked.txt
       ```
       )
    2. Trigger the MySQL dump process via the extension
    3. Verify on the host that the injected command is executed, for instance by checking for the file `C:\temp\hacked.txt`
    4. After mitigating by escaping inputs, re-run the test to confirm injection is prevented

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in Database CLI Terminal Launcher

    - Description:
    The extension’s routine for launching database CLI tools (in `/code/src/model/interface/node.ts`) constructs shell commands for various database tools (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) by directly concatenating connection parameters (such as username, password, host, port, etc.). If any field contains shell metacharacters, an attacker may inject additional commands that execute when the terminal starts.

    - Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution through the spawned CLI terminal
    - Potential full system compromise, data exfiltration, and unauthorized modifications

    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No sanitization or argument separation is applied when constructing the CLI command

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Validate and escape all connection parameters before constructing the command
    - Use safer methods (for example, argument arrays or parameterized API calls) to launch the terminal

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to influence connection configuration values (for example, via a malicious workspace file) and trigger the terminal launch functionality

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/model/interface/node.ts`, commands such as:
      ```js
      command = `mysql -u ${this.user} -p${this.password} -h ${this.host} -P ${this.port} \n`;
      ```
      are constructed without sanitization.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Craft a connection configuration (e.g. for a MySQL connection) with a malicious password like:
       ```
       pass; echo "injected" > /tmp/injected.txt
       ```
    2. Invoke the “open terminal” functionality for that connection
    3. Check that the injected command is executed (for example, verify whether `/tmp/injected.txt` is created)
    4. After applying input sanitization and secure command construction, re-run the test to ensure injection is no longer possible

- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in User Management Operations

    - Description:
    The `drop()` method in the user management routine (in `/code/src/model/database/userNode.ts`) constructs an SQL command by directly concatenating the username into a DROP USER statement without any sanitization. An attacker controlling the username (for example, by creating a user with a crafted name) could inject additional SQL commands.

    - Impact:
    - Arbitrary SQL command execution using the extension’s database connection privileges
    - Potential deletion of critical data or unauthorized modifications in the target database

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No input sanitization or parameterization is applied to the username in the SQL command

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Use parameterized queries or proper escaping/quoting of the username when building the SQL statement

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to control or influence database usernames (for example, by creating a user account with a malicious name) and trigger the “drop” operation via the extension’s interface

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/model/database/userNode.ts`, the drop method is implemented as:
      ```js
      public drop() {
        Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to drop user ${this.username} ?`, async () => {
            this.execute(`DROP user ${this.username}`)
            // additional processing…
        })
      }
      ```
      The direct concatenation of `this.username` without sanitization enables SQL injection (for example, a username such as `admin; DROP DATABASE important` would inject an extra command).

    - Security Test Case:
    1. In your database, create a user with a malicious name like:
       ```
       admin; DROP DATABASE important
       ```
    2. In the extension, navigate to the user management view and trigger the “drop” operation for that user
    3. Observe that the resulting SQL becomes:
       ```
       DROP user admin; DROP DATABASE important
       ```
       causing the injected command to execute
    4. After implementing proper sanitization or using parameterized queries, re-run the test to verify that injection is blocked

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in Database Import Services

    - Description:
    The import functionalities for MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are implemented by constructing shell command strings using unsanitized and unescaped configuration values. In the following files:
    - In `/code/src/service/import/mongoImportService.ts`, the command is constructed as:
      ```js
      const command = `mongoimport -h ${host}:${port} --db ${node.database} --jsonArray -c identitycounters --type json ${importPath}`
      ```
    - In `/code/src/service/import/mysqlImportService.ts`, the command is built as:
      ```js
      const command = `mysql -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} ${node.password ? `-p${node.password}` : ""} ${node.schema || ""} < ${importPath}`
      ```
    - In `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`, the command is built as:
      ```js
      const command = `psql -h ${host} -p ${port} -U ${node.user} -d ${node.database} < ${importPath}`
      ```
    In each case, parameters such as host, port, database name, user, password, and file path are directly inserted into the command string without any sanitization or escaping. As a result, an attacker who can supply or modify these configuration fields (for instance, via a malicious workspace file or configuration injection) could inject additional shell commands.

    - Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the host system, leading to full system compromise
    - Data exfiltration and unauthorized system modifications

    - Vulnerability Rank: Critical

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No mitigations are applied in the import service modules; the commands are constructed using template literals without input validation or escaping

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Validate and properly escape all configuration inputs before constructing shell commands
    - Use safe APIs (such as providing command arguments as an array) to avoid shell interpretation

    - Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to supply or modify the database connection settings (e.g. host, port, database, user, password, and file path) via a malicious configuration or workspace file
    - The import functionality must be triggered via the extension’s UI

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In **MongoImportService:**
      The command string is built by directly interpolating unsanitized values:
      ```js
      const command = `mongoimport -h ${host}:${port} --db ${node.database} --jsonArray -c identitycounters --type json ${importPath}`
      ```
    - In **MysqlImportService:**
      The command string is constructed without escaping:
      ```js
      const command = `mysql -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} ${node.password ? `-p${node.password}` : ""} ${node.schema || ""} < ${importPath}`
      ```
    - In **PostgresqlImortService:**
      Similarly, the command is built as:
      ```js
      const command = `psql -h ${host} -p ${port} -U ${node.user} -d ${node.database} < ${importPath}`
      ```
    In every case, this unsanitized concatenation permits an attacker to inject additional shell commands.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Configure a database connection (for example, for MongoDB) and set one of the parameters—such as the database name—to a malicious payload:
       ```
       testdb; echo "hacked" > /tmp/hacked.txt
       ```
    2. Save this configuration in the workspace settings and trigger the import operation via the extension’s UI
    3. Verify on the host system whether the injected command executes (for example, check if the file `/tmp/hacked.txt` is created with the expected content)
    4. After implementing proper validation and safe command construction, re-run the test to confirm that injection is prevented

- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in MySQL Data Dump Utility

    - Description:
    The data dump functionality for MySQL (implemented in `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getDataDump.ts`) builds SQL queries by directly concatenating a table name and an optional WHERE clause from user‑supplied dump options without proper sanitization. An attacker able to modify the dump configuration (for example, via a malicious workspace file) may supply a malicious table name or WHERE clause that injects arbitrary SQL commands into the SELECT statement.

    - Impact:
    - Execution of unintended SQL queries on the target database
    - Possible data leakage, unauthorized data modification, or deletion

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No input sanitization or parameterization is applied in the construction of the SQL query

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Validate and escape table names and WHERE clause inputs before constructing the query
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to safely incorporate user‑supplied values

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to supply or modify the dump configuration (specifically, the list of tables and the associated WHERE conditions) via a malicious workspace file or configuration injection
    - The dump operation must be triggered through the extension’s UI

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getDataDump.ts`, the code constructs the query as follows:
      ```js
      const where = options.where[table] ? ` WHERE ${options.where[table]}` : '';
      const query = connection.query(`SELECT * FROM ${table}${where}`) as EventEmitter;
      ```
      Both the `table` variable and the WHERE clause from `options.where[table]` are interpolated directly into the SQL string without sanitization.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Modify the dump configuration to supply a malicious table name (e.g.,
       ```
       users; DROP TABLE sensitive_data;--
       ```
       ) or a WHERE clause (e.g.,
       ```
       1=1; DROP TABLE valuable;--
       ```
       ).
    2. Trigger the dump operation via the extension’s UI.
    3. Observe whether the injected SQL commands are executed against the database (for instance, by checking if the target table is dropped).
    4. After applying input validation and parameterized query mechanisms, re-run the test to confirm that SQL injection is prevented.

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Write via Unvalidated Dump File Path in MySQL Dump Process

    - Description:
    In the MySQL dump process (implemented in `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/main.ts`), the dump file path is provided by the user via the `dumpToFile` configuration option and is subsequently used directly in file system write operations (using `fs.writeFileSync` and `fs.appendFileSync`) without any sanitization or validation. An attacker who controls this configuration value can specify an arbitrary file path, potentially overwriting critical files on the host system.

    - Impact:
    - Overwriting or corrupting critical system or user files
    - Potential arbitrary code execution if system-critical files are replaced
    - Compromise of system integrity and confidentiality

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No validation or sanitization is performed on the `dumpToFile` file path

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Validate and restrict the file path to a safe, pre‑defined directory
    - Use proper path normalization (e.g., via `path.normalize`) and verify that the resolved path resides within an allowed directory
    - Optionally, prompt the user for confirmation if a non‑standard or potentially dangerous path is provided

    - Preconditions:
    - Attacker must be able to supply or modify the `dumpToFile` configuration (for example, via a malicious workspace file or configuration injection)
    - The dump functionality must be triggered via the extension’s UI

    - Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/main.ts`, the relevant code is:
      ```js
      // Clear the destination file
      fs.writeFileSync(options.dumpToFile, '');
      // Append headers and subsequent dump data
      fs.appendFileSync(options.dumpToFile, `${HEADER_VARIABLES}\n`);
      ```
      The file path provided in `options.dumpToFile` is consumed directly without any path validation.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Modify the extension’s configuration to set `dumpToFile` to an arbitrary, sensitive file path (e.g., on Windows:
       ```
       C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
       ```
       or on Unix:
       ```
       /etc/passwd
       ```
       ).
    2. Initiate the MySQL dump operation via the extension’s UI.
    3. Verify that the file at the specified location is created or overwritten with the dump data.
    4. After implementing proper file path validation and restrictions, re-run the test to confirm that only allowed file paths are accepted and arbitrary file writes are blocked.

- Vulnerability Name: FTP Parser Command Injection in Filenames

    - Description:
    1. The extension uses the `Parser.parseListEntry` function in `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/parser.js` to parse the response of FTP LIST commands.
    2. This function uses regular expressions to extract information like file type, permissions, size, timestamp, and filename from the FTP server's response string.
    3. If a malicious FTP server crafts a response where the filename part contains command injection payload, the regular expression parsing might not sanitize it properly.
    4. When the extension processes and displays this filename (e.g., in the Database Explorer), it could potentially execute the injected commands on the user's machine.
    5. This is because the extension might use the parsed filename in a way that could lead to command execution, for example, if the filename is used in shell commands or passed to functions that interpret them as commands.

    - Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
    - If successfully exploited, an attacker could gain full control over the user's VSCode environment and potentially the entire system.
    - This could lead to data theft, malware installation, or further attacks on internal networks accessible from the user's machine.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code focuses on parsing FTP listing formats but does not seem to include any sanitization or validation of filenames to prevent command injection.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and validation of filenames parsed from FTP LIST responses in `Parser.parseListEntry` function.
    - Ensure that filenames are treated as data and not executed as commands in any part of the extension's functionality, especially when displaying or interacting with file lists.
    - Consider using safer methods for handling filenames, such as encoding or escaping special characters that could be interpreted as commands.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must connect to a malicious FTP server.
    - The malicious FTP server must be able to manipulate the LIST response to include command injection payloads in filenames.
    - The user's VSCode environment must process and display the file list from the malicious FTP server.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/parser.js`
       ```javascript
       Parser.parseListEntry = function(line) {
         var ret, info;
         if (ret = XRegExp.exec(line, REX_LISTUNIX)) {
           info = { name: ret.name, ... };
           ...
           if (ret.type === 'l') {
             var pos = ret.name.indexOf(' -> ');
             info.name = ret.name.substring(0, pos);
             info.target = ret.name.substring(pos+4);
           } else
             info.name = ret.name;
           ret = info;
         } else if (ret = XRegExp.exec(line, REX_LISTMSDOS)) {
           info = { name: ret.name, ... };
           ...
           ret = info;
         } else if (!RE_ENTRY_TOTAL.test(line))
           ret = line;
         return ret;
       };
       ```
    - The code uses `XRegExp.exec` to parse the LIST response and extracts the filename into `ret.name`.
    - The `ret.name` is then directly assigned to `info.name` without any sanitization.
    - If a malicious FTP server returns a LIST response with a filename like `"$(malicious command)"` or similar command injection syntax, this payload will be parsed and stored in `info.name`.
    - If this `info.name` is later used in a context where commands can be executed, it leads to command injection.
    2. File: `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/connection.js`
       ```javascript
       FTP.prototype.list = function(path, zcomp, cb) {
           ...
           source.on('data', function(chunk) {
              buffer += chunk.toString(self.options.encoding);
             });
           ...
           entries = buffer.split(RE_EOL);
           entries.pop();
           var parsed = [];
           for (var i = 0, len = entries.length; i < len; ++i) {
             var parsedVal = Parser.parseListEntry(entries[i]);
             if (parsedVal !== null)
               parsed.push(parsedVal);
           }
           ...
           cb(undefined, parsed);
       };
       ```
    - This function retrieves the FTP listing and uses `Parser.parseListEntry` to process each entry.
    - The resulting `parsed` array, which contains objects with potentially malicious filenames in the `name` property, is passed to the callback function.
    - If the callback or subsequent functions in the extension handle these filenames unsafely, command injection can occur.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a malicious FTP server that, upon a LIST request, responds with an entry containing a command injection payload in the filename. For example, the response line could be: `-rw-r--r--   1 user  group        1024 Jan 01 00:00 $(touch /tmp/pwned)` or `drwxr-xr-x   2 user  group        4096 Jan 01 00:00 $(calc)`.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this malicious FTP server.
    3. In the Database Explorer, attempt to browse the files or directories on the FTP server, which will trigger a LIST command.
    4. Observe if the command injection payload in the filename is executed on the client machine. For example, in the first case, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created. In the second case, check if the calculator application starts.
    5. If the command is executed, it confirms the command injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: SSH Tunnel Port Forwarding to Arbitrary Host

    - Description:
    1. The extension allows users to create SSH tunnels for database connections using the code in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js`.
    2. The tunnel configuration, including the destination host (`dstHost`), is taken from user input or configuration settings, processed by `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js` and UI in `/code/src/vue/forward.js`.
    3. If the `dstHost` parameter is not properly validated, an attacker who can influence the configuration (e.g., through compromised settings or a crafted workspace configuration) could set up an SSH tunnel forwarding local ports to arbitrary hosts on the internet or within internal networks accessible by the SSH server.
    4. This could be exploited to bypass firewalls, perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, or pivot to internal networks.

    - Impact:
    - Network pivoting: An attacker could use the user's VSCode extension as a pivot point to access internal network resources that are reachable from the SSH server but not directly from the attacker's machine.
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): An attacker could make requests to internal or external services via the user's VSCode extension, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or triggering unintended actions.
    - Firewall bypass: By tunneling traffic through the user's SSH connection, an attacker might be able to bypass firewall rules that would normally prevent direct access to certain hosts or ports.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The configuration parsing in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js` only checks for the existence of `host` and `dstPort` but does not validate the `dstHost` value against a whitelist or perform any other form of sanitization.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement validation for the `dstHost` parameter in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js` or in the UI input handling in `/code/src/vue/forward.js`.
    - Restrict allowed destination hosts to a predefined list or use a more secure method to determine valid destinations, avoiding arbitrary host forwarding.
    - Consider informing users about the security implications of SSH tunneling and the risks of forwarding ports to untrusted destinations.

    - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the SSH tunnel configuration used by the extension. This could be through:
        - Social engineering to convince a user to set up a malicious tunnel configuration.
        - Exploiting another vulnerability to modify the extension's settings or workspace configuration.
        - Supply a crafted workspace configuration that includes a malicious SSH tunnel setup.
    - The user must have an SSH connection configured and be willing to establish an SSH tunnel.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js`
       ```javascript
       function createConfig(config) {
           ...
           defaults(config || {}, {
               ...
               dstHost: '127.0.0.1',
               ...
           });

           if (!config.host) {
               throw new ConfigError('host not set');
           }

           if (!config.dstPort) {
               throw new ConfigError('dstPort not set');
           }

           return config;
       }
       ```
    - The `createConfig` function in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js` sets a default value of `'127.0.0.1'` for `dstHost` but does not perform any validation on the user-provided `config.dstHost`.
    - It only checks if `config.host` and `config.dstPort` are set, but not `dstHost`.
    - This lack of validation allows an attacker to specify any arbitrary hostname or IP address as the `dstHost`.
    2. File: `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js`
       ```javascript
       function bindSSHConnection(config, netConnection) {
           ...
           sshConnection.forwardOut(config.srcHost, config.srcPort, config.dstHost, config.dstPort, function (err, sshStream) { ... });
           ...
       }
       ```
    - The `bindSSHConnection` function directly uses `config.dstHost` and `config.dstPort` in the `sshConnection.forwardOut` call without any further checks or restrictions.
    - This means whatever is set as `dstHost` in the configuration will be used as the destination for port forwarding.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension.
    2. Create a new SSH tunnel configuration.
    3. In the tunnel configuration, set `dstHost` to a public website (e.g., `example.com`) and `dstPort` to `80`. Set `localPort` to an unused port on your local machine (e.g., `9000`).
    4. Start the SSH tunnel.
    5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000`.
    6. If the SSH tunnel is successfully forwarding traffic to `example.com:80`, you should see the content of `example.com` displayed in your browser, accessed through the SSH tunnel.
    7. To further demonstrate the risk, try setting `dstHost` to an internal IP address within a private network that the SSH server can access but your local machine cannot directly. If you can access resources on that internal IP via the tunnel, it confirms the arbitrary host forwarding vulnerability and its potential for network pivoting.

- Vulnerability Name: Elasticsearch Documentation Link URL Injection

    - Description:
    1. The extension uses `DocumentFinder.open(path)` in `/code/src/model/es/provider/documentFinder.ts` to open Elasticsearch documentation links.
    2. The `path` parameter for `DocumentFinder.open` is derived from `ElasticMatch.Path.Text` in `/code/src/model/es/provider/ElasticMatch.ts`, which is extracted from user-provided text (Elasticsearch query).
    3. The `DocumentFinder.open` function constructs a URL by embedding the `path` into a fixed base URL: `https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/${docuemntPath}.html`.
    4. If a malicious user crafts an Elasticsearch query that, when parsed by `ElasticMatch`, results in a `Path.Text` containing a malicious or unexpected value, this value will be used in the URL.
    5. When `vscode.env.openExternal` is called with this constructed URL, it could lead to the user being redirected to an arbitrary external website, potentially a phishing site or a site hosting malware.

    - Impact:
    - Phishing attack: An attacker could redirect users to a fake login page or a page that mimics a legitimate service to steal credentials.
    - Malware distribution: An attacker could redirect users to a website that automatically downloads malware or exploits browser vulnerabilities.
    - Information disclosure: In less likely scenarios, if the injected URL structure interacts with the user's local system in an unintended way through `vscode.env.openExternal`, it might lead to information disclosure (though this is highly dependent on the OS and browser behavior).

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `DocumentFinder.open` function directly uses the parsed path to construct the URL without any validation or sanitization of the `path` parameter.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement validation and sanitization of the `path` parameter in `DocumentFinder.open` before constructing the URL.
    - Whitelist allowed values for `docuemntPath` based on the `documentMap` keys, or use a more robust method to ensure that only valid Elasticsearch documentation paths are used.
    - Consider using `vscode.Uri.parse` with strict validation to prevent injection of malicious URLs.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must use the Elasticsearch feature of the extension and trigger the `mysql.elastic.document` command.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the `Path.Text` extracted by `ElasticMatch` from the Elasticsearch query. This could be achieved by crafting a malicious Elasticsearch query and somehow getting the user to execute the `mysql.elastic.document` command on it (e.g., through social engineering or by exploiting another vulnerability to automatically trigger this command).

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/es/provider/documentFinder.ts`
       ```typescript
       export class DocumentFinder {

           private static documentMap = {
               "_count": "search-count",
               "_search": "search-search",
               "_stats": "indices-stats",
           }

           public static find(path: string) {
               return this.documentMap[url.parse(path).pathname.replace("/", '')]
           }

           public static open(path: string) {

               const docuemntPath = this.find(path)
               if (!docuemntPath) {
                   vscode.window.showErrorMessage("Not doucment found!")
                   return;
               }

               vscode.env.openExternal(vscode.Uri.parse(`https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/${docuemntPath}.html`));


           }
       }
       ```
    - The `DocumentFinder.open` function takes `path` as input.
    - It uses `this.find(path)` to lookup `docuemntPath` from `documentMap`. This part is relatively safe as it's a lookup in a predefined map.
    - However, the original `path` parameter is not validated and is used indirectly via `docuemntPath` in the URL construction: `https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/${docuemntPath}.html`.
    - If `docuemntPath` or the original `path` could be manipulated to include characters like `@` or other URL components, it could lead to redirection to an external domain.
    2. File: `/code/src/model/es/provider/ElasticMatch.ts`
       ```typescript
       export class ElasticMatch {
           ...
           Path: ElasticItem
           ...
           public constructor(headLine: vscode.TextLine, match) {
               ...
               this.Path = { Text: match[2], Range: lrange }
               ...
           }
       }
       ```
    - `ElasticMatch` extracts `Path.Text` from the second capturing group (`match[2]`) of the regex `ElasticMatch.RegexMatch`.
    - The content of `match[2]` is directly taken from the user-provided line in the editor.
    - If a user crafts an Elasticsearch query line like `GET https://malicious.website.com`, and this is parsed by `ElasticMatch` and then `DocumentFinder.open` is called with the extracted path, it could result in opening the malicious website.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new file with language mode set to 'es'.
    2. Add the following line to the file: `GET https://malicious.website.com _search`
    3. Place the cursor on this line.
    4. Execute the command `Elastic Document` (or `mysql.elastic.document`). This command might be bound to a context menu or command palette.
    5. Observe if VSCode opens an external browser window and navigates to `https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/https://malicious.website.com.html`.  While this exact URL might be invalid and fail to load, the attempt to open `https://malicious.website.com` within the base URL context demonstrates the URL injection.
    6. For a more practical test, try a URL that is a valid website, e.g., `GET https://example.com _search`. Observe if `example.com` is opened within the base URL structure.
    7. If the extension attempts to open an external URL based on the injected path, it confirms the URL injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: SSH File Creation Path Traversal

    - Description:
    1. The extension allows users to create new files and folders on a remote SSH server using `SSHConnectionNode.newFile()` and `SSHConnectionNode.newFolder()` in `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`.
    2. When creating a new file or folder, the extension prompts the user for a name via `vscode.window.showInputBox()`.
    3. The user-provided name (input) is then directly concatenated to the current remote directory path (`this.fullPath`) without proper sanitization to form the target path for file/folder creation. For example: `targetPath = this.fullPath + "/" + input;`.
    4. If a malicious user provides an `input` value containing path traversal characters like "../", they can potentially create files or folders outside of the currently browsed directory on the remote SSH server.
    5. This could be exploited to overwrite critical system files, create files in sensitive directories, or bypass intended access restrictions on the remote system.

    - Impact:
    - File system manipulation: An attacker could create or overwrite files and directories at arbitrary locations on the remote SSH server, subject to the permissions of the SSH user.
    - Privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): Overwriting critical system files or creating files in sensitive directories could potentially lead to privilege escalation or system compromise if the attacker can leverage this file system access.
    - Data corruption or loss: Overwriting existing files could lead to data corruption or loss.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly concatenates the user-provided input to the remote path without any validation or sanitization to prevent path traversal.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization of the user-provided filename/folder name in `SSHConnectionNode.newFile()` and `SSHConnectionNode.newFolder()` to prevent path traversal characters (e.g., "../", "..\", absolute paths).
    - Validate the user input to ensure it only contains allowed characters for filenames and does not include any path separators or traversal sequences.
    - Use path joining functions provided by libraries (like `path.posix.join` for POSIX paths) to correctly and safely construct file paths, ensuring that traversal sequences are resolved and prevented.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must have an SSH connection configured and be browsing files on the remote SSH server using the extension's SSH file explorer.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user (or somehow trigger the extension on their behalf) to create a new file or folder and provide a malicious name containing path traversal characters.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`
       ```typescript
       public newFile(): any {
           vscode.window.showInputBox().then(async input => {
               if (input) {
                   const { sftp } = await ClientManager.getSSH(this.sshConfig)
                   const tempPath = await FileManager.record("temp/" + input, "", FileModel.WRITE);
                   const targetPath = this.fullPath + "/" + input; // Vulnerable path concatenation
                   sftp.fastPut(tempPath, targetPath, err => { ... })
               }
           })
       }

       public newFolder(): any {
           vscode.window.showInputBox().then(async input => {
               if (input) {
                   const { sftp } = await ClientManager.getSSH(this.sshConfig)
                   sftp.mkdir(this.fullPath + "/" + input, err => { // Vulnerable path concatenation
                       ...
                   })
               }
           })
       }
       ```
    - In both `newFile()` and `newFolder()` functions, the `targetPath` is constructed by directly concatenating `this.fullPath` and `input` with a `/` in between.
    - `this.fullPath` is derived from browsing the remote file system and should generally be safe.
    - However, the `input` variable, which is directly taken from user input via `vscode.window.showInputBox()`, is not validated or sanitized.
    - If a user provides an `input` like `"../evil_file"` when creating a new file in `/home/user/documents`, the `targetPath` becomes `/home/user/documents/../evil_file`, which resolves to `/home/user/evil_file`, allowing file creation outside the intended `documents` directory.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension and connect to a remote SSH server.
    2. Browse to a directory on the remote server, for example, `/home/user/documents`.
    3. Right-click on the directory in the file explorer and select "New File".
    4. In the input box, enter a filename with path traversal characters, such as `../pwned_file`.
    5. Observe if a file named `pwned_file` is created in the parent directory `/home/user/` instead of `/home/user/documents/`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time enter `../../../tmp/pwned_file`. Observe if the file is created in `/tmp/pwned_file` on the remote server.
    7. If files are created outside of the intended current directory using path traversal sequences in the filename, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: FTP File/Folder Creation Path Traversal

    - Description:
    1. The extension allows users to create new files and folders on a remote FTP server using `FTPConnectionNode.newFile()` and `FTPConnectionNode.newFolder()` in `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpConnectionNode.ts`.
    2. When creating a new file or folder, the extension prompts the user for a name via `vscode.window.showInputBox()`.
    3. The user-provided name (input) is then directly concatenated to the current remote directory path (`this.fullPath`) without proper sanitization to form the target path for file/folder creation. For example: `targetPath = this.fullPath + "/" + input;`.
    4. If a malicious user provides an `input` value containing path traversal characters like "../", they can potentially create files or folders outside of the currently browsed directory on the remote FTP server.
    5. This could be exploited to overwrite critical system files, create files in sensitive directories, or bypass intended access restrictions on the remote system.

    - Impact:
    - File system manipulation: An attacker could create or overwrite files and directories at arbitrary locations on the remote FTP server, subject to the permissions of the FTP user.
    - Privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): Overwriting critical system files or creating files in sensitive directories could potentially lead to privilege escalation or system compromise if the attacker can leverage this file system access.
    - Data corruption or loss: Overwriting existing files could lead to data corruption or loss.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly concatenates the user-provided input to the remote path without any validation or sanitization to prevent path traversal.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization of the user-provided filename/folder name in `FTPConnectionNode.newFile()` and `FTPConnectionNode.newFolder()` to prevent path traversal characters (e.g., "../", "..\", absolute paths).
    - Validate the user input to ensure it only contains allowed characters for filenames and does not include any path separators or traversal sequences.
    - Use path joining functions provided by libraries (like `path.posix.join` for POSIX paths) to correctly and safely construct file paths, ensuring that traversal sequences are resolved and prevented.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must have an FTP connection configured and be browsing files on the remote FTP server using the extension's FTP file explorer.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user (or somehow trigger the extension on their behalf) to create a new file or folder and provide a malicious name containing path traversal characters.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpConnectionNode.ts`
       ```typescript
       public newFile(): any {
           vscode.window.showInputBox().then(async input => {
               if (input) {
                   const client = await this.getClient()
                   const tempPath = await FileManager.record("temp/" + input, "", FileModel.WRITE);
                   const targetPath = this.fullPath + "/" + input; // Vulnerable path concatenation
                   client.put(tempPath, targetPath, err => { ... })
               }
           })
       }

       public newFolder(): any {
           vscode.window.showInputBox().then(async input => {
               if (input) {
                   const client = await this.getClient()
                   client.mkdir(this.fullPath + "/" + input, err => { // Vulnerable path concatenation
                       ...
                   })
               }
           })
       }
       ```

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Configure an FTP connection in the Database Client extension and connect to a remote FTP server.
    2. Browse to a directory on the remote server, for example, `/home/user/documents`.
    3. Right-click on the directory in the file explorer and select "New File".
    4. In the input box, enter a filename with path traversal characters, such as `../pwned_file`.
    5. Observe if a file named `pwned_file` is created in the parent directory `/home/user/` instead of `/home/user/documents/`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time enter `../../../tmp/pwned_file`. Observe if the file is created in `/tmp/pwned_file` on the remote server.
    7. If files are created outside of the intended current directory using path traversal sequences in the filename, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: FTP File Download Path Traversal

    - Description:
    1. The `FileNode.downloadByPath()` function in `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts` and `SSHConnectionNode.downloadByPath()` in `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts` are used to download files and folders from a remote SSH server to the local machine.
    2. When downloading a file or folder, the code constructs the local file path by directly concatenating the user-provided download path with the remote file/folder name: `childPath = path + "/" + child.label;`.
    3. If an attacker can control the `child.label` (filename or folder name on the SSH server) and it contains path traversal characters like "../", they can potentially write files outside of the intended download directory on the user's local machine.
    4. This could be exploited to overwrite critical user files, create files in sensitive user directories, or bypass intended access restrictions on the local file system.

    - Impact:
    - File system manipulation: An attacker could create or overwrite files and directories at arbitrary locations on the user's local machine, subject to the permissions of the user running VSCode.
    - Data corruption or loss: Overwriting existing files could lead to data corruption or loss.
    - Local privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): While less direct, if an attacker can overwrite executable files in predictable locations, it could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve local privilege escalation.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly concatenates the remote filename/folder name to the local path without any validation or sanitization to prevent path traversal.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization of the remote filename/folder name (`child.label`) in `FileNode.downloadByPath()` and `SSHConnectionNode.downloadByPath()` to prevent path traversal characters (e.g., "../", "..\", absolute paths).
    - Validate the remote filename/folder name to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not include any path separators or traversal sequences.
    - Use path joining functions provided by libraries (like `path.join` for local paths) to correctly and safely construct local file paths, ensuring that traversal sequences are resolved and prevented.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must have an SSH connection configured and be browsing files on the remote SSH server using the extension's SSH file explorer.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or rename files or folders on the remote SSH server with malicious names containing path traversal characters.
    - The user must initiate a download of a folder containing such maliciously named files or folders, or specifically download a maliciously named file.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts`
       ```typescript
       public async downloadByPath(path:string,showDialog?:boolean){
           ...
           const outStream = createWriteStream(path); // Local path from user-selected directory + filename
           fileReadStream.pipe(str).pipe(outStream);
           ...
       }
       ```
    2. File: `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`
       ```typescript
       public async downloadByPath(path: string) {
           const childs = await this.getChildren()
           for (const child of childs) {
               const childPath = path + "/" + child.label; // Vulnerable path concatenation
               if (child instanceof FileNode) {
                   child.downloadByPath(childPath)
               } else if (child instanceof SSHConnectionNode) {
                   if (!existsSync(childPath)) {
                       mkdirSync(childPath)
                   }
                   child.downloadByPath(childPath)
               }
           }
       }
       ```
    - In both `FileNode.downloadByPath()` and `SSHConnectionNode.downloadByPath()`, the local `childPath` is constructed by concatenating the user-provided `path` and `child.label` with a `/` in between.
    - `child.label` comes directly from the remote filename or folder name.
    - If a file or folder on the remote server has a name like `"../pwned_file"` and the user downloads the parent directory to `/home/user/downloads`, the `childPath` becomes `/home/user/downloads/../pwned_file`, which resolves to `/home/user/pwned_file`, allowing file creation outside the intended `downloads` directory.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension and connect to a remote SSH server.
    2. On the remote SSH server, create a folder and inside it, create a file named `../pwned_file`.
    3. In the Database Explorer, browse to the parent directory of the folder created in step 2.
    4. Right-click on the folder created in step 2 and select "Download".
    5. Choose a download location on your local machine, for example, `/tmp/`.
    6. Observe if a file named `pwned_file` is created in `/tmp/pwned_file` instead of `/tmp/<folder_name>/../pwned_file`.
    7. Repeat steps 2-6, but this time create a file named `../../../tmp/pwned_file` on the remote server and attempt to download the folder containing it to `/home/user/downloads`. Observe if the file is created in `/tmp/pwned_file` on your local machine.
    8. If files are created outside of the intended download directory using path traversal sequences in the remote filename, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Redis `rename` Command Injection via Key Name

    - Description:
    1. The extension uses the `client.rename(content.key.name, content.key.newName)` in `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts` to rename Redis keys.
    2. The `content.key.name` and `content.key.newName` parameters are derived from user input in the key detail view within the extension.
    3. If the `content.key.newName` (the new key name) is not properly sanitized, and if a malicious user provides a new key name containing command injection payloads, it could be possible to inject Redis commands.
    4. While the `rename` command itself doesn't directly execute OS commands, in Redis, command injection can lead to the execution of arbitrary Redis commands, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate data, access sensitive information, or even escalate privileges within the Redis server if unsafe modules are loaded.

    - Impact:
    - Redis command injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary Redis commands on the Redis server.
    - Data manipulation: Attacker can modify or delete arbitrary Redis keys and values.
    - Information disclosure: Attacker might be able to retrieve sensitive data stored in Redis.
    - Potential for further exploitation: In certain Redis configurations with unsafe modules loaded, command injection could potentially lead to more severe consequences, though this is less likely in default setups.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `rename` function directly passes the user-provided `content.key.newName` to the `client.rename` command without any sanitization or validation.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and validation of the `content.key.newName` parameter in `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts` before using it in the `client.rename` command.
    - Sanitize or escape special characters that could be interpreted as command separators or modifiers in Redis commands.
    - Consider using parameterized Redis commands if the ioredis library supports them, although `rename` might not be directly parameterizable in this way. Input validation is crucial here.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must have a Redis connection configured and be viewing the details of a Redis key in the extension.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user (or trick the extension) to rename a Redis key and provide a malicious new key name containing Redis command injection payloads. This is most likely through social engineering, as direct attacker control over the rename input is not immediately apparent.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts`
       ```typescript
       }).on("rename", async (content) => {
           await client.rename(content.key.name, content.key.newName) // Vulnerable rename call
           this.detail()
       })
       ```
    - The code directly uses `content.key.newName`, which is derived from user input, as the second argument to `client.rename()`.
    - If `content.key.newName` contains malicious Redis commands (e.g., newline characters followed by other commands), the `redis.rename` function might interpret these as separate commands, leading to command injection. For example, if `content.key.newName` was set to `"newkey\nCONFIG SET dir /tmp"`, it might attempt to execute `CONFIG SET dir /tmp` after the `RENAME` command.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Configure a Redis connection in the Database Client extension.
    2. In the Database Explorer, select a Redis key and open its detail view.
    3. In the key detail view, attempt to rename the key.
    4. In the "New Name" input field, enter a malicious payload as the new key name. For example: `test_key\nCONFIG SET dir /tmp`.  (Note: the effectiveness of this payload depends on the specific Redis server configuration and may not be directly exploitable in all scenarios. A more reliable test would involve trying to manipulate data using injected commands).
    5. After attempting to rename, check the Redis server's behavior. In this example, check if the Redis configuration directory has been changed to `/tmp` (though this specific command might be restricted). A more reliable test would be to inject commands that manipulate data, like setting or deleting keys, and verify if those operations are executed beyond the intended `RENAME` command.
    6. A safer test case would be to try injecting commands like `test_key\nSET injected_key injected_value` as the new name. After renaming, check if a new key named `injected_key` with value `injected_value` has been created in Redis.
    7. If injected Redis commands are executed, it confirms the Redis command injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in View Source and Drop View Operations

    - Description:
    1. The `ViewNode.showSource()` and `ViewNode.drop()` functions in `/code/src/model/main/viewNode.ts` construct and execute SQL queries to show the source code and drop views, respectively.
    2. These functions use `this.table` property, which is derived from the view name in the database.
    3. If the `this.table` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named views), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.
    4. Specifically, if a view name contains malicious SQL code, this code could be executed when `showSource()` or `drop()` is called.

    - Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    - Data breach: Potential access to sensitive data in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in the database.
    - Privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): If the database user has elevated privileges, SQL injection could lead to further system compromise.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `ViewNode.showSource()` and `ViewNode.drop()` functions directly embed `this.table` into SQL queries without any sanitization or escaping.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and escaping of the `this.table` value in `ViewNode.showSource()` and `ViewNode.drop()` before embedding it into SQL queries.
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, although direct parameterization of object names (like table/view names) might not be directly supported by all database drivers. Escaping or whitelisting table names is often necessary.
    - Validate the `this.table` value to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not include any SQL injection payloads.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must connect to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) that either is controlled by an attacker or contains database objects (views in this case) with maliciously crafted names.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or rename views in the database to include SQL injection payloads in their names.
    - The user must then browse to the view with the malicious name in the Database Explorer and attempt to either "Show Source" or "Drop View".

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/main/viewNode.ts`
       ```typescript
       public async showSource(open = true) {
           const sourceResule = await this.execute<any[]>(this.dialect.showViewSource(this.schema, this.table)) // Vulnerable query
           const sql = `DROP VIEW ${this.table};${sourceResule[0]['Create View']}` // Vulnerable string concatenation
           if(open){
               QueryUnit.showSQLTextDocument(this, sqlFormatter.format(sql));
           }
           return null;
       }

       public drop() {

           Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to drop view ${this.table} ? `, async () => {
               this.execute(`DROP view ${this.wrap(this.table)}`).then(() => { // Vulnerable query
                   this.parent.setChildCache(null)
                   DbTreeDataProvider.refresh(this.parent);
                   vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Drop view ${this.table} success!`);
               });
           })

       }
       ```
    - In `showSource()`, `this.table` is used in `this.dialect.showViewSource(this.schema, this.table)` and directly concatenated into the SQL string `DROP VIEW ${this.table};...`.
    - In `drop()`, `this.table` is used in `this.execute(\`DROP view ${this.wrap(this.table)}\`)`.
    - If `this.table` (view name) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into these SQL queries, leading to SQL injection. For example, if a view is named `evil_view; DROP TABLE users;--`, the `drop()` function would execute `DROP view evil_view; DROP TABLE users;--`, potentially dropping the `users` table.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a view with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE VIEW "evil_view; DROP TABLE users;--" AS SELECT * FROM some_table;`. Note that the quoting of the view name might be needed depending on the database system to allow special characters or spaces.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious view.
    4. Right-click on the view named `evil_view; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Show Source".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to showing the source of the `evil_view`. Check for error messages that might indicate SQL syntax errors or successful execution of injected commands.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time select "Drop View" on the malicious view.
    7. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database when attempting to drop the `evil_view`.
    8. If the `users` table is dropped in either test case, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in Function Source and Drop Function Operations

    - Description:
    1. The `FunctionNode.showSource()` and `FunctionNode.drop()` functions in `/code/src/model/main/function.ts` construct and execute SQL queries to show the source code and drop functions, respectively.
    2. These functions use `this.name` property, which is derived from the function name in the database.
    3. If the `this.name` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named functions), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.
    4. Specifically, if a function name contains malicious SQL code, this code could be executed when `showSource()` or `drop()` is called.

    - Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    - Data breach: Potential access to sensitive data in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in the database.

    - The user must then browse to the function with the malicious name in the Database Explorer and attempt to either "Show Source" or "Drop Function".

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/main/function.ts`
       ```typescript
       public async showSource() {
           this.execute<any[]>( this.dialect.showFunctionSource(this.schema,this.name)) // Vulnerable query
               .then((procedDtails) => {
                   const procedDtail = procedDtails[0];
                   QueryUnit.showSQLTextDocument(this,`DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS ${this.name};\n${procedDtail['Create Function']}`); // Vulnerable string concatenation
               });
       }

       public drop() {

           Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to drop function ${this.name} ?`, async () => {
               this.execute( `DROP function ${this.wrap(this.name)}`).then(() => { // Vulnerable query
                   this.parent.setChildCache(null)
                   DbTreeDataProvider.refresh(this.parent);
                   vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Drop function ${this.name} success!`);
               });
           })

       }
       ```
    - In `showSource()`, `this.name` is used in `this.dialect.showFunctionSource(this.schema,this.name)` and directly concatenated into the SQL string  `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS ${this.name};...`.
    - In `drop()`, `this.name` is used in `this.execute(\`DROP function ${this.wrap(this.name)}\`)`.
    - If `this.name` (function name) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into these SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a function with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE FUNCTION "evil_func; DROP TABLE users;--" () RETURNS INTEGER DETERMINISTIC RETURN 1;`.  Note that the quoting of the function name might be needed depending on the database system.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious function.
    4. Right-click on the function named `evil_func; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Show Source".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to showing the source of the `evil_func`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time select "Drop Function" on the malicious function.
    7. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database when attempting to drop the `evil_func`.
    8. If the `users` table is dropped in either test case, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in Trigger Source and Drop Trigger Operations

    - Description:
    1. The `TriggerNode.showSource()` and `TriggerNode.drop()` functions in `/code/src/model/main/trigger.ts` construct and execute SQL queries to show the source code and drop triggers, respectively.
    2. These functions use `this.name` property, which is derived from the trigger name in the database.
    3. If the `this.name` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named triggers), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.
    4. Specifically, if a trigger name contains malicious SQL code, this code could be executed when `showSource()` or `drop()` is called.

    - Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    - Data breach: Potential access to sensitive data in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in the database.
    - Privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): If the database user has elevated privileges, SQL injection could lead to further system compromise.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `TriggerNode.showSource()` and `TriggerNode.drop()` functions directly embed `this.name` into SQL queries without any sanitization or escaping.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and escaping of the `this.name` value in `TriggerNode.showSource()` and `TriggerNode.drop()` before embedding it into SQL queries.
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Escaping or whitelisting trigger names is necessary.
    - Validate the `this.name` value to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not include any SQL injection payloads.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must connect to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) that either is controlled by an attacker or contains database objects (triggers in this case) with maliciously crafted names.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or rename triggers in the database to include SQL injection payloads in their names.
    - The user must then browse to the trigger with the malicious name in the Database Explorer and attempt to either "Show Source" or "Drop Trigger".

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/main/trigger.ts`
       ```typescript
       public async showSource() {
           this.execute(this.dialect.showTriggerSource(this.schema, this.name)) // Vulnerable query
               .then((procedDtails) => {
                   const procedDtail = procedDtails[0]
                   QueryUnit.showSQLTextDocument(this, `${this.dialect.dropTriggerTemplate(this.wrap(this.name))};\n${procedDtail['SQL Original Statement']}`); // Vulnerable string concatenation
               });
       }

       public drop() {
           if (this.dbType == DatabaseType.PG) {
               vscode.window.showErrorMessage("This extension not support drop postgresql trigger.")
               return;
           }
           Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to drop trigger ${this.name} ?`, async () => {
               this.execute(this.dialect.dropTriggerTemplate(this.wrap(this.name))).then(() => { // Vulnerable query
                   this.parent.setChildCache(null)

               })
           })

       }
       ```
    - In `showSource()`, `this.name` is used in `this.dialect.showTriggerSource(this.schema, this.name)` and directly concatenated into the SQL string `${this.dialect.dropTriggerTemplate(this.wrap(this.name))};...`.
    - In `drop()`, `this.name` is used in `this.execute(this.dialect.dropTriggerTemplate(this.wrap(this.name)))`.
    - If `this.name` (trigger name) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into these SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a trigger with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE TRIGGER "evil_trigger; DROP TABLE users;--" BEFORE INSERT ON some_table FOR EACH ROW BEGIN END;`. Note that the quoting of the trigger name might be needed depending on the database system.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious trigger.
    4. Right-click on the trigger named `evil_trigger; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Show Source".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to showing the source of the `evil_trigger`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time select "Drop Trigger" on the malicious trigger.
    7. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database when attempting to drop the `evil_trigger`.
    8. If the `users` table is dropped in either test case, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in Procedure Source and Drop Procedure Operations

    - Description:
    1. The `ProcedureNode.showSource()` and `ProcedureNode.drop()` functions in `/code/src/model/main/procedure.ts` construct and execute SQL queries to show the source code and drop procedures, respectively.
    2. These functions use `this.name` property, which is derived from the procedure name in the database.
    3. If the `this.name` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named procedures), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.
    4. Specifically, if a procedure name contains malicious SQL code, this code could be executed when `showSource()` or `drop()` is called.

    - Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    - Data breach: Potential access to sensitive data in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in the database.

    - The user must connect to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) that either is controlled by an attacker or contains database objects (procedures in this case) with maliciously crafted names.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or rename procedures in the database to include SQL injection payloads in their names.
    - The user must then browse to the procedure with the malicious name in the Database Explorer and attempt to either "Show Source" or "Drop Procedure".

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/main/procedure.ts`
       ```typescript
       public async showSource() {
           this.execute<any[]>(this.dialect.showProcedureSource(this.schema, this.name)) // Vulnerable query

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a procedure with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE PROCEDURE "evil_proc; DROP TABLE users;--" () BEGIN SELECT 1; END;`. Note that the quoting of the procedure name might be needed depending on the database system.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious procedure.
    4. Right-click on the procedure named `evil_proc; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Show Source".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to showing the source of the `evil_proc`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time select "Drop Procedure" on the malicious procedure.
    7. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database when attempting to drop the `evil_proc`.
    8. If the `users` table is dropped in either test case, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection in Table Drop Operation

    - Description:
    1. The `TableNode.dropTable()` function in `/code/src/model/main/tableNode.ts` constructs and executes SQL queries to drop tables.
    2. This function uses `this.table` property, which is derived from the table name in the database.
    3. If the `this.table` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named tables), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.

               this.execute(`DROP TABLE ${this.wrap(this.table)}`).then(() => { // Vulnerable query
                   this.parent.setChildCache(null)

               });
           })

       }
       ```
    - In `dropTable()`, `this.table` is used in `this.execute(\`DROP TABLE ${this.wrap(this.table)}\`)`.
    - If `this.table` (table name) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into this SQL query, leading to SQL injection. For example, if a table is named `evil_table; DROP TABLE users;--`, the `dropTable()` function would execute `DROP TABLE evil_table; DROP TABLE users;--`, potentially dropping the `users` table.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a table with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE TABLE "evil_table; DROP TABLE users;--" (id INT);`. Note that the quoting of the table name might be needed depending on the database system.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious table.
    4. Right-click on the table named `evil_table; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Drop Table".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to dropping the `evil_table`.
    6. If the `users` table is dropped, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Export to SQL Injection

    - Description:
    1. The extension provides a data export functionality, including exporting data to SQL format using `ExportService.exportToSql` in `/code/src/service/export/exportService.ts`.
    2. The `exportToSql` function iterates through rows of data and constructs SQL `INSERT` statements.
    3. For each row, it iterates through the keys and values, directly embedding the values into the SQL string without proper sanitization or escaping.
    4. If the exported data (values in `rows`) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into the generated `INSERT` statements.
    5. When this exported SQL file is executed (e.g., imported into another database or executed via SQL client), the injected malicious SQL code will be executed, leading to SQL injection.

    - Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL commands via exported data.
    - If a user exports data and then executes the exported SQL file without inspecting it, malicious SQL commands embedded in the exported data will be executed.
    - This could lead to data breach, data manipulation, or other malicious actions depending on the injected SQL code and the privileges of the user executing the SQL script.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `exportToSql` function performs direct string concatenation of values into SQL queries without any sanitization or escaping.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement proper sanitization and escaping of all values being embedded into the SQL `INSERT` statements in `ExportService.exportToSql`.
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements if possible for SQL export, or use appropriate escaping functions provided by database libraries (e.g., `sqlstring.escape` for MySQL, or equivalent for other databases) to sanitize values before embedding them into SQL strings.
    - Educate users about the risks of executing SQL files exported from untrusted sources and recommend reviewing exported SQL files before execution.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must export data from a database table using the extension's export functionality and choose "SQL" as the export format.
    - The data being exported must contain malicious SQL code. This could be achieved if the attacker has previously injected malicious data into the database or if the data source itself is malicious.
    - The user must then execute the exported SQL file, trusting that it is safe.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/export/exportService.ts`
       ```typescript
       private exportToSql(exportContext: ExportContext) {

           const { rows, exportPath } = exportContext;
           if (rows.length == 0) {
               // show waraing
               return;
           }

           let sql = ``;
           for (const row of rows) {
               let columns = "";
               let values = "";
               for (const key in row) {
                   columns += `${key},`
                   values += `${row[key] != null ? `'${row[key]}'` : 'null'},` // Vulnerable value embedding
               }
               sql += `insert into ${exportContext.table}(${columns.replace(/.$/, '')}) values(${values.replace(/.$/, '')});\n` // Vulnerable string concatenation
           }
           fs.writeFileSync(exportPath, sql);
       }
       ```
    - In the `exportToSql` function, the code iterates through each `row` and then each `key` in the row to construct `INSERT` statements.
    - The line `values += `${row[key] != null ? `'${row[key]}'` : 'null'},`` directly embeds `row[key]` into the `values` string.
    - There is no sanitization or escaping applied to `row[key]` before embedding it into the SQL string.
    - If `row[key]` contains malicious SQL, such as `'value'); DROP TABLE users; --` or similar, it will be inserted into the SQL string as is.
    - When this exported SQL is executed, the injected SQL commands will be executed.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    2. Insert a row into a table where one of the column values contains a SQL injection payload. For example, insert a row with a column value set to: `malicious_value'); DROP TABLE users; --`.
    3. Using the Database Client extension, connect to this database and table.
    4. Execute a query that retrieves the row containing the malicious value.
    5. Export the result of this query to a SQL file using the extension's export functionality.
    6. Open the exported SQL file and examine the generated `INSERT` statement. You should see the malicious SQL payload directly embedded in the `VALUES` clause.
    7. Attempt to execute this exported SQL file against a database (you can use a test database for safety).
    8. Observe if the injected SQL command (e.g., `DROP TABLE users;`) is executed when the exported SQL file is run. If the `users` table (or another targeted action) is performed, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability in SQL export.

- Vulnerability Name: Mock Data SQL Injection

    - Description:
    1. The extension provides a mock data generation feature using `MockRunner.runMock()` in `/code/src/service/mock/mockRunner.ts`.
    2. The `runMock` function reads a mock data configuration (JSON) and generates SQL `INSERT` statements based on this configuration.
    3. It iterates through columns defined in the mock configuration and substitutes placeholders in an `insertSqlTemplate` with mock values.
    4. The mock values are generated using `Mock.mock(value)` where `value` is taken from the mock configuration.
    5. If the mock configuration is crafted maliciously, or if the `getMockValue` function or template replacement logic is flawed, it could lead to SQL injection in the generated `INSERT` statements.
    6. When these generated SQL statements are executed against the database, the injected SQL code will be executed.

    - Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL commands via crafted mock data configurations.
    - If a user is tricked into using a malicious mock configuration file, or if the configuration is somehow compromised, running the mock data generation could result in arbitrary SQL execution on the database server.
    - This could lead to data breach, data manipulation, or other malicious actions depending on the injected SQL code and the privileges of the database user.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code generates SQL queries by directly substituting mock values into a template without proper sanitization or escaping.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement proper sanitization and escaping of mock values before embedding them into SQL `INSERT` statements in `MockRunner.runMock`.
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for mock data insertion to prevent SQL injection.
    - Validate and sanitize the mock configuration input to prevent injection of malicious payloads through the configuration itself.
    - Review and harden the `getMockValue` function and template replacement logic to ensure that it does not introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must use the mock data generation feature of the extension.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the mock data configuration used by the `MockRunner.runMock()` function. This could be achieved by:
        - Social engineering to convince a user to use a malicious mock configuration file.
        - Compromising the workspace and replacing the mock configuration file.
        - Exploiting a hypothetical configuration injection vulnerability to modify the mock settings.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/mock/mockRunner.ts`
       ```typescript
       public async runMock() {

           const content = vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.getText()
           const mockModel = JSON.parse(content) as MockModel;
           ...
           const insertSqlTemplate = (await tableNode.insertSqlTemplate(false)).replace("\n", " ");
           const sqlList = [];
           const mockData = mockModel.mock;
           const { mockStartIndex, mockCount } = mockModel
           ...
               for (let i = startIndex; i < count; i++) {
                   let tempInsertSql = insertSqlTemplate;
                   for (const column in mockData) {
                       let value = mockData[column].value;
                       if (value && (typeof value == "string")) { value = value.replace(/^'|'$/g, "\\'") }
                       if (value == this.MOCK_INDEX) { value = i; }
                       tempInsertSql = tempInsertSql.replace(new RegExp("\\$+" + column + "(,|\\s)", 'ig'), this.wrapQuote(mockData[column].type, Mock.mock(value)) + "$1"); // Vulnerable replacement
                   }
                   sqlList.push(tempInsertSql)
               }
           ...
       }
       ```
    - In the `runMock` function, SQL `INSERT` statements are generated within the loop.
    - The line `tempInsertSql = tempInsertSql.replace(new RegExp("\\$+" + column + "(,|\\s)", 'ig'), this.wrapQuote(mockData[column].type, Mock.mock(value)) + "$1");` performs the value substitution.
    - `Mock.mock(value)` generates mock data based on the `value` from the mock configuration.
    - `this.wrapQuote(mockData[column].type, Mock.mock(value))` attempts to wrap the value in quotes based on the column type, but this is not sufficient for preventing SQL injection.
    - If the mock configuration contains a malicious `value` that includes SQL injection payloads, `Mock.mock(value)` might generate a string that, when inserted into the SQL template, will result in valid SQL injection. For example, a malicious mock configuration could set a `value` to `"; DROP TABLE users; --"`, and if this is used in the `replace` operation, it can inject the `DROP TABLE users;` command into the generated SQL.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    2. Create a table in the database (e.g., `test_table` with columns `id INT`, `name VARCHAR`).
    3. Create a mock configuration JSON file for this table. In the mock configuration, for one of the columns (e.g., `name`), set the `value` to a malicious SQL injection payload, such as `"; DROP TABLE users; --"`.
    4. Open this mock configuration file in VSCode.
    5. Run the "Run Mock" command in the editor with the mock configuration file active.
    6. Observe if the `users` table (or another targeted table) is dropped from the database when the mock data generation process is executed. Check for error messages or database state changes that indicate successful SQL injection.
    7. If the `users` table (or another targeted action) is performed, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability in mock data generation.

- Vulnerability Name: SSH Tunnel Native Command Injection

    - Description:
    1. The extension uses `child_process.spawn` in `SSHTunnelService.createTunnel()` in `/code/src/service/tunnel/sshTunnelService.ts` to execute the native `ssh` command for establishing SSH tunnels.
    2. The command arguments are constructed in the `args` array, which includes parameters from `sshConfig`, such as `sshConfig.privateKeyPath`, `config.host`, and `config.port`.
    3. If any of these `sshConfig` properties can be influenced by an attacker and are not properly sanitized, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities in the `spawn('ssh', args)` call.
    4. Specifically, if `sshConfig.privateKeyPath` or `config.host` contains malicious shell metacharacters or commands, they could be executed by the `spawn` call.

    - Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine: Successful command injection in the `spawn('ssh', args)` call would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - System compromise: This could potentially lead to full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or further attacks.

    - Vulnerability Rank: High

    - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly constructs the `ssh` command arguments using `sshConfig` properties without any sanitization or validation to prevent command injection.

    - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and validation of all `sshConfig` properties used in constructing the `args` array for `child_process.spawn` in `SSHTunnelService.createTunnel()`. This includes `sshConfig.privateKeyPath`, `config.host`, `config.port`, and any other parameters passed to the `ssh` command.
    - Ensure that these values cannot be influenced by external attacker input in a way that could lead to command injection.
    - Consider using safer methods for constructing and executing shell commands, or use libraries that offer parameterized command execution to prevent command injection in `child_process.spawn`.
    - If direct command construction is necessary, properly escape or quote all dynamic parts of the command arguments to prevent interpretation as shell commands.

    - Preconditions:
    - The user must have an SSH connection configured in the extension and choose to use the "native" SSH tunnel type.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the `sshConfig.host` or `sshConfig.privateKeyPath` values used when the `createTunnel` function is called. This could be through configuration injection or by exploiting another vulnerability to modify the SSH connection settings.
    - The user must attempt to establish an SSH tunnel using the vulnerable SSH connection with the "native" type.

    - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/tunnel/sshTunnelService.ts`
       ```typescript
       public createTunnel(node: Node, errorCallback: (error) => void): Promise<Node> {
           return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
               ...
               if (ssh.type == 'native') {
                   let args = ['-TnNL', `${port}:${config.dstHost}:${config.dstPort}`, config.host, '-p', `${config.port}`];
                   if (ssh.privateKeyPath) {
                       args.push('-i', ssh.privateKeyPath) // Vulnerable argument
                   }
                   const bat = spawn('ssh', args); // Vulnerable spawn call
                   ...
               }
               ...
           })
       }
       ```
    - In the `createTunnel` function, when `ssh.type == 'native'`, the code constructs an `args` array for the `ssh` command.
    - `args.push('-i', ssh.privateKeyPath)` adds the private key path to the arguments. If `ssh.privateKeyPath` is attacker-controlled and contains malicious characters, it can lead to command injection. For example, if `ssh.privateKeyPath` is set to `"; calc &"`, the `spawn('ssh', args)` call might execute `calc` command after the `ssh` command.
    - Similarly, while less immediately apparent, `config.host` and `config.port` are also added to the `args` and if these are attacker-controlled, they could potentially be exploited for command injection, though it might be more complex to construct a working payload through these parameters in this specific `ssh` command structure. The `privateKeyPath` is the most direct injection point here.

    - Security Test Case:
    1. Configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension and set the tunnel type to "native".
    2. Modify the SSH connection settings (either manually or by exploiting a hypothetical configuration injection vulnerability) to set the `privateKeyPath` to:  `/path/to/key & calc`. (or `/path/to/key; calc` on Linux/macOS, assuming `/path/to/key` is a valid, but irrelevant private key path or even a non-existent path).
    3. Attempt to establish an SSH tunnel using this modified connection.
    4. Observe if the calculator application (`calc`) starts on your local machine during the SSH tunnel creation process.
    5. If the calculator application starts, it confirms the command injection vulnerability in the native SSH tunnel functionality. You can replace `calc` with other more harmful commands for further testing, but exercise caution.
