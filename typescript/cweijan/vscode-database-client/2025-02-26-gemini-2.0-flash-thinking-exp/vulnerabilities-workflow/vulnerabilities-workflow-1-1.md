### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure SSH Tunnel Default Username

- Description:
The Database Client extension provides SSH tunneling functionality. By default, the extension pre-fills the username field with "root" in the SSH tunnel configuration when establishing a connection. If a user proceeds with this default configuration and attempts to connect to an SSH server that allows root login with password authentication (which is a bad security practice but sometimes exists), it increases the risk of unauthorized access. An attacker who gains access to the SSH server (e.g., through brute-force password attack if password authentication for root is enabled) can then potentially pivot and access the database server behind the tunnel.

Steps to trigger vulnerability:
1. Open the Database Client extension in VSCode.
2. Initiate a new database connection that requires SSH tunneling.
3. In the SSH Tunnel configuration section, observe that the "Username" field is pre-filled with "root".
4. Proceed to configure the SSH tunnel with default username "root" and other necessary connection details (host, port, password or private key).
5. If the target SSH server allows root login and is vulnerable (e.g., weak password), an attacker could potentially compromise the SSH tunnel.

- Impact:
If an attacker successfully compromises the SSH tunnel due to the insecure default username and weak SSH server configuration, they can gain unauthorized access to the database server. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities on the database.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
No direct mitigations are implemented in the project to prevent the use of "root" as the default username for SSH tunnels. The extension relies on users to change the default username to a more secure, non-privileged account.

- Missing Mitigations:
The extension should change the default SSH username from "root" to a less privileged and more secure default, such as the current system username or simply leave the field empty, prompting the user to enter a username explicitly. Alternatively, provide a warning or recommendation against using "root" as the SSH username in the UI or documentation.

- Preconditions:
1. User must utilize the SSH tunneling feature of the Database Client extension.
2. User must not change the default username "root" in the SSH tunnel configuration.
3. The target SSH server must be configured to allow SSH login for the "root" user, preferably with password authentication enabled and potentially with a weak password. (This precondition relies on insecure SSH server configuration, which is external to the extension but made more risky by the insecure default in the extension).

- Source Code Analysis:
1. File: `/code/src/service/tunnel/config.js` and `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js`
2. Analyze `createConfig` function in both files.
3. Observe the default value assignment for `username`:
   ```javascript
   defaults(config || {}, {
       username: env.TUNNELSSH_USER || env.USER || env.USERNAME || 'root',
       // ... other defaults
   });
   ```
4. The code prioritizes environment variables for username configuration, but if none are set, it defaults to 'root'.
5. This default 'root' username is then used in the SSH connection attempt when the user does not explicitly provide a different username in the extension's UI.
6. No code exists to validate or warn against using 'root' as username.

- Security Test Case:
1. **Setup:**
    a. Set up a test SSH server that allows SSH login for the 'root' user with password authentication. Use a weak password for the 'root' user for testing purposes only (in a real-world scenario, root login with password should be disabled).
    b. Install the Database Client extension in VSCode.
2. **Test Steps:**
    a. Open the Database Client extension and attempt to create a new database connection (e.g., MySQL) that requires SSH tunneling.
    b. In the connection configuration, navigate to the SSH Tunnel settings.
    c. Observe that the "Username" field is pre-filled with "root". Leave this default username as is.
    d. Enter the host, port, and the weak password for the 'root' user of the test SSH server.
    e. Attempt to establish the SSH tunnel and database connection.
    f. If the SSH server is configured as described in step 1a, the connection will likely succeed using the default "root" username.
3. **Expected Result:**
    The SSH tunnel and database connection are successfully established using the default "root" username. This demonstrates that the extension, by defaulting to "root", facilitates connection attempts using a potentially insecure username, especially if users do not change it and connect to vulnerable SSH servers.
4. **Pass/Fail:**
    The test case passes if the connection is established with the default "root" username, indicating the vulnerability exists.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential FTP Command Injection in `listSafe` function

- Description:
The `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function in `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/connection.js` is potentially vulnerable to FTP command injection. This function takes a `path` argument, which, if not properly sanitized, could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary FTP commands. The `path` is used in `CWD` and `LIST` commands sent to the FTP server. By crafting a malicious `path`, an attacker might be able to execute unintended FTP commands, potentially leading to unauthorized file access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions on the FTP server.

Steps to trigger vulnerability:
1. Identify a feature in the Database Client extension that uses the `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function and allows user-controlled input to be passed as the `path` argument. (Further code analysis is needed to pinpoint the exact entry point within the extension.)
2. Craft a malicious `path` string containing FTP commands. For example, a path like `"directoryA\r\nDELE malicious_file.txt"` could attempt to change the working directory to "directoryA" and then delete "malicious_file.txt".
3. Use the identified extension feature to trigger the `listSafe` function with the crafted malicious `path`.
4. Observe the FTP server's behavior to see if the injected commands are executed.

- Impact:
Successful FTP command injection could allow an attacker to:
    - Delete or rename files and directories on the FTP server.
    - Upload files to the FTP server.
    - Retrieve files from the FTP server.
    - Potentially execute other FTP commands depending on the server's capabilities and the injection technique.
    The impact severity depends on the permissions of the FTP user account used by the extension and the capabilities of the FTP server. In a worst-case scenario, it could lead to data loss, unauthorized data access, or server compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
No explicit sanitization or validation of the `path` argument in `FTP.prototype.listSafe` or related functions (`cwd`, `list`, `_send`) is apparent in the provided code snippets. The code directly constructs FTP commands using the provided path.

- Missing Mitigations:
Input sanitization is missing for the `path` argument in `FTP.prototype.listSafe` and related functions. The extension should implement robust sanitization to prevent FTP command injection. This could involve:
    - Validating the `path` to ensure it only contains allowed characters and directory separators.
    - Encoding or escaping special characters in the `path` before constructing FTP commands.
    - Ideally, avoid directly using user-controlled input to construct FTP commands. If possible, use parameterized commands or safer APIs if available in the FTP library.

- Preconditions:
1. The Database Client extension must use the `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function or any function that internally uses `FTP.prototype.cwd` or `FTP.prototype.list` with user-controlled path input.
2. The extension must not sanitize or validate the user-provided path before passing it to the FTP client functions.
3. The FTP server must be vulnerable to command injection (i.e., it executes commands embedded in path arguments).

- Source Code Analysis:
1. File: `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/connection.js`
2. Analyze `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function:
   ```javascript
   FTP.prototype.listSafe = function(path, zcomp, cb) {
       if (typeof path === 'string') {
           var self = this;
           // store current path
           this.pwd(function(err, origpath) {
               if (err) return cb(err);
               // change to destination path
               self.cwd(path, function(err) { // <--- path is used here
                   if (err) return cb(err);
                   // get dir listing
                   self.list(zcomp || false, function(err, list) { // <--- path might be used internally in list
                       // change back to original path
                       if (err) return self.cwd(origpath, cb);
                       self.cwd(origpath, function(err) {
                           if (err) return cb(err);
                           cb(err, list);
                       });
                   });
               });
           });
       } else
           this.list(path, zcomp, cb); // <--- path might be used here
   };
   ```
3. Analyze `FTP.prototype.cwd` function:
   ```javascript
   FTP.prototype.cwd = function(path, cb, promote) {
       this._send('CWD ' + path, function(err, text, code) { // <--- path is directly used in command
           if (err)
               return cb(err);
           var m = RE_WD.exec(text);
           cb(undefined, m ? m[1] : undefined);
       }, promote);
   };
   ```
4. Analyze `FTP.prototype.list` function (path usage not explicitly shown but might be used internally by server based on current directory):
   ```javascript
   FTP.prototype.list = function(path, zcomp, cb) {
       // ...
       function sendList() {
           // this callback will be executed multiple times, the first is when server
           // replies with 150 and then a final reply to indicate whether the
           // transfer was actually a success or not
           self._send(cmd, function(err, text, code) { // <--- cmd is constructed based on path in listSafe
               // ...
           }, true);
       }
       // ...
   };
   ```
5. Analyze `FTP.prototype._send` function:
   ```javascript
   FTP.prototype._send = function(cmd, cb, promote) {
       // ...
       if (!this._curReq && queueLen && this._socket && this._socket.readable) {
           this._curReq = this._queue.shift();
           // ...
           this._debug&&this._debug('[connection] > ' + inspect(this._curReq.cmd));
           this._socket.write(this._curReq.cmd + '\r\n'); // <--- Command is written directly to socket
       }
       // ...
   };
   ```
6. Visualization:
   ```
   User Input (path) --> FTP.prototype.listSafe --> FTP.prototype.cwd/list --> FTP.prototype._send --> _socket.write (FTP Command sent without sanitization) --> FTP Server
   ```
7. The code shows that the `path` argument from `listSafe` is directly incorporated into FTP commands (`CWD`, potentially `LIST`) and sent to the server via `_send` without any sanitization. This creates a potential FTP command injection vulnerability if user-controlled input can reach the `path` parameter of `listSafe`.

- Security Test Case:
1. **Setup:**
    a. Set up a test FTP server.
    b. Identify a feature in the Database Client extension that uses the `FTP.prototype.listSafe` function and allows providing a path (e.g., browsing FTP directories, file operations). For example, if the extension allows browsing directories, this would be a good entry point.
    c. Install the Database Client extension in VSCode and configure it to connect to the test FTP server.
2. **Test Steps:**
    a. Using the identified extension feature, provide a malicious path as input. For instance, if the feature is directory browsing, try to browse to a directory path like `"test\r\nDELE malicious_file.txt"`. The exact path and injected command will depend on the feature and FTP server. A simple test is to inject `LIST` command. Try to list a directory with path `"\r\nLIST -al /etc\r\n"` if the server supports it.
    b. Monitor the FTP server logs or network traffic to see the commands received by the server.
    c. Observe if the injected FTP commands are executed by the server in addition to the intended commands.
3. **Expected Result:**
    If the FTP server executes the injected commands, and you can observe unintended actions (like listing a different directory, deleting a file if you set up a more dangerous command), the vulnerability is confirmed. For example, if you inject `\r\nLIST -al /etc\r\n` and the server responds with a listing of `/etc` directory instead of the intended directory, it indicates successful command injection.
4. **Pass/Fail:**
    The test case passes if injected FTP commands are successfully executed by the server, demonstrating the FTP command injection vulnerability. Fail if only intended commands are executed, indicating path sanitization or server-side protection. (Note: success here means vulnerability is found, so "pass" indicates a negative security outcome).

- Vulnerability Name: SSH File Download Path Traversal

- Description:
When downloading files or folders from an SSH connection, the extension constructs the local file path by concatenating the user-selected download directory with the remote file/folder name. If the remote file/folder name (obtained from the SSH server) is maliciously crafted to include path traversal characters (e.g., "../"), it could allow writing files outside the intended download directory. This vulnerability is also applicable to FTP file download.

Steps to trigger vulnerability:
1. Connect to an SSH or FTP server using the extension.
2. Navigate to a directory in the SSH/FTP file explorer.
3. On the SSH/FTP server, create a file or folder with a malicious name, for example, "../../../malicious_file.txt".
4. In the extension, right-click on the directory containing the malicious file/folder and select "Download".
5. Choose a download location on your local machine.
6. The extension will attempt to download all files and folders, including the maliciously named one. Due to lack of sanitization, the file might be written to an unexpected location outside of the intended download directory, potentially overwriting system files or sensitive data.

- Impact:
Path traversal vulnerability could allow an attacker who controls filenames on the SSH/FTP server to write files to arbitrary locations on the user's local file system when the user attempts to download files using the extension. This can lead to local file overwrite, potentially including sensitive system files, or placing executable files in startup directories for persistence.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
No input sanitization or validation is performed on the remote file/folder names before constructing the local download path for both SSH and FTP file downloads.

- Missing Mitigations:
The extension should sanitize or validate the remote file/folder names before using them to construct local file paths during download operations. Specifically, it should:
    - Remove or replace path traversal characters (e.g., "..", ".").
    - Validate that the constructed path remains within the intended download directory.
    - Consider using a safer path joining mechanism that prevents traversal.

- Preconditions:
1. Attacker needs to have the ability to create files or folders with arbitrary names on the SSH/FTP server that the user connects to.
2. User must attempt to download a directory or file from the SSH/FTP server that contains a maliciously named file or folder.
3. User must select a local download directory.

- Source Code Analysis:
1. File: `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts`, `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`, `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpFileNode.ts`, `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpConnectionNode.ts`
2. Analyze `downloadByPath` function in `FileNode.ts` and `SSHConnectionNode.ts` for SSH, and `download` function in `FTPFileNode.ts` and `FTPConnectionNode.ts` (indirectly via folder download) for FTP.
3. In `FileNode.ts`:
   ```typescript
   public async downloadByPath(path: string) {
       const targetPath = path + "/" + this.file.filename;
       const content = await this.getContent();
       await FileManager.record(targetPath, content, FileModel.WRITE);
       vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`${this.file.filename} download success, save in ${targetPath}`)
   }
   ```
4. In `SSHConnectionNode.ts`:
   ```typescript
   public async downloadByPath(path: string) {
       const childs = await this.getChildren()
       for (const child of childs) {
           const childPath = path + "/" + child.label;
           if (child instanceof FileNode) {
               child.downloadByPath(childPath)
           } else if (child instanceof SSHConnectionNode) {
               if (!existsSync(childPath)) {
                   mkdirSync(childPath)
               }
               child.downloadByPath(childPath)
           }
       }
   }
   ```
5. In `FTPFileNode.ts`:
   ```typescript
   download(): any {
       vscode.window.showSaveDialog({ defaultUri: vscode.Uri.file(this.file.name), filters: { "Type": [extName] }, saveLabel: "Select Download Path" })
           .then(async uri => {
               if (uri) {
                   const client = await this.getClient()
                   // ...
                   const outStream = createWriteStream(uri.fsPath); // uri.fsPath is user selected download location
                   fileReadStream.pipe(str).pipe(outStream);
                   // ...
               }
           })
   }
   ```
6. In `FTPConnectionNode.ts`, folder download logic iterates children and calls `download` on `FTPFileNode` instances and recursively calls `FTPConnectionNode` for subfolders. The local path is constructed in `FTPFileNode.download` using `uri.fsPath` and filename from remote.
7. In all cases, `targetPath` or `childPath` is constructed by directly concatenating user-provided `path` and `this.file.filename`/`child.label` (for SSH) or using `uri.fsPath` directly with remote filename (for FTP) without sanitization. This leads to path traversal vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
1. **Setup:**
    a. Set up a test SSH or FTP server.
    b. Create a directory on the SSH/FTP server, e.g., `/home/test_user/test_dir` or `/ftp_root/test_dir`.
    c. Inside `/home/test_user/test_dir` or `/ftp_root/test_dir`, create a file named `../../../malicious_file.txt` (or a folder).
    d. Install the Database Client extension in VSCode and configure an SSH/FTP connection to the test server.
2. **Test Steps:**
    a. In VSCode, connect to the test SSH/FTP server using the Database Client extension.
    b. Navigate to the `/home/test_user/test_dir` or `/ftp_root/test_dir` directory in the SSH/FTP file explorer.
    c. Right-click on the `/home/test_user/test_dir` or `/ftp_root/test_dir` directory and select "Download".
    d. Choose your home directory or any safe directory as the download location on your local machine.
    e. After the download completes, check your local file system.
3. **Expected Result:**
    A file named `malicious_file.txt` should be created outside the directory you selected for download, indicating path traversal.
4. **Pass/Fail:**
    The test case passes if the file `malicious_file.txt` is created outside the intended download directory, demonstrating the path traversal vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Import Services

- Description:
The import services for MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL in the Database Client extension are vulnerable to command injection. These services use the `child_process.exec` function to execute command-line import utilities (`mongoimport`, `mysql`, `psql`). The file path provided by the user for import is directly incorporated into the command string without sufficient sanitization. A malicious user could craft a file path that, when processed by the extension, would inject and execute arbitrary shell commands on the user's system.

Steps to trigger vulnerability:
1. In VSCode, open the Database Client extension.
2. Connect to a MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL database.
3. Initiate an import operation for the connected database type.
4. In the file selection dialog, instead of selecting a legitimate SQL or JSON import file, enter a malicious file path designed to inject commands. For example, for Linux/macOS, a path like `/tmp/test.sql & touch /tmp/pwned` or for Windows, `C:\import.sql & calc.exe`.  A more realistic scenario would involve chaining commands like `; rm -rf /tmp/important_files;` on Linux/macOS or `& del C:\important_files /f /q &` on Windows.
5. Execute the import operation.
6. The `exec` command will be executed with the malicious file path. If the path is crafted correctly, arbitrary commands will be executed.

- Impact:
Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Sensitive files can be read and sent to a remote server.
    - Malware installation: Malicious software can be downloaded and executed on the user's system.
    - System compromise: The attacker can gain full control over the user's machine.
    - Data deletion or modification: Important files can be deleted or altered.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
No input sanitization or validation is performed on the `importPath` before it is used in the `exec` commands within `mongoImportService.ts`, `mysqlImportService.ts`, and `postgresqlImortService.ts`.

- Missing Mitigations:
The extension must sanitize the `importPath` to prevent command injection. Mitigations should include:
    - Validating the `importPath`: Ensure the path is a valid file path and does not contain any characters that could be used for command injection (e.g., semicolons, ampersands, backticks, pipes).
    - Using parameterized commands or safer APIs: Instead of constructing shell commands using string concatenation, use parameterized command execution if the command-line tools support it, or utilize safer APIs that prevent command injection. However, command-line tools like `mysql`, `psql`, and `mongoimport` might not directly support parameterized commands in the way database drivers do for SQL queries. In this case, robust path validation and sanitization are crucial.
    - Consider using shell-escape functions: If direct sanitization is complex, consider using shell-escape functions provided by libraries to escape the file path before passing it to `exec`. However, proper validation is still preferred.
    - Principle of least privilege: While not a direct mitigation for command injection, running the extension with the least necessary privileges can limit the impact of a successful attack.

- Preconditions:
1. User must initiate an import operation for MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL databases within the Database Client extension.
2. User must provide a malicious file path during the import file selection step.
3. The system must have the respective command-line tools (`mongoimport`, `mysql`, `psql`) installed and accessible in the system's PATH environment variable.

- Source Code Analysis:
1. File: `/code/src/service/import/mongoImportService.ts`, `/code/src/service/import/mysqlImportService.ts`, `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`
2. Analyze the `importSql` functions in these files.
3. In `mongoImportService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   exec(command, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... })
   ```
   where `command` is constructed as:
   ```typescript
   const command = `mongoimport -h ${host}:${port} --db ${node.database} --jsonArray -c identitycounters --type json ${importPath}`
   ```
   `importPath` is directly appended to the command string.
4. In `mysqlImportService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   exec(command, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... })
   ```
   where `command` is constructed as:
   ```typescript
   const command = `mysql -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} ${node.password ? `-p${node.password}` : ""} ${node.schema || ""} < ${importPath}`
   ```
   `importPath` is used with redirection `<` and directly appended to the command string.
5. In `postgresqlImortService.ts` (File: `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`):
   ```typescript
   exec(`${prefix} "PGPASSWORD=${node.password}" && ${command}`, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... })
   ```
   where `command` is constructed as:
   ```typescript
   const command = `psql -h ${host} -p ${port} -U ${node.user} -d ${node.database} < ${importPath}`
   ```
   `importPath` is used with redirection `<` and directly appended to the command string.
6. In all three files, the `importPath`, which is derived from user input through file selection dialog, is incorporated into the command string passed to `exec` without any sanitization or validation to prevent command injection.

- Security Test Case:
1. **Setup:**
    a. Install the Database Client extension in VSCode.
    b. Ensure that `mongoimport`, `mysql`, and `psql` command-line tools are installed and in your system's PATH (depending on which database type you want to test).
    c. Have a running instance of MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL server for testing.
2. **Test Steps (Example for PostgreSQL, repeat for others):**
    a. Connect to a PostgreSQL database using the Database Client extension.
    b. Right-click on the database and select "Import SQL File".
    c. In the file selection dialog, instead of choosing a file, in the file name input, type: `test.sql & touch /tmp/pwned_psql_import` (for Linux/macOS) or `test.sql & echo pwned > C:\pwned_psql_import.txt` (for Windows). Note: `test.sql` is a dummy file name, the important part is the injected command after `&`.
    d. Click "Open" or proceed with the import.
    e. After the import operation attempts to run (it might fail to import SQL, but the command injection is what we are testing), check if the injected command was executed. For Linux/macOS, check if a file named `pwned_psql_import` exists in the `/tmp` directory. For Windows, check if `C:\pwned_psql_import.txt` file was created and contains "pwned".
3. **Expected Result:**
    The injected command (`touch /tmp/pwned_psql_import` or `echo pwned > C:\pwned_psql_import.txt`) should be executed on the system, indicating successful command injection. The file `/tmp/pwned_psql_import` or `C:\pwned_psql_import.txt` should be created.
4. **Pass/Fail:**
    The test case passes if the injected command is executed, demonstrating the command injection vulnerability in the import service.

- Vulnerability Name: Redis Key/Folder Delete Operations Missing Sanitization

- Description:
The `RedisFolderNode.delete()` and `KeyNode.delete()` functions in `/code/src/model/redis/folderNode.ts` and `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts` do not perform sufficient sanitization or validation of the `label` (key/folder name) before using it in Redis `DEL` command. If the `label` is maliciously crafted, it might be possible to inject Redis commands or delete unintended keys. Although Redis `DEL` command arguments are generally treated as keys and not commands themselves, unexpected characters or patterns in the key names could still lead to unintended behavior depending on how keys are managed and displayed in the UI.

Steps to trigger vulnerability:
1. Connect to a Redis database using the extension.
2. Create a Redis key or folder with a malicious name. For example, a key named `"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n *"` or a folder with a similar name.
3. Attempt to delete this maliciously named key or folder using the extension's UI (e.g., right-click and select "Delete").
4. Observe the Redis server's behavior. Depending on how the Redis client and server handle the crafted key name, it might be possible to inject commands or cause unintended deletions beyond the targeted key/folder.

- Impact:
While direct command injection into the `DEL` command itself is unlikely in standard Redis usage, a maliciously crafted key name could potentially lead to unintended data loss. In a worst-case scenario, depending on Redis server configuration and how the extension handles key names, it might be possible to flush all databases if a key name like `"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n *"` is processed without proper sanitization and somehow interpreted by the server in an unexpected way. This is highly dependent on Redis server version and configuration and is less likely to be a direct command injection but more of an abuse of key naming combined with potential parsing issues.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
No sanitization or validation is performed on the `this.label` value in `RedisFolderNode.delete()` and `KeyNode.delete()` before it's used in the `client.del()` command.

- Missing Mitigations:
The extension should sanitize or validate the key/folder names (`this.label`) before using them in Redis commands, especially in delete operations. While direct command injection is less likely in `DEL`, sanitization is still a good practice to prevent unexpected behavior from unusual key names.  Consider validating the `label` to ensure it only contains allowed characters for Redis keys, or escaping special characters if necessary. However, for `DEL` command, simple validation to prevent control characters like `\r\n` might be sufficient to prevent any unexpected parsing issues.

- Preconditions:
1. Attacker needs to be able to create Redis keys or folders with arbitrary names, including potentially malicious names.
2. User (or attacker) needs to attempt to delete a maliciously named key or folder using the extension's delete functionality.
3. The Redis server's behavior when handling unusual key names in `DEL` command might contribute to the vulnerability's exploitability (though standard `DEL` is designed to be safe against command injection).

- Source Code Analysis:
1. File: `/code/src/model/redis/folderNode.ts` and `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts`
2. Analyze `delete()` functions in both files.
3. In `RedisFolderNode.ts`:
   ```typescript
   public async delete() {
       Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete folder ${this.label} ? `, async () => {
           const client = await this.getClient();
           for (const child of this.childens) {
               await client.del(child)  // <--- this.childens contains keys derived from labels, not sanitized
           }
           this.provider.reload()
       })
   }
   ```
4. In `KeyNode.ts`:
   ```typescript
   public async delete() {
       Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete key ${this.label} ? `, async () => {
           const client = await this.getClient();
           await client.del(this.label) // <--- this.label is directly used as key, not sanitized
           this.provider.reload()
       })
   }
   ```
5. In both cases, `this.label` (and `this.childens` which are derived from labels) are directly used as arguments to `client.del()` without any sanitization. If a malicious user can create a key or folder with a specially crafted name, this name will be directly passed to the `DEL` command.

- Security Test Case:
1. **Setup:**
    a. Set up a test Redis server.
    b. Connect to the Redis server using the Database Client extension.
    c. Create a Redis key with a malicious name, e.g., `"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n test_key"`. You might need to use redis-cli or another tool to create such a key directly, as the extension UI might prevent creating keys with such names.
    d. In the extension, navigate to the Redis key list and locate the maliciously named key.
2. **Test Steps:**
    a. Right-click on the maliciously named key (`"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n test_key"`) and select "Delete".
    b. Confirm the deletion in the confirmation dialog.
    c. After the operation, check the Redis server to see if unintended actions occurred, such as flushing all databases (which would be a severe outcome, indicating command injection). In a less severe scenario, check if the intended key and *only* the intended key is deleted.
3. **Expected Result:**
    Ideally, only the key `"* \r\n FLUSHALL \r\n test_key"` should be deleted, and no other Redis operations should be performed. If `FLUSHALL` or other unintended commands are executed, it indicates a vulnerability. Even if `FLUSHALL` is not executed, if the deletion fails or causes errors due to the unusual key name, it still highlights a lack of robustness in handling key names.
4. **Pass/Fail:**
    The test case passes if unintended Redis commands are executed (like `FLUSHALL`), or if the deletion operation fails or causes errors due to the malicious key name, indicating a vulnerability in key name handling. Fail if only the intended key is deleted without any side effects or errors, suggesting safe handling of unusual key names in `DEL` operation (or that Redis `DEL` inherently prevents such injection). (Note: "pass" here means vulnerability is found).
