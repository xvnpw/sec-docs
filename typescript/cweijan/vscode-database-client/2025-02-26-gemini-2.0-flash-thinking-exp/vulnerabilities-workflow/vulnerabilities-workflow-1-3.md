* Vulnerability name: FTP Parser Command Injection in Filenames
* Description:
    1. The extension uses the `Parser.parseListEntry` function in `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/parser.js` to parse the response of FTP LIST commands.
    2. This function uses regular expressions to extract information like file type, permissions, size, timestamp, and filename from the FTP server's response string.
    3. If a malicious FTP server crafts a response where the filename part contains command injection payload, the regular expression parsing might not sanitize it properly.
    4. When the extension processes and displays this filename (e.g., in the Database Explorer), it could potentially execute the injected commands on the user's machine.
    5. This is because the extension might use the parsed filename in a way that could lead to command execution, for example, if the filename is used in shell commands or passed to functions that interpret them as commands.
* Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
    - If successfully exploited, an attacker could gain full control over the user's VSCode environment and potentially the entire system.
    - This could lead to data theft, malware installation, or further attacks on internal networks accessible from the user's machine.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code focuses on parsing FTP listing formats but does not seem to include any sanitization or validation of filenames to prevent command injection.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and validation of filenames parsed from FTP LIST responses in `Parser.parseListEntry` function.
    - Ensure that filenames are treated as data and not executed as commands in any part of the extension's functionality, especially when displaying or interacting with file lists.
    - Consider using safer methods for handling filenames, such as encoding or escaping special characters that could be interpreted as commands.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must connect to a malicious FTP server.
    - The malicious FTP server must be able to manipulate the LIST response to include command injection payloads in filenames.
    - The user's VSCode environment must process and display the file list from the malicious FTP server.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/parser.js`
    ```javascript
    Parser.parseListEntry = function(line) {
      var ret, info;
      if (ret = XRegExp.exec(line, REX_LISTUNIX)) {
        info = { name: ret.name, ... };
        ...
        if (ret.type === 'l') {
          var pos = ret.name.indexOf(' -> ');
          info.name = ret.name.substring(0, pos);
          info.target = ret.name.substring(pos+4);
        } else
          info.name = ret.name;
        ret = info;
      } else if (ret = XRegExp.exec(line, REX_LISTMSDOS)) {
        info = { name: ret.name, ... };
        ...
        ret = info;
      } else if (!RE_ENTRY_TOTAL.test(line))
        ret = line;
      return ret;
    };
    ```
    - The code uses `XRegExp.exec` to parse the LIST response and extracts the filename into `ret.name`.
    - The `ret.name` is then directly assigned to `info.name` without any sanitization.
    - If a malicious FTP server returns a LIST response with a filename like `"$(malicious command)"` or similar command injection syntax, this payload will be parsed and stored in `info.name`.
    - If this `info.name` is later used in a context where commands can be executed, it leads to command injection.
    2. File: `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/connection.js`
    ```javascript
    FTP.prototype.list = function(path, zcomp, cb) {
        ...
        source.on('data', function(chunk) {
           buffer += chunk.toString(self.options.encoding);
          });
        ...
        entries = buffer.split(RE_EOL);
        entries.pop();
        var parsed = [];
        for (var i = 0, len = entries.length; i < len; ++i) {
          var parsedVal = Parser.parseListEntry(entries[i]);
          if (parsedVal !== null)
            parsed.push(parsedVal);
        }
        ...
        cb(undefined, parsed);
    };
    ```
    - This function retrieves the FTP listing and uses `Parser.parseListEntry` to process each entry.
    - The resulting `parsed` array, which contains objects with potentially malicious filenames in the `name` property, is passed to the callback function.
    - If the callback or subsequent functions in the extension handle these filenames unsafely, command injection can occur.

* Security test case:
    1. Set up a malicious FTP server that, upon a LIST request, responds with an entry containing a command injection payload in the filename. For example, the response line could be: `-rw-r--r--   1 user  group        1024 Jan 01 00:00 $(touch /tmp/pwned)` or `drwxr-xr-x   2 user  group        4096 Jan 01 00:00 $(calc)`.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this malicious FTP server.
    3. In the Database Explorer, attempt to browse the files or directories on the FTP server, which will trigger a LIST command.
    4. Observe if the command injection payload in the filename is executed on the client machine. For example, in the first case, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created. In the second case, check if the calculator application starts.
    5. If the command is executed, it confirms the command injection vulnerability.

* Vulnerability name: SSH Tunnel Port Forwarding to Arbitrary Host
* Description:
    1. The extension allows users to create SSH tunnels for database connections using the code in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js`.
    2. The tunnel configuration, including the destination host (`dstHost`), is taken from user input or configuration settings, processed by `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js` and UI in `/code/src/vue/forward.js`.
    3. If the `dstHost` parameter is not properly validated, an attacker who can influence the configuration (e.g., through compromised settings or a crafted workspace configuration) could set up an SSH tunnel forwarding local ports to arbitrary hosts on the internet or within internal networks accessible by the SSH server.
    4. This could be exploited to bypass firewalls, perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, or pivot to internal networks.
* Impact:
    - Network pivoting: An attacker could use the user's VSCode extension as a pivot point to access internal network resources that are reachable from the SSH server but not directly from the attacker's machine.
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): An attacker could make requests to internal or external services via the user's VSCode extension, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or triggering unintended actions.
    - Firewall bypass: By tunneling traffic through the user's SSH connection, an attacker might be able to bypass firewall rules that would normally prevent direct access to certain hosts or ports.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The configuration parsing in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js` only checks for the existence of `host` and `dstPort` but does not validate the `dstHost` value against a whitelist or perform any other form of sanitization.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement validation for the `dstHost` parameter in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js` or in the UI input handling in `/code/src/vue/forward.js`.
    - Restrict allowed destination hosts to a predefined list or use a more secure method to determine valid destinations, avoiding arbitrary host forwarding.
    - Consider informing users about the security implications of SSH tunneling and the risks of forwarding ports to untrusted destinations.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the SSH tunnel configuration used by the extension. This could be through:
        - Social engineering to convince a user to set up a malicious tunnel configuration.
        - Exploiting another vulnerability to modify the extension's settings or workspace configuration.
        - Supply a crafted workspace configuration that includes a malicious SSH tunnel setup.
    - The user must have an SSH connection configured and be willing to establish an SSH tunnel.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js`
    ```javascript
    function createConfig(config) {
        ...
        defaults(config || {}, {
            ...
            dstHost: '127.0.0.1',
            ...
        });

        if (!config.host) {
            throw new ConfigError('host not set');
        }

        if (!config.dstPort) {
            throw new ConfigError('dstPort not set');
        }

        return config;
    }
    ```
    - The `createConfig` function in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/lib/config.js` sets a default value of `'127.0.0.1'` for `dstHost` but does not perform any validation on the user-provided `config.dstHost`.
    - It only checks if `config.host` and `config.dstPort` are set, but not `dstHost`.
    - This lack of validation allows an attacker to specify any arbitrary hostname or IP address as the `dstHost`.
    2. File: `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js`
    ```javascript
    function bindSSHConnection(config, netConnection) {
        ...
        sshConnection.forwardOut(config.srcHost, config.srcPort, config.dstHost, config.dstPort, function (err, sshStream) { ... });
        ...
    }
    ```
    - The `bindSSHConnection` function directly uses `config.dstHost` and `config.dstPort` in the `sshConnection.forwardOut` call without any further checks or restrictions.
    - This means whatever is set as `dstHost` in the configuration will be used as the destination for port forwarding.

* Security test case:
    1. Configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension.
    2. Create a new SSH tunnel configuration.
    3. In the tunnel configuration, set `dstHost` to a public website (e.g., `example.com`) and `dstPort` to `80`. Set `localPort` to an unused port on your local machine (e.g., `9000`).
    4. Start the SSH tunnel.
    5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000`.
    6. If the SSH tunnel is successfully forwarding traffic to `example.com:80`, you should see the content of `example.com` displayed in your browser, accessed through the SSH tunnel.
    7. To further demonstrate the risk, try setting `dstHost` to an internal IP address within a private network that the SSH server can access but your local machine cannot directly. If you can access resources on that internal IP via the tunnel, it confirms the arbitrary host forwarding vulnerability and its potential for network pivoting.

* Vulnerability name: Elasticsearch Documentation Link URL Injection
* Description:
    1. The extension uses `DocumentFinder.open(path)` in `/code/src/model/es/provider/documentFinder.ts` to open Elasticsearch documentation links.
    2. The `path` parameter for `DocumentFinder.open` is derived from `ElasticMatch.Path.Text` in `/code/src/model/es/provider/ElasticMatch.ts`, which is extracted from user-provided text (Elasticsearch query).
    3. The `DocumentFinder.open` function constructs a URL by embedding the `path` into a fixed base URL: `https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/${docuemntPath}.html`.
    4. If a malicious user crafts an Elasticsearch query that, when parsed by `ElasticMatch`, results in a `Path.Text` containing a malicious or unexpected value, this value will be used in the URL.
    5. When `vscode.env.openExternal` is called with this constructed URL, it could lead to the user being redirected to an arbitrary external website, potentially a phishing site or a site hosting malware.
* Impact:
    - Phishing attack: An attacker could redirect users to a fake login page or a page that mimics a legitimate service to steal credentials.
    - Malware distribution: An attacker could redirect users to a website that automatically downloads malware or exploits browser vulnerabilities.
    - Information disclosure: In less likely scenarios, if the injected URL structure interacts with the user's local system in an unintended way through `vscode.env.openExternal`, it might lead to information disclosure (though this is highly dependent on the OS and browser behavior).
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `DocumentFinder.open` function directly uses the parsed path to construct the URL without any validation or sanitization of the `path` parameter.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement validation and sanitization of the `path` parameter in `DocumentFinder.open` before constructing the URL.
    - Whitelist allowed values for `docuemntPath` based on the `documentMap` keys, or use a more robust method to ensure that only valid Elasticsearch documentation paths are used.
    - Consider using `vscode.Uri.parse` with strict validation to prevent injection of malicious URLs.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must use the Elasticsearch feature of the extension and trigger the `mysql.elastic.document` command.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the `Path.Text` extracted by `ElasticMatch` from the Elasticsearch query. This could be achieved by crafting a malicious Elasticsearch query and somehow getting the user to execute the `mysql.elastic.document` command on it (e.g., through social engineering or by exploiting another vulnerability to automatically trigger this command).
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/es/provider/documentFinder.ts`
    ```typescript
    export class DocumentFinder {

        private static documentMap = {
            "_count": "search-count",
            "_search": "search-search",
            "_stats": "indices-stats",
        }

        public static find(path: string) {
            return this.documentMap[url.parse(path).pathname.replace("/", '')]
        }

        public static open(path: string) {

            const docuemntPath = this.find(path)
            if (!docuemntPath) {
                vscode.window.showErrorMessage("Not doucment found!")
                return;
            }

            vscode.env.openExternal(vscode.Uri.parse(`https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/${docuemntPath}.html`));


        }
    }
    ```
    - The `DocumentFinder.open` function takes `path` as input.
    - It uses `this.find(path)` to lookup `docuemntPath` from `documentMap`. This part is relatively safe as it's a lookup in a predefined map.
    - However, the original `path` parameter is not validated and is used indirectly via `docuemntPath` in the URL construction: `https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/${docuemntPath}.html`.
    - If `docuemntPath` or the original `path` could be manipulated to include characters like `@` or other URL components, it could lead to redirection to an external domain.
    2. File: `/code/src/model/es/provider/ElasticMatch.ts`
    ```typescript
    export class ElasticMatch {
        ...
        Path: ElasticItem
        ...
        public constructor(headLine: vscode.TextLine, match) {
            ...
            this.Path = { Text: match[2], Range: lrange }
            ...
        }
    }
    ```
    - `ElasticMatch` extracts `Path.Text` from the second capturing group (`match[2]`) of the regex `ElasticMatch.RegexMatch`.
    - The content of `match[2]` is directly taken from the user-provided line in the editor.
    - If a user crafts an Elasticsearch query line like `GET https://malicious.website.com`, and this is parsed by `ElasticMatch` and then `DocumentFinder.open` is called with the extracted path, it could result in opening the malicious website.

* Security test case:
    1. Create a new file with language mode set to 'es'.
    2. Add the following line to the file: `GET https://malicious.website.com _search`
    3. Place the cursor on this line.
    4. Execute the command `Elastic Document` (or `mysql.elastic.document`). This command might be bound to a context menu or command palette.
    5. Observe if VSCode opens an external browser window and navigates to `https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/https://malicious.website.com.html`.  While this exact URL might be invalid and fail to load, the attempt to open `https://malicious.website.com` within the base URL context demonstrates the URL injection.
    6. For a more practical test, try a URL that is a valid website, e.g., `GET https://example.com _search`. Observe if `example.com` is opened within the base URL structure.
    7. If the extension attempts to open an external URL based on the injected path, it confirms the URL injection vulnerability.

* Vulnerability name: SSH File Creation Path Traversal
* Description:
    1. The extension allows users to create new files and folders on a remote SSH server using `SSHConnectionNode.newFile()` and `SSHConnectionNode.newFolder()` in `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`.
    2. When creating a new file or folder, the extension prompts the user for a name via `vscode.window.showInputBox()`.
    3. The user-provided name (input) is then directly concatenated to the current remote directory path (`this.fullPath`) without proper sanitization to form the target path for file/folder creation. For example: `targetPath = this.fullPath + "/" + input;`.
    4. If a malicious user provides an `input` value containing path traversal characters like "../", they can potentially create files or folders outside of the currently browsed directory on the remote SSH server.
    5. This could be exploited to overwrite critical system files, create files in sensitive directories, or bypass intended access restrictions on the remote system.
* Impact:
    - File system manipulation: An attacker could create or overwrite files and directories at arbitrary locations on the remote SSH server, subject to the permissions of the SSH user.
    - Privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): Overwriting critical system files or creating files in sensitive directories could potentially lead to privilege escalation or system compromise if the attacker can leverage this file system access.
    - Data corruption or loss: Overwriting existing files could lead to data corruption or loss.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly concatenates the user-provided input to the remote path without any validation or sanitization to prevent path traversal.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization of the user-provided filename/folder name in `SSHConnectionNode.newFile()` and `SSHConnectionNode.newFolder()` to prevent path traversal characters (e.g., "../", "..\", absolute paths).
    - Validate the user input to ensure it only contains allowed characters for filenames and does not include any path separators or traversal sequences.
    - Use path joining functions provided by libraries (like `path.posix.join` for POSIX paths) to correctly and safely construct file paths, ensuring that traversal sequences are resolved and prevented.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must have an SSH connection configured and be browsing files on the remote SSH server using the extension's SSH file explorer.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user (or somehow trigger the extension on their behalf) to create a new file or folder and provide a malicious name containing path traversal characters.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`
    ```typescript
    public newFile(): any {
        vscode.window.showInputBox().then(async input => {
            if (input) {
                const { sftp } = await ClientManager.getSSH(this.sshConfig)
                const tempPath = await FileManager.record("temp/" + input, "", FileModel.WRITE);
                const targetPath = this.fullPath + "/" + input; // Vulnerable path concatenation
                sftp.fastPut(tempPath, targetPath, err => { ... })
            }
        })
    }

    public newFolder(): any {
        vscode.window.showInputBox().then(async input => {
            if (input) {
                const { sftp } = await ClientManager.getSSH(this.sshConfig)
                sftp.mkdir(this.fullPath + "/" + input, err => { // Vulnerable path concatenation
                    ...
                })
            }
        })
    }
    ```
    - In both `newFile()` and `newFolder()` functions, the `targetPath` is constructed by directly concatenating `this.fullPath` and `input` with a `/` in between.
    - `this.fullPath` is derived from browsing the remote file system and should generally be safe.
    - However, the `input` variable, which is directly taken from user input via `vscode.window.showInputBox()`, is not validated or sanitized.
    - If a user provides an `input` like `"../evil_file"` when creating a new file in `/home/user/documents`, the `targetPath` becomes `/home/user/documents/../evil_file`, which resolves to `/home/user/evil_file`, allowing file creation outside the intended `documents` directory.

* Security test case:
    1. Configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension and connect to a remote SSH server.
    2. Browse to a directory on the remote server, for example, `/home/user/documents`.
    3. Right-click on the directory in the file explorer and select "New File".
    4. In the input box, enter a filename with path traversal characters, such as `../pwned_file`.
    5. Observe if a file named `pwned_file` is created in the parent directory `/home/user/` instead of `/home/user/documents/`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time enter `../../../tmp/pwned_file`. Observe if the file is created in `/tmp/pwned_file` on the remote server.
    7. If files are created outside of the intended current directory using path traversal sequences in the filename, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.

---
* Vulnerability name: SSH Command Injection via Socks Proxy Command
* Description:
    1. The extension uses `child_process.exec` in `SSHConnectionNode.startSocksProxy()` in `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts` to execute an SSH command for creating a SOCKS proxy.
    2. The command is constructed using parameters from `this.sshConfig`, specifically `this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath` and `this.sshConfig.host`.
    3. While the base command structure appears fixed (`ssh -i ... -D ... root@...`), if the values of `this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath` or `this.sshConfig.host` are not properly validated and sanitized, and if these values can be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through configuration injection or other vulnerabilities), it could potentially lead to command injection.
    4. In this specific command, `root@` is hardcoded as the username in the command, which might be an issue if the intended username is different. However, for command injection, the primary concern is the lack of sanitization of `privateKeyPath` and `host`.
* Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine: If command injection is successful, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the machine running VSCode with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - System compromise: Successful command injection could lead to full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or further attacks.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly uses `this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath` and `this.sshConfig.host` in the `exec` command without any sanitization or validation.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and validation of `this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath` and `this.sshConfig.host` before using them in the `exec` command.
    - Ensure that these values cannot be influenced by external attacker input in a way that could lead to command injection.
    - Consider using safer alternatives to `child_process.exec` for executing SSH commands, if possible, or carefully construct the command to avoid injection vulnerabilities.
    - Avoid hardcoding `root@` and use the username from `sshConfig.username` instead.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must have an SSH connection configured in the extension.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the `sshConfig.host` or `sshConfig.privateKeyPath` values used when the `startSocksProxy` function is called. This could be through configuration injection or by exploiting another vulnerability to modify the SSH connection settings.
    - The user must trigger the "Start Socks Proxy" command for the vulnerable SSH connection.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`
    ```typescript
    public startSocksProxy() {
        var exec = require('child_process').exec;
        if (this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath) {
            exec(`cmd /c start ssh -i ${this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath} -qTnN -D 127.0.0.1:1080 root@${this.sshConfig.host}`) // Vulnerable exec call
        } else {
            exec(`cmd /c start ssh -qTnN -D 127.0.0.1:1080 root@${this.sshConfig.host}`) // Vulnerable exec call
        }
    }
    ```
    - The code uses `child_process.exec` to execute the `ssh` command.
    - The command string is constructed using template literals, embedding `this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath` and `this.sshConfig.host` directly into the command.
    - If `this.sshConfig.host` or `this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath` were to contain malicious characters (e.g., backticks, semicolons, etc.), it could lead to command injection. For example, if `sshConfig.host` was set to `example.com; malicious command`, the executed command would become `ssh ... root@example.com; malicious command`, potentially executing `malicious command` after the `ssh` command.

* Security test case:
    1. Configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension.
    2. Modify the SSH connection settings (either manually or by exploiting a hypothetical configuration injection vulnerability) to set the `host` to: `example.com & calc`. (or `example.com; calc` on Linux/macOS).
    3. Trigger the "Start Socks Proxy" command for this modified SSH connection.
    4. Observe if the calculator application (`calc`) starts on your local machine in addition to the SSH command execution.
    5. If the calculator application starts, it confirms the command injection vulnerability. You can replace `calc` with other more harmful commands for further testing, but exercise caution.

---
* Vulnerability name: Import Services Command Injection (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
* Description:
    1. The extension uses `child_process.exec` in `MongoImportService.importSql`, `MysqlImportService.importSql`, and `PostgresqlImortService.importSql` to execute command-line import utilities (`mongoimport`, `mysql`, `psql`).
    2. The commands are constructed by embedding properties of the `node` object (representing database connection) and the `importPath` (user-selected file path) into the command string.
    3. If an attacker can control or influence the `node` object properties or the `importPath`, they could inject malicious commands into the executed command string.
    4. This is possible if:
        - The extension has a configuration injection vulnerability that allows modifying connection settings.
        - The extension unsafely handles workspace configuration files that could be manipulated by an attacker.
        - An attacker can socially engineer a user to connect to a malicious database or import a file from a malicious path.
    5. Successful command injection leads to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when the import functionality is triggered.
* Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
    - If successfully exploited, an attacker could gain full control over the user's VSCode environment and potentially the entire system.
    - This could lead to data theft, malware installation, or further attacks.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly constructs and executes shell commands using `child_process.exec` without sanitizing the input parameters derived from the `node` object or `importPath`.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and validation of all parameters used in the command strings in `MongoImportService.importSql`, `MysqlImportService.importSql`, and `PostgresqlImortService.importSql`. This includes `node.host`, `node.port`, `node.user`, `node.password`, `node.database`, `node.schema`, and `importPath`.
    - Avoid using `child_process.exec` if possible. Consider using safer alternatives or libraries that offer parameterized command execution to prevent command injection.
    - If `child_process.exec` must be used, ensure all dynamic parts of the command are properly escaped or quoted to prevent interpretation as shell commands.
    - Implement input validation for the `importPath` to ensure it points to a valid file and prevent path traversal or other malicious inputs.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must attempt to import a SQL or JSON file using the extension's import functionality for MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB databases.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence either the connection settings of the database node or the path to the import file. This could be achieved through:
        - Configuration injection vulnerability (hypothetical in the provided code).
        - Social engineering to convince the user to import from a malicious path or connect to a malicious database.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/import/mongoImportService.ts`
    ```typescript
    exec(command, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... }) // Vulnerable exec call
    const command = `mongoimport -h ${host}:${port} --db ${node.database} --jsonArray -c identitycounters --type json ${importPath}`
    ```
    2. File: `/code/src/service/import/mysqlImportService.ts`
    ```typescript
    const cp=exec(command, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... }) // Vulnerable exec call
    const command = `mysql -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} ${node.password ? `-p${node.password}` : ""} ${node.schema || ""} < ${importPath}`
    ```
    3. File: `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`
    ```typescript
    exec(`${prefix} "PGPASSWORD=${node.password}" && ${command}`, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... }) // Vulnerable exec call
    const command = `psql -h ${host} -p ${port} -U ${node.user} -d ${node.database} < ${importPath}`
    ```
    - In all three files, the `exec` function from `child_process` is used to execute shell commands for importing data.
    - The `command` strings are constructed using template literals, embedding potentially attacker-controlled values like `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, `database`, `schema`, and `importPath` directly into the command.
    - If any of these values contain malicious characters, it can lead to command injection. For example, if `node.database` was set to `mydatabase; malicious command`, the executed command would become `mongoimport ... --db mydatabase; malicious command ...`, potentially executing `malicious command` after the `mongoimport` command.

* Security test case:
    1. Configure a MySQL connection in the Database Client extension.
    2. Modify the MySQL connection settings (either manually or by exploiting a hypothetical configuration injection vulnerability) to set the `schema` to: `testdb; calc`.
    3. Prepare a simple SQL file for import (e.g., `CREATE TABLE test (id INT);`).
    4. In the Database Explorer, right-click on the modified MySQL connection and select "Import SQL File".
    5. Select the prepared SQL file.
    6. Observe if the calculator application (`calc`) starts on your local machine during the import process.
    7. If the calculator application starts, it confirms the command injection vulnerability. You can replace `calc` with other more harmful commands for further testing, but exercise caution. Repeat similar test cases for PostgreSQL and MongoDB import functionalities, modifying relevant connection parameters to inject commands.

* Vulnerability name: FTP File/Folder Creation Path Traversal
* Description:
    1. The extension allows users to create new files and folders on a remote FTP server using `FTPConnectionNode.newFile()` and `FTPConnectionNode.newFolder()` in `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpConnectionNode.ts`.
    2. When creating a new file or folder, the extension prompts the user for a name via `vscode.window.showInputBox()`.
    3. The user-provided name (input) is then directly concatenated to the current remote directory path (`this.fullPath`) without proper sanitization to form the target path for file/folder creation. For example: `targetPath = this.fullPath + "/" + input;`.
    4. If a malicious user provides an `input` value containing path traversal characters like "../", they can potentially create files or folders outside of the currently browsed directory on the remote FTP server.
    5. This could be exploited to overwrite critical system files, create files in sensitive directories, or bypass intended access restrictions on the remote system.
* Impact:
    - File system manipulation: An attacker could create or overwrite files and directories at arbitrary locations on the remote FTP server, subject to the permissions of the FTP user.
    - Privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): Overwriting critical system files or creating files in sensitive directories could potentially lead to privilege escalation or system compromise if the attacker can leverage this file system access.
    - Data corruption or loss: Overwriting existing files could lead to data corruption or loss.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly concatenates the user-provided input to the remote path without any validation or sanitization to prevent path traversal.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization of the user-provided filename/folder name in `FTPConnectionNode.newFile()` and `FTPConnectionNode.newFolder()` to prevent path traversal characters (e.g., "../", "..\", absolute paths).
    - Validate the user input to ensure it only contains allowed characters for filenames and does not include any path separators or traversal sequences.
    - Use path joining functions provided by libraries (like `path.posix.join` for POSIX paths) to correctly and safely construct file paths, ensuring that traversal sequences are resolved and prevented.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must have an FTP connection configured and be browsing files on the remote FTP server using the extension's FTP file explorer.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user (or somehow trigger the extension on their behalf) to create a new file or folder and provide a malicious name containing path traversal characters.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpConnectionNode.ts`
    ```typescript
    public newFile(): any {
        vscode.window.showInputBox().then(async input => {
            if (input) {
                const client = await this.getClient()
                const tempPath = await FileManager.record("temp/" + input, "", FileModel.WRITE);
                const targetPath = this.fullPath + "/" + input; // Vulnerable path concatenation
                client.put(tempPath, targetPath, err => { ... })
            }
        })
    }

    public newFolder(): any {
        vscode.window.showInputBox().then(async input => {
            if (input) {
                const client = await this.getClient()
                client.mkdir(this.fullPath + "/" + input, err => { // Vulnerable path concatenation
                    ...
                })
            }
        })
    }
    ```
    - In both `newFile()` and `newFolder()` functions, the `targetPath` is constructed by directly concatenating `this.fullPath` and `input` with a `/` in between.
    - `this.fullPath` is derived from browsing the remote file system and should generally be safe.
    - However, the `input` variable, which is directly taken from user input via `vscode.window.showInputBox()`, is not validated or sanitized.
    - If a user provides an `input` like `"../evil_file"` when creating a new file in `/home/user/documents`, the `targetPath` becomes `/home/user/documents/../evil_file`, which resolves to `/home/user/evil_file`, allowing file creation outside the intended `documents` directory.

* Security test case:
    1. Configure an FTP connection in the Database Client extension and connect to a remote FTP server.
    2. Browse to a directory on the remote server, for example, `/home/user/documents`.
    3. Right-click on the directory in the file explorer and select "New File".
    4. In the input box, enter a filename with path traversal characters, such as `../pwned_file`.
    5. Observe if a file named `pwned_file` is created in the parent directory `/home/user/` instead of `/home/user/documents/`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time enter `../../../tmp/pwned_file`. Observe if the file is created in `/tmp/pwned_file` on the remote server.
    7. If files are created outside of the intended current directory using path traversal sequences in the filename, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.

* Vulnerability name: SSH File Download Path Traversal
* Description:
    1. The `FileNode.downloadByPath()` function in `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts` and `SSHConnectionNode.downloadByPath()` in `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts` are used to download files and folders from a remote SSH server to the local machine.
    2. When downloading a file or folder, the code constructs the local file path by directly concatenating the user-provided download path with the remote file/folder name: `childPath = path + "/" + child.label;`.
    3. If an attacker can control the `child.label` (filename or folder name on the SSH server) and it contains path traversal characters like "../", they can potentially write files outside of the intended download directory on the user's local machine.
    4. This could be exploited to overwrite critical user files, create files in sensitive user directories, or bypass intended access restrictions on the local file system.
* Impact:
    - File system manipulation: An attacker could create or overwrite files and directories at arbitrary locations on the user's local machine, subject to the permissions of the user running VSCode.
    - Data corruption or loss: Overwriting existing files could lead to data corruption or loss.
    - Local privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): While less direct, if an attacker can overwrite executable files in predictable locations, it could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve local privilege escalation.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly concatenates the remote filename/folder name to the local path without any validation or sanitization to prevent path traversal.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization of the remote filename/folder name (`child.label`) in `FileNode.downloadByPath()` and `SSHConnectionNode.downloadByPath()` to prevent path traversal characters (e.g., "../", "..\", absolute paths).
    - Validate the remote filename/folder name to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not include any path separators or traversal sequences.
    - Use path joining functions provided by libraries (like `path.join` for local paths) to correctly and safely construct local file paths, ensuring that traversal sequences are resolved and prevented.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must have an SSH connection configured and be browsing files on the remote SSH server using the extension's SSH file explorer.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or rename files or folders on the remote SSH server with malicious names containing path traversal characters.
    - The user must initiate a download of a folder containing such maliciously named files or folders, or specifically download a maliciously named file.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts`
    ```typescript
    public async downloadByPath(path:string,showDialog?:boolean){
        ...
        const outStream = createWriteStream(path); // Local path from user-selected directory + filename
        fileReadStream.pipe(str).pipe(outStream);
        ...
    }
    ```
    2. File: `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`
    ```typescript
    public async downloadByPath(path: string) {
        const childs = await this.getChildren()
        for (const child of childs) {
            const childPath = path + "/" + child.label; // Vulnerable path concatenation
            if (child instanceof FileNode) {
                child.downloadByPath(childPath)
            } else if (child instanceof SSHConnectionNode) {
                if (!existsSync(childPath)) {
                    mkdirSync(childPath)
                }
                child.downloadByPath(childPath)
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - In both `FileNode.downloadByPath()` and `SSHConnectionNode.downloadByPath()`, the local `childPath` is constructed by concatenating the user-provided `path` and `child.label` with a `/` in between.
    - `child.label` comes directly from the remote filename or folder name.
    - If a file or folder on the remote server has a name like `"../pwned_file"` and the user downloads the parent directory to `/home/user/downloads`, the `childPath` becomes `/home/user/downloads/../pwned_file`, which resolves to `/home/user/pwned_file`, allowing file creation outside the intended `downloads` directory.

* Security test case:
    1. Configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension and connect to a remote SSH server.
    2. On the remote SSH server, create a folder and inside it, create a file named `../pwned_file`.
    3. In the Database Explorer, browse to the parent directory of the folder created in step 2.
    4. Right-click on the folder created in step 2 and select "Download".
    5. Choose a download location on your local machine, for example, `/tmp/`.
    6. Observe if a file named `pwned_file` is created in `/tmp/pwned_file` instead of `/tmp/<folder_name>/../pwned_file`.
    7. Repeat steps 2-6, but this time create a file named `../../../tmp/pwned_file` on the remote server and attempt to download the folder containing it to `/home/user/downloads`. Observe if the file is created in `/tmp/pwned_file` on your local machine.
    8. If files are created outside of the intended download directory using path traversal sequences in the remote filename, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.

* Vulnerability name: Redis `rename` Command Injection via Key Name
* Description:
    1. The extension uses the `client.rename(content.key.name, content.key.newName)` in `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts` to rename Redis keys.
    2. The `content.key.name` and `content.key.newName` parameters are derived from user input in the key detail view within the extension.
    3. If the `content.key.newName` (the new key name) is not properly sanitized, and if a malicious user provides a new key name containing command injection payloads, it could be possible to inject Redis commands.
    4. While the `rename` command itself doesn't directly execute OS commands, in Redis, command injection can lead to the execution of arbitrary Redis commands, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate data, access sensitive information, or even escalate privileges within the Redis server if unsafe modules are loaded.
* Impact:
    - Redis command injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary Redis commands on the Redis server.
    - Data manipulation: Attacker can modify or delete arbitrary Redis keys and values.
    - Information disclosure: Attacker might be able to retrieve sensitive data stored in Redis.
    - Potential for further exploitation: In certain Redis configurations with unsafe modules loaded, command injection could potentially lead to more severe consequences, though this is less likely in default setups.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `rename` function directly passes the user-provided `content.key.newName` to the `client.rename` command without any sanitization or validation.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and validation of the `content.key.newName` parameter in `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts` before using it in the `client.rename` command.
    - Sanitize or escape special characters that could be interpreted as command separators or modifiers in Redis commands.
    - Consider using parameterized Redis commands if the ioredis library supports them, although `rename` might not be directly parameterizable in this way. Input validation is crucial here.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must have a Redis connection configured and be viewing the details of a Redis key in the extension.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user (or trick the extension) to rename a Redis key and provide a malicious new key name containing Redis command injection payloads. This is most likely through social engineering, as direct attacker control over the rename input is not immediately apparent.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/redis/keyNode.ts`
    ```typescript
    }).on("rename", async (content) => {
        await client.rename(content.key.name, content.key.newName) // Vulnerable rename call
        this.detail()
    })
    ```
    - The code directly uses `content.key.newName`, which is derived from user input, as the second argument to `client.rename()`.
    - If `content.key.newName` contains malicious Redis commands (e.g., newline characters followed by other commands), the `redis.rename` function might interpret these as separate commands, leading to command injection. For example, if `content.key.newName` was set to `"newkey\nCONFIG SET dir /tmp"`, it might attempt to execute `CONFIG SET dir /tmp` after the `RENAME` command.

* Security test case:
    1. Configure a Redis connection in the Database Client extension.
    2. In the Database Explorer, select a Redis key and open its detail view.
    3. In the key detail view, attempt to rename the key.
    4. In the "New Name" input field, enter a malicious payload as the new key name. For example: `test_key\nCONFIG SET dir /tmp`.  (Note: the effectiveness of this payload depends on the specific Redis server configuration and may not be directly exploitable in all scenarios. A more reliable test would involve trying to manipulate data using injected commands).
    5. After attempting to rename, check the Redis server's behavior. In this example, check if the Redis configuration directory has been changed to `/tmp` (though this specific command might be restricted). A more reliable test would be to inject commands that manipulate data, like setting or deleting keys, and verify if those operations are executed beyond the intended `RENAME` command.
    6. A safer test case would be to try injecting commands like `test_key\nSET injected_key injected_value` as the new name. After renaming, check if a new key named `injected_key` with value `injected_value` has been created in Redis.
    7. If injected Redis commands are executed, it confirms the Redis command injection vulnerability.

* Vulnerability name: SQL Injection in View Source and Drop View Operations
* Description:
    1. The `ViewNode.showSource()` and `ViewNode.drop()` functions in `/code/src/model/main/viewNode.ts` construct and execute SQL queries to show the source code and drop views, respectively.
    2. These functions use `this.table` property, which is derived from the view name in the database.
    3. If the `this.table` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named views), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.
    4. Specifically, if a view name contains malicious SQL code, this code could be executed when `showSource()` or `drop()` is called.
* Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    - Data breach: Potential access to sensitive data in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in the database.
    - Privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): If the database user has elevated privileges, SQL injection could lead to further system compromise.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `ViewNode.showSource()` and `ViewNode.drop()` functions directly embed `this.table` into SQL queries without any sanitization or escaping.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and escaping of the `this.table` value in `ViewNode.showSource()` and `ViewNode.drop()` before embedding it into SQL queries.
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, although direct parameterization of object names (like table/view names) might not be directly supported by all database drivers. Escaping or whitelisting table names is often necessary.
    - Validate the `this.table` value to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not include any SQL injection payloads.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must connect to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) that either is controlled by an attacker or contains database objects (views in this case) with maliciously crafted names.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or rename views in the database to include SQL injection payloads in their names.
    - The user must then browse to the view with the malicious name in the Database Explorer and attempt to either "Show Source" or "Drop View".
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/main/viewNode.ts`
    ```typescript
    public async showSource(open = true) {
        const sourceResule = await this.execute<any[]>(this.dialect.showViewSource(this.schema, this.table)) // Vulnerable query
        const sql = `DROP VIEW ${this.table};${sourceResule[0]['Create View']}` // Vulnerable string concatenation
        if(open){
            QueryUnit.showSQLTextDocument(this, sqlFormatter.format(sql));
        }
        return null;
    }

    public drop() {

        Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to drop view ${this.table} ? `, async () => {
            this.execute(`DROP view ${this.wrap(this.table)}`).then(() => { // Vulnerable query
                this.parent.setChildCache(null)
                DbTreeDataProvider.refresh(this.parent);
                vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Drop view ${this.table} success!`);
            });
        })

    }
    ```
    - In `showSource()`, `this.table` is used in `this.dialect.showViewSource(this.schema, this.table)` and directly concatenated into the SQL string `DROP VIEW ${this.table};...`.
    - In `drop()`, `this.table` is used in `this.execute(\`DROP view ${this.wrap(this.table)}\`)`.
    - If `this.table` (view name) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into these SQL queries, leading to SQL injection. For example, if a view is named `evil_view; DROP TABLE users;--`, the `drop()` function would execute `DROP view evil_view; DROP TABLE users;--`, potentially dropping the `users` table.

* Security test case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a view with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE VIEW "evil_view; DROP TABLE users;--" AS SELECT * FROM some_table;`. Note that the quoting of the view name might be needed depending on the database system to allow special characters or spaces.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious view.
    4. Right-click on the view named `evil_view; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Show Source".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to showing the source of the `evil_view`. Check for error messages that might indicate SQL syntax errors or successful execution of injected commands.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time select "Drop View" on the malicious view.
    7. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database when attempting to drop the `evil_view`.
    8. If the `users` table is dropped in either test case, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

* Vulnerability name: SQL Injection in Function Source and Drop Function Operations
* Description:
    1. The `FunctionNode.showSource()` and `FunctionNode.drop()` functions in `/code/src/model/main/function.ts` construct and execute SQL queries to show the source code and drop functions, respectively.
    2. These functions use `this.name` property, which is derived from the function name in the database.
    3. If the `this.name` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named functions), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.
    4. Specifically, if a function name contains malicious SQL code, this code could be executed when `showSource()` or `drop()` is called.
* Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    - Data breach: Potential access to sensitive data in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in the database.

    ```
    - In `showSource()`, `this.name` is used in `this.dialect.showFunctionSource(this.schema,this.name)` and directly concatenated into the SQL string  `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS ${this.name};...`.
    - In `drop()`, `this.name` is used in `this.execute(\`DROP function ${this.wrap(this.name)}\`)`.
    - If `this.name` (function name) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into these SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

* Security test case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a function with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE FUNCTION "evil_func; DROP TABLE users;--" () RETURNS INTEGER DETERMINISTIC RETURN 1;`.  Note that the quoting of the function name might be needed depending on the database system.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious function.
    4. Right-click on the function named `evil_func; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Show Source".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to showing the source of the `evil_func`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time select "Drop Function" on the malicious function.
    7. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database when attempting to drop the `evil_func`.
    8. If the `users` table is dropped in either test case, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

* Vulnerability name: SQL Injection in Trigger Source and Drop Trigger Operations
* Description:
    1. The `TriggerNode.showSource()` and `TriggerNode.drop()` functions in `/code/src/model/main/trigger.ts` construct and execute SQL queries to show the source code and drop triggers, respectively.
    2. These functions use `this.name` property, which is derived from the trigger name in the database.
    3. If the `this.name` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named triggers), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.
    4. Specifically, if a trigger name contains malicious SQL code, this code could be executed when `showSource()` or `drop()` is called.
* Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    - Data breach: Potential access to sensitive data in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in the database.
    - Privilege escalation (in certain scenarios): If the database user has elevated privileges, SQL injection could lead to further system compromise.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `TriggerNode.showSource()` and `TriggerNode.drop()` functions directly embed `this.name` into SQL queries without any sanitization or escaping.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and escaping of the `this.name` value in `TriggerNode.showSource()` and `TriggerNode.drop()` before embedding it into SQL queries.
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Escaping or whitelisting trigger names is necessary.
    - Validate the `this.name` value to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not include any SQL injection payloads.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must connect to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) that either is controlled by an attacker or contains database objects (triggers in this case) with maliciously crafted names.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create or rename triggers in the database to include SQL injection payloads in their names.
    - The user must then browse to the trigger with the malicious name in the Database Explorer and attempt to either "Show Source" or "Drop Trigger".
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/main/trigger.ts`
    ```typescript
    public async showSource() {
        this.execute(this.dialect.showTriggerSource(this.schema, this.name)) // Vulnerable query
            .then((procedDtails) => {
                const procedDtail = procedDtails[0]
                QueryUnit.showSQLTextDocument(this, `${this.dialect.dropTriggerTemplate(this.wrap(this.name))};\n${procedDtail['SQL Original Statement']}`); // Vulnerable string concatenation
            });
    }

    public drop() {
        if (this.dbType == DatabaseType.PG) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage("This extension not support drop postgresql trigger.")
            return;
        }
        Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to drop trigger ${this.name} ?`, async () => {
            this.execute(this.dialect.dropTriggerTemplate(this.wrap(this.name))).then(() => { // Vulnerable query
                this.parent.setChildCache(null)

                vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Drop trigger ${this.name} success!`)
            })
        })

    }
    ```
    - In `showSource()`, `this.name` is used in `this.dialect.showTriggerSource(this.schema, this.name)` and directly concatenated into the SQL string `${this.dialect.dropTriggerTemplate(this.wrap(this.name))};...`.
    - In `drop()`, `this.name` is used in `this.execute(this.dialect.dropTriggerTemplate(this.wrap(this.name)))`.
    - If `this.name` (trigger name) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into these SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

* Security test case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a trigger with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE TRIGGER "evil_trigger; DROP TABLE users;--" BEFORE INSERT ON some_table FOR EACH ROW BEGIN END;`. Note that the quoting of the trigger name might be needed depending on the database system.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious trigger.
    4. Right-click on the trigger named `evil_trigger; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Show Source".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to showing the source of the `evil_trigger`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time select "Drop Trigger" on the malicious trigger.
    7. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database when attempting to drop the `evil_trigger`.
    8. If the `users` table is dropped in either test case, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

* Vulnerability name: SQL Injection in Procedure Source and Drop Procedure Operations
* Description:
    1. The `ProcedureNode.showSource()` and `ProcedureNode.drop()` functions in `/code/src/model/main/procedure.ts` construct and execute SQL queries to show the source code and drop procedures, respectively.
    2. These functions use `this.name` property, which is derived from the procedure name in the database.
    3. If the `this.name` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named procedures), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.
    4. Specifically, if a procedure name contains malicious SQL code, this code could be executed when `showSource()` or `drop()` is called.
* Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.

    - The attacker needs to be able to create or rename procedures in the database to include SQL injection payloads in their names.
    - The user must then browse to the procedure with the malicious name in the Database Explorer and attempt to either "Show Source" or "Drop Procedure".
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/model/main/procedure.ts`
    ```typescript
    public async showSource() {
        this.execute<any[]>(this.dialect.showProcedureSource(this.schema, this.name)) // Vulnerable query

            })
        })

    }
    ```
    - In `showSource()`, `this.name` is used in `this.dialect.showProcedureSource(this.schema, this.name)` and directly concatenated into the SQL string  `DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS ${this.name};...`.
    - In `drop()`, `this.name` is used in `this.execute(\`DROP procedure ${this.wrap(this.name)}\`)`.
    - If `this.name` (procedure name) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into these SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

* Security test case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a procedure with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE PROCEDURE "evil_proc; DROP TABLE users;--" () BEGIN SELECT 1; END;`. Note that the quoting of the procedure name might be needed depending on the database system.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious procedure.
    4. Right-click on the procedure named `evil_proc; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Show Source".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to showing the source of the `evil_proc`.
    6. Repeat steps 3-4, but this time select "Drop Procedure" on the malicious procedure.
    7. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database when attempting to drop the `evil_proc`.
    8. If the `users` table is dropped in either test case, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

---
* Vulnerability name: SQL Injection in Table Drop Operation
* Description:
    1. The `TableNode.dropTable()` function in `/code/src/model/main/tableNode.ts` constructs and executes SQL queries to drop tables.
    2. This function uses `this.table` property, which is derived from the table name in the database.
    3. If the `this.table` value is not properly sanitized and could be influenced by an attacker (e.g., through a compromised database or a database with maliciously named tables), it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the constructed queries.
    4. Specifically, if a table name contains malicious SQL code, this code could be executed when `dropTable()` is called.
* Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    - Data breach: Potential access to sensitive data in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Ability to modify or delete data in the database.

            });
        })

    }
    ```
    - In `dropTable()`, `this.table` is used in `this.execute(\`DROP TABLE ${this.wrap(this.table)}\`)`.
    - If `this.table` (table name) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into this SQL query, leading to SQL injection. For example, if a table is named `evil_table; DROP TABLE users;--`, the `dropTable()` function would execute `DROP TABLE evil_table; DROP TABLE users;--`, potentially dropping the `users` table.

* Security test case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a table with a malicious name, for example: `CREATE TABLE "evil_table; DROP TABLE users;--" (id INT);`. Note that the quoting of the table name might be needed depending on the database system.
    2. Configure the Database Client extension to connect to this database.
    3. In the Database Explorer, navigate to the schema containing the malicious table.
    4. Right-click on the table named `evil_table; DROP TABLE users;--` and select "Drop Table".
    5. Observe if the `users` table is dropped from the database in addition to dropping the `evil_table`.
    6. If the `users` table is dropped, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability.

---
* Vulnerability name: Export to SQL Injection
* Description:
    1. The extension provides a data export functionality, including exporting data to SQL format using `ExportService.exportToSql` in `/code/src/service/export/exportService.ts`.
    2. The `exportToSql` function iterates through rows of data and constructs SQL `INSERT` statements.
    3. For each row, it iterates through the keys and values, directly embedding the values into the SQL string without proper sanitization or escaping.
    4. If the exported data (values in `rows`) contains malicious SQL code, it will be directly embedded into the generated `INSERT` statements.
    5. When this exported SQL file is executed (e.g., imported into another database or executed via SQL client), the injected malicious SQL code will be executed, leading to SQL injection.
* Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL commands via exported data.
    - If a user exports data and then executes the exported SQL file without inspecting it, malicious SQL commands embedded in the exported data will be executed.
    - This could lead to data breach, data manipulation, or other malicious actions depending on the injected SQL code and the privileges of the user executing the SQL script.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The `exportToSql` function performs direct string concatenation of values into SQL queries without any sanitization or escaping.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement proper sanitization and escaping of all values being embedded into the SQL `INSERT` statements in `ExportService.exportToSql`.
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements if possible for SQL export, or use appropriate escaping functions provided by database libraries (e.g., `sqlstring.escape` for MySQL, or equivalent for other databases) to sanitize values before embedding them into SQL strings.
    - Educate users about the risks of executing SQL files exported from untrusted sources and recommend reviewing exported SQL files before execution.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must export data from a database table using the extension's export functionality and choose "SQL" as the export format.
    - The data being exported must contain malicious SQL code. This could be achieved if the attacker has previously injected malicious data into the database or if the data source itself is malicious.
    - The user must then execute the exported SQL file, trusting that it is safe.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/export/exportService.ts`
    ```typescript
    private exportToSql(exportContext: ExportContext) {

        const { rows, exportPath } = exportContext;
        if (rows.length == 0) {
            // show waraing
            return;
        }

        let sql = ``;
        for (const row of rows) {
            let columns = "";
            let values = "";
            for (const key in row) {
                columns += `${key},`
                values += `${row[key] != null ? `'${row[key]}'` : 'null'},` // Vulnerable value embedding
            }
            sql += `insert into ${exportContext.table}(${columns.replace(/.$/, '')}) values(${values.replace(/.$/, '')});\n` // Vulnerable string concatenation
        }
        fs.writeFileSync(exportPath, sql);
    }
    ```
    - In the `exportToSql` function, the code iterates through each `row` and then each `key` in the row to construct `INSERT` statements.
    - The line `values += `${row[key] != null ? `'${row[key]}'` : 'null'},`` directly embeds `row[key]` into the `values` string.
    - There is no sanitization or escaping applied to `row[key]` before embedding it into the SQL string.
    - If `row[key]` contains malicious SQL, such as `'value'); DROP TABLE users; --` or similar, it will be inserted into the SQL string as is.
    - When this exported SQL is executed, the injected SQL commands will be executed.

* Security test case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    2. Insert a row into a table where one of the column values contains a SQL injection payload. For example, insert a row with a column value set to: `malicious_value'); DROP TABLE users; --`.
    3. Using the Database Client extension, connect to this database and table.
    4. Execute a query that retrieves the row containing the malicious value.
    5. Export the result of this query to a SQL file using the extension's export functionality.
    6. Open the exported SQL file and examine the generated `INSERT` statement. You should see the malicious SQL payload directly embedded in the `VALUES` clause.
    7. Attempt to execute this exported SQL file against a database (you can use a test database for safety).
    8. Observe if the injected SQL command (e.g., `DROP TABLE users;`) is executed when the exported SQL file is run. If the `users` table (or another targeted action) is performed, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability in SQL export.

---
* Vulnerability name: Mock Data SQL Injection
* Description:
    1. The extension provides a mock data generation feature using `MockRunner.runMock()` in `/code/src/service/mock/mockRunner.ts`.
    2. The `runMock` function reads a mock data configuration (JSON) and generates SQL `INSERT` statements based on this configuration.
    3. It iterates through columns defined in the mock configuration and substitutes placeholders in an `insertSqlTemplate` with mock values.
    4. The mock values are generated using `Mock.mock(value)` where `value` is taken from the mock configuration.
    5. If the mock configuration is crafted maliciously, or if the `getMockValue` function or template replacement logic is flawed, it could lead to SQL injection in the generated `INSERT` statements.
    6. When these generated SQL statements are executed against the database, the injected SQL code will be executed.
* Impact:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL commands via crafted mock data configurations.
    - If a user is tricked into using a malicious mock configuration file, or if the configuration is somehow compromised, running the mock data generation could result in arbitrary SQL execution on the database server.
    - This could lead to data breach, data manipulation, or other malicious actions depending on the injected SQL code and the privileges of the database user.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code generates SQL queries by directly substituting mock values into a template without proper sanitization or escaping.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement proper sanitization and escaping of mock values before embedding them into SQL `INSERT` statements in `MockRunner.runMock`.
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for mock data insertion to prevent SQL injection.
    - Validate and sanitize the mock configuration input to prevent injection of malicious payloads through the configuration itself.
    - Review and harden the `getMockValue` function and template replacement logic to ensure that it does not introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must use the mock data generation feature of the extension.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the mock data configuration used by the `MockRunner.runMock()` function. This could be achieved by:
        - Social engineering to convince a user to use a malicious mock configuration file.
        - Compromising the workspace and replacing the mock configuration file.
        - Exploiting a hypothetical configuration injection vulnerability to modify the mock settings.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/mock/mockRunner.ts`
    ```typescript
    public async runMock() {

        const content = vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.getText()
        const mockModel = JSON.parse(content) as MockModel;
        ...
        const insertSqlTemplate = (await tableNode.insertSqlTemplate(false)).replace("\n", " ");
        const sqlList = [];
        const mockData = mockModel.mock;
        const { mockStartIndex, mockCount } = mockModel
        ...
            for (let i = startIndex; i < count; i++) {
                let tempInsertSql = insertSqlTemplate;
                for (const column in mockData) {
                    let value = mockData[column].value;
                    if (value && (typeof value == "string")) { value = value.replace(/^'|'$/g, "\\'") }
                    if (value == this.MOCK_INDEX) { value = i; }
                    tempInsertSql = tempInsertSql.replace(new RegExp("\\$+" + column + "(,|\\s)", 'ig'), this.wrapQuote(mockData[column].type, Mock.mock(value)) + "$1"); // Vulnerable replacement
                }
                sqlList.push(tempInsertSql)
            }
        ...
    }
    ```
    - In the `runMock` function, SQL `INSERT` statements are generated within the loop.
    - The line `tempInsertSql = tempInsertSql.replace(new RegExp("\\$+" + column + "(,|\\s)", 'ig'), this.wrapQuote(mockData[column].type, Mock.mock(value)) + "$1");` performs the value substitution.
    - `Mock.mock(value)` generates mock data based on the `value` from the mock configuration.
    - `this.wrapQuote(mockData[column].type, Mock.mock(value))` attempts to wrap the value in quotes based on the column type, but this is not sufficient for preventing SQL injection.
    - If the mock configuration contains a malicious `value` that includes SQL injection payloads, `Mock.mock(value)` might generate a string that, when inserted into the SQL template, will result in valid SQL injection. For example, a malicious mock configuration could set a `value` to `"; DROP TABLE users; --"`, and if this is used in the `replace` operation, it can inject the `DROP TABLE users;` command into the generated SQL.

* Security test case:
    1. Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    2. Create a table in the database (e.g., `test_table` with columns `id INT`, `name VARCHAR`).
    3. Create a mock configuration JSON file for this table. In the mock configuration, for one of the columns (e.g., `name`), set the `value` to a malicious SQL injection payload, such as `"; DROP TABLE users; --"`.
    4. Open this mock configuration file in VSCode.
    5. Run the "Run Mock" command in the editor with the mock configuration file active.
    6. Observe if the `users` table (or another targeted table) is dropped from the database when the mock data generation process is executed. Check for error messages or database state changes that indicate successful SQL injection.
    7. If the `users` table (or another targeted action) is performed, it confirms the SQL injection vulnerability in mock data generation.

* Vulnerability name: SSH Tunnel Native Command Injection
* Description:
    1. The extension uses `child_process.spawn` in `SSHTunnelService.createTunnel()` in `/code/src/service/tunnel/sshTunnelService.ts` to execute the native `ssh` command for establishing SSH tunnels.
    2. The command arguments are constructed in the `args` array, which includes parameters from `sshConfig`, such as `sshConfig.privateKeyPath`, `config.host`, and `config.port`.
    3. If any of these `sshConfig` properties can be influenced by an attacker and are not properly sanitized, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities in the `spawn('ssh', args)` call.
    4. Specifically, if `sshConfig.privateKeyPath` or `config.host` contains malicious shell metacharacters or commands, they could be executed by the `spawn` call.
* Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine: Successful command injection in the `spawn('ssh', args)` call would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - System compromise: This could potentially lead to full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or further attacks.
* Vulnerability rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly constructs the `ssh` command arguments using `sshConfig` properties without any sanitization or validation to prevent command injection.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and validation of all `sshConfig` properties used in constructing the `args` array for `child_process.spawn` in `SSHTunnelService.createTunnel()`. This includes `sshConfig.privateKeyPath`, `config.host`, `config.port`, and any other parameters passed to the `ssh` command.
    - Ensure that these values cannot be influenced by external attacker input in a way that could lead to command injection.
    - Consider using safer methods for constructing and executing shell commands, or use libraries that offer parameterized command execution to prevent command injection in `child_process.spawn`.
    - If direct command construction is necessary, properly escape or quote all dynamic parts of the command arguments to prevent interpretation as shell commands.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must have an SSH connection configured in the extension and choose to use the "native" SSH tunnel type.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the `sshConfig.host` or `sshConfig.privateKeyPath` values used when the `createTunnel` function is called. This could be through configuration injection or by exploiting another vulnerability to modify the SSH connection settings.
    - The user must attempt to establish an SSH tunnel using the vulnerable SSH connection with the "native" type.
* Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/service/tunnel/sshTunnelService.ts`
    ```typescript
    public createTunnel(node: Node, errorCallback: (error) => void): Promise<Node> {
        return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
            ...
            if (ssh.type == 'native') {
                let args = ['-TnNL', `${port}:${config.dstHost}:${config.dstPort}`, config.host, '-p', `${config.port}`];
                if (ssh.privateKeyPath) {
                    args.push('-i', ssh.privateKeyPath) // Vulnerable argument
                }
                const bat = spawn('ssh', args); // Vulnerable spawn call
                ...
            }
            ...
        })
    }
    ```
    - In the `createTunnel` function, when `ssh.type == 'native'`, the code constructs an `args` array for the `ssh` command.
    - `args.push('-i', ssh.privateKeyPath)` adds the private key path to the arguments. If `ssh.privateKeyPath` is attacker-controlled and contains malicious characters, it can lead to command injection. For example, if `ssh.privateKeyPath` is set to `"; calc &"`, the `spawn('ssh', args)` call might execute `calc` command after the `ssh` command.
    - Similarly, while less immediately apparent, `config.host` and `config.port` are also added to the `args` and if these are attacker-controlled, they could potentially be exploited for command injection, though it might be more complex to construct a working payload through these parameters in this specific `ssh` command structure. The `privateKeyPath` is the most direct injection point here.

* Security test case:
    1. Configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension and set the tunnel type to "native".
    2. Modify the SSH connection settings (either manually or by exploiting a hypothetical configuration injection vulnerability) to set the `privateKeyPath` to:  `/path/to/key & calc`. (or `/path/to/key; calc` on Linux/macOS, assuming `/path/to/key` is a valid, but irrelevant private key path or even a non-existent path).
    3. Attempt to establish an SSH tunnel using this modified connection.
    4. Observe if the calculator application (`calc`) starts on your local machine during the SSH tunnel creation process.
    5. If the calculator application starts, it confirms the command injection vulnerability in the native SSH tunnel functionality. You can replace `calc` with other more harmful commands for further testing, but exercise caution.
