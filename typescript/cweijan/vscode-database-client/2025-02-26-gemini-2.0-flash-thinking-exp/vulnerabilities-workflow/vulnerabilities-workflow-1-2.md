- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in External Process Execution  
  **Description:**  
  The extension uses functions to spawn or execute external processes (for example, when starting an SSH tunnel or launching a terminal) by constructing shell command strings with user‑controlled configuration values (such as host, port, username, private‑key path, etc.) without proper sanitization. An attacker able to supply or alter these values (for instance by modifying a malicious workspace file or extension configuration) may include shell metacharacters and inject extra commands.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Arbitrary command execution on the host system  
  - Full system compromise, data exfiltration, and lateral movement  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The code uses Node’s `child_process` APIs in argument‑array mode in some branches but does not consistently validate or escape all user‑supplied values  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validate and escape all configuration inputs before interpolating them into command strings  
  - Where possible, use APIs that separate command names from arguments  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must have the ability to supply or modify connection configuration values (for example, via a malicious workspace file)  
  - The vulnerable functionality (e.g. launching an SSH tunnel/terminal) must be invoked  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In files such as `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`, command strings are built by directly embedding configuration values—for example:  
    ```js
    if (this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath) {
      exec(`cmd /c start ssh -i ${this.sshConfig.privateKeyPath} -qTnN -D 127.0.0.1:1080 root@${this.sshConfig.host}`)
    } else {
      exec(`cmd /c start ssh -qTnN -D 127.0.0.1:1080 root@${this.sshConfig.host}`)
    }
    ```  
    Both the private key path and the host are inserted without proper sanitization.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Modify a connection configuration (for example, set the `sshConfig.host` to  
     ```
     example.com && echo hacked > /tmp/hacked.txt
     ```
     ).  
  2. Trigger the vulnerable functionality (e.g. start the SOCKS proxy or open a terminal from the extension).  
  3. Monitor the host system for evidence (such as checking for a created file `/tmp/hacked.txt`).  
  4. After applying input validation and safer API usage, confirm that command injection is no longer possible.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Directory Traversal in Local File Management Operations  
  **Description:**  
  The file‑management routine (specifically in the `FileManager.record()` function) concatenates a user‑supplied file name with a fixed storage path after applying only minimal regex stripping (which removes a few forbidden special characters) but does not remove directory traversal sequences (such as `../`). An attacker controlling the file name (e.g. via a “new file” command) could supply a name like `"../../evil.txt"` to write files outside the intended directory.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Unauthorized file creation, modification or overwrite outside the designated storage directory  
  - Potential privilege escalation or further exploitation on the host  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - A regular expression is used to strip characters like `: * ? " < >`  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Normalize and validate the final file path (using Node’s `path.normalize`) and ensure it remains within the allowed storage directory  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must be able to supply an arbitrary file name via the file management UI  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/common/filesManager.ts`, the file name is sanitized only by removing some special characters and then concatenated to the storage path:
    ```js
    fileName = fileName.replace(/[\:\*\?"\<\>]*/g,"")
    const recordPath = `${this.storagePath}/${fileName}`;
    ```  
    This process does not remove directory traversal sequences like `"../"`.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Trigger the “new file” command in the file management view  
  2. Enter a file name such as `"../../malicious.txt"`  
  3. Verify on disk that `malicious.txt` is not created outside of the designated storage directory  
  4. After applying proper path normalization, re-run the test to confirm that traversal input is blocked

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Remote Directory Traversal in SFTP Operations  
  **Description:**  
  In SSH‑based file management (for example, when creating new files on a remote server), the extension builds remote file paths by concatenating a base path with user-provided file names without restraining directory traversal characters. An attacker controlling the file name can use traversal sequences (e.g. `"../"`) to access or modify files outside the designated folder on the remote SSH server.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Creation, modification, or deletion of arbitrary files on the remote server  
  - Potential unauthorized access to sensitive system files or data  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No proper sanitization or normalization is applied to user‑supplied remote file names  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Normalize remote file paths and strictly reject names that contain traversal patterns  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must be able to supply file or folder names (for example, via the “new file” command in the remote file management view) and trigger the SSH file operation  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`, methods like `newFile()` concatenate unsanitized input (obtained via `vscode.window.showInputBox()`) with a base remote path, forming a path vulnerable to traversal  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Use the SSH file management UI to create a new file  
  2. Enter an input such as `"../../malicious.txt"`  
  3. Verify on the remote host whether the file is erroneously created outside the intended directory  
  4. After path sanitization is implemented, repeat the test to confirm that traversal input is rejected

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Eval in MongoConnection Query Handling  
  **Description:**  
  Within the MongoDB connection implementation, the `query()` method (in `/code/src/service/connect/mongoConnection.ts`) concatenates `"this.client."` with a user‑supplied query string and then passes the resulting string to the JavaScript `eval()` function. Because the query text is not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker able to supply arbitrary query text may inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed within the extension’s context.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension context  
  - Possible full system compromise, data theft, or unauthorized database manipulation  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No input validation or safeguards are applied around the use of `eval()`  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Remove the use of `eval()` entirely and replace it with safe, parameterized logic  
  - Enforce a strict whitelist of allowed query commands  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must be able to supply query text via the extension’s query field (or by manipulating workspace configuration)  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/service/connect/mongoConnection.ts`, when the query is not a simple “show dbs”, the code performs:  
    ```js
    const result = await eval('this.client.' + sql)
    ```  
    This direct concatenation without sanitization enables injection of arbitrary code.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Connect to a MongoDB instance via the extension and in the query input, supply a malicious payload (for example:  
     ```
     constructor('fs.writeFileSync("/tmp/hacked.txt", "hacked")')()
     ```
     )  
  2. Execute the query and verify that the injected code executes (for example, by checking for the presence of `/tmp/hacked.txt`)  
  3. After replacing `eval()` with a safe alternative, repeat the test to ensure no code execution occurs

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Unvalidated Input in Forward Service Exec Command  
  **Description:**  
  The SSH forwarding service (in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/forwardService.ts`) listens for a `"cmd"` event and directly interpolates the associated user‑supplied payload into a shell command which is executed by calling `exec()`. Because the payload is not sanitized, an attacker can embed additional commands using shell metacharacters, thereby executing arbitrary commands via the forwarding service.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Arbitrary command execution on the host system  
  - Full system compromise with subsequent data exfiltration and remote code execution  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No validation or escaping is applied to the payload received from the webview event  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validate and escape all input from the forwarding service before including it in the command  
  - Consider restricting or removing the functionality that allows sending arbitrary commands  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must be able to trigger the `"cmd"` event (for example, through the forwarding service UI) and supply malicious input  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/forwardService.ts`, the code includes:  
    ```js
    }).on("cmd", (content) => {
        exec(`cmd.exe /C start cmd /C ${content}`)
    })
    ```  
    Here, the unsanitized `content` is directly passed to `exec()`, allowing injection (for example, a payload like `echo hacked && notepad.exe`).  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Use the forwarding service UI to trigger the `"cmd"` event  
  2. Supply a payload such as:  
     ```
     echo hacked && notepad.exe
     ```  
  3. Verify that the malicious command is executed (for example, Notepad is launched)  
  4. After applying input validation, re-test to ensure that injection is blocked

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Unsanitized mysqldump Command in MySQL Dump Service  
  **Description:**  
  In the MySQL dump service (in `/code/src/service/dump/mysqlDumpService.ts`), the shell command to invoke the `mysqldump` utility is built by concatenating various connection parameters (host, port, user, password, schema, table list, etc.) directly into the command string without proper escaping. An attacker able to tamper with these configuration parameters may inject additional shell commands.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Arbitrary command execution on the host machine  
  - Full system compromise and potential data exfiltration  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No sanitization or escaping is applied when constructing the mysqldump command  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Sanitize and escape all arguments prior to insertion into the shell command  
  - Use APIs that separate command and arguments rather than concatenating strings  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must be able to supply or modify database connection parameters via a malicious configuration  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/service/dump/mysqlDumpService.ts`, the mysqldump command is built as:  
    ```js
    const command = `mysqldump -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} -p${node.password}${data} --skip-add-locks ${node.schema} ${tables}>${folderPath.fsPath}`
    ```  
    Unsanitized parameters allow shell metacharacter injection.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Modify a MySQL connection configuration (for example, set the password to  
     ```
     secret&&echo hacked > C:\temp\hacked.txt
     ```  
     )  
  2. Trigger the MySQL dump process via the extension  
  3. Verify on the host that the injected command is executed, for instance by checking for the file `C:\temp\hacked.txt`  
  4. After mitigating by escaping inputs, re-run the test to confirm injection is prevented

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in Database CLI Terminal Launcher  
  **Description:**  
  The extension’s routine for launching database CLI tools (in `/code/src/model/interface/node.ts`) constructs shell commands for various database tools (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) by directly concatenating connection parameters (such as username, password, host, port, etc.). If any field contains shell metacharacters, an attacker may inject additional commands that execute when the terminal starts.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Arbitrary command execution through the spawned CLI terminal  
  - Potential full system compromise, data exfiltration, and unauthorized modifications  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No sanitization or argument separation is applied when constructing the CLI command  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validate and escape all connection parameters before constructing the command  
  - Use safer methods (for example, argument arrays or parameterized API calls) to launch the terminal  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must be able to influence connection configuration values (for example, via a malicious workspace file) and trigger the terminal launch functionality  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/model/interface/node.ts`, commands such as:  
    ```js
    command = `mysql -u ${this.user} -p${this.password} -h ${this.host} -P ${this.port} \n`;
    ```  
    are constructed without sanitization.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Craft a connection configuration (e.g. for a MySQL connection) with a malicious password like:  
     ```
     pass; echo "injected" > /tmp/injected.txt
     ```  
  2. Invoke the “open terminal” functionality for that connection  
  3. Check that the injected command is executed (for example, verify whether `/tmp/injected.txt` is created)  
  4. After applying input sanitization and secure command construction, re-run the test to ensure injection is no longer possible

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in User Management Operations  
  **Description:**  
  The `drop()` method in the user management routine (in `/code/src/model/database/userNode.ts`) constructs an SQL command by directly concatenating the username into a DROP USER statement without any sanitization. An attacker controlling the username (for example, by creating a user with a crafted name) could inject additional SQL commands.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Arbitrary SQL command execution using the extension’s database connection privileges  
  - Potential deletion of critical data or unauthorized modifications in the target database  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No input sanitization or parameterization is applied to the username in the SQL command  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Use parameterized queries or proper escaping/quoting of the username when building the SQL statement  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must be able to control or influence database usernames (for example, by creating a user account with a malicious name) and trigger the “drop” operation via the extension’s interface  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/model/database/userNode.ts`, the drop method is implemented as:  
    ```js
    public drop() {
      Util.confirm(`Are you sure you want to drop user ${this.username} ?`, async () => {
          this.execute(`DROP user ${this.username}`)
          // additional processing…
      })
    }
    ```  
    The direct concatenation of `this.username` without sanitization enables SQL injection (for example, a username such as `admin; DROP DATABASE important` would inject an extra command).  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In your database, create a user with a malicious name like:  
     ```
     admin; DROP DATABASE important
     ```  
  2. In the extension, navigate to the user management view and trigger the “drop” operation for that user  
  3. Observe that the resulting SQL becomes:  
     ```
     DROP user admin; DROP DATABASE important
     ```  
     causing the injected command to execute  
  4. After implementing proper sanitization or using parameterized queries, re-run the test to verify that injection is blocked

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in Database Import Services *(New)*  
  **Description:**  
  The import functionalities for MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are implemented by constructing shell command strings using unsanitized and unescaped configuration values. In the following files:  
  - In `/code/src/service/import/mongoImportService.ts`, the command is constructed as:  
    ```js
    const command = `mongoimport -h ${host}:${port} --db ${node.database} --jsonArray -c identitycounters --type json ${importPath}`
    ```  
  - In `/code/src/service/import/mysqlImportService.ts`, the command is built as:  
    ```js
    const command = `mysql -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} ${node.password ? `-p${node.password}` : ""} ${node.schema || ""} < ${importPath}`
    ```  
  - In `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`, the command is built as:  
    ```js
    const command = `psql -h ${host} -p ${port} -U ${node.user} -d ${node.database} < ${importPath}`
    ```  
  In each case, parameters such as host, port, database name, user, password, and file path are directly inserted into the command string without any sanitization or escaping. As a result, an attacker who can supply or modify these configuration fields (for instance, via a malicious workspace file or configuration injection) could inject additional shell commands.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Arbitrary command execution on the host system, leading to full system compromise  
  - Data exfiltration and unauthorized system modifications  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No mitigations are applied in the import service modules; the commands are constructed using template literals without input validation or escaping  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validate and properly escape all configuration inputs before constructing shell commands  
  - Use safe APIs (such as providing command arguments as an array) to avoid shell interpretation  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to supply or modify the database connection settings (e.g. host, port, database, user, password, and file path) via a malicious configuration or workspace file  
  - The import functionality must be triggered via the extension’s UI  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In **MongoImportService:**  
    The command string is built by directly interpolating unsanitized values:
    ```js
    const command = `mongoimport -h ${host}:${port} --db ${node.database} --jsonArray -c identitycounters --type json ${importPath}`
    ```  
  - In **MysqlImportService:**  
    The command string is constructed without escaping:
    ```js
    const command = `mysql -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} ${node.password ? `-p${node.password}` : ""} ${node.schema || ""} < ${importPath}`
    ```  
  - In **PostgresqlImortService:**  
    Similarly, the command is built as:
    ```js
    const command = `psql -h ${host} -p ${port} -U ${node.user} -d ${node.database} < ${importPath}`
    ```  
  In every case, this unsanitized concatenation permits an attacker to inject additional shell commands.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Configure a database connection (for example, for MongoDB) and set one of the parameters—such as the database name—to a malicious payload:  
     ```
     testdb; echo "hacked" > /tmp/hacked.txt
     ```  
  2. Save this configuration in the workspace settings and trigger the import operation via the extension’s UI  
  3. Verify on the host system whether the injected command executes (for example, check if the file `/tmp/hacked.txt` is created with the expected content)  
  4. After implementing proper validation and safe command construction, re-run the test to confirm that injection is prevented

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in MySQL Data Dump Utility *(New)*  
  **Description:**  
  The data dump functionality for MySQL (implemented in `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getDataDump.ts`) builds SQL queries by directly concatenating a table name and an optional WHERE clause from user‑supplied dump options without proper sanitization. An attacker able to modify the dump configuration (for example, via a malicious workspace file) may supply a malicious table name or WHERE clause that injects arbitrary SQL commands into the SELECT statement.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Execution of unintended SQL queries on the target database  
  - Possible data leakage, unauthorized data modification, or deletion  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No input sanitization or parameterization is applied in the construction of the SQL query  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validate and escape table names and WHERE clause inputs before constructing the query  
  - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to safely incorporate user‑supplied values  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must be able to supply or modify the dump configuration (specifically, the list of tables and the associated WHERE conditions) via a malicious workspace file or configuration injection  
  - The dump operation must be triggered through the extension’s UI  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getDataDump.ts`, the code constructs the query as follows:
    ```js
    const where = options.where[table] ? ` WHERE ${options.where[table]}` : '';
    const query = connection.query(`SELECT * FROM ${table}${where}`) as EventEmitter;
    ```  
    Both the `table` variable and the WHERE clause from `options.where[table]` are interpolated directly into the SQL string without sanitization.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Modify the dump configuration to supply a malicious table name (e.g.,  
     ```
     users; DROP TABLE sensitive_data;--
     ```
     ) or a WHERE clause (e.g.,  
     ```
     1=1; DROP TABLE valuable;--
     ```
     ).  
  2. Trigger the dump operation via the extension’s UI.  
  3. Observe whether the injected SQL commands are executed against the database (for instance, by checking if the target table is dropped).  
  4. After applying input validation and parameterized query mechanisms, re-run the test to confirm that SQL injection is prevented.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Write via Unvalidated Dump File Path in MySQL Dump Process *(New)*  
  **Description:**  
  In the MySQL dump process (implemented in `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/main.ts`), the dump file path is provided by the user via the `dumpToFile` configuration option and is subsequently used directly in file system write operations (using `fs.writeFileSync` and `fs.appendFileSync`) without any sanitization or validation. An attacker who controls this configuration value can specify an arbitrary file path, potentially overwriting critical files on the host system.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Overwriting or corrupting critical system or user files  
  - Potential arbitrary code execution if system-critical files are replaced  
  - Compromise of system integrity and confidentiality  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No validation or sanitization is performed on the `dumpToFile` file path  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validate and restrict the file path to a safe, pre‑defined directory  
  - Use proper path normalization (e.g., via `path.normalize`) and verify that the resolved path resides within an allowed directory  
  - Optionally, prompt the user for confirmation if a non‑standard or potentially dangerous path is provided  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - Attacker must be able to supply or modify the `dumpToFile` configuration (for example, via a malicious workspace file or configuration injection)  
  - The dump functionality must be triggered via the extension’s UI  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/main.ts`, the relevant code is:
    ```js
    // Clear the destination file
    fs.writeFileSync(options.dumpToFile, '');
    // Append headers and subsequent dump data
    fs.appendFileSync(options.dumpToFile, `${HEADER_VARIABLES}\n`);
    ```
    The file path provided in `options.dumpToFile` is consumed directly without any path validation.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Modify the extension’s configuration to set `dumpToFile` to an arbitrary, sensitive file path (e.g., on Windows:  
     ```
     C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
     ```
     or on Unix:  
     ```
     /etc/passwd
     ```
     ).  
  2. Initiate the MySQL dump operation via the extension’s UI.  
  3. Verify that the file at the specified location is created or overwritten with the dump data.  
  4. After implementing proper file path validation and restrictions, re-run the test to confirm that only allowed file paths are accepted and arbitrary file writes are blocked.
