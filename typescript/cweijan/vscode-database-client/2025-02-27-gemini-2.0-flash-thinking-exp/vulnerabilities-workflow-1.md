### Vulnerability List for Database Client VSCode Extension

#### SSH Tunnel Port Forwarding Vulnerability

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to a database server that is intended to be protected by an SSH tunnel.
    2. The attacker needs to know the local port that the VSCode extension is using for the SSH tunnel, which, while not directly exposed, might be discoverable through local port scanning or other means if the attacker has some level of access to the user's machine or network.
    3. The attacker then connects to the exposed local port on the user's machine, bypassing the intended security of the SSH tunnel and directly accessing the database server.
    4. This is possible because the extension, when setting up port forwarding, reuses existing tunnels based on connection details (`getId` function in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js`), but it doesn't properly manage or restrict access to these forwarded ports. If a tunnel is already established for a given SSH connection, any subsequent connection attempt for the same SSH configuration will reuse the existing tunnel, potentially leaving the forwarded port open even after the original VSCode session that initiated the tunnel has ended or disconnected.

- **Impact:**
    - High. Unauthorized database access. If an attacker can discover the locally forwarded port, they can bypass the SSH tunnel and connect directly to the database server, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The code reuses existing tunnels without proper access control on the forwarded ports.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Implement proper tunnel management and access control.
    - Ensure that forwarded ports are closed when the VSCode extension disconnects or is closed.
    - Consider using dynamically generated ports that are harder to predict.
    - Implement authentication or authorization checks for connections to forwarded ports.

- **Preconditions:**
    - User must have established an SSH tunnel to a database server using the Database Client extension.
    - Attacker must be able to discover or guess the local port used for SSH tunnel forwarding.
    - Attacker must be able to connect to the user's localhost on the discovered port.

- **Source code analysis:**
    1. File: `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js`
    2. Function `getId(config)` creates a unique identifier for SSH tunnels based on connection parameters.
    ```javascript
    function getId(config) {
        return `${config.host}_${config.port}_${config.localHost}_${config.localPort}_${config.remoteHost}_${config.remotePort}`;
    }
    ```
    3. Function `bindSSHConnection(config, netConnection)` checks for existing tunnels using `tunelMark[id]`.
    ```javascript
    function bindSSHConnection(config, netConnection) {
        let id = getId(config)
        function forward(sshConnection, netConnection) {
            if (tunelMark[id]) { // reuse existing tunnel
                forward(tunelMark[id].connection, netConnection)
                return;
            }
            // ... rest of forward logic
        }
        if (tunelMark[id]) { // reuse existing tunnel
            forward(tunelMark[id].connection, netConnection)
            return;
        }
        // ... creates new tunnel if not exists
    }
    ```
    4. The `tunelMark` object acts as a cache for tunnels. It stores active SSH connections based on the `id`.
    5. When a new connection request comes in with the same `id`, the extension reuses the existing tunnel from `tunelMark` instead of creating a new, isolated tunnel.
    6. This reuse mechanism, while intended for performance and resource optimization, inadvertently leaves the forwarded port accessible even after the original connection is closed, as the tunnel itself persists in `tunelMark` until explicitly closed or the process terminates.
    7. There's no mechanism to restrict access to the forwarded port, meaning any application or user on the same machine can connect to `localhost:localPort` and access the database through the established tunnel.

- **Security test case:**
    1. Precondition: Ensure you have a database server (e.g., MySQL) and a way to connect to it (e.g., using `mysql` client).
    2. In VSCode, set up an SSH connection to your database server using the Database Client extension, configuring port forwarding (e.g., forward local port 3307 to remote database port 3306). Connect to the database using the extension.
    3. Verify that you can access the database through the extension.
    4. Disconnect the database connection in the VSCode extension.
    5. Open a terminal on the same machine where VSCode is running.
    6. Attempt to connect to the database server directly using a database client (e.g., `mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u <user> -p<password>`). Use the same credentials that you used for the SSH tunnel setup.
    7. Observe that you are able to connect to the database server through the forwarded port `3307`, even though the VSCode extension is disconnected. This proves that the SSH tunnel remains active and the port remains open for unauthorized access.
    8. Expected result: You should be able to connect to the database server directly through the forwarded port, even after disconnecting the extension, demonstrating the vulnerability.

#### SSH Tunnel Host Command Injection

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can control the `host` parameter in the SSH tunnel configuration.
    2. The `sshConfig` is passed to `sshConnection.connect(config)` in `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js` and `/code/src/service/tunnel/tunnel-ssh.js`.
    3. The `ssh2` library might be vulnerable to command injection if the `host` parameter is not properly sanitized, especially when using "native" SSH type.
    4. An attacker could craft a malicious host string that, when processed by the underlying SSH client, executes arbitrary commands on the system where the VSCode extension is running.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the machine running the VSCode extension, potentially gaining full control of the system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly uses the user-provided `host` in the `ssh2.Connection().connect(config)` call without any sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization for the `host` parameter in SSH tunnel configuration to prevent command injection.
    - Consider using safer methods for executing SSH commands if possible, or carefully validate all input passed to the `ssh2` library.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to configure an SSH connection in the Database Client extension.
    - The extension must be configured to use SSH tunneling.
    - The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the SSH connection settings, specifically the `host` field.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/service/tunnel/tunnel-ssh.js`
    ```javascript
    sshConnection.connect(config);
    ```
    - File: `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js`
    ```javascript
    sshConnection.connect(config);
    ```
    - File: `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js` - `getId` function uses host and port in ID, potentially vulnerable if used unsafely later.
    ```javascript
    function getId(config) {
        return `${config.host}_${config.port}_${config.localHost}_${config.localPort}_${config.remoteHost}_${config.remotePort}`;
    }
    ```
    - Visualization:
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Input: Malicious Host String] --> B(SSH Tunnel Config);
        B --> C{sshConnection.connect(config)};
        C --> D[ssh2 Library];
        D --> E{System Command Execution};
        E --> F[Remote Code Execution];
    ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. Open VSCode and install the Database Client extension.
    2. Open the Database Explorer panel.
    3. Click the '+' button to add a new connection.
    4. Select any database type that supports SSH tunneling (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    5. Configure the connection to use SSH Tunnel.
    6. In the SSH configuration, enter a malicious payload in the "host" field. For example: ``127.0.0.1 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null; touch /tmp/pwned ``
    7. Fill in other required SSH connection details (username, password or private key, etc.).
    8. Attempt to connect to the database using the configured SSH tunnel.
    9. Check if the command `touch /tmp/pwned` was executed on the system running VSCode. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms the command injection vulnerability.

#### SSH Tunnel Arbitrary Host/Port Connection

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker gains control over the configuration settings of the Database Client extension, either through compromised workspace settings or by convincing a user to import malicious settings.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious connection configuration that includes SSH tunneling.
    3. In the SSH tunnel configuration, the attacker specifies arbitrary values for `host` and `dstPort` parameters, pointing to a server and port controlled by the attacker.
    4. The user attempts to connect to a database using this malicious configuration.
    5. The Database Client extension, without proper validation, uses the attacker-supplied `host` and `dstPort` values to establish an SSH tunnel.
    6. The SSH tunnel is created to the attacker's server and port, potentially exposing internal network resources or redirecting database traffic through the attacker's infrastructure.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to establish an SSH tunnel to an arbitrary host and port. This can lead to:
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data intended for the legitimate database server could be redirected through the attacker's server, allowing for data interception and exfiltration.
        - **Internal Network Scanning/Access:** The attacker could use the established tunnel as a pivot point to scan and potentially access other resources within the internal network that are accessible from the VSCode user's machine.
        - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Database traffic could be intercepted and modified by the attacker, leading to data manipulation or credential theft.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the provided code files. The code responsible for creating the SSH tunnel in `/code/src/service/tunnel/tunnel-ssh.js` and `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js` does not appear to have any input validation or sanitization for the `host` and `dstPort` parameters. The configuration creation in `/code/src/service/tunnel/config.js` relies on `lodash.defaults` and environment variables without explicit validation for these critical parameters.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation for the `host` and `dstPort` parameters in the SSH tunnel configuration. Restrict allowed values to trusted hosts or predefined lists.
    - **User Confirmation:** Before establishing an SSH tunnel to a non-standard or externally controlled host and port, display a clear warning to the user and require explicit confirmation.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Review the necessity of allowing arbitrary host and port connections for SSH tunneling. Consider restricting tunneling functionality to predefined or commonly used database server ports and hosts.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to influence the connection configuration settings used by the Database Client extension. This could be achieved through:
        - **Workspace Setting Manipulation:** Compromising the user's VSCode workspace settings file.
        - **Social Engineering:** Tricking the user into importing a malicious connection configuration file.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `/code/src/service/tunnel/config.js`**:
        ```javascript
        function createConfig(config) {
            // ...
            defaults(config || {}, {
                // ...
                host: null,
                // ...
                dstPort: null,
                // ...
            });

            if (!config.host) {
                throw new ConfigError('host not set');
            }

            if (!config.dstPort) {
                throw new ConfigError('dstPort not set');
            }
            return config;
        }
        ```
        This function `createConfig` in `/code/src/service/tunnel/config.js` creates the configuration object for the SSH tunnel. It uses `lodash.defaults` to set default values and checks if `host` and `dstPort` are set, but it **lacks any validation** on the *content* of `host` and `dstPort`.

    2. **File: `/code/src/service/tunnel/tunnel-ssh.js`**:
        ```javascript
        sshConnection.forwardOut(config.srcHost, config.srcPort, config.dstHost, config.dstPort, function (err, sshStream) {
            // ...
        });
        ```
        In `/code/src/service/tunnel/tunnel-ssh.js`, the `forwardOut` function from the `ssh2` library is called with `config.dstHost` and `config.dstPort`. These values, derived from the user-controlled configuration, are used directly without validation to establish the tunnel destination.

    3. **Visualization**:

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Malicious Config] --> B(createConfig in config.js);
        B --> C{No Validation for host/dstPort};
        C --> D[config Object];
        D --> E(sshConnection.forwardOut in tunnel-ssh.js);
        E --> F[SSH Tunnel to Attacker Host/Port];
    ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Install the Database Client extension in VSCode.
        - Have access to a server controlled by the attacker (attacker-server.com) and a port (e.g., 9999).

    2. **Steps:**
        - Open VSCode and the Database Client extension.
        - Create a new connection configuration for any supported database type (e.g., MySQL).
        - Enable SSH Tunnel for this connection.
        - In the SSH Tunnel settings, set the following malicious values:
            - Host: attacker-server.com
            - Port: 22 (or any open SSH port on attacker-server.com)
            - Destination Host: attacker-server.com  (This is the malicious host)
            - Destination Port: 9999 (This is the malicious port)
            - Provide valid credentials for the SSH server (if needed for the test, use a test account on the attacker server).
            - Database connection details can be any valid or dummy values as the vulnerability is in the SSH tunnel setup, not the database connection itself.
        - Attempt to connect to the database using this malicious configuration.
        - On the attacker-server.com, use `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to monitor traffic on port 9999.

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - Traffic intended for the specified database server (defined in the Database Client connection config) should be redirected to `attacker-server.com:9999`.
        - Evidence of network traffic to `attacker-server.com:9999` should be captured by `tcpdump` or `wireshark` on the attacker's server, confirming that the SSH tunnel was successfully established to the attacker-controlled host and port.
        - The database connection itself might fail if the attacker server is not running a database service on port 9999, but the SSH tunnel vulnerability is proven by the traffic redirection.
