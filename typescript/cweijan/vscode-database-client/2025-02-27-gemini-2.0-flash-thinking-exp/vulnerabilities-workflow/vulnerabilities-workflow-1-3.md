### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: SSH Tunnel Arbitrary Host/Port Connection

* Description:
    1. An attacker gains control over the configuration settings of the Database Client extension, either through compromised workspace settings or by convincing a user to import malicious settings.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious connection configuration that includes SSH tunneling.
    3. In the SSH tunnel configuration, the attacker specifies arbitrary values for `host` and `dstPort` parameters, pointing to a server and port controlled by the attacker.
    4. The user attempts to connect to a database using this malicious configuration.
    5. The Database Client extension, without proper validation, uses the attacker-supplied `host` and `dstPort` values to establish an SSH tunnel.
    6. The SSH tunnel is created to the attacker's server and port, potentially exposing internal network resources or redirecting database traffic through the attacker's infrastructure.

* Impact:
    - **High:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to establish an SSH tunnel to an arbitrary host and port. This can lead to:
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data intended for the legitimate database server could be redirected through the attacker's server, allowing for data interception and exfiltration.
        - **Internal Network Scanning/Access:** The attacker could use the established tunnel as a pivot point to scan and potentially access other resources within the internal network that are accessible from the VSCode user's machine.
        - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Database traffic could be intercepted and modified by the attacker, leading to data manipulation or credential theft.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code files. The code responsible for creating the SSH tunnel in `/code/src/service/tunnel/tunnel-ssh.js` and `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js` does not appear to have any input validation or sanitization for the `host` and `dstPort` parameters. The configuration creation in `/code/src/service/tunnel/config.js` relies on `lodash.defaults` and environment variables without explicit validation for these critical parameters.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation for the `host` and `dstPort` parameters in the SSH tunnel configuration. Restrict allowed values to trusted hosts or predefined lists.
    - **User Confirmation:** Before establishing an SSH tunnel to a non-standard or externally controlled host and port, display a clear warning to the user and require explicit confirmation.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Review the necessity of allowing arbitrary host and port connections for SSH tunneling. Consider restricting tunneling functionality to predefined or commonly used database server ports and hosts.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to influence the connection configuration settings used by the Database Client extension. This could be achieved through:
        - **Workspace Setting Manipulation:** Compromising the user's VSCode workspace settings file.
        - **Social Engineering:** Tricking the user into importing a malicious connection configuration file.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/src/service/tunnel/config.js`**:
        ```javascript
        function createConfig(config) {
            // ...
            defaults(config || {}, {
                // ...
                host: null,
                // ...
                dstPort: null,
                // ...
            });

            if (!config.host) {
                throw new ConfigError('host not set');
            }

            if (!config.dstPort) {
                throw new ConfigError('dstPort not set');
            }
            return config;
        }
        ```
        This function `createConfig` in `/code/src/service/tunnel/config.js` creates the configuration object for the SSH tunnel. It uses `lodash.defaults` to set default values and checks if `host` and `dstPort` are set, but it **lacks any validation** on the *content* of `host` and `dstPort`.

    2. **File: `/code/src/service/tunnel/tunnel-ssh.js`**:
        ```javascript
        sshConnection.forwardOut(config.srcHost, config.srcPort, config.dstHost, config.dstPort, function (err, sshStream) {
            // ...
        });
        ```
        In `/code/src/service/tunnel/tunnel-ssh.js`, the `forwardOut` function from the `ssh2` library is called with `config.dstHost` and `config.dstPort`. These values, derived from the user-controlled configuration, are used directly without validation to establish the tunnel destination.

    3. **Visualization**:

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Malicious Config] --> B(createConfig in config.js);
        B --> C{No Validation for host/dstPort};
        C --> D[config Object];
        D --> E(sshConnection.forwardOut in tunnel-ssh.js);
        E --> F[SSH Tunnel to Attacker Host/Port];
    ```

    The visualization shows how user-provided configuration flows through the code without validation to the SSH tunnel creation function, leading to the vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:

    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Install the Database Client extension in VSCode.
        - Have access to a server controlled by the attacker (attacker-server.com) and a port (e.g., 9999).

    2. **Steps:**
        - Open VSCode and the Database Client extension.
        - Create a new connection configuration for any supported database type (e.g., MySQL).
        - Enable SSH Tunnel for this connection.
        - In the SSH Tunnel settings, set the following malicious values:
            - Host: attacker-server.com
            - Port: 22 (or any open SSH port on attacker-server.com)
            - Destination Host: attacker-server.com  (This is the malicious host)
            - Destination Port: 9999 (This is the malicious port)
            - Provide valid credentials for the SSH server (if needed for the test, use a test account on the attacker server).
            - Database connection details can be any valid or dummy values as the vulnerability is in the SSH tunnel setup, not the database connection itself.
        - Attempt to connect to the database using this malicious configuration.
        - On the attacker-server.com, use `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to monitor traffic on port 9999.

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - Traffic intended for the specified database server (defined in the Database Client connection config) should be redirected to `attacker-server.com:9999`.
        - Evidence of network traffic to `attacker-server.com:9999` should be captured by `tcpdump` or `wireshark` on the attacker's server, confirming that the SSH tunnel was successfully established to the attacker-controlled host and port.
        - The database connection itself might fail if the attacker server is not running a database service on port 9999, but the SSH tunnel vulnerability is proven by the traffic redirection.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker can manipulate the SSH tunnel configuration to redirect network traffic to an arbitrary destination, confirming the vulnerability.
