## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Redux Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_redux_application__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success in any of the sub-paths leads to achieving this goal.
*   **Attack Vectors (Summarized from sub-paths):**
    *   Manipulating Redux state to gain unauthorized access or control.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in reducer logic, middleware, or state handling.
    *   Injecting malicious actions or payloads.
    *   Exposing sensitive information stored in the Redux state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Manipulation Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_manipulation_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on directly manipulating the Redux state to compromise the application. It is critical because the state is the central data store of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Reducer Logic Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Incorrect Conditional Logic:** Exploiting errors in `if/else` or `switch` statements within reducers to cause unintended state changes.
        *   **Missing Validation:**  Sending actions with unexpected or malicious data that reducers process without validation, leading to harmful state modifications.
        *   **Side Effects in Reducers (Anti-Pattern):** Triggering actions that cause reducers to perform unintended side effects (like API calls or data manipulation outside of state updates), if this anti-pattern is present.
    *   **Middleware Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Vulnerable Custom Middleware:** Exploiting flaws in custom middleware, such as:
            *   **Sensitive Data Logging:** Middleware logging action payloads or state containing sensitive information without proper sanitization.
            *   **Insecure Authorization:** Bypassing or subverting flawed authorization logic implemented in middleware.
        *   **Insecure Third-Party Middleware:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure third-party middleware libraries used in the application.
    *   **Direct State Mutation (Anti-Pattern Exploitation) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Directly Mutating State:** Identifying and exploiting code that directly modifies the Redux state object (violating Redux principles), leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Action Validation/Sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_action_validationsanitization__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path targets the lack of proper validation and sanitization of action payloads, allowing attackers to inject malicious data. This is critical because actions are the primary input mechanism to the Redux store.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Payloads in Actions:** Dispatching actions with payloads containing:
        *   **Code Injection Strings:** Strings designed to be interpreted as code (e.g., JavaScript) if components improperly handle state data, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
        *   **Data Corruption Payloads:** Data designed to corrupt application logic or database interactions if state is used in backend operations.
        *   **Denial of Service Payloads:**  Extremely large payloads intended to overwhelm the application or cause performance issues.
    *   **Exploiting Missing Validation in Reducers/Components:**  Leveraging the absence of validation in:
        *   **Reducers:**  Reducers processing malicious payloads without checking their validity.
        *   **Components:** Components rendering state data without proper sanitization or escaping, leading to vulnerabilities like XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Information Disclosure via State [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_information_disclosure_via_state__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the Redux state. Information disclosure can be a critical vulnerability in itself or a stepping stone to further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **State Exposure in Client-Side Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Access Redux DevTools in Production (if enabled accidentally) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Production DevTools Enabled:**  Accidentally deploying a production build with Redux DevTools enabled, allowing anyone to inspect the entire application state through browser developer tools.
        *   **State Logging or Exposure in Client-Side Debugging:**
            *   **Excessive Logging:**  Client-side JavaScript code logging the Redux state or parts of it to the browser console.
            *   **State in Error Messages:**  Including state information in client-side error messages displayed to users or logged in client-side error reporting systems.
    *   **Server-Side State Exposure (if using SSR with Redux):**
        *   **Insecure SSR Configuration:** Misconfigurations in server-side rendering setup leading to:
            *   **State in Server Logs:** Serialized Redux state being logged in server-side logs.
            *   **State in Server Responses:** Serialized state being inadvertently included in server responses (e.g., headers, body).
        *   **State Leakage through Server-Side Errors:** Server-side errors during SSR exposing parts of the state in error messages or debugging information sent back to the client or logged on the server.
