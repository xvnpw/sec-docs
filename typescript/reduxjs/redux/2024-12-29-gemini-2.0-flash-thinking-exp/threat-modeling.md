### High and Critical Redux-Specific Threats

Here are the threats from the previous list that directly involve the Redux library and are classified as High or Critical severity:

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Application State via Malicious Actions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft and dispatch malicious Redux actions, either by exploiting vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary action dispatch or by compromising a user's session. These malicious actions could modify the application state in unintended ways, leading to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or denial of service. For example, an attacker might dispatch an action that changes a user's role or modifies critical application settings.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of application data or settings, privilege escalation, denial of service, unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Affected Redux Component:** Action Dispatch mechanism, Reducers (which process actions and update the state).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for any data that influences action payloads.
        *   Implement authorization checks within reducers or middleware to ensure only authorized actions can modify specific parts of the state.
        *   Secure any API endpoints or event handlers that trigger action dispatches to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   Consider using action creators that enforce a specific structure and validation for actions.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Redux Store
    *   **Description:** An attacker, having gained unauthorized access to the application's client-side environment, could inspect the Redux store and extract sensitive information such as user credentials, personal data, or API keys stored within the application's state. This could be done by directly accessing the `store` object in the browser's developer console or by injecting malicious scripts that read and exfiltrate the data.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breach, identity theft, unauthorized access to user accounts or external services, violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Affected Redux Component:** Redux Store (the global state container).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in the Redux store.
        *   If sensitive data must be stored, encrypt it before storing and decrypt it only when needed.
        *   Implement robust security measures to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which are a primary attack vector for accessing client-side data.
        *   Regularly audit the Redux store to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently being stored.

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Redux Itself or its Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Like any software library, Redux itself or its dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are not patched in a timely manner. This could potentially lead to various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Redux Component:** The core Redux library or its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Redux and all its dependencies up to date with the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to Redux or its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency management tools that can help identify and update vulnerable packages.
