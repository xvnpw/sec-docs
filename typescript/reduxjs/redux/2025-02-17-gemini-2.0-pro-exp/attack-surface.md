# Attack Surface Analysis for reduxjs/redux

## Attack Surface: [1. Unvalidated Action Payloads (Reducer-Side)](./attack_surfaces/1__unvalidated_action_payloads__reducer-side_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into Redux actions, and reducers process this data *without* sufficient validation. This is a *direct* consequence of how Redux handles state updates.
*   **How Redux Contributes:** Redux's action-reducer pattern centralizes data flow.  Reducers are *the* point where state changes happen, making them the critical target for this attack. Redux provides no built-in validation.
*   **Example:** An action `UPDATE_USER_SETTINGS` with a `settings` object.  An attacker injects malicious code into a setting (e.g., a profile description field intended for display). The reducer blindly merges this into the state, leading to XSS when rendered.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data corruption, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other application-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depends on data and application context).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Reducer-Level Validation:** *Mandatory* validation within *every* reducer handling user-supplied data. This is the *primary* defense:
        *   **Type Checking:** Verify data types rigorously.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Use libraries like `joi`, `yup`, or `ajv`.
        *   **Sanitization:** Use `DOMPurify` (or similar) for HTML/string inputs to prevent XSS.
        *   **Length Limits:** Enforce maximum input lengths.
        *   **Whitelisting:** If feasible, allow only known-good values.

## Attack Surface: [2. Exposure of Sensitive Data in the Store](./attack_surfaces/2__exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_the_store.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII) is stored in plain text within the Redux store. This is a *direct* result of misusing Redux as a storage mechanism.
*   **How Redux Contributes:** Redux stores the application state in a readily accessible JavaScript object, often exposed via Redux DevTools. This *direct* accessibility is the core issue.
*   **Example:** Storing a user's JWT or API key directly in the Redux store after a successful login.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, legal and reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Store Sensitive Data Directly:** The *absolute* best practice. Redux is *not* designed for secure storage.
    *   **Alternative Secure Storage:**
        *   **`httpOnly` Cookies:** For session tokens.
        *   **Server-Side Sessions:** The most secure approach.
        *   **Encrypted Local Storage:** *Only* if client-side storage is unavoidable, use encryption (e.g., `redux-persist-sensitive-storage`). Decrypt *only* when needed.
    *   **Disable Redux DevTools in Production:** Prevent easy access to the store's contents in live environments.

## Attack Surface: [3. Overly Permissive Actions](./attack_surfaces/3__overly_permissive_actions.md)

*   **Description:** Actions are defined that allow broad, uncontrolled state modifications. This is a *direct* design flaw within the Redux implementation.
*   **How Redux Contributes:** Redux's flexibility allows developers to create actions with *any* payload and *any* effect on the state. This inherent flexibility, if misused, is the root cause.
*   **Example:** An action `SET_STATE` that accepts an arbitrary object and replaces the *entire* Redux store.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Granular Actions:** Design actions to be *highly specific* and have a *limited* scope of effect.
    *   **Strict Reducer Logic:** Reducers should *only* modify the state in ways *directly* related to the action's intended purpose. No unexpected side effects.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review action and reducer designs to prevent over-permissiveness.

## Attack Surface: [4. Malicious Redux Middleware](./attack_surfaces/4__malicious_redux_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**  A compromised or malicious third-party Redux middleware intercepts and modifies actions or state. This is a *direct* threat due to Redux's middleware architecture.
*   **How Redux Contributes:** Redux middleware sits *directly* between action dispatch and the reducer, giving it full access to modify actions and state. This is the core vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A compromised npm package containing Redux middleware that sends all actions (potentially including sensitive data) to a remote attacker-controlled server.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, complete application compromise, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Vet Third-Party Middleware:** *Extremely* careful review of source code and reputation of *any* third-party Redux middleware. Use only trusted, well-maintained libraries.
    *   **Minimize Middleware:** Use middleware *sparingly*. Avoid complex middleware chains.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts (including middleware) can be loaded. This is a crucial defense.
