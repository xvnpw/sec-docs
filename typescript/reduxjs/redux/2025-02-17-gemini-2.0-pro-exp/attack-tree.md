# Attack Tree Analysis for reduxjs/redux

Objective: To manipulate the application's state in an unauthorized manner, leading to data corruption, privilege escalation, or denial of service specific to the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Application State (Unauthorized) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_application_state__unauthorized___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching goal of the attacker.  Successful manipulation of the application's state allows the attacker to control the application's behavior and data.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the root of the attack tree and represents the ultimate objective.  If achieved, it signifies a complete compromise of the application's state management.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Access Redux DevTools in Production (if enabled) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_access_redux_devtools_in_production__if_enabled___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to the Redux DevTools interface in a production environment. This should *never* be possible.
*   **Why High Risk:**  It's a high-risk scenario because it's often caused by a simple configuration error (leaving DevTools enabled), and the impact is immediate and severe.
*   **Why Critical:**  Provides direct, unrestricted access to the application's state, allowing the attacker to view, modify, and replay actions.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if best practices are followed), Medium (if there are configuration errors)
*   **Impact:** High (complete control over application state)
*   **Effort:** Low (simply accessing the application)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (basic understanding of web applications)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (might be detected through traffic analysis or unusual application behavior)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Inject Malicious State Changes (via Redux DevTools) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_inject_malicious_state_changes__via_redux_devtools___critical_.md)

*    **Description:** An attacker, having gained access to Redux DevTools (potentially through a compromised user session), uses the interface to inject arbitrary state changes.
*    **Why Critical:** Allows direct manipulation of the application's state, bypassing normal application logic and security controls.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (requires access to a legitimate user's session *and* DevTools to be present)
*   **Impact:** High (complete control over application state for that user's session)
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires session hijacking or other access compromise)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (understanding of session management and Redux DevTools)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (difficult to distinguish from legitimate user actions)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Inject Malicious Actions (via XSS) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_inject_malicious_actions__via_xss___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability to inject JavaScript code that dispatches arbitrary Redux actions.
*   **Why High Risk:** XSS vulnerabilities are relatively common, and this attack vector allows the attacker to trigger any application logic associated with Redux actions.
*   **Why Critical:**  Allows the attacker to bypass normal user interface interactions and directly invoke application functionality, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the presence of XSS vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:** High (can trigger arbitrary application logic)
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires finding and exploiting an XSS vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (understanding of XSS and JavaScript)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (XSS detection tools and WAFs can help)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Modify Existing Actions/Reducers (e.g., XSS) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_modify_existing_actionsreducers__e_g___xss___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses an XSS vulnerability to overwrite or modify the code of existing Redux action creators or reducers.
*   **Why Critical:** This provides a persistent level of control.  The attacker's modifications will affect all subsequent users of the application until the vulnerability is patched and the code is restored.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (more sophisticated XSS attack)
*   **Impact:** High (persistent control over application behavior)
*   **Effort:** High (requires more complex XSS payload)
*   **Skill Level:** High (advanced XSS techniques)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (requires code integrity checks)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Directly Modify State (if Immutability Helpers are not used/used incorrectly) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_directly_modify_state__if_immutability_helpers_are_not_usedused_incorrectly___high_risk___critic_9eed00bc.md)

*   **Description:** Developers directly mutate the Redux state object instead of using immutable update patterns (e.g., spread operator, Immer, Immutable.js).  An attacker might then exploit the resulting unpredictable behavior.
*   **Why High Risk:** This is a common developer error, especially for those new to Redux or functional programming concepts.
*   **Why Critical:** Direct state mutation breaks the core principles of Redux, leading to unpredictable behavior, race conditions, and potential security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to corrupt data or bypass security checks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on developer discipline and code review)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (can lead to unpredictable behavior and data corruption)
*   **Effort:** Low (simply writing incorrect code)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (basic understanding of JavaScript, but lack of understanding of Redux principles)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (can be detected through code reviews, linters, and runtime errors)
