# Threat Model Analysis for reduxjs/redux

## Threat: [Unauthorized Action Dispatch](./threats/unauthorized_action_dispatch.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Action Dispatch

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to dispatch actions they are not authorized to trigger.  This could involve manipulating client-side code, exploiting vulnerabilities that expose action creators, or injecting code that directly calls `store.dispatch()` with malicious or unintended actions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized state changes, leading to data corruption, privilege escalation, or execution of unintended application logic. The attacker could bypass security controls, modify sensitive data, or trigger actions reserved for administrators.
    *   **Affected Component:** `store.dispatch()`, Action Creators (functions that return action objects), potentially connected components (if they expose dispatch).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the actions that can be dispatched).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Action Creator Access:** Limit the scope of action creators. Avoid global exposure. Use module scoping (ES modules) to restrict access.
        *   **Middleware Validation:** Implement Redux middleware to authenticate and authorize actions *before* they reach the reducers. Check user roles, tokens, or other contextual data. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **Action Type Whitelisting:** Maintain a whitelist of allowed action types, especially if actions are generated dynamically or received from external sources.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review code that dispatches actions to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Action Payload Tampering](./threats/action_payload_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Action Payload Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `payload` of a dispatched action to contain malicious data, unexpected values, or data that violates expected constraints. This could be achieved by manipulating client-side code, intercepting network requests (if actions are based on server responses), or exploiting vulnerabilities that allow direct manipulation of action objects before dispatch.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential crashes, or security vulnerabilities if the reducer doesn't properly validate the payload. The attacker might inject malicious scripts (if the payload is used in rendering without sanitization), overflow buffers, or cause the application to enter an invalid state.
    *   **Affected Component:** Reducers (functions that handle state updates), Action Payloads (the `payload` property of action objects).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data and the reducer's logic).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Reducer-Level Validation:** Reducers *must* rigorously validate the `payload` of *every* action. Use schema validation libraries (Zod, Yup, Joi) or custom validation logic. This is the most critical mitigation.
        *   **Middleware Validation:** Implement middleware to perform pre-reducer payload validation, providing an additional layer of defense.
        *   **Type Safety (TypeScript):** Use TypeScript to enforce strong typing for action payloads, preventing unexpected data types.
        *   **Immutability:** Enforce immutability in reducers to prevent direct modification of the state, even with a malicious payload.

## Threat: [State Manipulation via Redux DevTools](./threats/state_manipulation_via_redux_devtools.md)

*   **Threat:** State Manipulation via Redux DevTools

    *   **Description:** An attacker uses the Redux DevTools (if enabled in a production environment) to directly modify the application's state, bypassing all intended application logic and security controls. They can change values, trigger actions, and observe the state's evolution.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the application's state, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data breaches, or privilege escalation. The attacker can bypass all client-side security measures.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Redux store (the application's state), Redux DevTools.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if DevTools are enabled in production).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable DevTools in Production:** *Absolutely essential and non-negotiable*. Use environment variables and conditional code to ensure DevTools are completely disabled in production builds. This should be a core part of your deployment process.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in State](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_state.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in State

    *   **Description:** Sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personally identifiable information (PII)) is stored directly in the Redux state. An attacker could access this data through DevTools (if enabled), memory dumps, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that expose the application's memory.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, identity theft, compromise of user accounts, or exposure of confidential information. This can have severe legal and reputational consequences.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Redux store (the application's state).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Store Sensitive Data in State:** The primary and most crucial mitigation. Use appropriate secure storage mechanisms (HTTP-Only cookies for session tokens, server-side storage for highly sensitive data).
        *   **Data Masking/Redaction (DevTools):** If you *must* store partially sensitive data (e.g., a masked credit card number for display), use DevTools extensions or custom middleware to mask or redact it in the DevTools display. This is a secondary mitigation, *not* a replacement for proper storage.
        * **Short-Lived State:** If you temporarily need sensitive data in the state, remove it as soon as it's no longer needed.

## Threat: [Flawed Custom Middleware Exploitation](./threats/flawed_custom_middleware_exploitation.md)

* **Threat:** Flawed Custom Middleware Exploitation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in custom Redux middleware to bypass security checks, modify actions or state, or gain unauthorized access. This could be due to insecure coding practices, logic errors, or insufficient input validation within the middleware itself. The middleware acts as a critical point of control, and flaws here can have wide-ranging consequences.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the middleware's purpose and the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from data leaks to complete application compromise, including privilege escalation or execution of arbitrary code.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Redux Middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the middleware's functionality and the severity of the flaw).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Code Reviews:** Rigorously review and test *all* custom middleware for security vulnerabilities, including input validation, error handling, and potential side effects.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Middleware should only have the minimum necessary access to the store and other resources. Avoid granting excessive permissions.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs to the middleware, including actions and any data passed to it.
        *   **Use Established Libraries:** Prefer well-vetted, community-maintained middleware libraries over writing your own, unless absolutely necessary. If you must write custom middleware, follow security best practices meticulously.

## Threat: [Improper use of `dispatch` and `getState` in Middleware](./threats/improper_use_of__dispatch__and__getstate__in_middleware.md)

* **Threat:** Improper use of `dispatch` and `getState` in Middleware

    * **Description:** Incorrectly using `dispatch` or `getState` inside middleware can lead to infinite loops (if a middleware dispatches an action that triggers itself), unexpected state changes, or the ability to bypass security checks. For example, a middleware might try to modify the state directly using `getState` and then `dispatch` without proper safeguards, or it might dispatch an action based on the current state without considering potential race conditions.
    * **Impact:** Application instability, unpredictable behavior, potential security vulnerabilities (if security checks are bypassed), infinite loops leading to browser crashes or denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** Custom Redux Middleware, `store.dispatch`, `store.getState`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Understand Middleware Flow:** Deeply understand the Redux middleware execution flow and the implications of calling `dispatch` and `getState` within middleware. Be aware of the order in which middleware is executed and how actions are processed.
        *   **Avoid Recursive `dispatch`:** Prevent middleware from dispatching actions that trigger the same middleware, creating an infinite loop. Use careful logic and potentially action type checks to avoid this scenario.
        *   **Use `getState` Sparingly:** Only use `getState` when absolutely necessary, and be aware of potential race conditions. Consider if the information can be passed through the action payload instead. If you must use `getState`, ensure you understand the potential for the state to change between the time you call `getState` and the time you use the result.
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensively test middleware that uses `dispatch` or `getState` to ensure it behaves as expected under various conditions, including edge cases and concurrent actions.
