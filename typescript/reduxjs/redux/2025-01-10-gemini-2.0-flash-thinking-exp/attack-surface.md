# Attack Surface Analysis for reduxjs/redux

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in the Redux Store](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_the_redux_store.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information residing within the Redux store becomes accessible through client-side debugging tools or if the state is inadvertently logged or transmitted.
    *   **How Redux Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Redux's central store holds the entire application state, making all its data potentially accessible if not handled carefully.
    *   **Example:** API keys, user Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or authentication tokens are stored directly in the Redux store and become visible through Redux DevTools in a production environment.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in the Redux store.
        *   Implement data sanitization before storing sensitive information.
        *   Ensure Redux DevTools are disabled or conditionally enabled only in development environments.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive data within the store.
        *   Be mindful of what data is persisted and how.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Action Dispatch and State Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_action_dispatch_and_state_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject or manipulate actions dispatched to the Redux store, leading to unintended and potentially harmful alterations of the application state.
    *   **How Redux Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Redux relies on actions to trigger state changes. If the dispatch mechanism is vulnerable, malicious actions can be introduced.
    *   **Example:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to inject JavaScript that dispatches an action setting an administrative privilege flag to `true` in the Redux store.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, denial of service, or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for data that triggers action dispatches.
        *   Ensure actions are dispatched from trusted sources within the application logic.
        *   Consider using action creators that enforce data integrity and prevent arbitrary data injection.
        *   Protect against XSS vulnerabilities which can be a vector for malicious action dispatch.
