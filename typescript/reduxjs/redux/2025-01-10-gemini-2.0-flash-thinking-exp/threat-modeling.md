# Threat Model Analysis for reduxjs/redux

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in the Store](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_the_store.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Redux store, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that allow reading client-side memory, or by intercepting communication if the application state is being serialized and transmitted insecurely. This allows them to view sensitive data stored within the Redux state.

**Impact:** Confidential information such as API keys, personal data, or business secrets could be exposed, leading to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.

**Affected Redux Component:** Store (the central data container)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in the Redux store. Consider alternative storage mechanisms like backend services or secure, HTTP-only cookies.
*   Implement proper data sanitization and filtering before storing any data in the store.
*   Ensure the application has robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the client-side code and memory.

## Threat: [Malicious Action Injection](./threats/malicious_action_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker finds a way to dispatch crafted actions with malicious payloads or types that were not intended by the application logic. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution, or by manipulating the dispatch mechanism if it's improperly secured (though direct manipulation of `dispatch` is less common in typical Redux usage).

**Impact:** The attacker could trigger unintended state changes, potentially leading to application malfunction, data corruption, unauthorized access to features, or even execution of malicious code if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Redux Component:** Dispatch (the mechanism for sending actions to the store)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure that action dispatch is controlled and not directly exposed to user input or external sources without proper validation.
*   Implement strict validation of action types and payloads within reducers and middleware to prevent processing of unexpected or malicious data.
*   Enforce proper authorization checks before dispatching sensitive actions.

## Threat: [State Manipulation via Vulnerable Reducers](./threats/state_manipulation_via_vulnerable_reducers.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or flaws in the logic of reducers to manipulate the application state in a way that benefits them or harms the application. This could involve sending actions that trigger unintended state transitions due to logic errors or missing validation within the reducer functions.

**Impact:** Application behavior could be altered, leading to unauthorized access, data corruption, or denial of service. For example, an attacker might manipulate a user's roles or permissions stored in the state.

**Affected Redux Component:** Reducers (functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement thorough unit and integration tests for reducers to verify their behavior under various conditions and input.
*   Follow best practices for reducer design, such as immutability and pure functions, to minimize the risk of unintended side effects and logic errors.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of reducer logic to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Middleware Injection/Manipulation](./threats/malicious_middleware_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manages to inject or manipulate Redux middleware. This could happen if there are vulnerabilities in how middleware is configured or loaded, or if an attacker gains control over parts of the build process. Malicious middleware can intercept and modify actions before they reach reducers or access and manipulate the state directly.

**Impact:** This is a critical threat as it allows the attacker to completely control the application's behavior, potentially logging sensitive information, modifying state arbitrarily, or even executing arbitrary code within the application context.

**Affected Redux Component:** Middleware (functions that intercept actions dispatched before they reach the reducer)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure that middleware configuration is secure and not vulnerable to external manipulation.
*   Implement strict code review processes for any custom middleware.
*   Be cautious when using third-party middleware and ensure its security and trustworthiness. Verify the integrity of dependencies.
