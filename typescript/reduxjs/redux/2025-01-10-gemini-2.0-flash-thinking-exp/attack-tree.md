## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Application via Redux Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_application_via_redux_exploitation.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within the Redux implementation to compromise the application's functionality or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate Redux State for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_redux_state_for_malicious_purposes.md)

* This path focuses on directly altering the application's state through the Redux mechanism.
    * **[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerable Action Creators:**
        * Attackers identify and exploit flaws in the functions responsible for creating action objects. This could involve:
            * Injecting malicious data through crafted input parameters in action creators.
            * Triggering unintended behavior due to logic errors within the action creator.
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Bypass Action Validation/Authorization:**
        * Attackers find ways to circumvent checks intended to prevent unauthorized actions from being processed. This could involve:
            * Exploiting weaknesses in the validation logic itself.
            * Finding alternative ways to dispatch actions that bypass the validation process.
    * **[CRITICAL] Exploit Reducer Logic Vulnerabilities:**
        * Attackers target flaws in the reducers, which are responsible for updating the state based on actions.
            * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Logic Errors Leading to Incorrect State Transitions:**
                * Attackers exploit programming errors or flawed logic within reducers to cause unintended and potentially harmful changes to the application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit State Rehydration/Persistence Mechanisms (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_state_rehydrationpersistence_mechanisms__if_applicable_.md)

* This path targets the mechanisms used to save and restore the Redux state, often for features like remembering user preferences or offline capabilities.
    * **[CRITICAL] Tamper with Persisted State (e.g., Local Storage):**
        * If the Redux state is persisted in a client-side storage mechanism like Local Storage without proper protection (e.g., encryption, integrity checks), attackers can directly modify the stored data to manipulate the application's initial state upon loading.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Redux Middleware](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_redux_middleware.md)

* This path focuses on attacking the middleware layer, which sits between dispatching an action and it reaching the reducer, allowing for interception and modification of actions or state.
    * **[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Middleware:**
        * Attackers find ways to introduce their own malicious middleware into the application's middleware pipeline. This could be through:
            * Compromising dependencies and injecting malicious code.
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the build process.
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Bypass Middleware Logic:**
        * Attackers discover methods to dispatch actions that circumvent the intended logic within the middleware. This could be due to:
            * Flaws in the middleware's implementation.
            * Unintended execution paths within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Redux DevTools (in development/production if enabled insecurely)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_redux_devtools__in_developmentproduction_if_enabled_insecurely_.md)

* If Redux DevTools is inadvertently enabled or accessible in a production environment, it presents a significant security risk.
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Intercept and Modify Dispatched Actions:**
        * Attackers can use the DevTools interface to directly dispatch arbitrary actions with malicious payloads, bypassing normal application controls.
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Inspect and Steal Sensitive State Data:**
        * Attackers can use DevTools to inspect the entire Redux state, potentially revealing sensitive information like user credentials, API keys, or other confidential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Indirect Vulnerabilities Related to Redux Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_indirect_vulnerabilities_related_to_redux_implementation.md)

* This path involves leveraging vulnerabilities in other parts of the application to indirectly compromise the Redux state or functionality.
    * **[CRITICAL] Leverage Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Dispatch Malicious Actions:**
        * Attackers inject malicious scripts into the application that, when executed in a user's browser, dispatch Redux actions to manipulate the application's state on behalf of the unsuspecting user. This can lead to a wide range of malicious outcomes, depending on the application's functionality.
