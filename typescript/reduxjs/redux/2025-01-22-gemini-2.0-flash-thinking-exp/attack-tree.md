## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Redux Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_redux_application__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success in any of the sub-paths leads to achieving this goal.
*   **Why Critical:** Represents the highest level of risk – full application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Manipulation Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_manipulation_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacks targeting the core principle of Redux – state management. Manipulating the state directly or through flawed logic can lead to significant compromise.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Direct impact on application logic and data integrity. Relatively medium likelihood due to potential coding errors in reducers and middleware.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Reducer Logic Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting errors in reducer functions that lead to unintended or malicious state changes.
        *   **Specific Threats:**
            *   Incorrect conditional logic in reducers leading to wrong state updates.
            *   Missing input validation in reducers allowing malicious data to modify state.
            *   Exploiting side effects within reducers (anti-pattern) for harmful actions.
    *   **Middleware Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom or third-party middleware that intercept actions before reducers.
        *   **Specific Threats:**
            *   Vulnerable custom middleware logging sensitive data, causing information disclosure.
            *   Insecure authorization logic in custom middleware that can be bypassed.
            *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure third-party middleware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Action Validation/Sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_action_validationsanitization__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacks exploiting the absence of proper validation and sanitization of action payloads.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Can lead to various vulnerabilities including XSS and data corruption. Medium likelihood due to potential oversight in input handling.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **Dispatch actions with malicious payloads:**
        *   **Description:** Sending actions containing payloads with harmful data, such as strings intended for code injection.
        *   **Specific Threats:**
            *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if malicious strings in state are rendered in components without proper escaping.
            *   Data corruption if malicious payloads bypass validation and are stored in the state.
            *   Logic bypass if malicious payloads manipulate state to alter application flow.
    *   **Exploit lack of validation in reducers or components consuming state:**
        *   **Description:** Taking advantage of the absence of validation in reducers or components that process state derived from actions.
        *   **Specific Threats:**
            *   XSS vulnerabilities in components rendering unvalidated state.
            *   Unexpected application behavior due to processing invalid or malicious data from state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Information Disclosure via State [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_information_disclosure_via_state__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks focused on gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the Redux state.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Direct exposure of potentially sensitive application data. Likelihood varies, but impact is high if successful.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **State Exposure in Client-Side Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Accidental or intentional exposure of the Redux state in client-side JavaScript.
        *   **Specific Threats:**
            *   **Access Redux DevTools in production (if enabled accidentally) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Description:**  Redux DevTools, if mistakenly enabled in production, provide full access to the application state.
                *   **Specific Threat:** Complete exposure of the entire Redux state, including potentially sensitive user data, application secrets, and business logic details.
            *   **State inadvertently logged or exposed in client-side errors/debugging:**
                *   **Description:** State data being unintentionally included in client-side logs, error messages, or debugging outputs.
                *   **Specific Threat:** Partial exposure of state information through logs or error details, potentially revealing sensitive snippets of data.
