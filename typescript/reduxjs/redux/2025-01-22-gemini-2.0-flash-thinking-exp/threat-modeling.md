# Threat Model Analysis for reduxjs/redux

## Threat: [Redux DevTools Enabled in Production](./threats/redux_devtools_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, or even a curious user, could use browser developer tools to access Redux DevTools if it's mistakenly enabled in a production build. This allows them to inspect the entire application state, including potentially sensitive data, action history, and application logic. This is possible because Redux DevTools is designed to be a powerful introspection tool that exposes the internal workings of the Redux store.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data privacy violation, potential regulatory non-compliance, information disclosure about application internals.
    *   **Redux Component Affected:** Store, Redux DevTools extension (external component, but integral part of Redux development workflow).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly disable Redux DevTools in production builds.** Utilize environment variables or build processes to conditionally include DevTools only in development and staging environments.  Ensure that build configurations for production explicitly exclude the DevTools setup.
        *   **Implement automated checks in the build pipeline.**  Incorporate checks within your build scripts or CI/CD pipeline to verify that DevTools are not included in production bundles. This can be done by analyzing the build output or using static analysis tools.
        *   **Educate developers about the risks.**  Train development teams on the security implications of enabling DevTools in production and emphasize the importance of proper build configurations.

## Threat: [Malicious Action Dispatch - State Manipulation](./threats/malicious_action_dispatch_-_state_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to craft and dispatch malicious actions to the Redux store. If actions are not properly validated and reducers are not written defensively, these crafted actions could manipulate the application state in unintended ways.  By understanding the application's action structure and reducer logic (which might be partially reverse-engineered or inferred), an attacker could craft actions designed to exploit weaknesses in state management. For example, they might target reducers responsible for authorization or data integrity.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity compromise, potential privilege escalation, application malfunction, data corruption.  Successful state manipulation can lead to unauthorized access to features, modification of critical data, or denial of service by corrupting application logic.
    *   **Redux Component Affected:** Actions, Reducers, Store. These are core Redux components directly involved in action processing and state updates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement robust action validation.** Validate action types and payloads rigorously before they are processed by reducers. This validation should occur both on the client-side (for immediate feedback and UI consistency) and, more importantly, on the server-side if actions are initiated from external sources or influence backend operations.  For client-side only applications, validation within middleware or reducers is crucial.
        *   **Write reducers defensively and idempotently.** Ensure reducers handle unexpected action types or payloads gracefully without causing errors or unintended state changes. Reducers should ideally be idempotent, meaning that processing the same action multiple times has the same effect as processing it once, preventing potential issues from repeated malicious action dispatch.
        *   **Adhere strictly to immutable update patterns.**  Immutable updates in reducers make state changes predictable and easier to reason about. This reduces the risk of unintended side effects from malicious actions and simplifies debugging and security analysis.
        *   **Apply the principle of least privilege in state design.** Minimize the storage of highly sensitive or security-critical data directly within the Redux state if possible. If sensitive data must be stored, implement robust access control mechanisms and consider encrypting sensitive portions of the state.  Avoid relying solely on client-side Redux state for critical security decisions; backend authorization should always be the primary control.
