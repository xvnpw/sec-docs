# Attack Surface Analysis for reduxjs/redux

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional State Exposure (Sensitive Data in State)](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_state_exposure__sensitive_data_in_state_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is inadvertently stored within the Redux store, making it accessible through debugging tools or vulnerabilities elsewhere in the application. This is a direct consequence of using Redux as a centralized state management solution where developers might place sensitive data without sufficient security considerations.
*   **Redux Contribution:** Redux's global state container centralizes application data, increasing the risk of exposure if sensitive data is placed within it without proper safeguards. The ease of access to the Redux store, especially via tools like Redux DevTools, amplifies this risk.
*   **Example:** API keys, user credentials, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are stored directly in the Redux store. If Redux DevTools is accidentally enabled in production, or if an XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to access the store, this sensitive data is exposed.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, identity theft, severe privacy violations, significant regulatory non-compliance penalties (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA violations).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Data in State:**  Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in the Redux store whenever possible. Consider alternative, more secure storage mechanisms for truly sensitive information.
    *   **Data Redaction/Sanitization:** Redact or sanitize sensitive data before storing it in the Redux store, especially if there's a chance it might be logged or exposed through debugging tools.
    *   **Production Security Practices:** Ensure Redux DevTools and similar debugging aids are completely disabled in production builds. Implement robust access controls and security measures throughout the application to prevent unauthorized access to the Redux store.
    *   **Encryption for Persistent State:** If Redux state persistence is used (e.g., `redux-persist`), encrypt sensitive data before it is stored in persistent storage (like local storage or cookies).

## Attack Surface: [Action Injection/Spoofing (High Impact Scenarios)](./attack_surfaces/action_injectionspoofing__high_impact_scenarios_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft and dispatch malicious Redux actions to trigger critical state changes or application behavior, exploiting insufficient validation of action origin or type. This directly leverages Redux's action-driven architecture to manipulate the application.
*   **Redux Contribution:** Redux's reliance on actions as the primary mechanism for state updates makes it vulnerable if action handling logic lacks proper security checks.  If the application trusts action types without validation, malicious actions can be effective.
*   **Example:** An application uses a `ADMIN_PRIVILEGE_GRANT` action. If there's no server-side or robust client-side validation to ensure only authorized users can dispatch this action, an attacker could craft and dispatch this action, potentially granting themselves or others administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, significant data breaches, complete compromise of application control.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Critical if it leads to privilege escalation or complete control).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Action Validation & Authorization:** Implement robust server-side validation and authorization for critical actions. Verify the legitimacy and permissions of the user attempting to dispatch actions that have security implications.
    *   **Secure Action Handling Logic:** Design reducers and middleware to strictly enforce authorization and validation rules when processing actions, especially those that modify sensitive state or trigger privileged operations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Actions):** Design actions and reducers to minimize the scope of actions and ensure they only perform operations within the user's authorized permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Action Payload Manipulation Leading to XSS or Critical Logic Flaws](./attack_surfaces/action_payload_manipulation_leading_to_xss_or_critical_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or data into action payloads, which are then processed by reducers, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities or critical logic flaws within the application. This exploits the data flow through Redux actions and reducers.
*   **Redux Contribution:** Redux actions carry payloads that are directly used by reducers to update the state. If these payloads are not sanitized, they become a direct injection point.  Unsafe handling of payload data in reducers can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An action `SET_USERNAME` takes a username string in its payload. If the reducer directly updates the state with this username, and this username is later rendered in the UI without escaping, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code in the username payload, leading to XSS when the state is rendered.  Similarly, manipulating numeric payloads in actions could lead to logic flaws in reducers if not properly validated.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to account takeover, session hijacking, malware injection; or critical logic flaws causing application malfunction or data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Critical if XSS leads to account takeover or if logic flaws cause significant data corruption or system compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize all action payloads *before* they are processed by reducers. Use appropriate encoding and escaping techniques to prevent injection attacks, especially XSS.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if payload sanitization is imperfect.
    *   **Secure Reducer Logic & Output Encoding:** Design reducers to handle payloads safely and ensure that data rendered from the Redux state in the UI is properly encoded and escaped to prevent XSS. Use templating engines or frameworks that provide automatic escaping by default.
