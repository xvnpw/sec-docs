## Vulnerability list:

There are no high or critical rank vulnerabilities introduced by the provided code of the VSCode PDF extension that meet the specified criteria for inclusion in this list.

After a thorough review focusing on external attacker threats to the VSCode extension, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were identified that are:

- Introduced by the extension's code itself (not insecure code in project files).
- Not solely due to missing documentation.
- Not denial of service vulnerabilities.
- Valid and not already mitigated.

The extension's secure use of VS Code's Webview API, including Content Security Policy and `localResourceRoots`, suggests a strong security posture against common webview-related vulnerabilities.  Potential vulnerabilities in the underlying PDF.js library are outside the scope of this extension-focused analysis.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the VSCode PDF extension code, no vulnerabilities meeting the criteria for this list were found.
