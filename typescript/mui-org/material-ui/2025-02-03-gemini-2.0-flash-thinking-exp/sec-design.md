# BUSINESS POSTURE

Material UI is a popular open-source React UI framework. Its primary business priority is to provide a comprehensive, accessible, and performant library of UI components that enables developers to build user interfaces efficiently and consistently. The project aims to foster a strong community and maintain its position as a leading UI framework in the React ecosystem.

Business goals include:
- Maintaining a high-quality, well-documented component library.
- Ensuring accessibility and responsiveness of components.
- Providing excellent developer experience and ease of use.
- Growing and supporting a vibrant community of users and contributors.
- Staying up-to-date with the latest React and web development best practices.

Most important business risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could damage reputation and user trust.
- Performance issues could lead to negative user experiences and adoption decline.
- Lack of accessibility could limit user base and create legal compliance issues for users.
- Poor documentation or developer experience could hinder adoption and community growth.
- Stagnation or failure to adapt to new technologies could lead to obsolescence.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: GitHub repository with public visibility (location: github.com).
- security control: Community contributions and code reviews (location: GitHub pull requests).
- security control: Dependency management using npm/yarn (location: package.json, yarn.lock/package-lock.json).
- security control: Standard JavaScript/TypeScript development practices (location: codebase).
- accepted risk: Reliance on open-source dependencies, which may have their own vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Public nature of the repository means potential exposure of development practices.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Automated security scanning of dependencies (e.g., using Dependabot, Snyk).
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools integrated into the build process.
- security control: Regular security audits of the codebase by security experts.
- security control: Security vulnerability reporting and response process.
- security control: Secure coding guidelines for contributors.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Material UI library itself, as it's a client-side component library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using Material UI.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to Material UI library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using Material UI.
- Input validation: Material UI components should be designed to handle various types of input gracefully and prevent common front-end vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Components should sanitize or escape user-provided data when rendering.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to Material UI library itself in terms of implementing cryptographic algorithms. However, Material UI should not introduce vulnerabilities that could weaken the security of applications using cryptography. If Material UI handles sensitive data (even indirectly), it should do so securely and avoid storing or transmitting sensitive data unnecessarily in client-side storage or logs.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Material UI library.
- Ensuring the security and reliability of the UI components for users.
- Protecting the reputation and trust of the Material UI project.
- Supporting the community and fostering continued adoption.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
- Build artifacts (npm packages): High sensitivity. Integrity is crucial to ensure users receive untampered and secure packages.
- Documentation website content: Medium sensitivity. Integrity and availability are important for user experience and project reputation.
- User data on documentation website (if any, e.g., forum accounts): Low to medium sensitivity depending on the data collected. Confidentiality and integrity are relevant.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., WCAG for accessibility) that Material UI needs to adhere to?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and high-quality UI library for the React ecosystem. Community growth and developer experience are also important business priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Security is a significant concern for the Material UI project, given its widespread use. The project aims to follow secure development practices and address security vulnerabilities proactively.
