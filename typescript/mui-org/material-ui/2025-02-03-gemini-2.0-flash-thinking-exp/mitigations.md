    *   **Step 2: Justify `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` Usage in Material-UI Context:** If `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is deemed necessary for specific Material-UI component usage, carefully justify its use case.
    *   **Step 3: Rigorously Sanitize HTML Input for Material-UI `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:** If you must use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user-provided or untrusted HTML content within Material-UI components, sanitize the HTML *before* passing it to the property. Use a robust HTML sanitization library with strict configuration.
    *   **Step 4: Input Validation and Encoding for Material-UI `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:** In addition to sanitization, validate and encode user input before it is processed and potentially used with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in Material-UI components.
    *   **Step 5: Regularly Review `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` Usage in Material-UI Context:** Periodically review all instances of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` used in conjunction with Material-UI components. Re-evaluate if its use is still necessary and if the sanitization and validation are still adequate in the context of Material-UI rendering.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - DOM-Based and Reflected/Stored (High Severity):** `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` bypasses React's XSS protection and can easily introduce XSS vulnerabilities when used with Material-UI components if not handled with extreme care.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of severe XSS vulnerabilities that can arise from improper use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` within Material-UI components.
