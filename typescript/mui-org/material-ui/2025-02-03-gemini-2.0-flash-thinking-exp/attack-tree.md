## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Material-UI Components](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_material-ui_components.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target potential vulnerabilities within Material-UI components that are exposed on the client-side (user's browser). This could involve exploiting undiscovered bugs in component code or misusing component features.
*   **Focus Area:** Primarily focuses on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within Material-UI components.
*   **Impact:** If successful, attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, website defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Component-Specific Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__component-specific_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to find and exploit specific Material-UI components that might be vulnerable to XSS. This could be due to flaws in the component's code itself or how developers use the component.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify a Material-UI component that might be vulnerable (e.g., Input fields, Autocomplete, Dialogs, components handling user-provided HTML).
    *   Research known CVEs or security advisories related to Material-UI components (though direct CVEs for Material-UI components are less common, general web component XSS principles apply).
    *   Inject malicious JavaScript code through the component's properties (props) or user input fields that are rendered by the component. This often targets props that handle HTML content or situations where user input is not properly sanitized before being displayed by the component.
*   **Critical Node: Execute malicious script in user's browser:** This is the point of successful exploitation. Once the malicious script executes, the attacker can perform various malicious actions within the user's browser context.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities (If Application Uses SSR with Material-UI)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__if_application_uses_ssr_with_m_93fca8bf.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Material-UI, attackers can target vulnerabilities in the SSR process. This is especially relevant if dynamic data is involved in rendering Material-UI components on the server.
*   **Focus Area:** Primarily focuses on SSR Injection attacks.
*   **Impact:** SSR vulnerabilities can be more severe than client-side vulnerabilities. Successful SSR injection can lead to:
    *   Server-side code execution, potentially compromising the entire server.
    *   Manipulation of server-side data and application logic.
    *   Injection of malicious code into the HTML that is rendered on the server and sent to all clients, leading to widespread client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] SSR Injection Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__ssr_injection_attacks.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to inject malicious code during the server-side rendering process. This could exploit vulnerabilities in how the SSR framework handles data, especially when rendering Material-UI components with dynamic content.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify if the application uses SSR with Material-UI.
    *   Analyze the server-side rendering logic to find potential injection points, especially where dynamic data is incorporated into Material-UI component rendering.
    *   Inject malicious code that will be executed during the SSR process.
*   **Critical Node: Execute malicious code on the server or in the rendered HTML sent to the client:** This is the point of critical compromise. Server-side code execution can have catastrophic consequences. Even if the code executes only in the rendered HTML, it can lead to widespread client-side attacks affecting all users.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Material-UI's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_material-ui's_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Material-UI relies on various dependencies (like React, JSS, etc.). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect applications using Material-UI.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify Material-UI's dependencies by examining `package.json` or lock files.
    *   Check for known vulnerabilities in these dependencies using vulnerability scanners (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk) or CVE databases.
    *   Determine if the application is actually using the vulnerable functionality of the dependency.
    *   Exploit the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit the dependency vulnerability to compromise the application:** Successful exploitation of a dependency vulnerability can have a wide range of impacts, depending on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., Remote Code Execution, XSS, Denial of Service).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Improper Handling of User Input in Material-UI Components](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__improper_handling_of_user_input_in_material-ui_components.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers often use Material-UI components to display user-provided content. If developers fail to properly sanitize or validate this user input before rendering it within Material-UI components, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Developers fail to sanitize or escape user input before rendering it in Material-UI components. This is a common mistake, especially when dealing with dynamic content or when developers assume Material-UI automatically handles sanitization (which it generally does not for user-provided HTML).
    *   Attackers inject malicious scripts through user input fields (e.g., form fields, search bars, comments sections) that are displayed using Material-UI components.
*   **Critical Node: Execute malicious scripts in user's browser:** Similar to Component-Specific XSS, successful injection of unsanitized user input leads to XSS execution in the user's browser, with the same potential consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Outdated Material-UI Version](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__outdated_material-ui_version.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using an outdated version of Material-UI means the application might be vulnerable to known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Application uses an outdated version of Material-UI (check `package.json` or lock files).
    *   The outdated version contains known security vulnerabilities (research CVE databases, Material-UI release notes, security advisories).
    *   These vulnerabilities are exploitable in the context of the application.
    *   Exploit the known vulnerabilities.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit known vulnerabilities to compromise the application:** If the outdated Material-UI version has exploitable vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage public exploits or develop custom exploits to compromise the application. The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability.
