# Threat Model Analysis for mui-org/material-ui

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Insecure Component Properties](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_insecure_component_properties.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might inject malicious scripts into the application by exploiting Material-UI components that render user-supplied data without proper sanitization. This could involve manipulating URL parameters, form inputs, or other data sources that are then used as component properties. The attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
*   **Impact:**  Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, installation of malware, defacement of the application.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any component that accepts user-controlled data as a property, especially components that render HTML-like content (e.g., `Typography`, `Tooltip`, components using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` if the application uses it in conjunction with Material-UI).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize user input before passing it to Material-UI component properties.
    *   Utilize browser built-in sanitization mechanisms or dedicated libraries.
    *   Be extremely cautious with properties that accept HTML strings.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a dependency within the Material-UI dependency tree or a related package used by the application alongside Material-UI. This could involve injecting malicious code into a legitimate package or creating a typosquatting package with a similar name. Upon installation, this malicious code could execute within the application's environment.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the server it runs on, data theft, backdoors, malware installation.
*   **Affected Component:**  The entire Material-UI library and its dependencies managed by package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or package lock files.
    *   Consider using a private registry for internal dependencies.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Material-UI Version](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_outdated_material-ui_version.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities present in an older version of Material-UI that the application is using. Vulnerability databases and security advisories often detail these flaws and provide methods for exploitation.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from XSS and CSS injection to more severe issues like remote code execution in some scenarios (though less likely with a front-end library).
*   **Affected Component:** The entire Material-UI library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Material-UI updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor Material-UI release notes and security advisories for updates and patches.
    *   Implement a robust update process for front-end dependencies.

## Threat: [Client-Side Logic Manipulation via Component State](./threats/client-side_logic_manipulation_via_component_state.md)

*   **Description:** If critical application logic relies solely on the client-side state managed by Material-UI components, an attacker could potentially manipulate this state using browser developer tools or by intercepting and modifying network requests. This could bypass security checks or alter the intended application flow.
*   **Impact:**  Circumvention of security controls, unauthorized access to features or data, manipulation of application behavior.
*   **Affected Component:** Components managing application state, especially when used for authorization or critical business logic (e.g., components controlling access to features based on their internal state).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side state for critical security decisions.
    *   Implement server-side validation and authorization checks for all sensitive operations.
    *   Treat client-side state as untrusted.
