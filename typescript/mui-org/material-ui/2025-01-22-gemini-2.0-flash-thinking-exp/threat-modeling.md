## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized User Input in Material-UI Component Props](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_user_input_in_material-ui_component_props.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by providing unsanitized user input that is directly passed as props to Material-UI components, particularly those that render HTML or attributes.  Developers might unknowingly pass user-controlled strings to props like `children` of `Typography`, `label` of `TextField`, or `title` of `Tooltip` without proper escaping. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser when the component renders, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** High
        *   Account takeover through session hijacking or credential theft.
        *   Data theft by accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or through API calls made by the injected script.
        *   Website defacement, altering the appearance and functionality of the application.
        *   Malware distribution by redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting drive-by download scripts.
    *   **Affected Material-UI Component:**
        *   `Typography` component (when using `children` prop to render user-provided text as HTML)
        *   `TextField` component (specifically when using `label`, `helperText`, or `placeholder` props with user-provided text)
        *   `Tooltip` component (when using `title` prop to render user-provided text)
        *   `Snackbar` component (if `message` prop is used to render user-provided text as HTML)
        *   `Dialog` component (if `title` or `content` props are used to render user-provided text as HTML)
        *   Generally, any Material-UI component that renders user-provided strings passed as props as HTML content without explicit sanitization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Always sanitize and escape any user-provided data before passing it as props to Material-UI components that render text or HTML. Use appropriate escaping functions provided by your framework or dedicated sanitization libraries.
        *   **Leverage React's JSX Escaping:** Rely on React's built-in JSX escaping mechanism. JSX automatically escapes string literals, which helps prevent basic XSS. However, be extra cautious when constructing strings dynamically or when dealing with HTML attributes.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust Content Security Policy to significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks. CSP can restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, limiting the capabilities of injected scripts.
        *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews specifically focusing on how user input is handled and rendered within Material-UI components. Look for instances where user-provided strings are directly passed to component props without sanitization.
        *   **Component-Specific Security Awareness:**  Developers should be specifically trained to be aware of the XSS risks associated with passing user input to text-rendering props of Material-UI components.
