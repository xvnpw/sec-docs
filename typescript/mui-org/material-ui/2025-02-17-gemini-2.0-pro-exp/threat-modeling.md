## Threat: [DataGrid Column Definition Manipulation (with Custom Renderers)](./threats/datagrid_column_definition_manipulation__with_custom_renderers_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in how the `DataGrid` or `DataGridPro` component handles *custom cell renderers* (`renderCell` prop) when the column definitions are also dynamically generated or loaded from an untrusted source.  The attacker crafts malicious input that is passed to the custom renderer, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) *within the context of the DataGrid*. This is *critical* because the attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the user's browser. The attacker might try to manipulate the `columns` prop data, either directly through a client-side vulnerability or by compromising the data source that provides the column definitions.
*   **Impact:** **Critical:**  Successful XSS allows the attacker to steal user cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, deface the application, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Component:** `DataGrid` and `DataGridPro` components, specifically when using the `columns` prop with custom `renderCell` functions that receive attacker-controlled data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Sanitize Renderer Input:** Treat *all* data passed to the `renderCell` function as potentially untrusted.  Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove any malicious code *before* rendering it.  *Never* directly insert data into the DOM without sanitization.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Column Definitions (if possible):** If the column structure is known in advance, define it statically. This significantly reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Validate Column Definitions:** If column definitions *must* be loaded dynamically, rigorously validate them against a strict schema.  Ensure that the `field` values are expected and that the `renderCell` function (if present) is a known, safe function.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP with a restrictive `script-src` directive to limit the impact of any potential XSS vulnerabilities.  This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews for *any* code involving custom `DataGrid` renderers, with a specific focus on security.
    * **Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML:** If you use React, avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` at all costs.

## Threat: [Undiscovered Zero-Day Vulnerability in a Complex MUI Component](./threats/undiscovered_zero-day_vulnerability_in_a_complex_mui_component.md)

*   **Description:** A previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerability exists within a complex MUI component (e.g., `DataGrid`, `Autocomplete`, `TreeView`, or a less commonly used component). This vulnerability could be a logic error, an improper handling of user input within the component's internal logic, or a vulnerability in a component's *direct* dependency (a dependency specifically required by that MUI component, and not a general project dependency). The attacker discovers and exploits this vulnerability before a patch is available.
*   **Impact:**  **High to Critical:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from data leakage to denial-of-service to, in the worst case, client-side code execution (though less likely than a direct XSS attack, it's still possible).
*   **Affected Component:**  Potentially any complex MUI component. The specific component would be unknown until the vulnerability is discovered.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (potentially **Critical** depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rapid Response to Security Advisories:**  Monitor the MUI GitHub repository, changelog, and security advisories *very closely*.  Have a process in place to rapidly deploy updates when security patches are released. This is the *most critical* mitigation for zero-day vulnerabilities.
    *   **Defense in Depth:**  Implement robust security practices throughout the application, even if they don't directly relate to MUI. This includes input validation, output encoding, strong authentication, and authorization. This helps to limit the impact of any potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Component Selection:**  Carefully consider the complexity of the components you use. If a simpler alternative exists, prefer it.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help to detect and block some exploit attempts, even for zero-day vulnerabilities, by analyzing traffic patterns.
    *   **Security Audits:** If the application is high-risk, consider periodic security audits that specifically focus on the usage of MUI components.
    *   **Bug Bounty Program:** Consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Vulnerability Triggered by Malformed MUI Component Input (Indirect, but MUI-Related)](./threats/server-side_vulnerability_triggered_by_malformed_mui_component_input__indirect__but_mui-related_.md)

*    **Description:** While not a direct vulnerability *within* MUI, an attacker crafts specific, malformed input to an MUI component (e.g., `TextField`, `Select`, `Autocomplete`) that, while seemingly harmless on the client-side, triggers a vulnerability on the *server-side* when the data is processed. This relies on the backend *not* properly validating or sanitizing the data received from the MUI component. The attacker might exploit type confusion, boundary conditions, or other server-side logic flaws. This is *high* severity because it can lead to server-side compromise.
*   **Impact:** **High:** Could lead to server-side data corruption, denial-of-service, or potentially even remote code execution on the server, depending on the nature of the server-side vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** Any MUI component that accepts user input and sends it to the server (e.g., `TextField`, `Select`, `Autocomplete`, `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, `Slider`, `Switch`, `DatePicker`, `TimePicker`, etc.). The vulnerability is *not* in the MUI component itself, but in how the server handles the data from it.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Input Validation:** This is the *primary* mitigation. *Never* trust data received from the client, even if it comes from an MUI component. Validate *all* input on the server-side against a strict whitelist of allowed values, types, and formats.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (for Databases):** If the data is used in database queries, *always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Server-Side):** Sanitize input on the server-side to remove any potentially harmful characters or sequences.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Include server-side code that handles data from MUI components in security audits.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing that specifically targets the interaction between MUI components and the backend.
