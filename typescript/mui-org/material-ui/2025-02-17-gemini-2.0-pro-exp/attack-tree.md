## Attack Tree Path: [Path 1: Exploiting Unpatched Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/path_1_exploiting_unpatched_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on leveraging known, but unpatched, vulnerabilities within specific Material-UI components. The attacker relies on the application using an outdated version of the library.

*   **Critical Node: `Unpatched Vulnerability in Specific Component (e.g., CVE-XXXX-YYYY)`**
    *   **Description:** A specific Material-UI component has a known vulnerability (identified by a CVE or other security advisory) that has not been patched in the application's deployed version.
    *   **Vulnerability Types:** This could be any type of vulnerability, including XSS, code injection, denial of service, etc., depending on the specific CVE.
    *   **Example:** A hypothetical CVE-2024-XXXX might describe an XSS vulnerability in the `Autocomplete` component when handling specially crafted user input.

*   **Critical Node: `Find Public Exploit Code`**
    *   **Description:** The attacker searches for publicly available exploit code that targets the identified unpatched vulnerability.
    *   **Sources:** Exploit databases (e.g., Exploit-DB), security forums, GitHub repositories, blog posts, etc.
    *   **Impact:** Finding a public exploit significantly reduces the attacker's effort and required skill level.

* **Attack Steps:**
    1.  Identify the version of Material-UI used by the target application.
    2.  Search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting that version.
    3.  If a relevant vulnerability is found, search for publicly available exploit code.
    4.  Adapt and deploy the exploit code against the target application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 2: Exploiting Input Validation Issues](./attack_tree_paths/path_2_exploiting_input_validation_issues.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path targets weaknesses in how the application handles user input when using Material-UI components. It relies on the developer either disabling Material-UI's built-in sanitization or failing to implement additional server-side validation.

*   **Critical Node: `Input Validation Issue`**
    *   **Description:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input before passing it to a Material-UI component.
    *   **Common Causes:**
        *   Disabling Material-UI's built-in input sanitization.
        *   Relying solely on client-side validation.
        *   Incorrectly configuring input validation rules.
        *   Using user input in unexpected ways within the component.
    *   **Example:** A developer might disable escaping in a `TextField` component, allowing an attacker to inject HTML tags.

*   **Critical Node: `Craft Malicious Input`**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious input designed to exploit the input validation vulnerability.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **XSS:** Injecting `<script>` tags or other HTML elements containing malicious JavaScript.
        *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Depending on how the input is used, other injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) might be possible, although these are less likely to be directly related to Material-UI itself.

* **Attack Steps:**
    1. Identify Material-UI components that handle user input.
    2. Test the components with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones.
    3. If an input validation vulnerability is found, craft a malicious payload to exploit it.
    4. Submit the malicious input to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 3: Misusing Component Props](./attack_tree_paths/path_3_misusing_component_props.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by misusing Material-UI component props, particularly those that allow for dynamic styling or behavior. The `sx` prop is a prime example.

*   **Critical Node: `Component Props Misuse (e.g., uncontrolled sx prop)`**
    *   **Description:** The application passes user-provided data directly to a component prop without proper sanitization, creating an injection vulnerability.
    *   **`sx` Prop Vulnerability:** The `sx` prop allows for arbitrary style overrides, making it a particularly dangerous vector for XSS if user input is not sanitized. An attacker could inject CSS that includes `behavior` properties (older browsers) or JavaScript event handlers.
    *   **Other Prop Vulnerabilities:** Other props that control component behavior or rendering could also be vulnerable if misused.
    *   **Example:** `<TextField sx={{ color: userInput }} />` where `userInput` is not sanitized.

*   **Critical Node: `Craft Malicious Input`**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious input designed to exploit the prop misuse.
    *   **Techniques (Focusing on `sx`):**
        *   Injecting CSS with malicious properties (e.g., `behavior`, `expression` in older browsers).
        *   Injecting JavaScript event handlers (e.g., `onclick`, `onerror`) within CSS.
        *   Using CSS to load external resources (e.g., images, fonts) from malicious servers.

* **Attack Steps:**
    1. Identify Material-UI components and their props.
    2.  Pay close attention to props that accept objects or functions, especially those related to styling (like `sx`).
    3. Test if user input is passed directly to these props without sanitization.
    4. If a vulnerability is found, craft a malicious payload (e.g., CSS with embedded JavaScript) to exploit it.
    5. Submit the malicious input to the application.
