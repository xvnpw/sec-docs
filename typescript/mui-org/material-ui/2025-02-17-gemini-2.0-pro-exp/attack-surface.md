# Attack Surface Analysis for mui-org/material-ui

## Attack Surface: [Theme and `sx` Prop Injection](./attack_surfaces/theme_and__sx__prop_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious CSS or JavaScript through the theming system or the `sx` prop.
*   **Material-UI Contribution:** MUI's theming and styling mechanisms (especially the `sx` prop) provide direct avenues for injecting code if user input is not properly handled. This is a *direct* consequence of using these MUI features.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to customize their profile page colors. An attacker provides a "color" value that includes a `<style>` tag with malicious CSS or a JavaScript event handler within the `sx` prop that executes arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), defacement, data theft, session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical. XSS is a very common and serious vulnerability, and the `sx` prop and theming system provide a direct path for exploitation if misused.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** *Never* directly incorporate user-provided input into theme configurations or the `sx` prop. Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-supplied data used for styling. Use a dedicated sanitization library specifically designed for preventing XSS.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP with appropriate `style-src` and `script-src` directives to limit the execution of injected code, even if sanitization fails. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Theme Validation (if applicable):** If user-defined themes are allowed, implement a robust validation system to ensure they adhere to a strict whitelist of allowed properties and values. Reject any themes containing potentially harmful code (e.g., using a CSS parser to detect disallowed properties or JavaScript).
    *   **Limit User Customization:** Restrict the extent of user-controlled styling. Offer pre-defined themes or a very limited set of customization options instead of allowing arbitrary CSS or JavaScript. This is the most effective way to reduce the risk.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities (with Material-UI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__with_material-ui_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the improper use of Material-UI with server-side rendering, specifically related to how MUI components are rendered.
*   **Material-UI Contribution:** While SSR is a general concept, MUI's components and their rendering process on the server are directly involved. The way MUI handles data during SSR can introduce vulnerabilities if not done securely.
*   **Example:** An application uses SSR to render a Material-UI `TextField` component pre-filled with a user's name. If the user's name (taken from user input) is not properly escaped *before* being passed as a prop to the `TextField` during server-side rendering, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the name field, leading to XSS.
*   **Impact:** XSS, data leakage, potentially other injection attacks. The XSS can be particularly dangerous as it bypasses client-side-only defenses.
*   **Risk Severity:** High. SSR-related XSS is a significant threat because it can be harder to detect and mitigate.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Output Encoding:** Ensure *all* data rendered on the server, *especially* data passed as props to MUI components, is properly encoded and escaped for HTML. Use appropriate escaping functions for the context (e.g., HTML entity encoding). This is the primary defense.
    *   **Data Separation:** Maintain a clear separation between data intended for the server and data intended for the client. Avoid sending sensitive data to the client unnecessarily.  Be mindful of what data is included in the initial HTML payload.
    *   **SSR Framework Security:** Follow security best practices for the chosen SSR framework (e.g., Next.js, Gatsby), paying particular attention to how data is passed to components.
    *   **Review MUI Component Usage in SSR:** Specifically review how MUI components are used within the SSR context. Ensure that props are not being populated with unsanitized user data.
