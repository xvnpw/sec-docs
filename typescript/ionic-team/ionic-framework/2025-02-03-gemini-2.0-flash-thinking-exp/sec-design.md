# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Ionic Framework project aims to provide a free, open-source UI toolkit for developers to build cross-platform mobile, web, and desktop applications using web technologies. The primary business priority is to empower developers to create high-quality applications efficiently and effectively, reducing development time and costs by enabling code reuse across different platforms. The project's success is tied to its adoption by the developer community and its ability to remain a leading choice for cross-platform development.

Key business goals include:

- Growing the Ionic developer community and increasing framework adoption.
- Maintaining and improving the quality, performance, and features of the framework.
- Ensuring compatibility and ease of integration with various web technologies and platforms.
- Providing comprehensive documentation and support to developers.
- Fostering a sustainable open-source ecosystem around the framework.

Major business risks to address:

- Security vulnerabilities in the framework could damage its reputation and deter adoption.
- Lack of timely security updates and patches could expose applications built with Ionic to risks.
- Performance issues or limitations could lead developers to choose alternative frameworks.
- Insufficient documentation or community support could hinder developer adoption and satisfaction.
- Changes in underlying web technologies or platform requirements could render the framework obsolete if not adapted quickly.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Open Source Code - The framework is open source, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Regular Updates - The Ionic team actively maintains the framework and releases updates, including security patches. Described in: Release notes and changelogs in the repository and on the Ionic website.
- security control: Community Support - A large and active community contributes to identifying and reporting potential security issues. Implemented in: GitHub issues, forums, and community channels.
- security control: Dependency Management - The project uses standard dependency management tools (npm) which allows for tracking and updating dependencies, including security updates for those dependencies. Implemented in: `package.json` and build process.

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Libraries - The framework depends on numerous third-party libraries, which may introduce vulnerabilities. Mitigation: Dependency updates and security scanning.
- accepted risk: Misuse by Developers - Developers may misuse the framework or introduce vulnerabilities in their applications built with Ionic. Mitigation: Documentation, best practices, and security guidelines.
- accepted risk: Client-Side Security - As a front-end framework, Ionic applications are inherently client-side, meaning sensitive logic or data handling on the client-side carries inherent risks. Mitigation: Emphasize backend security and secure API design.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for the framework itself to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- security control: Security Audits - Conduct regular security audits of the framework code by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses.
- security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Program - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues by the community.
- security control: Secure Coding Guidelines - Publish and promote secure coding guidelines for developers using Ionic to build applications, focusing on common web application security vulnerabilities.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
  - Applications built with Ionic will typically handle authentication on the backend. The framework itself should not enforce or dictate specific authentication mechanisms but should be compatible with standard web authentication patterns (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
  - Security Requirement: Ensure compatibility with common authentication flows and libraries used in web development.
- Authorization:
  - Authorization logic should primarily reside on the backend. Ionic applications should be able to securely communicate user roles and permissions obtained from the backend to control access to features and data within the application UI.
  - Security Requirement: Provide guidance and best practices for integrating backend authorization with Ionic applications.
- Input Validation:
  - Ionic framework components should be designed to prevent common input validation vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS).
  - Security Requirement: Framework components must sanitize and encode user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
  - Security Requirement: Provide clear documentation and examples on how developers should perform input validation in their Ionic applications, especially when interacting with external APIs or handling user-generated content.
- Cryptography:
  - The framework itself may not directly implement cryptographic functions, but applications built with Ionic might need to use cryptography for data protection.
  - Security Requirement: Ensure compatibility with standard web cryptography APIs and libraries.
  - Security Requirement: Provide guidance on secure storage of sensitive data within Ionic applications, recommending best practices like using secure storage mechanisms provided by the underlying platforms or secure backend services.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

- Application functionality and availability: Ensuring that applications built with Ionic Framework function correctly and are available to end-users is critical for businesses relying on these applications.
- Developer trust and adoption: Maintaining the trust of developers in the Ionic Framework is crucial for its continued adoption and success. Security vulnerabilities or a perception of insecurity can severely damage this trust.
- Brand reputation: Security incidents related to Ionic Framework or applications built with it can negatively impact the brand reputation of both the Ionic project and businesses using it.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity (in context of applications built with Ionic):

- User data: Applications built with Ionic may handle various types of user data, including personal information, credentials, financial data, and usage data. The sensitivity of this data depends on the application's purpose and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Application code and intellectual property: The source code of applications built with Ionic, as well as the framework itself, represents intellectual property and business value. Protecting this code from unauthorized access and modification is important.
- Backend system data: Ionic applications often interact with backend systems that store and process sensitive data. Protecting this backend data is crucial, even though it's not directly part of the Ionic Framework itself.
- Build and deployment infrastructure: Securing the build and deployment infrastructure is important to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure the integrity of deployed applications.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the target risk appetite for projects built with Ionic Framework? (This will influence the level of security controls recommended and implemented in applications).
- Are there specific industry compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS) that applications built with Ionic Framework need to adhere to? (This will dictate specific security requirements).
- What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities found in the Ionic Framework itself or in applications built with it? (Understanding the vulnerability management process is important for ongoing security).
- Are there any specific security features or functionalities planned for future releases of Ionic Framework? (Knowing the roadmap can help anticipate future security improvements).

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure and reliable framework that developers can confidently use to build cross-platform applications. Security is a high priority for the Ionic project.
- SECURITY POSTURE: While Ionic Framework provides UI components and tools, the ultimate security of applications built with it depends on developers following secure coding practices and implementing appropriate security controls in their applications and backend systems. The Ionic team is committed to addressing security vulnerabilities in the framework itself.
- DESIGN: The design assumes a typical web application architecture where Ionic applications act as front-ends communicating with backend APIs. Deployment scenarios include web, mobile (using Capacitor/Cordova), and desktop (using Electron). The build process involves standard web development tools and CI/CD practices.
