## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Ionic Framework Application](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_ionic_framework_application.md)

*   This is the root goal of the attacker. Success here means achieving unauthorized access, data breach, or disruption of the Ionic application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] 1. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Web Layer)](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path___critical_node__1__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__web_layer_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** Exploiting weaknesses in the web layer of the Ionic application, primarily within the JavaScript codebase running in the WebView.
*   **Risk Assessment (Overall for this category):**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low to Medium
    *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

    *   **Actionable Insight:** Client-side vulnerabilities are a major attack vector for Ionic applications due to their Single Page Application (SPA) nature and reliance on JavaScript.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prioritize secure coding practices for JavaScript.
        *   Implement robust client-side input validation and sanitization.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   Conduct thorough client-side security testing.

    *   **Sub-Attack Vectors:**

        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1. DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
            *   **Attack Step:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the application's DOM, which is then executed by the user's browser.
            *   **Risk Assessment:**
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: High

                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            *   **Actionable Insight:** Focus on Ionic components and custom code that dynamically render user-controlled data.
            *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                *   Strict input validation and sanitization using Angular/React/Vue built-in mechanisms.
                *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP).
                *   Regularly review code for potential DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
                *   Use secure coding practices to avoid insecurely handling user input (e.g., avoid `innerHTML` when possible).

                *   **1.1.1. Identify vulnerable Ionic component or custom code handling user input**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Finding components or code sections that process user input and dynamically render it without proper sanitization.
                    *   **Example:**  An Ionic list component displaying user-submitted comments without escaping HTML entities.

                *   **1.1.2. Inject malicious script via crafted URL, input field, or local storage manipulation**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Delivering malicious JavaScript payload through various input channels.
                    *   **Examples:**
                        *   Crafted URL parameters designed to be reflected in the DOM.
                        *   Malicious input submitted through form fields.
                        *   Modifying data in local storage that is then rendered in the UI without sanitization.

        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2. Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities**
            *   **Attack Step:** Exploiting flaws in the JavaScript logic of the application to bypass security checks, gain unauthorized access, or manipulate data.

                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-High
            *   **Actionable Insight:** Ionic apps handle significant logic client-side. Vulnerabilities in authentication, authorization, or data handling logic are critical.
            *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                *   Thoroughly review and test client-side logic, especially security-sensitive parts.
                *   Implement robust state management and secure API communication practices.
                *   Minimize sensitive logic on the client-side, moving it to the server whenever possible.
                *   Implement server-side validation for critical operations.

                *   **1.2.1. Identify flaws in JavaScript logic related to authentication, authorization, or data handling**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Discovering weaknesses in how the application manages user sessions, access control, or processes sensitive data in JavaScript.
                    *   **Examples:**
                        *   Bypassing client-side authentication checks.
                        *   Exploiting flaws in client-side routing to access unauthorized pages.
                        *   Manipulating client-side data to gain elevated privileges.

                *   **1.2.2. Manipulate client-side state or logic to bypass security checks or gain unauthorized access**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Directly altering the application's state or JavaScript execution flow to circumvent security measures.
                    *   **Examples:**
                        *   Modifying JavaScript variables or function behavior in the browser's developer console.
                        *   Tampering with browser storage (local storage, session storage) to alter application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] 4. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__4__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)
