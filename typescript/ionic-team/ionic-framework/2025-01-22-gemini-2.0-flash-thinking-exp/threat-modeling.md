# Threat Model Analysis for ionic-team/ionic-framework

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Ionic Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_ionic_components.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within Ionic Framework components themselves could allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code. For example, if an Ionic component designed to display user-provided content has an XSS vulnerability, an attacker could craft malicious input that, when rendered by the component, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the WebView. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. The attacker might exploit a flaw in how Ionic components handle data binding or rendering, especially when dealing with dynamic content.
*   **Impact:** High. User account compromise, data theft (including sensitive information accessible within the WebView context), reputation damage, potential for further exploitation if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Ionic Component:** Potentially any Ionic component that handles and renders user-provided or dynamic data, such as components in `@ionic/angular` like `ion-input`, `ion-textarea`, `ion-list`, or custom components built using Ionic components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Ionic Framework to the latest version to benefit from security patches that address component vulnerabilities.
    *   Carefully review and test applications after Ionic Framework updates to ensure no regressions are introduced.
    *   When using Ionic components to display dynamic content, ensure proper output encoding and sanitization is applied at the application level, even if Ionic components are expected to handle some level of sanitization.
    *   Report any suspected XSS vulnerabilities in Ionic Framework components to the Ionic team through their security channels.

## Threat: [Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations in Ionic Storage Module Leading to Data Exposure](./threats/insecure_defaults_or_misconfigurations_in_ionic_storage_module_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  If developers rely on default configurations of the `@ionic/storage-angular` module or misunderstand its security implications, they might inadvertently store sensitive data insecurely. For instance, using the default storage engine without enabling encryption when handling sensitive information, or misconfiguring access controls, could allow attackers to access locally stored data. An attacker with physical access to the device or malware running on the device could potentially read this unencrypted data.
*   **Impact:** High. Data breach, privacy violation, identity theft, financial loss, regulatory non-compliance if sensitive personal data is exposed.
*   **Affected Ionic Component:** `@ionic/storage-angular` module, specifically its configuration and default settings related to data encryption and access control.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always encrypt sensitive data when using `@ionic/storage-angular`. Explicitly configure encryption options provided by the storage engine or use a secure storage engine if available for the target platform.
    *   Carefully review the security documentation and best practices for `@ionic/storage-angular` and the chosen storage engine.
    *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data client-side if possible. Consider server-side storage for critical information.
    *   Implement application-level access controls to further restrict access to sensitive data stored using `@ionic/storage-angular`.
