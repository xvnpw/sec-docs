## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Web Layer) - [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__web_layer__-__critical_node_&_high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **1.1.1. Identify vulnerable Ionic component or custom code handling user input:**
            *   Attackers analyze the application's client-side code to find Ionic components or custom JavaScript code that dynamically renders user-controlled data without proper sanitization.
            *   This includes components using `innerHTML`, dynamically setting attributes based on user input, or using Angular/React/Vue's data binding in insecure ways.
            *   Example: A vulnerable Ionic `card` component displaying user-provided names without escaping HTML characters.
        *   **1.1.2. Inject malicious script via crafted URL, input field, or local storage manipulation:**
            *   Once a vulnerable point is identified, attackers inject malicious JavaScript code.
            *   Injection points can be:
                *   **Crafted URLs:**  Modifying URL parameters to include malicious scripts that are then processed by the client-side application.
                *   **Input Fields:**  Entering malicious scripts into input fields that are not properly sanitized before being rendered.
                *   **Local Storage Manipulation:**  Modifying data in local storage that is later read and rendered by the application without sanitization.
            *   Successful XSS allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the context of the application, potentially stealing session tokens, user data, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **1.2. Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities - [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **1.2.1. Identify flaws in JavaScript logic related to authentication, authorization, or data handling:**
            *   Attackers examine the application's JavaScript code to find weaknesses in how it handles security-sensitive operations client-side.
            *   This includes flaws in:
                *   **Authentication Logic:**  Bypassing client-side authentication checks or manipulating authentication tokens stored client-side.
                *   **Authorization Logic:**  Circumventing client-side authorization checks to access features or data they shouldn't.
                *   **Data Handling Logic:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how client-side JavaScript processes and stores sensitive data.
            *   Example:  Client-side routing logic that incorrectly grants access to admin pages based on a client-side variable.
        *   **1.2.2. Manipulate client-side state or logic to bypass security checks or gain unauthorized access:**
            *   Attackers directly manipulate the client-side application's state or logic to bypass security controls.
            *   This can involve:
                *   **Modifying JavaScript Variables:**  Using browser developer tools to change JavaScript variables that control access or application behavior.
                *   **Function Hooking/Overriding:**  Replacing or modifying JavaScript functions to alter their intended behavior, potentially bypassing security checks.
                *   **Browser Storage Manipulation:**  Directly modifying data in browser storage (local storage, session storage, cookies) to gain unauthorized access or privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities - [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_-__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **4.1.2. Exploit vulnerabilities in libraries and packages used within the Ionic application (via `npm`, `yarn`, etc.) - [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Ionic applications rely on a vast ecosystem of npm packages and libraries.
        *   Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
        *   **Process:**
            *   **Identify Vulnerable Dependencies:** Attackers use automated tools or manual analysis to identify outdated or vulnerable npm packages used by the application. Public vulnerability databases (like CVE, npm audit) are valuable resources.
            *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities:** Once a vulnerable dependency is identified, attackers leverage publicly available exploits or develop custom exploits to target the vulnerability.
            *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability and the compromised package. It can range from denial of service, data breaches, to remote code execution on the client or server (if the vulnerable package is used server-side as well).
            *   Example: A vulnerable version of a popular JavaScript library used for image processing could be exploited to perform XSS or even remote code execution if the application processes user-uploaded images client-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.2. Exploit vulnerabilities in libraries and packages used within the Ionic application (via `npm`, `yarn`, etc.) - [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_and_packages_used_within_the_ionic_application__via__npm_ff5bdb60.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. WebView Vulnerabilities - [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__webview_vulnerabilities_-__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **3.1. WebView Vulnerabilities - [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **3.1.1. Exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying WebView engine (e.g., Chromium on Android, Safari on iOS) - [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   Ionic applications running on mobile devices rely on WebView components (Chromium on Android, Safari on iOS) to render the web application.
            *   WebViews, like any browser engine, can have security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Process:**
                *   **Identify WebView Vulnerabilities:** Attackers monitor public vulnerability databases and security advisories for WebView engines (Chromium, Safari).
                *   **Target Vulnerable WebView Versions:** Attackers target users running older versions of operating systems or WebView engines that are known to be vulnerable.
                *   **Exploit WebView Vulnerabilities:** Attackers craft exploits that leverage WebView vulnerabilities. These exploits can be delivered through various means, such as:
                    *   **Malicious Websites:**  If the Ionic app navigates to external websites, attackers can host malicious websites designed to exploit WebView vulnerabilities.
                    *   **Deep Links/Custom URL Schemes:**  Crafted deep links or custom URL schemes could be used to trigger vulnerabilities within the WebView context.
                    *   **Compromised Content within the App:**  If the application loads external content (e.g., remote HTML, images) from compromised sources, this content could contain WebView exploits.
                *   **Impact:** Exploiting WebView vulnerabilities can lead to:
                    *   **Remote Code Execution:**  Gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the user's device.
                    *   **Sandbox Escape:**  Breaking out of the WebView sandbox to access device resources and functionalities beyond the application's intended scope.
                    *   **Data Theft:**  Stealing sensitive data stored by the application or other applications on the device.
