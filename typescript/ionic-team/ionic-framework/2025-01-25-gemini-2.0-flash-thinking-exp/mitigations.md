## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Client-Side Data Storage using Ionic Native Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/secure_client-side_data_storage_using_ionic_native_plugins.md)

#### Mitigation Strategy:
Utilize Secure Storage Plugins (Cordova/Capacitor) within Ionic

#### Description:
1.  **Choose an Ionic Native Secure Storage Plugin:** Select either `@ionic-native/secure-storage` (for Cordova) or `@capacitor/preferences` (for Capacitor) which are Ionic Native wrappers around platform-specific secure storage mechanisms.
2.  **Install the Ionic Native Plugin:** Add the chosen Ionic Native plugin to your Ionic project using npm. For example, for Cordova: `npm install @ionic-native/secure-storage cordova-plugin-secure-storage --save`. For Capacitor: `npm install @capacitor/preferences @capacitor/core --save` and follow Capacitor's plugin installation instructions.
3.  **Replace `localStorage`/Cookies in Ionic App:** Refactor Ionic application code that currently uses `localStorage` or cookies for storing sensitive data to utilize the chosen Ionic Native secure storage plugin API. Access the plugin through Ionic Native wrappers in your Angular services or components.
4.  **Implement Data Storage and Retrieval via Ionic Native:** Use the Ionic Native plugin's API (e.g., `SecureStorage` service in Ionic Native for Cordova, or `Preferences` in Capacitor) to store and retrieve sensitive data within your Ionic application.
5.  **Test on Target Mobile Platforms:** Thoroughly test the secure storage implementation on both Android and iOS devices through your Ionic application builds to ensure data is correctly stored and retrieved securely using the native platform secure storage.

#### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Local Storage/Cookie Theft (High Severity):** Malicious apps or scripts gaining access to sensitive data stored in easily accessible `localStorage` or cookies within the Ionic WebView context.
*   **Data Exposure through Device Compromise (Medium Severity):** If a device running the Ionic app is compromised, data in standard web storage is more easily accessible. Ionic Native secure storage plugins provide a more robust, platform-backed protection.

#### Impact:
*   **Local Storage/Cookie Theft:** **High Impact** - Significantly reduces the risk within the Ionic WebView environment by leveraging platform-native secure storage.
*   **Data Exposure through Device Compromise:** **Medium Impact** - Increases security for Ionic apps by making data access more difficult for attackers even with device access, utilizing platform security features.

#### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. Ionic Native Secure Storage plugin (`@ionic-native/secure-storage` with `cordova-plugin-secure-storage`) is installed and used via Ionic Native wrapper. Used for storing user authentication tokens in `src/app/services/auth.service.ts`.

#### Missing Implementation:
Not fully implemented for storing user profile information and application settings that are currently still using `localStorage` in `src/app/services/user-settings.service.ts` within the Ionic application. Needs to be extended to cover all sensitive client-side data managed by the Ionic app.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) for Ionic WebView](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__for_ionic_webview.md)

#### Mitigation Strategy:
Implement a Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) within Ionic Application

#### Description:
1.  **Define CSP Meta Tag in Ionic `index.html`:**  Define CSP directives within the `<meta>` tag in your Ionic application's `index.html` file. This CSP will govern the security policy within the WebView where your Ionic app runs.
2.  **Whitelist Trusted Sources for Ionic App Resources:**  Specifically whitelist only trusted sources for scripts (`script-src`), styles (`style-src`), images (`img-src`), fonts (`font-src`), and other resources that your Ionic application legitimately needs to load.  Crucially, avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` which weaken CSP and are often unnecessary in modern Ionic/Angular development.
3.  **Test CSP in Ionic WebView:** Thoroughly test your CSP implementation by running your Ionic application on devices or emulators. Use browser developer tools (accessible via remote debugging for WebViews) to identify and resolve CSP violations that occur within the Ionic WebView context.
4.  **Refine and Monitor CSP for Ionic App:** Continuously monitor for CSP violations during development and in production (if CSP reporting is configured). Refine your policy as your Ionic application evolves and new resources are required, always aiming for the strictest policy possible while maintaining functionality.

#### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in WebView (High Severity):** Prevents or significantly mitigates XSS attacks within the Ionic WebView by controlling resource loading, a critical vulnerability in web-based mobile apps.
*   **Clickjacking within WebView (Medium Severity):** Can help mitigate clickjacking attacks within the Ionic WebView context by using the `frame-ancestors` directive to control where the Ionic application can be framed.
*   **Data Injection via Script Injection in WebView (Medium Severity):** Indirectly reduces the risk of certain data injection attacks within the Ionic WebView by limiting the execution of untrusted scripts.

#### Impact:
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in WebView:** **High Impact** - Significantly reduces the attack surface for XSS vulnerabilities within the Ionic WebView, a primary concern for hybrid apps.
*   **Clickjacking within WebView:** **Medium Impact** - Provides a layer of defense against clickjacking attacks targeting the Ionic application's WebView.
*   **Data Injection via Script Injection in WebView:** **Medium Impact** - Reduces risk by limiting script execution within the Ionic WebView.

#### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. A basic, overly permissive CSP meta tag is present in `index.html` of the Ionic application (`default-src *; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; img-src 'self' data:`).

#### Missing Implementation:
Needs a much stricter and properly configured CSP in the Ionic application's `index.html`.  Should remove `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` and whitelist specific trusted domains required by the Ionic app for scripts, styles, and other resources. CSP reporting should be considered to actively monitor violations within the Ionic app in different environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Audits and Updates of Ionic Native and Cordova/Capacitor Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/regular_audits_and_updates_of_ionic_native_and_cordovacapacitor_plugins.md)

#### Mitigation Strategy:
Implement Regular Audits and Updates for Ionic Native and Underlying Plugins

#### Description:
1.  **Inventory Ionic Native and Cordova/Capacitor Plugins:** Create a comprehensive list of all Ionic Native plugins and their underlying Cordova or Capacitor plugins used in your Ionic project, along with their versions.
2.  **Establish Plugin Update Schedule for Ionic App:** Set a regular schedule (e.g., monthly or quarterly) specifically for auditing and updating both Ionic Native wrappers and their core Cordova/Capacitor plugins within your Ionic development workflow.
3.  **Check for Updates via npm for Ionic Plugins:** Use npm or yarn to check for updates to your Ionic Native and Cordova/Capacitor plugins (e.g., `npm outdated`). Pay attention to both Ionic Native wrapper versions and the underlying plugin versions.
4.  **Review Changelogs and Security Advisories for Ionic Plugins:** Before updating, meticulously review the changelogs and security advisories for *both* the Ionic Native wrappers and the underlying Cordova/Capacitor plugins to understand changes, bug fixes, and especially any security-related updates.
5.  **Test Ionic App After Plugin Updates:** After updating Ionic Native and Cordova/Capacitor plugins, thoroughly test your Ionic application on target platforms to ensure compatibility, that no regressions have been introduced, and that the Ionic Native wrappers still function correctly with the updated core plugins.
6.  **Remove Unnecessary Ionic Native/Cordova Plugins:** Regularly review the list of Ionic Native and Cordova/Capacitor plugins used in your Ionic project and remove any that are no longer essential or have become redundant. Minimizing the plugin footprint reduces the attack surface of your Ionic application.

#### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Vulnerabilities in Ionic Native and Cordova/Capacitor Plugins (High to Critical Severity):** Outdated Ionic Native wrappers or, more critically, the underlying Cordova/Capacitor plugins may contain known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited within the Ionic application context.
*   **Supply Chain Risks via Ionic Plugin Ecosystem (Medium Severity):** Compromised or malicious Ionic Native wrappers or Cordova/Capacitor plugins could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code directly into your Ionic application.

#### Impact:
*   **Plugin Vulnerabilities in Ionic Apps:** **High Impact** - Significantly reduces the risk of vulnerabilities stemming from outdated or insecure Ionic Native and Cordova/Capacitor plugins, a key dependency in Ionic development.
*   **Supply Chain Risks in Ionic Plugin Ecosystem:** **Medium Impact** - Reduces the risk associated with the Ionic plugin supply chain by maintaining up-to-date plugins and being vigilant about plugin changes and security advisories.

#### Currently Implemented:
Not implemented. No formal, scheduled process for auditing and updating Ionic Native and Cordova/Capacitor plugins is currently in place for the Ionic project. Plugin updates are typically performed reactively when issues arise.

#### Missing Implementation:
A documented and regularly executed process for auditing and updating Ionic Native and Cordova/Capacitor plugins needs to be established. This should include maintaining an inventory of plugins, setting a recurring update schedule, defining steps for reviewing changelogs and security information for both wrapper and core plugins, and rigorous testing of the Ionic application after each plugin update cycle. This process should be integrated into the standard Ionic development workflow and tracked within project management systems.
