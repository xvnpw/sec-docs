## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Ionic Native/Capacitor Plugins]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_ionic_nativecapacitor_plugins_.md)

*   **[***Improper Plugin Configuration***]**
    *   **Description:** Plugins often require configuration parameters (API keys, permissions, server addresses, etc.). Incorrectly configuring these parameters can expose sensitive information or grant the plugin excessive privileges, allowing an attacker to leverage the plugin for malicious purposes.  Examples include hardcoding API keys in the application code, granting unnecessary permissions to the plugin (e.g., full network access when only limited access is needed), or using default, easily guessable configuration values.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **[Vulnerable Plugin Logic]**
    *   **Description:** The native code of the plugin itself (Java/Kotlin for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS) may contain vulnerabilities. This is distinct from vulnerabilities in the plugin's *dependencies*. These vulnerabilities could be due to coding errors, insecure use of APIs, or lack of proper input validation within the native code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High
        * **Lack of Input Validation (Plugin Level):**
            *   **Description:** The native plugin code might not properly validate or sanitize data received from the JavaScript side of the application. This can lead to various injection vulnerabilities within the native code, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive resources.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **[***Outdated/Unpatched Plugin***]**
    *   **Description:** Like any software, plugins have vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched over time. Using outdated plugins that contain known vulnerabilities makes the application susceptible to attacks that exploit those vulnerabilities. Attackers often scan for applications using outdated components with publicly available exploits.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **[Known Vulns in Dep.***]**
            *   **Description:** The plugin itself might be up-to-date, but it might rely on outdated or vulnerable dependencies (third-party libraries). These dependencies can introduce security risks that can be exploited by attackers.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium-High
            *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        * **[Outdated Plugin Vers.***]**
            * **Description:** The plugin is not updated to the latest version, and the current version has known vulnerabilities.
            * **Likelihood:** High
            * **Impact:** Medium-High
            * **Effort:** Low
            * **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[Exploit Ionic Web View/UI Components]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_ionic_web_viewui_components_.md)

*   **[***Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data***]**
    *   **Description:** Ionic applications often store data locally on the device. Using insecure storage mechanisms, such as `localStorage` or cookies without the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags, can expose sensitive data (user credentials, session tokens, personal information) to attackers. If an attacker gains access to the device or compromises the application's sandbox, they can easily retrieve this data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **[***Data Leakage via Plugin***]**
            *   **Description:** A compromised or malicious plugin can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data stored within the application. This could occur if the plugin has excessive permissions or if it contains vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to access and transmit data without authorization.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Medium-High
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High
