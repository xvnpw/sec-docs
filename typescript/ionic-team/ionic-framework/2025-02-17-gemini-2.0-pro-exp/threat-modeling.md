# Threat Model Analysis for ionic-team/ionic-framework

## Threat: [Outdated Ionic Framework Version](./threats/outdated_ionic_framework_version.md)

**1.  Threat:  Outdated Ionic Framework Version**

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an outdated version of the *Ionic Framework itself*. This could be a vulnerability in the core Ionic code, how Ionic manages the WebView, or a vulnerability in a bundled Ionic-specific dependency *that is not a general web framework vulnerability*. The attacker leverages publicly available exploit code or information specific to Ionic. This is distinct from an outdated Angular/React/Vue version, focusing on Ionic's own codebase.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific Ionic vulnerability. Could range from UI glitches specific to Ionic components to more severe issues like data breaches if the vulnerability affects Ionic's data handling or communication mechanisms, or even code execution within the WebView context *if the flaw is in Ionic's WebView management*.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire Ionic Framework, including core modules, UI components, and Ionic-specific utilities. The vulnerability would reside within the `@ionic/core` package or other Ionic-maintained packages.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Regularly update the Ionic Framework to the latest stable version. This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Developer:** Use a dependency management tool (npm, yarn) to track and manage the Ionic Framework version.
    *   **Developer:** Automate dependency vulnerability scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline, specifically checking for Ionic-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developer:** Monitor Ionic's official channels (GitHub, blog, security advisories) for vulnerability announcements *specifically related to Ionic*.
    *   **User:** Keep the application updated to the latest version provided by the developer.

## Threat: [Ionic Component Input Manipulation (Ionic-Specific Logic Flaw)](./threats/ionic_component_input_manipulation__ionic-specific_logic_flaw_.md)

**2. Threat: Ionic Component Input Manipulation (Ionic-Specific Logic Flaw)**

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input fields within a specific Ionic UI component (e.g., `<ion-input>`, `<ion-textarea>`) to bypass client-side validation *that is implemented within the Ionic component's own logic*. This is *not* general XSS or a failure of the underlying web framework; it's a flaw in how the *Ionic component itself* handles unexpected input internally, *before* any data is passed to the underlying web framework or backend. The attacker might try to inject oversized data, special characters not handled by the *Ionic component's* internal parsing, or crafted payloads designed to trigger unexpected behavior within the *Ionic component's* JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** Could lead to denial of service (DoS) of the *specific Ionic component* (making it unresponsive), UI glitches *specific to the Ionic component's rendering*, data corruption if the component interacts with a backend without proper server-side validation (and the flaw allows bypassing Ionic's intended input restrictions), or potentially limited code execution *within the context of the Ionic component's JavaScript*.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific Ionic UI components: `<ion-input>`, `<ion-textarea>`, `<ion-select>`, `<ion-datetime>`, `<ion-range>`, and any custom components built using Ionic's base components *where the vulnerability is in Ionic's provided logic*. The vulnerability would reside in the component's internal JavaScript implementation *within the `@ionic/core` or related Ionic packages*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the component and the nature of the flaw; potential for code execution within the component's context elevates this).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Always implement robust server-side validation, regardless of client-side checks. Never trust client-side input.
    *   **Developer:** Regularly update the Ionic Framework to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches *specifically addressing Ionic component vulnerabilities*.
    *   **Developer:** If building custom components based on Ionic components, thoroughly test input handling and sanitization within your custom component's code, paying close attention to how you interact with Ionic's base component APIs.
    *   **Developer:** Use a linter and static analysis tools that can detect potential vulnerabilities in Angular/React/Vue code, *specifically focusing on how Ionic components are used and if their internal APIs are misused*.
    *   **User:** (Limited mitigation) Keep the application updated to the latest version provided by the developer.

## Threat: [WebView JavaScript Injection via Deep Link (Ionic's Handling)](./threats/webview_javascript_injection_via_deep_link__ionic's_handling_.md)

**3. Threat: WebView JavaScript Injection via Deep Link (Ionic's Handling)**
*   **Description:** While deep linking itself is not solely an Ionic issue, *Ionic's handling* of the data received from a deep link *before* it's passed to the WebView is the critical point. An attacker crafts a malicious deep link. If Ionic's built-in mechanisms for handling deep links (e.g., routing, data parsing) have vulnerabilities, the attacker could inject JavaScript into the WebView *because of Ionic's flawed processing*. This is distinct from a general deep linking vulnerability; it's about Ionic's specific implementation.
*   **Impact:** High. Could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or execution of arbitrary code within the WebView context *due to Ionic's failure to properly sanitize the deep link data*.
*   **Affected Component:** The application's WebView and the *Ionic Framework's deep linking handling mechanisms*. This likely involves Ionic's routing system and any Ionic-provided utilities for processing deep link data. The vulnerability would be in how Ionic processes the URL *before* any framework-specific (Angular, React, Vue) routing takes place.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Strictly validate and sanitize *all* data received through deep links, *especially within any Ionic-specific pre-processing or routing logic*.
    *   **Developer:** Implement a whitelist of allowed URL schemes and parameters *within Ionic's configuration*.
    *   **Developer:** Avoid using deep links to perform sensitive actions or to directly modify the application's state without further validation, *paying particular attention to how Ionic handles these actions*.
    *   **Developer:** Use Android App Links or iOS Universal Links for more secure deep linking, and ensure *Ionic's configuration correctly integrates with these mechanisms*.
    *   **Developer:** Thoroughly review Ionic's documentation on deep linking and ensure you are using the recommended, secure methods.
    *   **User:** Be cautious about clicking on links from untrusted sources. Verify the link's destination before opening it.
