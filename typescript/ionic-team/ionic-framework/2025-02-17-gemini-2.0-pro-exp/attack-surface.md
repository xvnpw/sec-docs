# Attack Surface Analysis for ionic-team/ionic-framework

## Attack Surface: [1. Native Plugin Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/1__native_plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in native plugins (Cordova or Capacitor) to gain unauthorized access to device features and data.
    *   **Ionic Framework Contribution:** Ionic's core design *relies* on plugins for native functionality.  The framework provides the bridge (and thus the potential attack pathway) between the webview and native code.  The security of this bridge is intrinsically linked to the security of the plugins used.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor exploits a vulnerability in an outdated, third-party file access plugin to read arbitrary files from the device's storage.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, device compromise, execution of arbitrary code, privacy violation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the plugin and vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Rigorous Plugin Vetting:**  Extremely careful selection of plugins, prioritizing actively maintained, well-documented, and security-audited options from reputable sources.  Avoid obscure or unmaintained plugins.
            *   **Mandatory Plugin Updates:**  Implement a strict policy of immediately updating all plugins to their latest versions upon release.  Automate this process where possible.
            *   **Strict Least Privilege:**  Grant plugins *only* the absolute minimum necessary permissions.  Review and minimize permissions regularly.
            *   **Aggressive Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization on *both* the webview and native sides of *every* plugin interaction.
            *   **Proactive Vulnerability Scanning:**  Utilize plugin vulnerability scanners and actively monitor security advisories and CVE databases for plugin-related vulnerabilities.
            *   **Custom Plugin Development (Critical Cases):** For high-security functionality, *strongly* consider developing custom, minimal plugins with a narrow, well-defined scope, instead of relying on large, feature-rich third-party plugins. This significantly reduces the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [2. WebView to Native Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/2__webview_to_native_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the Ionic app's webview (typically via XSS), which then leverages the native bridge (provided by Ionic) to execute malicious native code through a plugin.
    *   **Ionic Framework Contribution:** Ionic's fundamental architecture, using a webview to interact with native code via a bridge, *creates* this specific escalation path. While XSS is a general web vulnerability, Ionic's bridge makes it far more dangerous, allowing it to jump from the web context to the native device context.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability in a chat feature to inject JavaScript that calls a vulnerable plugin function (exposed through the Ionic bridge) to send SMS messages without the user's knowledge.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, device compromise, execution of arbitrary native code, privilege escalation, financial loss (if SMS is used for billing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Bulletproof XSS Prevention:**  Implement *multiple* layers of XSS defense within the Ionic application's code.  This includes:
                *   Using a framework with built-in XSS protection (Angular, React, Vue) and *correctly* utilizing its escaping mechanisms.
                *   Thorough input validation and output encoding.
                *   Avoiding `innerHTML` and similar unsafe methods.
            *   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a *very* restrictive CSP to tightly control the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed within the webview.  This is a *critical* mitigation.  The CSP should be carefully crafted and tested.
            *   **Secure Bridge Communication:**  Ensure the communication channel between the webview and native code (e.g., Capacitor's bridge) is secure and uses appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
            *   **Double Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize *all* data passed between the webview and native code *on both sides*, even if it has already been sanitized on one side.  This provides defense-in-depth.
            *   **Code Review:** Conduct regular code reviews, focusing specifically on XSS vulnerabilities and secure use of the native bridge.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure Data Storage in WebView](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_data_storage_in_webview.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored insecurely within the WebView's cache, local storage, or cookies, making it accessible to attackers who gain access to the device or exploit other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Ionic Framework Contribution:** Because Ionic apps run within a WebView, developers might incorrectly assume that the WebView's built-in storage is secure for all data types. Ionic's documentation should emphasize secure storage, but developer oversight is a key factor.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a debugging tool to inspect the WebView's local storage and finds unencrypted user authentication tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Mandatory Secure Storage:** *Never* store sensitive data (passwords, tokens, API keys, PII) directly in the WebView's local storage, cookies, or cache.  Use the operating system's secure storage mechanisms: Keychain on iOS and Keystore on Android.
            *   **Data Minimization:** Store only the absolute minimum necessary data, and encrypt it securely.
            *   **Proper Cache/Cookie Management:** Implement a policy to clear the WebView cache and cookies at appropriate times (e.g., on logout, after a period of inactivity). Ensure cookies are set with the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags.
            * **Encryption:** Encrypt any sensitive data that *must* be stored, using strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms.
