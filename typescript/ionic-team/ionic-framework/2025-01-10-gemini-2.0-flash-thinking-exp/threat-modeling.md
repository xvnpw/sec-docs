# Threat Model Analysis for ionic-team/ionic-framework

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Ionic Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_ionic_components.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into an Ionic UI component that doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input. This injected script would then execute within the context of other users' browsers interacting with the application. This could happen if Ionic components fail to adequately escape or sanitize data bound to their templates or properties, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft (including session cookies), redirection to malicious websites, and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the compromised user.

**Affected Ionic Component:** Specific Ionic UI Components (e.g., `ion-input`, `ion-textarea`, components using vulnerable data binding or rendering mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Utilize Angular's built-in sanitization:** Ensure proper use of Angular's `DomSanitizer` or template directives that perform automatic sanitization.
*   **Avoid direct manipulation of the DOM:** Refrain from using `innerHTML` or similar methods to render user-provided content. Rely on Angular's templating engine.
*   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure a strict CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the impact of successful XSS attacks.
*   **Regularly update Ionic Framework:** Keep the framework updated to benefit from security patches that address potential XSS vulnerabilities in its components.

## Threat: [Insecure Deep Linking Handling Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/insecure_deep_linking_handling_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious deep link that, when opened by a user, bypasses intended application navigation or authentication checks implemented within the Ionic application's routing system. This could allow an attacker to directly access restricted parts of the application or trigger actions without proper authorization, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in how Ionic's `NavController` or routing modules are configured.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application features or data, potential manipulation of application state, and bypassing intended security controls.

**Affected Ionic Component:** `NavController`, `@ionic/angular` Router module, Route Guards.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement robust route guards:** Utilize Angular's route guards to enforce authentication and authorization checks before allowing access to specific routes.
*   **Validate deep link parameters:** Thoroughly validate all parameters passed through deep links to prevent manipulation and ensure they conform to expected formats.
*   **Avoid exposing sensitive logic in route parameters:** Do not pass sensitive data or actions directly through deep link parameters.
*   **Follow secure routing practices:** Ensure that the application's routing configuration is secure and does not inadvertently expose protected areas.
