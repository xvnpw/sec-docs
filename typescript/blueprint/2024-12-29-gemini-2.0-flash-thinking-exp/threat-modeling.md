### High and Critical Blueprint-Specific Threats

* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsafe Rendering in Blueprint Components
    * **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application by providing input that is not properly sanitized by the application and is subsequently rendered by a Blueprint component. This occurs because the Blueprint component itself does not automatically sanitize all input, relying on the developer to handle this. The injected script executes in the victim's browser within the context of the application's origin.
    * **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, and defacement of the application.
    * **Affected Blueprint Component:** Any component that renders user-provided or external data without explicit sanitization by the developer, including:
        * `TextInput` (module: `@blueprintjs/core`) when its value is dynamically set based on external input.
        * `TextArea` (module: `@blueprintjs/core`) for the same reason as `TextInput`.
        * `EditableText` (module: `@blueprintjs/core`) as it's designed for direct user input and rendering.
        * Potentially components within `@blueprintjs/select` if displaying unsanitized user-provided options.
        * `HTMLSelect` (module: `@blueprintjs/select`) if options are dynamically generated from unsanitized data.
        * `Table` (module: `@blueprintjs/table`) when rendering cell content that originates from unsanitized sources.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Always sanitize user-provided or external data *before* passing it to Blueprint components for rendering. Use appropriate sanitization libraries or browser APIs.
        * **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Encode data appropriately based on the context where it's being rendered within Blueprint components.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to reduce the impact of successful XSS attacks by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load.

* **Threat:** Client-Side Prototype Pollution via Blueprint Component Manipulation
    * **Description:** An attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in Blueprint components to manipulate the prototypes of built-in JavaScript objects or Blueprint's own component prototypes. This could lead to application-wide issues, including the ability to inject malicious code or bypass security checks. This might involve crafting specific input or interactions that trigger unintended prototype modifications within Blueprint's internal logic.
    * **Impact:**  Application instability, potential for arbitrary code execution within the client-side application, bypassing security mechanisms, and data corruption.
    * **Affected Blueprint Component:**  Potentially any component, but components with complex object structures or those that perform significant object manipulation might be more susceptible. This could include:
        * Base component classes within Blueprint's internal structure (though less directly exploitable by application developers).
        * Components that heavily utilize or extend other Blueprint components' prototypes.
        * Potentially components involved in complex data rendering or state management within Blueprint's ecosystem.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Blueprint Updated:** Regularly update Blueprint to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that may address prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
        * **Careful Dependency Management:** Be aware of vulnerabilities in Blueprint's dependencies that could indirectly lead to prototype pollution.
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Avoid directly manipulating prototypes in application code, especially when interacting with Blueprint components.
        * **Object Immutability:** Where feasible, use immutable data structures to prevent unintended modifications.

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource-Intensive Blueprint Components
    * **Description:** An attacker could intentionally provide large or complex datasets or trigger rapid interactions with specific Blueprint components that are resource-intensive on the client-side. This could lead to excessive CPU or memory usage in the user's browser, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash.
    * **Impact:** Application unavailability for legitimate users, poor user experience, and potential client-side crashes.
    * **Affected Blueprint Component:** Components designed to handle large amounts of data or perform complex rendering, such as:
        * `Table` (module: `@blueprintjs/table`) when provided with extremely large datasets without proper virtualization or pagination.
        * `Tree` (module: `@blueprintjs/core`) if rendering very large or deeply nested tree structures.
        * Potentially components involved in complex animations or transitions if triggered rapidly.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement Pagination and Virtualization:** For components like `Table`, use pagination or virtualization techniques to render only the visible portion of large datasets.
        * **Limit Data Size and Complexity:** Restrict the size and complexity of data processed by resource-intensive Blueprint components. Implement server-side limits and validation.
        * **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement client-side or server-side rate limiting to prevent excessive interactions with resource-intensive components.
        * **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor client-side performance to identify potential bottlenecks related to specific Blueprint components.
