# No vulnerabilities found

Both vulnerability reports indicate that no security vulnerabilities were identified in the VS Code theme extensions. The reports analyzed different themes (Tokyo Night and One Dark Pro), but both concluded that VS Code themes are inherently low-risk as they:

1. Consist primarily of static JSON configuration files and visual assets
2. Do not execute commands or code
3. Do not process user input in dangerous ways
4. Do not make network requests
5. Do not read or write arbitrary files
6. Operate within a restricted context in VS Code

VS Code themes only provide color information to the editor's renderer, creating a natural security boundary that prevents common vulnerability classes like RCE, Command Injection, and Code Injection.
