# Vulnerabilities Report

After a thorough security analysis of the provided project files, I cannot identify any high-severity vulnerabilities in the Tokyo Night VS Code theme extension.

The files provided (README.md and CHANGELOG.md) indicate this is a purely cosmetic VS Code theme that defines color schemes. VS Code themes are generally static JSON configuration files that specify colors for UI elements and syntax highlighting, without containing executable code.

The extension does not appear to:
1. Execute any commands
2. Process user input
3. Parse or execute repository content
4. Use dangerous APIs or functions
5. Make network requests
6. Read or write arbitrary files

VS Code themes operate within a restricted context where they only provide color information to the VS Code renderer, making them inherently resistant to the vulnerability classes specified (RCE, Command Injection, Code Injection).

Without seeing the actual theme implementation files (like theme JSON files or any potential JavaScript code), I cannot completely rule out vulnerabilities, but the nature of VS Code themes makes the likelihood of high-severity security issues extremely low.
