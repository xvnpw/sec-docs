## Vulnerability List

There are no identified vulnerabilities of high or critical rank in the provided project files.

**Explanation:**

Based on the provided files (`README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`), the project is a VSCode theme. These files are primarily documentation and release notes. They do not contain any executable code or configuration that could be directly exploited by an external attacker to trigger a high-rank vulnerability in a VSCode extension context.

VSCode themes are declarative configurations that define the visual appearance of the editor. They do not typically handle user input or perform actions that could lead to security vulnerabilities like code injection, cross-site scripting, or privilege escalation within a VSCode extension.

While a poorly designed theme could potentially cause usability issues (e.g., making text unreadable), these are not considered security vulnerabilities relevant to the criteria outlined for this analysis, especially when considering an external attacker targeting a VSCode extension.

Therefore, after analyzing the provided files, no vulnerabilities meeting the inclusion criteria (valid, not mitigated, rank at least high, not DoS, not caused by explicit insecure code patterns, not missing documentation) and exclusion criteria (DoS, insecure code patterns in project files, missing documentation) were found.

**Summary:**

- No high or critical rank vulnerabilities found that meet the specified criteria.
- Project files are documentation for a VSCode theme and not executable code for a VSCode extension.
- VSCode themes are declarative and have a very limited attack surface in the context of VSCode extension vulnerabilities.
