## Vulnerability List for Tokyo Night VSCode Theme

Based on the analysis of `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files, and considering the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified that are exploitable by an external attacker in the Tokyo Night VSCode Theme extension.

**Explanation:**

The provided files (`README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`) are documentation files and do not contain executable code that could directly introduce vulnerabilities in the VSCode extension. They primarily serve to inform users about the theme's features, usage, and changes.

Therefore, according to the instructions and the scope limited to these files, there are no vulnerabilities to report that meet the specified criteria (high or critical rank, not excluded by the given conditions).

**Conclusion:**

No high or critical vulnerabilities were found in the provided project files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) for the Tokyo Night VSCode theme that meet the specified criteria for inclusion in this list.  A comprehensive security assessment of the entire VSCode extension codebase would be necessary to identify potential vulnerabilities beyond the scope of these documentation files.
