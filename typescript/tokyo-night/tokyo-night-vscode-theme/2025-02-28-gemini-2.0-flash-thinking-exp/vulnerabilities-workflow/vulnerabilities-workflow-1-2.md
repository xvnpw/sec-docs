## Vulnerability List for Tokyo Night VSCode Theme

Based on the analysis considering the provided files (`/code/README.md`, `/code/CHANGELOG.md`) and the specified criteria for vulnerability assessment, no high-rank vulnerabilities have been identified that meet the inclusion criteria for this list.

**Analysis Process:**

1. **Initial Assessment:** Review of `/code/README.md` and `/code/CHANGELOG.md` indicates these are documentation files for a VSCode theme. Themes are primarily declarative and define visual styles. These files do not contain executable code or theme definition files that are typically associated with exploitable vulnerabilities by external attackers.

2. **Filtering based on exclusion criteria:**
    * **Vulnerabilities caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES:**  Themes are mostly declarative. The provided files are documentation, not project files containing executable code that might exhibit insecure patterns in the context of external attack vectors.
    * **Vulnerabilities that are only missing documentation to mitigate:** Not applicable as no vulnerabilities were identified in the first place.
    * **Denial of Service vulnerabilities:** Not applicable as no vulnerabilities were identified in the first place.

3. **Filtering based on inclusion criteria:**
    * **Valid and not already mitigated vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities were initially identified, so this criterion is not applicable.
    * **Vulnerability rank at least: high:** As no vulnerabilities were identified, this criterion is also not applicable.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided documentation files (`/code/README.md`, `/code/CHANGELOG.md`) and applying the specified filtering criteria for external attacker exploitation of a VSCode extension, no vulnerabilities of high rank or above have been identified for the Tokyo Night VSCode Theme.

**No vulnerabilities found based on provided files and specified criteria.**

**Further Considerations:**

For a more comprehensive security assessment, examination of the actual theme definition files (e.g., `*.json` files) and any potential scripts or code within the VSCode extension package would be necessary. However, based on the current scope limited to the provided documentation files and the nature of VSCode themes, no high-rank vulnerabilities are apparent.
