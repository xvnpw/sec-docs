Based on your instructions and the provided vulnerability list, here is the updated list in markdown format.

After filtering the provided list of vulnerabilities according to the specified criteria (excluding vulnerabilities caused by insecure code patterns in project files, missing documentation only, and denial of service, and including only valid, not mitigated vulnerabilities with rank at least high), the list remains as follows, indicating that no vulnerabilities meeting the inclusion criteria were identified:

- Vulnerability Name: None identified in PROJECT FILES with rank high or critical.
- Description: No high or critical vulnerabilities were identified in the provided project files.
- Impact: No high or critical impact.
- Vulnerability Rank: None
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: N/A
- Missing Mitigations: N/A
- Preconditions: N/A
- Source Code Analysis: After a thorough review of the provided source code, including configuration files, build scripts, and extension logic, no code paths were found that could be easily exploited by an external attacker to cause high-severity impact. The extension primarily focuses on theming and icon display, and does not seem to handle complex user inputs or interact with external systems in a way that would introduce high-risk vulnerabilities. The code base is well-structured and demonstrates awareness of security best practices, such as dependency management and automated code analysis tools integration.
- Security Test Case: N/A
