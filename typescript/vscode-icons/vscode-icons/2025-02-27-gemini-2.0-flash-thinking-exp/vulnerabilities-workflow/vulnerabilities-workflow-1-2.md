## Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: **Prototype Pollution via Deep Copy in Configuration Merging**
* Description:
    * An attacker could potentially pollute the JavaScript prototype chain by crafting malicious configuration settings that are deeply merged into the extension's configuration.
    * Step 1: An attacker gains control over a configuration file that is merged with the extension's default configuration. This could be a workspace settings file if the extension merges workspace settings with its defaults.
    * Step 2: The attacker crafts a malicious JSON object within this configuration file. This JSON object includes properties like `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`, or `__defineSetter__` which are used to target the JavaScript prototype chain.
    * Step 3: The extension uses a deep merge function (like `lodash.cloneDeep` which is used in `src/iconsManifest/customsMerger.ts`) to combine the malicious configuration with its default configuration.
    * Step 4: Due to the nature of deep merge and the crafted malicious payload, properties intended for prototype pollution are written to the prototype chain of JavaScript objects.
* Impact:
    * Prototype pollution can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including:
        * **Property injection:** Attacker-controlled properties can be injected into JavaScript objects, potentially overriding existing properties or methods.
        * **Bypass security checks:** If security checks rely on properties of objects, prototype pollution could be used to manipulate these properties and bypass the checks.
        * **Code execution (in some scenarios):** In certain complex situations, prototype pollution can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution, although this is less likely in the context of this VSCode extension and would require further vulnerabilities to be present.
    * In the context of a VSCode extension, the impact is primarily on the extension's functionality and potentially the VSCode environment if the pollution affects shared objects or APIs.
* Vulnerability Rank: high
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * None in the provided code. The use of `lodash.cloneDeep` in `src/iconsManifest/customsMerger.ts` is intended for deep copying but does not inherently prevent prototype pollution if malicious input is provided.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * **Input validation and sanitization:** The extension should validate and sanitize any external configuration data before merging it, especially if it's merged deeply. This should include stripping or escaping potentially dangerous properties like `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`, and similar.
    * **Use safer merge strategies:** Instead of deep merge, consider using safer merging techniques that do not inherit prototype properties, or explicitly control the merging process to prevent prototype pollution. For example, using object spread or `Object.assign` for shallow merges, or custom merge functions that handle prototype properties safely.
* Preconditions:
    * The attacker needs to be able to influence a configuration file that is loaded and deeply merged by the VSCode extension. This could be workspace settings, user settings (if the extension processes these), or any other configuration source the extension reads and merges.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * `src/iconsManifest/customsMerger.ts`: This file uses `lodash.cloneDeep` for merging configurations:

    ```typescript
    import { cloneDeep, remove } from 'lodash';
    // ...
    class CustomsMerger {
        public static async merge(
            customFiles: models.IFileCollection,
            extFiles: models.IFileCollection,
            customFolders: models.IFolderCollection,
            extFolders: models.IFolderCollection,
            presets: models.IPresets,
            projectDetectionResults?: models.IProjectDetectionResult[],
            affectedPresets?: models.IPresets,
        ): Promise<models.IMergedCollection> {
            // ...
            let { files, folders } = this.mergeCustoms(
                customFiles || { default: {}, supported: [] },
                extFiles,
                customFolders || { default: {}, supported: [] },
                extFolders,
            );
            // ...
        }

        private static mergeCustoms(
            customFiles: models.IFileCollection,
            supportedFiles: models.IFileCollection,
            customFolders: models.IFolderCollection,
            supportedFolders: models.IFolderCollection,
        ): models.IMergedCollection {
            const files: models.IFileCollection = {
                default: this.mergeDefaultFiles(
                    customFiles.default,
                    supportedFiles.default,
                ),
                supported: this.mergeSupported(
                    customFiles.supported,
                    supportedFiles.supported,
                ),
            };
            // ...
            return { files, folders };
        }

        private static mergeSupported(
            custom: models.IExtension[],
            supported: models.IExtension[],
        ): models.IExtension[] {
            if (!custom || !custom.length) {
                return supported;
            }
            // start the merge operation
            let final: models.IExtension[] = cloneDeep(supported); // Deep copy is used here
            // ...
            return final;
        }
    }
    ```

    *   The `mergeSupported` function in `CustomsMerger` uses `cloneDeep` to merge configurations. If `custom` contains maliciously crafted objects, `cloneDeep` will deeply copy these properties, including those targeting the prototype chain, into the `final` configuration.
    *   While `cloneDeep` is useful for deep copying, it doesn't inherently protect against prototype pollution. If the input data is malicious, it will faithfully copy the malicious payload.

* Security Test Case:
    * Step 1: As an attacker, create a workspace settings file (`.vscode/settings.json`) within a workspace where the VSCode Icons extension is active.
    * Step 2: Add the following malicious JSON to the workspace settings file. This example targets the `Object.prototype.polluted` property:

    ```json
    {
        "vsicons": {
            "associations": {
                "files": [
                    {
                        "icon": "malicious",
                        "extensions": ["test"],
                        "overrides": "__proto__",
                        "format": "svg"
                    }
                ],
                "fileDefault": {
                    "file": {
                        "icon": "default_file",
                        "format": "svg",
                        "__proto__": {
                            "polluted": "VULNERABLE"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    * Step 3: Open VSCode in this workspace or reload the window if it's already open. This will cause VSCode to load and merge the workspace settings, triggering the vulnerability if present.
    * Step 4: Open the developer console in VSCode (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools).
    * Step 5: In the console, type `Object.prototype.polluted` and press Enter.
    * Step 6: If the vulnerability is present, the console will output `"VULNERABLE"`, indicating that the prototype has been polluted. If not vulnerable, it will likely output `undefined`.

This test case demonstrates a potential prototype pollution vulnerability by manipulating the `fileDefault` configuration within workspace settings. A real-world attack might target different configuration settings or properties depending on how the extension uses the merged configuration and what parts of the prototype chain are most impactful to pollute.
