### Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Read via Custom Icon Path Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via Custom Icon Path Configuration

- **Description:**
    An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the user's system by manipulating the `vsicons.customIconFolderPath` setting. If the VSCode extension doesn't properly sanitize or validate the user-provided path, an attacker could set this path to a location they want to read files from. When the extension attempts to load custom icons from this path, it might inadvertently read and potentially expose file contents if the path is not restricted to the intended icons directory.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1.  An attacker gains access to a user's VSCode settings (e.g., through social engineering, phishing, or if the user is running VSCode in an insecure environment).
    2.  The attacker modifies the `vsicons.customIconFolderPath` setting in the user's VSCode configuration (either user settings or workspace settings).
    3.  The attacker sets the path to a sensitive location on the user's file system, for example, `/etc/passwd` on Linux or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows, or any other file they wish to read, assuming user has read access to that file.
    4.  The attacker then triggers a reload of VSCode or the VSCode Icons extension (e.g., by changing the active icon theme or restarting VSCode).
    5.  When the extension initializes or reloads, it attempts to resolve icon paths relative to the maliciously configured `customIconFolderPath`. Due to insufficient validation, the extension might attempt to read files from the attacker-specified path, potentially leading to arbitrary file read.

- **Impact:**
    An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the user's system that the VSCode process has access to. This could include configuration files, credentials, source code, or other sensitive data, depending on the user's file system and permissions.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None visible in the provided code. The code in `SettingsManager.ts` and `ConfigManager.ts` handles setting and retrieving configurations, but there's no explicit validation or sanitization of the `customIconFolderPath` value before it's used in `ManifestBuilder.ts` to construct file paths. The `Utils.belongToSameDrive` and `Utils.overwriteDrive` in `ManifestBuilder.ts` are present, but they are insufficient to prevent path traversal as they are applied after path joining with the user-controlled path.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Path validation and sanitization for `vsicons.customIconFolderPath`. The extension should validate that the configured path is within the expected extension's storage directory or a safe, predefined location.
    - Input validation to ensure the path is a valid directory and not an attempt to traverse outside of allowed boundaries.
    - Implement proper error handling and prevent the extension from attempting to read files outside of the intended icons directories.

- **Preconditions:**
    - User must have the VSCode Icons extension installed and activated.
    - Attacker needs to be able to modify the user's VSCode settings. This could be achieved through various means like social engineering, phishing attacks, or if the user is working in a compromised environment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`SettingsManager.ts`**: This file manages the extension's state and settings, including reading and updating global state. It does not directly handle the `customIconFolderPath` but provides mechanisms to access settings via `ConfigManager`. No changes in this file in the provided batch.
    2.  **`ConfigManager.ts`**: This file is responsible for retrieving configuration values. The `getCustomIconsDirPath` function retrieves the `vsicons.customIconFolderPath` from VSCode settings and attempts to resolve workspace paths, but lacks proper validation or sanitization to prevent path traversal or arbitrary absolute paths.

        ```typescript
        public async getCustomIconsDirPath(dirPath: string): Promise<string> {
            if (!dirPath) {
            return this.vscodeManager.getAppUserDirPath();
            }
            const workspacePaths: string[] = this.vscodeManager.getWorkspacePaths();
            const dPath = dirPath.trim();
            if (isAbsolute(dPath) || !workspacePaths || !workspacePaths.length) {
            return dPath;
            }
            const iterator = async (wsp: string): Promise<string> =>
            (await existsAsync(wsp)) ? wsp : '';

            const promises: Array<Promise<string>> = [];
            workspacePaths.forEach((wsp: string) => promises.push(iterator(wsp)));
            const absWspPath: string = (await Promise.all(promises)).find(
            (path: string) => !!path,
            );
            return Utils.pathUnixJoin(absWspPath, dPath);
        }
        ```

        - The function checks for absolute paths and workspace paths but doesn't sanitize for path traversal characters or restrict the path to a safe directory.
    3.  **`ManifestBuilder.ts`**: The `getIconPath` function in `ManifestBuilder.ts` uses `this.customIconDirPath` (obtained from `ConfigManager`) to construct icon paths.

        ```typescript
        private static async getIconPath(filename: string): Promise<string> {
            if (!this.customIconDirPath) {
            return this.iconsDirRelativeBasePath;
            }
            const absPath = Utils.pathUnixJoin(
            this.customIconDirPath, // User-controlled path from settings
            constants.extension.customIconFolderName,
            );
            const hasCustomIcon = await this.hasCustomIcon(absPath, filename);
            if (!hasCustomIcon) {
            return this.iconsDirRelativeBasePath;
            }
            const belongToSameDrive: boolean = Utils.belongToSameDrive(
            absPath,
            ConfigManager.sourceDir,
            );
            const sanitizedFolderPath: string = belongToSameDrive
            ? ConfigManager.sourceDir
            : Utils.overwriteDrive(absPath, ConfigManager.sourceDir);
            return Utils.getRelativePath(sanitizedFolderPath, absPath, false);
        }
        ```

        -   The `customIconDirPath` from `ConfigManager` (user-controlled) is directly used in `Utils.pathUnixJoin` to construct `absPath`.
        -   `Utils.getRelativePath` and `Utils.pathUnixJoin` themselves don't prevent path traversal.
        -   The `sanitizedFolderPath` and drive checks are insufficient because the initial `absPath` is already constructed using the potentially malicious base path.
    4.  **`Utils/index.ts`**: Utility functions used in path manipulation (`pathUnixJoin`, `getRelativePath`, `overwriteDrive`) do not include sanitization logic to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

        ```typescript
        public static pathUnixJoin(...paths: string[]): string {
            return posix.join(...paths);
        }

        public static getRelativePath(
            fromDirPath: string,
            toDirName: string,
            checkDirectory = true,
        ): Promise<string> {
            // ...
            return relative(fromDirPath, toDirName).replace(/\\/g, '/').concat('/');
        }
        ```
    5.  **Visualization:**

        ```
        UserSettings --> ConfigManager.getCustomIconsDirPath --> ManifestBuilder.getIconPath --> Utils.pathUnixJoin (Vulnerable) --> File System Read
        ```

    6.  The code lacks input validation and sanitization for `customIconDirPath`, making it vulnerable to arbitrary file read. The provided PROJECT FILES do not include any mitigations for this vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Open VSCode with the VSCode Icons extension activated.
    2.  Open User Settings (JSON) or Workspace Settings (JSON).
    3.  Add or modify the `vsicons.customIconFolderPath` setting and set it to a directory containing sensitive files you want to read, for example, `/etc/` on Linux systems (if you have read permissions) or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\` on Windows. For testing purposes, you can also create a directory with a sensitive file within your home directory and point to that. Example: `"vsicons.customIconFolderPath": "/etc"`.
    4.  Reload VSCode (Developer: Reload Window or `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Reload Window`).
    5.  Observe if any errors occur during the icon theme loading process. While direct evidence of file reading might not be immediately visible through the UI, you can use system monitoring tools (like `strace` on Linux or Process Monitor on Windows) to observe the file system access patterns of the VSCode process. Look for attempts to read files from the directory you specified in `customIconFolderPath`, specifically targeting files within the path you set (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    6.  Alternatively, create a test file (e.g., `test_icon.svg`) inside the directory specified in `vsicons.customIconFolderPath`. Modify the extension's code (in a development environment) to log the file paths being accessed when loading icons. This will directly show if the extension is trying to access files under the malicious path.
    7.  If the system monitoring tools or logs show access attempts to files within the attacker-controlled path, it confirms the arbitrary file read vulnerability.

### Vulnerability: Prototype Pollution via Deep Copy in Configuration Merging

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prototype Pollution via Deep Copy in Configuration Merging
- **Description:**
    An attacker could potentially pollute the JavaScript prototype chain by crafting malicious configuration settings that are deeply merged into the extension's configuration.
    * Step 1: An attacker gains control over a configuration file that is merged with the extension's default configuration. This could be a workspace settings file if the extension merges workspace settings with its defaults.
    * Step 2: The attacker crafts a malicious JSON object within this configuration file. This JSON object includes properties like `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`, or `__defineSetter__` which are used to target the JavaScript prototype chain.
    * Step 3: The extension uses a deep merge function (like `lodash.cloneDeep` which is used in `src/iconsManifest/customsMerger.ts`) to combine the malicious configuration with its default configuration.
    * Step 4: Due to the nature of deep merge and the crafted malicious payload, properties intended for prototype pollution are written to the prototype chain of JavaScript objects.
- **Impact:**
    * Prototype pollution can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including:
        * **Property injection:** Attacker-controlled properties can be injected into JavaScript objects, potentially overriding existing properties or methods.
        * **Bypass security checks:** If security checks rely on properties of objects, prototype pollution could be used to manipulate these properties and bypass the checks.
        * **Code execution (in some scenarios):** In certain complex situations, prototype pollution can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution, although this is less likely in the context of this VSCode extension and would require further vulnerabilities to be present.
    * In the context of a VSCode extension, the impact is primarily on the extension's functionality and potentially the VSCode environment if the pollution affects shared objects or APIs.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** high
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    * None in the provided code. The use of `lodash.cloneDeep` in `src/iconsManifest/customsMerger.ts` is intended for deep copying but does not inherently prevent prototype pollution if malicious input is provided.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    * **Input validation and sanitization:** The extension should validate and sanitize any external configuration data before merging it, especially if it's merged deeply. This should include stripping or escaping potentially dangerous properties like `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`, and similar.
    * **Use safer merge strategies:** Instead of deep merge, consider using safer merging techniques that do not inherit prototype properties, or explicitly control the merging process to prevent prototype pollution. For example, using object spread or `Object.assign` for shallow merges, or custom merge functions that handle prototype properties safely.
- **Preconditions:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to influence a configuration file that is loaded and deeply merged by the VSCode extension. This could be workspace settings, user settings (if the extension processes these), or any other configuration source the extension reads and merges.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    * `src/iconsManifest/customsMerger.ts`: This file uses `lodash.cloneDeep` for merging configurations:

    ```typescript
    import { cloneDeep, remove } from 'lodash';
    // ...
    class CustomsMerger {
        public static async merge(
            customFiles: models.IFileCollection,
            extFiles: models.IFileCollection,
            customFolders: models.IFolderCollection,
            extFolders: models.IFolderCollection,
            presets: models.IPresets,
            projectDetectionResults?: models.IProjectDetectionResult[],
            affectedPresets?: models.IPresets,
        ): Promise<models.IMergedCollection> {
            // ...
            let { files, folders } = this.mergeCustoms(
                customFiles || { default: {}, supported: [] },
                extFiles,
                customFolders || { default: {}, supported: [] },
                extFolders,
            );
            // ...
        }

        private static mergeCustoms(
            customFiles: models.IFileCollection,
            supportedFiles: models.IFileCollection,
            customFolders: models.IFolderCollection,
            supportedFolders: models.IFolderCollection,
        ): models.IMergedCollection {
            const files: models.IFileCollection = {
                default: this.mergeDefaultFiles(
                    customFiles.default,
                    supportedFiles.default,
                ),
                supported: this.mergeSupported(
                    customFiles.supported,
                    supportedFiles.supported,
                ),
            };
            // ...
            return { files, folders };
        }

        private static mergeSupported(
            custom: models.IExtension[],
            supported: models.IExtension[],
        ): models.IExtension[] {
            if (!custom || !custom.length) {
                return supported;
            }
            // start the merge operation
            let final: models.IExtension[] = cloneDeep(supported); // Deep copy is used here
            // ...
            return final;
        }
    }
    ```

    *   The `mergeSupported` function in `CustomsMerger` uses `cloneDeep` to merge configurations. If `custom` contains maliciously crafted objects, `cloneDeep` will deeply copy these properties, including those targeting the prototype chain, into the `final` configuration.
    *   While `cloneDeep` is useful for deep copying, it doesn't inherently protect against prototype pollution. If the input data is malicious, it will faithfully copy the malicious payload.

- **Security Test Case:**
    * Step 1: As an attacker, create a workspace settings file (`.vscode/settings.json`) within a workspace where the VSCode Icons extension is active.
    * Step 2: Add the following malicious JSON to the workspace settings file. This example targets the `Object.prototype.polluted` property:

    ```json
    {
        "vsicons": {
            "associations": {
                "files": [
                    {
                        "icon": "malicious",
                        "extensions": ["test"],
                        "overrides": "__proto__",
                        "format": "svg"
                    }
                ],
                "fileDefault": {
                    "file": {
                        "icon": "default_file",
                        "format": "svg",
                        "__proto__": {
                            "polluted": "VULNERABLE"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    * Step 3: Open VSCode in this workspace or reload the window if it's already open. This will cause VSCode to load and merge the workspace settings, triggering the vulnerability if present.
    * Step 4: Open the developer console in VSCode (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools).
    * Step 5: In the console, type `Object.prototype.polluted` and press Enter.
    * Step 6: If the vulnerability is present, the console will output `"VULNERABLE"`, indicating that the prototype has been polluted. If not vulnerable, it will likely output `undefined`.

This test case demonstrates a potential prototype pollution vulnerability by manipulating the `fileDefault` configuration within workspace settings. A real-world attack might target different configuration settings or properties depending on how the extension uses the merged configuration and what parts of the prototype chain are most impactful to pollute.
