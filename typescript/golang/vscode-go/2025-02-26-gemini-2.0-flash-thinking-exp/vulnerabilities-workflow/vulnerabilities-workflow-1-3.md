### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in External Tool Execution
- Description: The VS Code Go extension executes external Go tools such as `go`, `dlv`, `go vet`, `go lint`, `gomodifytags`, `goplay`, etc., using `child_process.execFile` and `child_process.spawn`. Several parts of the command arguments for these tools are constructed from user-controlled inputs, primarily through VS Code configurations (settings.json, launch.json, tasks.json). Specifically, the following configuration options can be manipulated by a malicious user or project to inject arbitrary commands:
    - Debug configurations (`launch.json`): `dlvToolPath`, `dlvArgs`, `buildFlags`, `program`, `cwd`, `env`, `envFile`, `testFlags`.
    - Task configurations (`tasks.json`): `command` (indirectly, through task type resolution), `args`, `options.env`, `options.cwd`.
    - Settings (`settings.json`): `go.vetFlags`, `go.lintFlags`, `go.buildFlags`, `go.testFlags`, `go.toolsGopath`, `go.gopath`, `go.alternateTools`, `go.coverageDecorator`, `go.testEnvVars`, `go.playground`.
    - Project files (`go.mod`, `.env` files referenced in configurations): indirectly through environment variables and module paths.

    An attacker can craft a malicious Go project or VS Code workspace configuration (e.g., by contributing a malicious `launch.json`, `tasks.json`, or `.env` file to a project, or by tricking a user into opening a malicious workspace) that injects commands into the arguments passed to these external tools. When the VS Code Go extension executes these tools, the injected commands will be executed by the system shell, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

    **Step-by-step trigger for Debugging (example using `dlvToolPath`):**
    1. An attacker creates a malicious Go project or provides a malicious debug configuration.
    2. In the malicious debug configuration (e.g., in `launch.json`), the attacker sets `dlvToolPath` to an arbitrary command, such as `/path/to/malicious_script.sh` or `dlv ; malicious_command`.
    3. The user opens this malicious project in VS Code and attempts to debug a Go program.
    4. The VS Code Go extension, when launching the debugger, uses the attacker-controlled `dlvToolPath` from the debug configuration and executes it using `child_process.spawn`.
    5. The injected command (`malicious_script.sh` or `malicious_command`) is executed by the system shell.

    **Step-by-step trigger for Tasks (example using `tasks.json`):**
    1. An attacker contributes a malicious `tasks.json` file to a Go project.
    2. In the malicious `tasks.json`, the attacker crafts a "go" task where `command` or `args` contain malicious commands. For instance:
       ```json
       {
           "version": "2.0.0",
           "tasks": [
               {
                   "type": "go",
                   "command": "build && malicious_command",
                   "label": "Malicious Build Task",
                   "group": "build"
               }
           ]
       }
       ```
    3. The user opens this project in VS Code.
    4. If the user executes the "Malicious Build Task" (either manually or automatically if configured), VS Code Go extension uses `ProcessExecution` to run the command specified in `tasks.json`.
    5. The injected command (`malicious_command`) is executed by the system shell alongside the intended `go build` command.

    **Step-by-step trigger for Go Playground (example using `go.playground` settings):**
    1. An attacker creates a malicious Go project with a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    2. In the malicious `settings.json`, the attacker sets options under `go.playground` to inject commands. For example:
       ```json
       {
           "go.playground": {
               "vet": "off ; calc.exe"
           }
       }
       ```
    3. The user opens this project in VS Code and attempts to use the "Go Playground" feature (e.g., by running the `Go: Run on Go Playground` command).
    4. The VS Code Go extension uses the attacker-controlled `go.playground` settings when executing the `goplay` tool.
    5. The injected command (`calc.exe`) is executed by the system shell.

    Similar attack vectors exist for other external tool executions within the extension (linting, vetting, etc.) by manipulating relevant configuration options.

- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker could leverage this to install malware, steal sensitive data, or completely compromise the user's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The extension vendors `tree-kill` version `1.2.2` which includes a security fix for PID sanitization. However, this mitigation is relevant only to the process termination aspect and does not prevent command injection in the initial command execution.
    - Codebase likely uses `child_process` functions, but without explicit input sanitization for command arguments derived from user configurations.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Crucially, all user-controlled inputs that are used to construct commands for external tools must be rigorously sanitized and validated. This includes:
        - `dlvToolPath`, `dlvArgs`, `buildFlags`, `program`, `cwd`, `env`, `envFile`, `testFlags` in debug configurations.
        - `command`, `args`, `options.env`, `options.cwd` in task configurations.
        - `vetFlags`, `lintFlags`, `buildFlags`, `testFlags`, `toolsGopath`, `go.gopath`, `go.alternateTools`, `go.coverageDecorator`, `go.testEnvVars`, options under `go.playground` from settings.
    - **Command Construction Security:** Instead of directly using shell commands constructed from strings, utilize safer methods for process execution that avoid shell interpretation, such as passing arguments as an array to `child_process.spawn` and ensuring the command itself is explicitly defined and not derived from user input.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid running external tools with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary and after careful security review. For debugging, consider alternatives to `sudo` if possible.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Webviews:** While not directly related to command injection, ensure strict CSP is in place for all webviews to prevent XSS and further limit the attack surface if command injection were to be chained with webview vulnerabilities. (This is already in place for `welcome.ts`).
- Preconditions:
    - The user must be using the VS Code Go extension.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user to open a malicious Go project or workspace configuration in VS Code. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks, or by contributing malicious configurations to public repositories.
    - Debugging, testing, linting, vetting, task execution, Go Playground or any other extension feature that triggers the execution of external Go tools with user-influenced configurations must be initiated.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Identify External Tool Execution Points:** Search the codebase for usages of `child_process.execFile` and `child_process.spawn`.
    2. **Trace Argument Construction:** For each identified execution point, trace back how the command and its arguments are constructed. Pay close attention to variables derived from VS Code configurations, user settings, and project files.
        - **Example: `goTaskProvider.ts`:**
            - `buildGoTask` function uses `vscode.Task` and `vscode.ProcessExecution`.
            - `vscode.ProcessExecution` constructor takes `getBinPath('go')` as command and `[definition.command, ...(definition.args ?? [])]` as args.
            - `definition.command` and `definition.args` are derived from `GoTaskDefinition`, which can be influenced by `tasks.json`.
        - **Example: `util.ts` - `runTool`:**
            - `runTool` function uses `cp.execFile(cmd, args, { env, cwd }, ...)`
            - `cmd` is obtained via `getBinPath(toolName)` (generally safe).
            - `args` is directly passed as input to `runTool`. If this `args` array is constructed using user-controlled inputs, it becomes a command injection vulnerability.
        - **Example: `goDebugFactory.ts` - `spawnDlvDapServerProcess`:**
            - `spawnDlvDapServerProcess` function uses `spawn(dlvPath, dlvArgs, { cwd: dir, env: envForSpawn, ... })`
            - `dlvArgs` are constructed in `getSpawnConfig` based on `launchAttachArgs` (debug configuration).
            - `launchAttachArgs` is directly derived from `launch.json`.
        - **Example: `goPlayground.ts` - `goPlay`:**
            - `goPlay` function uses `execFile(binaryLocation, [...cliArgs, '-'], ...)`
            - `binaryLocation` is obtained via `getBinPath(TOOL_CMD_NAME)` (generally safe, `TOOL_CMD_NAME` is 'goplay').
            - `cliArgs` is constructed from `goConfig('playground')` which is directly derived from `settings.json`.
        - **Analysis of `goDebug.ts`:**
            - The file `goDebug.ts` (from PROJECT FILES) confirms the usage of `child_process.spawn` in `Delve` class constructor, specifically to launch `dlv`.
            - The arguments to `spawn`, including `launchArgs.dlvToolPath`, `dlvArgs`, `buildFlags`, `port`, `host`, and `args`, are derived from `LaunchRequestArguments` and `AttachRequestArguments`. These arguments are directly influenced by `launch.json` and user settings, reinforcing the command injection vulnerability via these configurations.
    5. **Visualize Data Flow (Conceptual):**

    ```
    [Malicious User/Project] --> [VSCode Configurations (launch.json, tasks.json, settings.json, project files)] --> [VSCode Go Extension Code] --> [Command Construction (Unsanitized User Inputs)] --> [child_process.spawn/execFile] --> [External Go Tools (go, dlv, vet, lint, goplay, etc.)] --> [System Shell] --> [Arbitrary Code Execution]
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up the VS Code Go extension.
        - Create a new Go workspace or use an existing one.
    2. **Craft Malicious `launch.json` (Debug Configuration Command Injection):**
        - Create a `.vscode` folder in the workspace root if it doesn't exist.
        - Create or modify `launch.json` within the `.vscode` folder.
        - Add a new debug configuration or modify an existing one to inject a command in `dlvToolPath`. For example:
          ```json
          {
              "version": "0.2.0",
              "configurations": [
                  {
                      "name": "Malicious Debug",
                      "type": "go",
                      "request": "launch",
                      "mode": "auto",
                      "program": "${fileDirname}",
                      "dlvToolPath": "sh -c 'calc.exe & sleep 5 && dlv'"  // Inject command before dlv
                  }
              ]
          }
          ```
          *(Note: `calc.exe` is used as a harmless payload for demonstration. In a real attack, a more malicious command would be used.)*
    3. **Trigger Debugging:** Open a Go file in the workspace and start debugging using the "Malicious Debug" configuration.
    4. **Observe Outcome:** Monitor the system for signs of arbitrary code execution. In this example, observe if `calc.exe` (or the injected command) executes. If it does, it confirms command injection.
    5. **Craft Malicious `tasks.json` (Task Command Injection):**
        - Create or modify `tasks.json` in the `.vscode` folder.
        - Add a new task with a malicious command in the `command` or `args` field:
          ```json
          {
              "version": "2.0.0",
              "tasks": [
                  {
                      "type": "go",
                      "command": "echo",
                      "args": ["Hello from Go Task && calc.exe"], // Inject command in args
                      "label": "Malicious Go Task",
                      "group": "build"
                  }
              ]
          }
          ```
    6. **Trigger Task Execution:** Execute the "Malicious Go Task" from VS Code's task menu (Terminal > Run Task...).
    7. **Observe Outcome:** Check if `calc.exe` is executed alongside the `echo` command, indicating successful command injection via tasks.json.
    8. **Craft Malicious `settings.json` (Go Playground Command Injection):**
        - Create or modify `settings.json` in the `.vscode` folder.
        - Add malicious options under `go.playground` settings:
          ```json
          {
              "go.playground": {
                  "vet": "off ; calc.exe"
              }
          }
          ```
    9. **Trigger Go Playground:** Run the `Go: Run on Go Playground` command from VS Code command palette.
    10. **Observe Outcome:** Check if `calc.exe` is executed. If it does, it confirms command injection via `go.playground` settings.
