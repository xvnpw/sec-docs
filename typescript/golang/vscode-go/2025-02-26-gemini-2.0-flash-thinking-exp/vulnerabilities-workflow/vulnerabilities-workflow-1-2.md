Here are the high-risk vulnerabilities for the project, updated according to your instructions:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unvalidated SubstitutePath Configuration in Debug Adapter  
  **Description:**  
  The debug adapter supports a user‑configured substitutePath setting that maps local file system paths to remote paths (and vice-versa) for debugging purposes. In methods such as `toDebuggerPath` and `toLocalPath` (in the file `goDebug.ts`), the extension iterates over user‑provided substitute mapping rules and applies string replacement based solely on simple `startsWith` equivalence. No check is carried out to confirm that the “from” or “to” values remain within a safe directory. An attacker who is able to modify or trick a user into using a malicious workspace configuration could induce the debug adapter to map a benign project folder to a sensitive system directory (for example, mapping the project root to `/etc` on Unix‑like systems).  
  **Impact:**  
  An attacker controlling the workspace (or tricking a user into trusting a malicious workspace configuration) may force the debugger to read or even display sensitive files from outside the proper scope. This could lead to disclosure of confidential system or application files, potentially paving the way for further attacks.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - File paths are normalized “before” applying substitution rules.  
  - Log warnings are emitted if multiple substitutePath rules match a given file path.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No validation is performed to ensure that the “from” or “to” parameters of the substitutePath rules lie within an allowed set of directories.  
  - No sanitization or strict whitelisting is applied to block directory‑traversal or absolute paths outside an expected safe boundary.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to modify workspace or user settings (which are trusted by VS Code).  
  - The debugger must be used against a workspace that loads these configuration settings.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `goDebug.ts`, the methods `toDebuggerPath(filePath: string)` and `toLocalPath(pathToConvert: string)` iterate over the array of substitutePath rules with only a simple string‑matching check (e.g. using `startsWith`).  
  - The code does not perform any further checks on the replacement values, thereby allowing a benign source file path to be translated into an arbitrary target path.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a trusted workspace’s `launch.json` or user settings, add a substitutePath entry such as:  
     ```json
     {
       "go.substitutePath": [
         { "from": "/Users/legit/project", "to": "/etc" }
       ]
     }
     ```  
  2. Start a debugging session on a file under `/Users/legit/project`.  
  3. Verify in the debugger’s source view or stack trace that the file path has been rewritten to begin with `/etc` and that its content (or a sensitive file from `/etc`) is displayed.  
  4. This confirms that the substitution was done without verifying the target safe boundary.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unvalidated Debug Output Path Configuration  
  **Description:**  
  When launching a debug session in “launch” mode, the extension accepts an optional `output` property in the launch configuration. The method `getLocalDebugeePath(output: string | undefined)` (in `goDebug.ts`) computes an absolute path to which the debug binary will be built. Later, during session cleanup in the `close()` method, the extension calls `removeFile()` on the computed path. Because the supplied output path is not validated, an attacker who is able to influence the workspace’s launch configuration can specify an absolute path that points to a sensitive file. When the session ends, the cleanup logic may inadvertently delete that file.  
  **Impact:**  
  An attacker who controls the workspace (or is able to trick a user into accepting a malicious launch configuration) may force the debugger to delete arbitrary files on disk. This could result in unintended data loss or even system instability if a critical file is removed.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The adapter resolves relative paths using Node’s path functions such as `path.resolve()`, thereby normalizing path separators.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No verification is performed to ensure that the computed output path resides in a designated temporary or safe directory.  
  - There is no sanitization to check that the user‑supplied output path does not refer to a critical system or user file.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to modify the workspace or launch configuration.  
  - The file specified in the `output` property must exist and be writable/deletable by the user running the extension.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `goDebug.ts`, the function `getLocalDebugeePath(output: string | undefined)` checks if the supplied value is an absolute path; if not, it resolves it relative to the program path.  
  - The resulting path is later passed to the cleanup function (`removeFile()`) without an additional boundary check.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a trusted workspace, open the launch configuration file (e.g. `launch.json`) and set the `"output"` property to an absolute path such as `"/tmp/malicious_test_file"`.  
  2. Manually create a file at that path with recognizable content.  
  3. Start a debugging session so that the debug binary is built.  
  4. End the debugging session to trigger the cleanup logic.  
  5. Verify that the file at `"/tmp/malicious_test_file"` has been deleted, confirming that the unvalidated output path was used.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Lack of Authentication on Debug Adapter Socket (Delve DAP)  
  **Description:**  
  In Delve DAP mode, the debug adapter creates a network server (implemented in `DelveDAPDebugAdapterOnSocket` in `goDebug.test.ts`) that listens on a port provided by `getPort()`. Although the server explicitly binds to the loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`), no further authentication is applied to the socket. In environments where an attacker can gain network access to the loopback interface (for example, in multi‑tenant containerized IDEs or through improperly configured port forwarding), an attacker may connect to the debug adapter socket and send arbitrary Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) messages.  
  **Impact:**  
  An attacker who connects to the debug adapter socket may intercept or manipulate the debugging session. By sending malformed or forged DAP messages (such as commands to continue execution or alter variables), the attacker can disrupt the debug process or potentially extract sensitive data about the target application.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The server binds only to the loopback address (`127.0.0.1`), which under typical desktop use restricts access to local processes.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No authentication or encryption is implemented to verify that only the legitimate VS Code client is connecting to the socket.  
  - No token‑ or key‑based access control is used to restrict interaction with the debug adapter.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to access the host’s loopback interface (this can occur in multi‑tenant setups or via misconfigured firewalls).  
  - The debug adapter must be running in Delve DAP mode.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the `serve()` method of the `DelveDAPDebugAdapterOnSocket` class (found in `goDebug.test.ts`), a server is created using `net.createServer()` and bound to `127.0.0.1` without additional access control.  
  - Once a connection is accepted, data is immediately forwarded to the DAP handling logic without any validation of its origin or credentials.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Launch a debug session using Delve DAP mode so that the adapter’s server is active and note the listening port.  
  2. From a separate terminal on the same machine, connect to `127.0.0.1` on the noted port (for example, using `nc 127.0.0.1 <port>`).  
  3. Manually send a crafted DAP message (e.g. a malformed “continue” request).  
  4. Observe that the debug adapter processes the message without rejecting it and that the debug session behaves unexpectedly (such as resuming execution improperly).  
  5. This confirms that an unauthenticated client is able to interact with the debug adapter over the socket.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Custom Formatter Command Execution  
  **Description:**  
  The extension supports using a user‑defined custom formatter when the workspace configuration sets `"go.formatTool"` to `"custom"` and specifies a command under `"go.alternateTools.customFormatter"`. The extension reads this command from the configuration and passes it directly to the underlying execution routine (typically via system calls or child process spawns) when the user triggers a document formatting action. Because no stringent validation or sanitization is applied to this command string, an attacker who is able to influence the workspace settings may supply a malicious command.  
  **Impact:**  
  Execution of arbitrary system commands with the same privileges as the user running VS Code. This can lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized modification or deletion of files, escalation of privileges, or even full system compromise.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The extension relies on the VS Code workspace trust model; it trusts that the configuration (including custom tool specifications) is provided by the user.  
  - In testing (see `/code/extension/test/gopls/extension.test.ts`), attempts to format with a nonexistent or custom formatter cause an error—but no further checks are made on the command string.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No explicit validation or sanitization of the custom formatter command is performed.  
  - There is no whitelist or set of allowed commands for the formatter, nor is there a prompt or confirmation when a custom command is about to be executed.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to modify or inject workspace configuration (for example, by tricking the user into opening an untrusted workspace).  
  - The user must subsequently trigger the document formatting feature so that the custom formatter command is executed.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the test file `/code/extension/test/gopls/extension.test.ts`, the helper function `testCustomFormatter` sets up a workspace configuration where `"go.formatTool"` is set to `"custom"` and an alternate tool (the custom formatter) is provided.  
  - The language client is configured and started without any additional checks on the value of `"go.alternateTools.customFormatter"`.  
  - When the document formatting provider is invoked (via `formatter.provideDocumentFormattingEdits`), the extension attempts to execute the custom formatter command exactly as provided by the configuration.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a trusted workspace’s `settings.json`, specify the following settings:  
     ```json
     {
       "go.formatTool": "custom",
       "go.alternateTools": {
         "customFormatter": "malicious_command_here"
       }
     }
     ```  
     (For testing purposes, replace `"malicious_command_here"` with a benign command that logs a distinctive message or writes to a controlled file.)  
  2. Open a Go source file in the workspace.  
  3. Trigger document formatting (e.g. via the command palette or keyboard shortcut).  
  4. Verify (using logging, file monitoring, or stubbing of the command executor) that the custom formatter command is indeed executed and that its output or side effect corresponds to the supplied (malicious) command.  
  5. This proves that the custom formatter command is executed directly from the configuration without any proper sanitization.
