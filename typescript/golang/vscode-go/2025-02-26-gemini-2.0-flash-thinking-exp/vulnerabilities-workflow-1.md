### Consolidated Vulnerability Report

This report combines identified vulnerabilities in the VS Code Go extension, categorized for clarity.

#### 1. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

This category encompasses vulnerabilities where user-controlled configuration settings or inputs are used to construct commands for external Go tools without proper sanitization, leading to potential arbitrary command execution.

##### 1.1. Command Injection in External Tool Execution via Configuration Settings

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in External Tool Execution via Configuration Settings
- Description: The VS Code Go extension executes various external Go tools using `child_process.execFile` or `child_process.spawn`.  A significant number of command arguments for these tools are derived from user-configurable settings in VS Code, including `settings.json`, `launch.json`, and `tasks.json`. These settings, if maliciously crafted, can inject arbitrary commands into the arguments passed to the external tools. Vulnerable settings include but are not limited to:
    - `go.vetFlags`, `go.lintFlags`, `go.buildFlags`, `go.testFlags`, `go.generateFlags`, `go.formatFlags`, `go.languageServerFlags`, `go.toolsGopath`, `go.gopath`, `go.alternateTools`, `go.coverageDecorator`, `go.testEnvVars`, options under `go.playground` in `settings.json`.
    - `dlvToolPath`, `dlvFlags`, `buildFlags`, `program`, `cwd`, `env`, `envFile`, `testFlags` in `launch.json` and `attach.json`.
    - `command`, `args`, `options.env`, `options.cwd` in `tasks.json`.

    Attackers can manipulate these settings by contributing malicious configuration files to projects or by tricking users into opening workspaces with compromised settings. When the extension executes tools based on these configurations, injected commands are executed by the system shell.

    **Step-by-step trigger (example with `go.testFlags`):**
    1. An attacker creates a malicious Go project with a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    2. In `settings.json`, the attacker sets `go.testFlags` to include a malicious command, e.g., `"-v", "-exec", "/bin/touch /tmp/vuln_test"`.
    3. The user opens this project in VS Code and triggers a Go test task (e.g., "Go: Test Workspace").
    4. The VS Code Go extension uses the attacker-controlled `go.testFlags` when executing `go test`.
    5. The injected command (`/bin/touch /tmp/vuln_test`) is executed by the system shell.

- Impact: High: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This allows attackers to install malware, steal data, or compromise the system.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - `tree-kill` version `1.2.2` is vendored, fixing PID sanitization (process termination, not initial execution).
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for all user-controlled configuration settings used in command construction.
    - Secure command construction methods to avoid shell interpretation.
    - Principle of least privilege for external tool execution.
- Preconditions:
    - User uses VS Code Go extension and opens a malicious project or workspace.
    - User triggers features that execute external Go tools (debugging, testing, linting, formatting, tasks, playground, etc.).
- Source code analysis:
    - Multiple files across the extension (e.g., `goTaskProvider.ts`, `goDebug.ts`, `goPlayground.ts`, `goFormat.ts`, `goVet.ts`, `goLint.ts`, `goLanguageServer.ts`, `goImpl.ts`, `goVulncheck.ts`) use `child_process.execFile` or `child_process.spawn` to execute external Go tools.
    - Command arguments are often constructed by concatenating user-configurable settings directly into command strings or argument arrays without sanitization.
    - Functions like `getTestFlags`, `getBuildFlags`, `getGenerateFlags`, `getFormatFlags`, `buildLanguageServerConfig`, `runGoImpl`, `writeVulns`, and task/debug configuration handling functions directly use user settings to build command arguments.
- Security test case:
    1. Setup: Open a Go workspace in VS Code.
    2. Modify Workspace Settings: Add a malicious `go.testFlags` setting in `settings.json`: `"go.testFlags": ["-v", "-vet=off", "-exec", "/bin/touch /tmp/task_vuln_test"]`.
    3. Trigger Go Test Task: Execute "Go: Test Workspace".
    4. Check for Command Execution: Verify if `/tmp/task_vuln_test` is created.
    5. Expected Outcome: File `/tmp/task_vuln_test` is created, indicating successful command injection.

##### 1.2. Command Injection in `gopls vulncheck` via Stdin

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in `gopls vulncheck` via Stdin
- Description: The `writeVulns` function in `extension/src/goVulncheck.ts` processes `VulncheckReport` data, which can contain `Entries` and `Findings`. This function iterates through and stringifies these as JSON before writing them to the stdin of a `gopls vulncheck` process. If `gopls vulncheck` is vulnerable to command injection via stdin JSON processing, a malicious `VulncheckReport` could cause arbitrary command execution.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. Attacker crafts a malicious `VulncheckReport` with command injection payloads in `Entries` or `Findings`.
        2. The VSCode Go extension processes this report using `writeVulns`, stringifying parts as JSON and sending to `gopls vulncheck` stdin.
        3. If `gopls vulncheck` improperly handles this JSON, command injection occurs.
- Impact: High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - VSCode Go extension: No sanitization on `res.Entries` or `res.Findings`.
    - Assumed mitigation in `gopls vulncheck`: Secure JSON stdin processing (unverified).
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for `res.Entries` and `res.Findings`.
    - Security audit of `gopls vulncheck` for stdin JSON handling.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker influences `VulncheckReport` data.
    - `gopls vulncheck` is vulnerable to command injection via stdin JSON.
- Source code analysis:
    - `extension/src/goVulncheck.ts`, `writeVulns` function: JSON.stringify of `res.Entries` and `res.Findings` written to `gopls vulncheck` stdin.
- Security test case:
    1. Setup: Prepare a Go project to produce a `VulncheckReport` with malicious data.
    2. Trigger Vulnerability Scan: Open project, trigger `go.diagnostic.vulncheck`.
    3. Monitor for Command Execution: Observe system for command execution.
    4. Expected Outcome: Command execution if `gopls vulncheck` is vulnerable and report is crafted correctly.

##### 1.3. Command Injection in `impl` command via user input

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in `impl` command via user input
- Description: The `implCursor` function in `extension/src/goImpl.ts` takes user input for interface implementation via `vscode.window.showInputBox`. This input is regex-parsed and passed as arguments to the `impl` tool via `cp.execFile`. If the `impl` tool is vulnerable or the regex is insufficient, malicious user input could lead to command injection.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. User executes "Go: Implement Interface" command.
        2. User provides malicious input in the input box, e.g., `foo $(touch /tmp/impl_vuln_test) io.Reader`.
        3. VSCode Go extension parses input and executes `impl` with user input as arguments.
        4. If `impl` is vulnerable, command injection occurs.
- Impact: High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Regex parsing `^(\w+\ \*?\w+\ )?([\w\.\-\/]+)$` on user input (likely insufficient).
    - Assumed mitigation in `impl` tool: Secure command-line argument processing (unverified).
- Missing mitigations:
    - Robust input sanitization beyond regex.
    - Security audit of `impl` tool.
- Preconditions:
    - User executes "Go: Implement Interface" command.
    - `impl` tool is vulnerable to command injection via command-line arguments.
- Source code analysis:
    - `extension/src/goImpl.ts`, `implCursor` and `runGoImpl` functions: User input regex-parsed and passed to `cp.execFile` executing `impl`.
- Security test case:
    1. Setup: Ensure `impl` tool is installed.
    2. Trigger "Implement Interface": Execute command in VSCode.
    3. Provide Malicious Input: Enter `foo $(touch /tmp/impl_vuln_test) io.Reader`.
    4. Check for Command Execution: Verify if `/tmp/impl_vuln_test` is created.
    5. Expected Outcome: File `/tmp/impl_vuln_test` creation indicates successful command injection.

##### 1.4. Insecure Custom Formatter Command Execution

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Custom Formatter Command Execution
- Description: When configured to use a custom formatter (`"go.formatTool": "custom"` and `"go.alternateTools.customFormatter"`), the extension directly executes the user-specified command. Lack of validation on this command allows for arbitrary command execution if a malicious command is configured.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. Attacker modifies workspace settings to set `"go.formatTool": "custom"` and `"go.alternateTools.customFormatter": "malicious_command"`.
        2. User opens a Go file and triggers document formatting.
        3. The extension executes `malicious_command` as the formatter.
- Impact: High: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Relies on VS Code workspace trust model.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Validation or sanitization of the custom formatter command.
    - Whitelist of allowed commands or user confirmation prompt.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker modifies workspace configuration.
    - User triggers document formatting.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `/code/extension/test/gopls/extension.test.ts` shows custom formatter configuration and execution without validation.
    - `GoDocumentFormattingEditProvider.runFormatter` executes the custom command via `cp.spawn`.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup: Set workspace `settings.json`: `"go.formatTool": "custom", "go.alternateTools": { "customFormatter": "/bin/touch /tmp/custom_format_vuln_test" }`.
    2. Trigger Formatting: Open Go file, format document.
    3. Check for Command Execution: Verify if `/tmp/custom_format_vuln_test` is created.
    4. Expected Outcome: File `/tmp/custom_format_vuln_test` is created, confirming command injection.


#### 2. Unvalidated Path Configuration Vulnerabilities

This category includes vulnerabilities related to insufficient validation of file paths provided in configuration settings, potentially leading to unauthorized file access or deletion.

##### 2.1. Unvalidated SubstitutePath Configuration in Debug Adapter

- Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated SubstitutePath Configuration in Debug Adapter
- Description: The debug adapter's `substitutePath` setting allows mapping local to remote file paths for debugging. It uses simple `startsWith` matching without validating the "from" and "to" paths. A malicious configuration could map a project folder to a sensitive system directory (e.g., `/etc`), allowing access to sensitive files during debugging.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. Attacker sets malicious `substitutePath` in `launch.json` or user settings, e.g., `{ "from": "/Users/legit/project", "to": "/etc" }`.
        2. User starts debugging a file in `/Users/legit/project`.
        3. Debugger rewrites file paths based on the malicious rule.
- Impact: High: Potential disclosure of sensitive system or application files.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Path normalization before substitution.
    - Log warnings for multiple matching rules.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Validation of "from" and "to" paths to ensure they are within safe directories.
    - Sanitization to prevent directory traversal or absolute paths outside safe boundaries.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker modifies workspace settings.
    - Debugger is used with these settings.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `goDebug.ts`, `toDebuggerPath` and `toLocalPath`: simple `startsWith` matching for substitution rules without validation.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup: Add malicious `substitutePath` to `launch.json`: `{ "go.substitutePath": [{ "from": "/Users/legit/project", "to": "/etc" }] }`.
    2. Start Debugging: Debug a file under `/Users/legit/project`.
    3. Verify Path Rewriting: Check debugger source view or stack trace for rewritten paths starting with `/etc`.
    4. Expected Outcome: File paths are rewritten to `/etc`, confirming unvalidated substitution.

##### 2.2. Unvalidated Debug Output Path Configuration

- Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated Debug Output Path Configuration
- Description: The debug adapter's `output` property in launch configuration specifies the debug binary output path. The `getLocalDebugeePath` function resolves this path, and `removeFile` is called on it during cleanup. Lack of validation allows an attacker to specify a sensitive file path, leading to unintended file deletion upon debug session end.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. Attacker sets malicious `output` path in `launch.json`, e.g., `"output": "/tmp/malicious_test_file"`.
        2. User starts and ends a debug session.
        3. Cleanup logic deletes the file at the specified path.
- Impact: High: Arbitrary file deletion, potentially leading to data loss or system instability.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Path normalization using Node.js path functions.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Validation to ensure output path is within a safe/temporary directory.
    - Sanitization to prevent critical system or user file paths.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker modifies launch configuration.
    - Specified file exists and is deletable by the user.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `goDebug.ts`, `getLocalDebugeePath`: resolves output path.
    - `goDebug.ts`, `close`: calls `removeFile` on the resolved output path without validation.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup: Set `"output": "/tmp/malicious_test_file"` in `launch.json`. Create `/tmp/malicious_test_file`.
    2. Start/End Debug Session: Start and immediately end a debug session.
    3. Verify File Deletion: Check if `/tmp/malicious_test_file` is deleted.
    4. Expected Outcome: File `/tmp/malicious_test_file` is deleted, confirming unvalidated output path usage.


#### 3. Lack of Authentication Vulnerability

This category contains vulnerabilities arising from missing or insufficient authentication mechanisms, potentially allowing unauthorized access and control.

##### 3.1. Lack of Authentication on Debug Adapter Socket (Delve DAP)

- Vulnerability Name: Lack of Authentication on Debug Adapter Socket (Delve DAP)
- Description: In Delve DAP mode, the debug adapter creates a network server on `127.0.0.1` without authentication. In environments with loopback interface access (e.g., containerized IDEs), attackers can connect to this socket and send arbitrary DAP messages to manipulate the debugging session.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. Debug session launched in Delve DAP mode.
        2. Attacker gains network access to loopback interface.
        3. Attacker connects to debug adapter socket and sends malicious DAP messages.
- Impact: Critical: Debug session manipulation, potential data extraction, disruption of debug process.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Server binds to loopback address (`127.0.0.1`).
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Authentication or encryption for socket connections.
    - Token- or key-based access control.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker access to host's loopback interface.
    - Debug adapter running in Delve DAP mode.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `goDebug.test.ts`, `DelveDAPDebugAdapterOnSocket.serve()`: creates server on `127.0.0.1` without authentication.
    - Data forwarded to DAP logic without origin validation.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup: Launch debug session in Delve DAP mode, note listening port.
    2. Connect to Socket: From terminal, connect to `127.0.0.1:<port>` using `nc`.
    3. Send Malicious DAP Message: Manually send a malformed DAP message (e.g., "continue").
    4. Observe Debug Session: Check for unexpected debug session behavior.
    5. Expected Outcome: Debug adapter processes message without authentication, session behaves unexpectedly, confirming vulnerability.
