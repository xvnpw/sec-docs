## Vulnerability List

### 1. Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution in `tree-kill` dependency

- Description: The `tree-kill` dependency, used for killing processes and their children, was found to have an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.2. This vulnerability is due to unsanitized input to the `pid` parameter, allowing injection of shell commands. Although the project has vendored version 1.2.2 of `tree-kill` which includes a fix, there is a risk if the vendoring or build process is compromised or if the fix is incomplete. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability if they can control the `pid` parameter passed to the `tree-kill` function within the VSCode extension's debug adapter.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the machine running the VSCode extension. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: The project has vendored `tree-kill` version 1.2.2, which includes a fix for the known arbitrary code execution vulnerability. The `extension/third_party/tree-kill/README.md` and `extension/third_party/tree-kill/tree-kill/CHANGELOG.md` files document this mitigation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Dependency Subresource Integrity (SRI) or similar mechanism to ensure the integrity of the vendored dependency.
    - Regular updates and security audits of vendored dependencies, especially those with known security vulnerabilities.
    - Sandboxing or isolation of the debug adapter process to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - The VSCode Go extension must use the `tree-kill` dependency to terminate processes.
    - An attacker must be able to influence the `pid` argument passed to the `tree-kill` function. This is theoretically possible if a vulnerability is found in how the extension handles process IDs, although no such vulnerability is apparent in the provided code.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The project vendors `tree-kill` version 1.2.2 in `extension/third_party/tree-kill`.
    - `extension/third_party/tree-kill/README.md` and `extension/third_party/tree-kill/CHANGELOG.md` confirm vendoring version 1.2.2 and highlight the security fix.
    - `extension/third_party/tree-kill/index.js` is the code of the vendored library. Reviewing the changelog and code confirms the input sanitization fix in version 1.2.2.
    - The extension uses `tree-kill` in `extension/src/utils/processUtils.ts` to implement `killProcessTree`.
    - `killProcessTree` function is used in `extension/src/language/legacy/goFormat.ts` to handle process termination during formatting, and in `extension/src/debugAdapter/goDebug.ts` to handle debug session termination.
    - In `extension/src/language/legacy/goFormat.ts`:
        ```typescript
        p.on('close', (code) => { ... token.onCancellationRequested(() => !p.killed && killProcessTree(p)); ... });
        ```
        - `killProcessTree(p)` is called when cancellation is requested for the formatting process. The `p` here is the child process spawned for the formatting tool. The `pid` used in `tree-kill` comes from `p.pid`, which is process ID of the formatting tool spawned by the extension.
    - In `extension/src/debugAdapter/goDebug.ts`:
        ```typescript
        export class Delve { ... public async close(): Promise<void> { ... await forceCleanup(); ... } ... }
        const forceCleanup = async () => { ... if (this.debugProcess) { await killProcessTree(this.debugProcess, log); } ... };
        ```
        - `killProcessTree(this.debugProcess, log)` is called within `forceCleanup` function when closing debug session. `this.debugProcess` is the child process spawned for `dlv`. The `pid` used in `tree-kill` comes from `this.debugProcess.pid`, which is process ID of the delve debugger spawned by the extension.
    - The `pid` argument to `killProcessTree` originates from child processes spawned by the extension itself (formatter, debugger), not directly from external user input. However, if there's a way to manipulate the spawned processes or their IDs through a vulnerability in the extension, arbitrary code execution via `tree-kill` could be theoretically possible.
    - Visualization: Not needed as the vulnerability is in a vendored dependency and the mitigation is vendoring the fixed version.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Vulnerability Confirmation Test (Negative Test - Should be mitigated):**
        - Attempt to exploit the arbitrary code execution vulnerability in a hypothetical older version of `tree-kill` (e.g., by modifying the vendored code temporarily to an older vulnerable version, if feasible in a controlled test environment, or by analyzing the code diff between vulnerable and fixed versions).
        - Trigger the process killing functionality in the VSCode Go extension (e.g., by cancelling a formatting operation, or stopping a debug session).
        - Observe that arbitrary code execution does not occur due to the input sanitization fix present in the vendored `tree-kill` version 1.2.2.
    2. **Dependency Integrity Test:**
        - Implement a test to verify the checksum or hash of the vendored `tree-kill` dependency against a known good value to ensure its integrity and prevent tampering. This test would ideally be part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### 2. Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in custom formatTool

- Description: The VSCode Go extension allows users to configure a custom formatting tool via the `go.formatTool` and `go.alternateTools` settings. If a user configures `go.formatTool` to `custom` and `go.alternateTools.customFormatter` to a path controlled by an attacker, or a path containing malicious arguments, it could lead to command injection when the extension executes this custom formatter.
    - Steps to trigger vulnerability:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious input that will be eventually used as `pid` argument in `tree-kill` library.
        2. The attacker provides this malicious input to the VS Code Go extension in a way that the extension uses it to kill process tree using `tree-kill` library.
        3. The `tree-kill` library executes arbitrary code due to the unsanitized `pid` parameter.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could lead to data exfiltration, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: The extension uses `resolvePath` function to resolve the path of the custom formatter. However, this function does not prevent command injection if the resolved path itself contains malicious arguments. The `usingCustomFormatTool` function checks against a predefined list of safe formatters, but this check is bypassed when `go.formatTool` is set to `custom`.
    - Location: `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/README.md` and `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/index.js`
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `go.alternateTools.customFormatter` setting. The extension should verify that the path is safe and does not contain any command injection characters.
    - Consider disallowing the `custom` formatTool option altogether or providing a more secure way to configure custom tools.
- Preconditions:
    1. The VS Code Go extension must use the `tree-kill` library for process management.
    2. External input that is not properly validated must be used as the `pid` argument to the `tree-kill` function.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. The file `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/README.md` and `/code/CHANGELOG.md` indicate that `tree-kill` was vendored at version 1.2.2 to address issue #90 and includes a security fix for an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
    2. The file `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/index.js` is the source code of the `tree-kill` library.
    3. Review of `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/index.js` and the mentioned commit in `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/README.md` confirms that the `pid` parameter is now sanitized before being used in the `exec` or `spawn` calls, mitigating the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Ensure the VS Code Go extension is installed with the vendored `tree-kill` library.
        - Create a simple Go project that can be debugged using the VS Code Go extension.
    2. Trigger:
        -  It is not directly possible to trigger this vulnerability through a standard VS Code extension test case because it requires crafting malicious input that would be used as a PID.  However, the test case here is to verify the mitigation.
    3. Verification:
        - Manually review the code in `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/index.js` to confirm the sanitization logic for the `pid` parameter in version 1.2.2.
        - Verify that the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files in the root of the project correctly point to the vendored and patched version of `tree-kill` in `third_party/tree-kill`.
        - Run `npm install` from the root of the project and verify that `package-lock.json` still points to the patched version.
