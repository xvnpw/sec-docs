```

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer creates a contribution (e.g., new type definition or update) and submits it as a Pull Request (PR) to the DefinitelyTyped GitHub repository.
  - The PR submission automatically triggers the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
  - The CI pipeline performs a series of automated checks:
    - Linting Checks: Code linters analyze the code for style and potential errors.
    - TypeScript Compiler Checks: The TypeScript compiler verifies the type definitions for syntax and type correctness.
    - Test Suites (if any): If test suites are included with the contribution, they are executed to ensure the type definitions behave as expected.
    - Security Scanning (Recommended): Security scanning tools (SAST, dependency checks) should be integrated to identify potential vulnerabilities in the contributed code and dependencies.
  - The results of the CI pipeline are reported back to the GitHub PR.
  - Maintainers review the PR, considering the CI results and manually inspecting the code.
  - Upon approval from maintainers, the PR is merged into the main branch of the GitHub repository.
  - Optionally, a merge to the main branch can trigger a separate publishing process (which is likely external to this repository and managed by the DefinitelyTyped maintainers) to publish the type definitions to package registries like npm.
- Build Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated CI pipeline ensures consistent and repeatable build and validation process. Implemented by: GitHub Actions.
  - security control: Linting and TypeScript compiler checks help prevent syntax errors and type inconsistencies. Implemented by: GitHub Actions (Linters, TypeScript Compiler).
  - security control: Code review process by maintainers adds a manual security and quality gate. Implemented by: Community Maintainers.
  - security control: (Recommended) Security scanning (SAST, dependency scanning) in CI to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle. Recommended for implementation in: GitHub Actions.
  - security control: (Recommended) Supply chain security considerations for CI environment, ensuring tools and dependencies used in the build process are secure. Recommended for implementation in: GitHub Actions configuration and runner environment.
  - security control: Access control to GitHub Actions workflows and secrets to prevent unauthorized modifications to the build process. Implemented by: GitHub platform access controls.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Maintaining the integrity and accuracy of TypeScript type definitions.
  - Ensuring the availability and accessibility of the DefinitelyTyped repository.
  - Facilitating a trustworthy and collaborative community for type definition contributions.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Type Definition Files (.d.ts): Publicly available code, but integrity is critical. Compromised type definitions can introduce vulnerabilities into a wide range of projects. High integrity requirement.
  - Contribution History (Git): Publicly available, important for traceability and accountability. Medium integrity requirement.
  - Metadata (e.g., issue reports, PR discussions): Publicly available, contributes to community knowledge and project management. Low to medium integrity requirement.
  - No highly confidential data is directly managed within the DefinitelyTyped repository itself. The primary concern is the integrity and availability of public type definition data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific security scanning tools are currently used (if any) in the GitHub Actions CI pipeline?
  - Is there a formal process for security reviews of contributions, especially for widely used or critical type definitions?
  - What is the process for handling reported security vulnerabilities in type definitions? Is there a dedicated security team or contact?
  - Are there any specific guidelines or training for maintainers on security best practices for code review and contribution management?
  - What is the process for publishing type definitions to npm registry or other distribution channels? Are there security controls in place for the publishing process?
- Assumptions:
  - The GitHub platform provides a reasonably secure infrastructure and platform-level security controls.
  - Community contributors are generally well-intentioned, but security vulnerabilities can be introduced unintentionally or maliciously.
  - The primary security risk is related to the integrity of type definitions and the potential for introducing vulnerabilities into consuming projects through compromised or inaccurate types.
  - The project relies heavily on community contributions and the code review process for maintaining quality and security.
  - The build and CI/CD processes are currently based on GitHub Actions, and can be extended to incorporate additional security controls.
