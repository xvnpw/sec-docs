# Threat Model Analysis for definitelytyped/definitelytyped

## Threat: [Malicious Type Definitions Injection](./threats/malicious_type_definitions_injection.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Type Definitions Injection
* **Description:** An attacker compromises a contributor account or the DefinitelyTyped infrastructure. They inject malicious code into type definition files hosted on DefinitelyTyped. This malicious code is designed to execute during the development or build process when developers install or use these type definitions. For example, the attacker might embed JavaScript code within comments or craft type definitions that exploit vulnerabilities in build tools, type checkers, or developer IDEs.
* **Impact:**
    * Developer machines can be compromised, potentially leading to sensitive data theft, installation of malware, or unauthorized access to development environments.
    * Build pipelines can be compromised, allowing the attacker to inject malicious code into the final application artifacts, leading to a supply chain attack. This could affect all users of applications built using the compromised type definitions.
* **Affected DefinitelyTyped Component:** Type Definition Files (`.d.ts` files) - specifically the content within comments or through type system manipulations within these files.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement rigorous **code review** processes for all dependency updates, especially type definitions. Focus on identifying unusual or suspicious changes within the type definition files.
    * Utilize **package integrity checks** provided by package managers (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, `pnpm audit`) to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies, although this might not directly detect injected malicious code in type definitions.
    * Employ **dependency pinning** using package lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) to ensure consistent versions of type definitions are used and prevent unexpected updates that might introduce malicious code.
    * **Monitor source code management** for unexpected modifications to dependency files (`package.json`, `yarn.lock`) that could indicate unauthorized changes to type definition dependencies.
    * Use **sandboxed build environments** (e.g., containers, virtual machines) to limit the potential impact of compromised type definitions during the build process, preventing malicious code from spreading beyond the build environment.
    * Prioritize and trust type definitions from **well-established and reputable contributors** within the DefinitelyTyped community, although this is not a foolproof method.
