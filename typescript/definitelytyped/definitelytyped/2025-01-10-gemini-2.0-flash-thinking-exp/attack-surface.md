# Attack Surface Analysis for definitelytyped/definitelytyped

## Attack Surface: [Type Definition Exploitation Leading to Type Confusion](./attack_surfaces/type_definition_exploitation_leading_to_type_confusion.md)

* **Attack Surface: Type Definition Exploitation Leading to Type Confusion**
    * **Description:**  Maliciously crafted or subtly incorrect type definitions introduce ambiguities or false assumptions about the types of data being handled. This can bypass TypeScript's type checking and lead to runtime errors or security vulnerabilities in the compiled JavaScript code.
    * **How DefinitelyTyped Contributes:**  Errors or malicious intent in community-contributed type definitions *within the DefinitelyTyped repository* can lead to incorrect type assumptions in the consuming application. If a widely used type definition from DefinitelyTyped is subtly flawed, it can affect many projects.
    * **Example:** A type definition for a function sourced from `@types/some-library` on DefinitelyTyped, which is supposed to return a sanitized string, incorrectly allows for the return of unsanitized data. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the consuming code relies on the type definition's implied guarantee.
    * **Impact:**  Introduction of runtime errors, security vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection (if type definitions influence data handling logic), or data corruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly test your application, even if TypeScript reports no errors. Type safety at compile time doesn't guarantee runtime safety.
        * Be cautious about relying solely on type definitions for security guarantees, especially for data sanitization.
        * Consider using runtime validation libraries to enforce data integrity at runtime.
        * Report suspicious or incorrect type definitions to the DefinitelyTyped maintainers through their GitHub repository.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities via Compromised Packages](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerabilities_via_compromised_packages.md)

* **Attack Surface: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities via Compromised Packages**
    * **Description:**  An attacker compromises a maintainer account for a popular `@types` package on npm (which originates from DefinitelyTyped contributions) or gains unauthorized access to the DefinitelyTyped repository itself, allowing them to inject malicious or flawed type definitions.
    * **How DefinitelyTyped Contributes:**  DefinitelyTyped serves as the primary source for many `@types` packages on npm. A compromise at either the DefinitelyTyped repository level or at the individual `@types` package maintainer level directly impacts users who depend on these definitions. The trust placed in the `@types` namespace stemming from DefinitelyTyped is the core of this contribution.
    * **Example:** A compromised maintainer for `@types/react` on npm (built from DefinitelyTyped contributions) publishes a version with a subtly altered type definition that introduces a vulnerability in applications using React. Alternatively, a malicious actor gains access to the DefinitelyTyped repository and merges a pull request containing backdoored type definitions for a widely used library.
    * **Impact:**  Widespread distribution of malicious code or flawed definitions, potentially affecting a large number of projects and developers. This can lead to various security breaches, data loss, or supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly audit your project's dependencies, specifically including `@types` packages.
        * Use dependency scanning tools that can detect known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
        * Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) practices to track your dependencies.
        * Consider using tools that verify the integrity and authenticity of packages fetched from npm.
        * Stay informed about security advisories related to npm and the DefinitelyTyped project.
        * Pin your dependencies to specific versions to avoid automatically pulling in potentially compromised updates.
        * Consider using a private npm registry to have more control over the packages used in your projects.
