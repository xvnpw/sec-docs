# Threat Model Analysis for definitelytyped/definitelytyped

## Threat: [Compromised Maintainer Account](./threats/compromised_maintainer_account.md)

* **Threat:** Compromised Maintainer Account
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a maintainer's account on the `DefinitelyTyped` repository. They could then modify existing type definition files or upload new, malicious ones. This could involve phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in GitHub's security.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application's build process or even runtime (if the malicious definitions lead to the inclusion of unexpected code). This could lead to data breaches, application crashes, or remote code execution on user machines.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `DefinitelyTyped` repository and individual type definition files.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Encourage maintainers to use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their GitHub accounts.
        * Implement code review processes for all changes to type definitions, even for trusted maintainers.
        * Regularly audit maintainer access and activity logs.
        * GitHub should enforce strong security practices for repository maintainers.

## Threat: [Type Confusion Leading to Runtime Errors or Security Vulnerabilities](./threats/type_confusion_leading_to_runtime_errors_or_security_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Type Confusion Leading to Runtime Errors or Security Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** An attacker submits or modifies type definitions that are subtly incorrect or misleading within the `DefinitelyTyped` repository. This could cause the TypeScript compiler to allow unsafe operations, leading to runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities in the compiled JavaScript code. For example, a type definition might incorrectly allow a null value where it's not expected, leading to a null pointer exception.
    * **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, and potentially exploitable security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or denial-of-service (DoS) if the type confusion affects security-sensitive parts of the application.
    * **Affected Component:** Specific type definition files within the `DefinitelyTyped` repository with incorrect or misleading type information.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement thorough testing, including runtime testing, to catch errors introduced by incorrect type definitions.
        * Encourage developers to carefully review type definitions for correctness, especially for critical dependencies.
        * Utilize linters and static analysis tools that can detect potential type inconsistencies.
        * Consider using runtime type checking or validation in addition to TypeScript's compile-time checks for critical data.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Repository Infrastructure](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_repository_infrastructure.md)

* **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Repository Infrastructure
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises the infrastructure hosting the `DefinitelyTyped` repository (e.g., GitHub servers, CI/CD pipelines). This could allow them to directly modify type definition files without needing to compromise individual maintainer accounts.
    * **Impact:** Widespread distribution of malicious or vulnerable type definitions, potentially affecting a large number of applications that depend on `DefinitelyTyped`. This could have severe consequences, including widespread data breaches or malware distribution.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `DefinitelyTyped` repository and its associated infrastructure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Rely on GitHub's security measures for protecting its infrastructure.
        * Encourage GitHub to implement robust security practices and regularly audit its infrastructure.
        * Developers can use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for `@types` packages if supported by their package manager (though this is not a standard practice for type definitions).
        * Employ dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in `@types` packages.
