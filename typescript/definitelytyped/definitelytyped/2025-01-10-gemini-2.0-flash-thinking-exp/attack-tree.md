## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via DefinitelyTyped (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_definitelytyped__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the aggregation of all successful attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise DefinitelyTyped Repository (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_definitelytyped_repository__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This node represents the attacker gaining control over the official source of type definitions. Success here allows for widespread impact by injecting malicious or flawed definitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Phishing of Repository Admins (High-Risk Path Start)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringphishing_of_repository_admins__high-risk_path_start_.md)

Attackers target administrators of the DefinitelyTyped repository with phishing emails or other social engineering tactics to steal their credentials, granting them access to the repository infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Contributor Account (Critical Node, High-Risk Path Start)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_contributor_account__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

Attackers target individual contributors to DefinitelyTyped to gain access to their accounts. This is often easier than compromising the entire repository infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing Attack on Contributor (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_attack_on_contributor__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers use deceptive emails or messages to trick contributors into revealing their login credentials or other sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Account Credential Theft (malware, reused passwords) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/account_credential_theft__malware__reused_passwords___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers obtain contributor credentials through various means, such as infecting their systems with malware or exploiting the reuse of passwords across different services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Type Definitions (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_type_definitions__high-risk_path_.md)

Once an attacker has gained access to the repository or a contributor account, they can introduce malicious or flawed type definitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Type Definitions with Subtle Errors Leading to Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_type_definitions_with_subtle_errors_leading_to_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers introduce type definitions that contain subtle errors or omissions that can lead to vulnerabilities in applications using those definitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type Confusion Exploitation (e.g., incorrect nullability, wrong function signatures) (High-Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/type_confusion_exploitation__e_g___incorrect_nullability__wrong_function_signatures___high-risk_.md)

This specific technique involves creating type definitions that cause type mismatches at runtime, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities, such as incorrectly defining a nullable type as non-nullable or providing incorrect function signatures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Existing Vulnerabilities in DefinitelyTyped Definitions (High-Risk Path Start)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_existing_vulnerabilities_in_definitelytyped_definitions__high-risk_path_start_.md)

Attackers identify and exploit existing flaws or oversights in the current type definitions within the DefinitelyTyped repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Type Definitions with Incorrect or Missing Null Checks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_type_definitions_with_incorrect_or_missing_null_checks__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers find type definitions that incorrectly mark properties as non-nullable when they can be null, leading to potential null pointer exceptions or undefined behavior in the target application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Null Pointer Exceptions or Undefined Behavior in Target Application (High-Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_null_pointer_exceptions_or_undefined_behavior_in_target_application__high-risk_.md)

This is the consequence of the previous step, where the application crashes or behaves unexpectedly due to encountering null values where they were not expected based on the type definitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Type Definitions with Incorrect Function Signatures (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_type_definitions_with_incorrect_function_signatures__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers find type definitions that do not accurately reflect the parameters of the underlying JavaScript functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Allow Passing Incorrect Arguments Leading to Errors or Vulnerabilities (High-Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/allow_passing_incorrect_arguments_leading_to_errors_or_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

As a result of incorrect function signatures in type definitions, developers might pass incorrect arguments to functions, leading to errors, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Misleading Developers (High-Risk Path Start)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringmisleading_developers__high-risk_path_start_.md)

Attackers aim to manipulate developers into writing insecure code by providing misleading or flawed type definitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Type Definitions that Encourage Insecure Coding Practices (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_type_definitions_that_encourage_insecure_coding_practices__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers create type definitions that subtly encourage developers to write code that is vulnerable, for example, by omitting necessary checks or suggesting insecure patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Developers unknowingly implement vulnerable code based on misleading types (High-Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/developers_unknowingly_implement_vulnerable_code_based_on_misleading_types__high-risk_.md)

This is the consequence of the previous step, where developers, trusting the type definitions, write insecure code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Type Definitions that Mask Underlying Issues (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_type_definitions_that_mask_underlying_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers provide type definitions that incorrectly imply a certain level of safety or validation, leading developers to believe their code is secure when it is not.

## Attack Tree Path: [Developers fail to address potential problems due to misleading type safety (High-Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/developers_fail_to_address_potential_problems_due_to_misleading_type_safety__high-risk_.md)

This is the consequence of the previous step, where developers, misled by the type definitions, fail to implement necessary security measures.
