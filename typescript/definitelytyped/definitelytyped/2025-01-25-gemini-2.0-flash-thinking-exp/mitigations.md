### Mitigation Strategy: Code Review and Auditing of Type Definitions from DefinitelyTyped

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Integrate Type Definition Review into Workflow:**  Make code review a mandatory step for any changes that introduce new `@types/*` dependencies or update existing ones from DefinitelyTyped.
    2.  **Dedicated Reviewer Focus:** Assign reviewers who understand the risks associated with community-sourced type definitions and are familiar with basic type definition structure and potential malicious patterns.
    3.  **Review Steps:** Reviewers should:
        *   **Verify Justification:** Confirm the necessity of the new or updated `@types/*` package. Is it truly needed for the project?
        *   **Check DefinitelyTyped Source:**  Briefly examine the type definition files directly in the DefinitelyTyped repository on GitHub (https://github.com/definitelytyped/definitelytyped) for the specific package and version being added. Look for recent changes, contributor history, and any unusual or overly permissive type definitions (e.g., excessive use of `any`).
        *   **Look for Suspicious Patterns:**  Scan `.d.ts` files for any code that looks like executable JavaScript (which should not be present in type definitions), unusual comments, or overly complex type constructs that seem unnecessary.
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** If concerns arise, explore if there are alternative type definition sources or if the library itself provides types.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Type Definitions Injection via DefinitelyTyped (High Severity):**  Compromised or intentionally malicious type definitions could be introduced through DefinitelyTyped, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure if the types are crafted to exploit vulnerabilities or mislead developers.
    *   **Accidental Introduction of Poor Quality Type Definitions (Medium Severity):**  DefinitelyTyped is community-maintained, and type definitions can be incomplete, incorrect, or outdated. Poor quality definitions can lead to type errors being ignored, masking real issues in the application code and potentially creating runtime vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Type Definitions Injection via DefinitelyTyped (High Reduction):**  Direct review of type definitions from DefinitelyTyped significantly reduces the risk of unknowingly incorporating malicious code disguised as type information.
    *   **Accidental Introduction of Poor Quality Type Definitions (Medium Reduction):** Review can catch obvious errors or inconsistencies in type definitions, prompting further investigation or selection of more reliable definitions.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are mandatory, but specific focus on DefinitelyTyped source verification and dedicated reviewer training for type definition security is missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalize steps for reviewing DefinitelyTyped source code in the code review process documentation.
    *   Provide training to reviewers on identifying potential security risks within type definition files from DefinitelyTyped.
    *   Potentially create checklists or automated checks to assist reviewers in verifying type definition integrity from DefinitelyTyped.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pinning Specific Versions of `@types/*` Packages from DefinitelyTyped](./mitigation_strategies/pinning_specific_versions_of__@types__packages_from_definitelytyped.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Pinning Specific Versions of `@types/*` Packages from DefinitelyTyped

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Exact Versions in `package.json`:**  When adding or updating `@types/*` packages in `package.json`, always specify exact versions (e.g., `"@types/lodash": "4.14.191"`) instead of version ranges (e.g., `"^4.14.0"` or `"~4.14.0"`).
    2.  **Commit Lock Files:** Ensure `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (Yarn) is committed to version control. These files record the exact versions of all dependencies, including `@types/*` packages, used in a build.
    3.  **Controlled Updates:**  When updating `@types/*` packages, do so explicitly and deliberately. Review the changes in the DefinitelyTyped repository for the new version before updating in `package.json` and regenerating the lock file.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Malicious Updates from DefinitelyTyped (Medium Severity):** If a maintainer account on DefinitelyTyped is compromised, malicious updates could be pushed to `@types/*` packages within a version range. Pinning versions prevents automatic adoption of such updates.
    *   **Introduction of Breaking Changes from DefinitelyTyped Updates (Medium Severity):**  Even non-malicious updates to type definitions on DefinitelyTyped can introduce breaking changes or subtle errors in type checking that can disrupt the application. Pinning versions provides stability and control over when these changes are introduced.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Malicious Updates from DefinitelyTyped (Medium Reduction):** Pinning versions significantly reduces the window of opportunity for malicious updates to automatically affect the project. Updates require explicit action and review.
    *   **Introduction of Breaking Changes from DefinitelyTyped Updates (Medium Reduction):**  Pinning versions provides a stable baseline and allows for controlled testing and adaptation to breaking changes in type definitions before updating.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Version pinning is generally practiced for dependencies, but consistent enforcement and specific awareness for `@types/*` packages from DefinitelyTyped might be lacking.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Audit `package.json` to ensure all `@types/*` dependencies are using exact versions.
    *   Explicitly document version pinning for `@types/*` packages as a security best practice in development guidelines.
    *   Consider using linters or dependency audit tools to flag version ranges in `@types/*` dependencies and enforce exact versioning.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Private Mirroring or Caching of DefinitelyTyped Packages](./mitigation_strategies/private_mirroring_or_caching_of_definitelytyped_packages.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Private Mirroring or Caching of DefinitelyTyped Packages

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set up a Private npm Registry or Mirror:**  Implement a private npm registry (like Artifactory, Nexus, or npm Enterprise) or a mirroring solution that caches or proxies requests to the public npm registry, specifically for `@types/*` packages originating from DefinitelyTyped.
    2.  **Configure Build Process:**  Configure the project's build process (npm or yarn configuration) to prioritize the private registry or mirror when resolving `@types/*` dependencies.
    3.  **Snapshotting/Version Control in Private Registry:**  Utilize features of the private registry to create snapshots or version-controlled copies of `@types/*` packages. This allows for rollback to known good versions and further control over the supply chain.
    4.  **Vetting and Whitelisting (Optional):**  For highly sensitive environments, implement a vetting process where `@types/*` packages are manually reviewed and whitelisted in the private registry before being made available for project use.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks on DefinitelyTyped/npm Registry (High Severity):**  If the DefinitelyTyped repository or the npm registry itself is compromised, malicious packages could be served. A private mirror or registry acts as a buffer and point of control.
    *   **Dependency Availability and Stability (Medium Severity):**  Reliance on the public npm registry introduces a dependency on its availability and stability. A private mirror ensures continued access to necessary `@types/*` packages even if the public registry has issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks on DefinitelyTyped/npm Registry (High Reduction):**  A private mirror or registry significantly reduces the direct dependency on the public npm registry and DefinitelyTyped, providing a controlled and potentially vetted source for type definitions.
    *   **Dependency Availability and Stability (High Reduction):**  Local caching and mirroring ensure consistent access to `@types/*` packages, improving build reliability and reducing the risk of build failures due to external registry issues.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. The project currently relies directly on the public npm registry for all dependencies, including `@types/*` packages.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Evaluate and select a suitable private npm registry or mirroring solution.
    *   Implement the chosen solution and configure the project's build process to use it for `@types/*` packages.
    *   Establish processes for managing and maintaining the private registry/mirror, including snapshotting and potential vetting of packages.
