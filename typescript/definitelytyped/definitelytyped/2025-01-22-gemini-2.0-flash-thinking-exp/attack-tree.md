## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Development Environment [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_development_environment__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker aims to gain control over the developer's machine or development environment. This is a critical node because it can lead to direct code injection, credential theft, and further compromise of the application and its infrastructure.

    *   **1.1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Development Tools [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting bugs in tools that process type definitions (compiler, linters, IDEs). This is a high-risk path because successful exploitation can lead to code execution within the development environment.

            *   **1.1.1. Trigger Compiler Bugs (TypeScript Compiler - `tsc`) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - if vuln known]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious type definitions (1.1.1.1) specifically designed to trigger known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the TypeScript compiler. Targeting a specific compiler version (1.1.1.2) increases the likelihood of success if a version with known vulnerabilities is targeted.
                *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine during compilation.
                *   **Mitigation:** Keep TypeScript compiler updated, consider pre-release testing of type definitions, and potentially sandboxing compilation processes in sensitive environments.

            *   **1.1.2. Trigger Linter/Static Analysis Bugs [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - if vuln known]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to compiler bugs, but targeting linters or static analysis tools. Crafting malicious type definitions (1.1.2.1) to exploit vulnerabilities in linters/analyzers, potentially targeting specific versions (1.1.2.2).
                *   **Impact:** Code execution within the linter/analyzer process in the development environment.
                *   **Mitigation:** Keep linters and static analysis tools updated, review their logs for anomalies, and consider sandboxing these processes.

            *   **1.1.3. Exploit IDE Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - if vuln known]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in IDEs through malicious type definitions (1.1.3.1). This could target specific IDE features that process type information (1.1.3.2) like code completion or refactoring.
                *   **Impact:** Code execution within the IDE process, potentially leading to access to project files and developer credentials.
                *   **Mitigation:** Keep IDEs and TypeScript plugins updated, monitor IDE logs for suspicious activity, and consider IDE security settings.

    *   **1.2. Supply Chain Poisoning via DefinitelyTyped [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Compromising the supply chain of type definitions to distribute malicious code to developers. This is a critical node and high-risk path due to the potential for widespread impact.

            *   **1.2.2. Malicious Contribution Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious type definitions through the contribution process. Submitting malicious pull requests (1.2.2.1) is a key attack vector here, relying on bypassing code review.
                *   **Impact:** Potentially widespread distribution of malicious type definitions if a malicious PR is merged.
                *   **Mitigation:** Strengthen code review processes for DefinitelyTyped contributions, focusing on security implications. Implement stricter contributor vetting and potentially automated security checks for PRs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirectly Influence Application Logic (Less Direct, More Theoretical) [HIGH-RISK PATH - Logic Errors]](./attack_tree_paths/indirectly_influence_application_logic__less_direct__more_theoretical___high-risk_path_-_logic_error_ab211610.md)

*   **Description:**  Subtly manipulating type definitions to introduce logic errors in the application. While less direct than development environment compromise, it can still lead to vulnerabilities in the deployed application.

    *   **2.1. Type Definition Mismatches Leading to Logic Errors [HIGH-RISK PATH - Logic Errors]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Introducing subtle type errors in definitions (2.1.1) that are not immediately obvious but lead to incorrect type assumptions in application code (2.1.2), ultimately manifesting as logic errors in the deployed application (2.1.3).
        *   **Impact:** Logic errors in the application, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or application malfunctions.
        *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous testing of application logic, especially in areas heavily reliant on type definitions. Code reviews should also consider the potential for type-related logic errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Type Definition Complexity [HIGH-RISK PATH - DoS]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_type_definition_complexity__high-risk_path_-_dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  Overloading development tools with extremely complex type definitions to cause a denial of service. While not a direct security compromise of the application itself, it can disrupt development workflows.

    *   **2.2. Denial of Service via Type Definition Complexity [HIGH-RISK PATH - DoS]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting extremely complex type definitions (2.2.1) that overload compiler/type checker resources (2.2.2), significantly slowing down development or build processes (2.2.3).
        *   **Impact:** Disruption of development workflows, slowing down build times, and potentially hindering releases.
        *   **Mitigation:** Performance monitoring of build processes. Implement limits on type definition complexity if feasible.  Code review should also look for excessively complex or suspicious type definitions.
