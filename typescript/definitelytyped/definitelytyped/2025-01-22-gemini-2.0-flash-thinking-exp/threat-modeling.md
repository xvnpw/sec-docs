# Threat Model Analysis for definitelytyped/definitelytyped

## Threat: [Malicious Type Definition Injection (High Severity)](./threats/malicious_type_definition_injection__high_severity_.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Type Definition Injection
* **Description:**
    * An attacker compromises the DefinitelyTyped GitHub repository or the npm registry accounts used to publish `@types` packages.
    * The attacker injects malicious code or intentionally flawed type definitions into a *highly popular* `@types` package (e.g., `@types/react`, `@types/node`).
    * Developers unknowingly download and use this compromised package as a dependency in their projects.
    * The malicious code, if present and exploitable by tooling, could be executed during development or build processes. More likely, the flawed type definitions could introduce subtle bugs or mislead developers into writing vulnerable code, which could be exploited later.
* **Impact:**
    * **Supply Chain Compromise (High Impact):**  Compromises the integrity of the software supply chain, potentially affecting a vast number of projects that depend on the compromised `@types` package.
    * **Development Tooling Exploitation (Medium to High Impact, Low Probability but Severe if Successful):**  Potentially compromise developer machines or build environments if malicious code in type definitions can exploit vulnerabilities in TypeScript compilers or related tooling.
    * **Widespread Application Bugs (High Impact):** Introduce logic errors and unexpected behavior in numerous applications due to incorrect type assumptions, potentially leading to widespread security vulnerabilities.
* **Affected Component:** `@types` packages published on npm registry, potentially the DefinitelyTyped GitHub repository itself.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Use Package Lock Files:** Ensure consistent dependency versions using `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to prevent unexpected updates to potentially compromised packages.
    * **Regular Dependency Audits:** Periodically review dependencies, especially `@types` packages, for unexpected changes or potential signs of compromise.
    * **Pin Specific Versions:** Consider pinning `@types` package versions in `package.json` to have greater control over updates and reduce the window of exposure to a compromised package.
    * **Source Verification (Limited but Important):** While direct code verification of all type definitions is impractical, rely on the general reputation of DefinitelyTyped and monitor for security advisories related to the repository or npm registry. Be aware of any unusual activity or warnings related to `@types` packages.
    * **Consider Subresource Integrity (SRI) for npm (Future Enhancement):** While not currently widely supported for npm dependencies, if SRI or similar mechanisms become available, consider using them to verify the integrity of downloaded `@types` packages.
