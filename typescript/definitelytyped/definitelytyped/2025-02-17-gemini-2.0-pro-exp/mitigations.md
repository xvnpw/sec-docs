# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for definitelytyped/definitelytyped

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pinning `@types` Package Versions](./mitigation_strategies/pinning__@types__package_versions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all `@types` packages (dependencies from the DefinitelyTyped project) in your `package.json` file.
    2.  For each `@types` package, change the version specifier from `^` (caret) or `~` (tilde) to `=` (equals).  This "pins" the package to a specific version retrieved from DefinitelyTyped.  For example, change `"@types/react": "^18.0.27"` to `"@types/react": "18.0.27"`.
    3.  Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to update your lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to reflect the pinned versions from DefinitelyTyped.
    4.  Establish a process for *manually* updating `@types` packages:
        *   Review the changelog of the `@types` package *on the DefinitelyTyped repository*.
        *   Test thoroughly after updating.
        *   Update the pinned version in `package.json` and the lock file.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Introduction of breaking changes from `@types` updates published to DefinitelyTyped.
        *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Threat:** Introduction of malicious code through a compromised `@types` package published to DefinitelyTyped.
        *   **Severity:** Critical
    *   **Threat:** Incompatibility between `@types` from DefinitelyTyped and the library version.
        *   **Severity:** Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Breaking Changes:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low).
    *   **Malicious Code:** Risk reduced significantly (Critical to Low).
    *   **Incompatibility:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal, documented process for manual `@types` updates, including reviewing the DefinitelyTyped changelog.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Auditing of `@types` Dependencies (DefinitelyTyped Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_auditing_of__@types__dependencies__definitelytyped_focus_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Schedule regular audits (e.g., monthly).
    2.  During the audit:
        *   Run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` (these often include data from DefinitelyTyped).
        *   For each `@types` package, compare its version to the library version.
        *   **Crucially:** Check the *DefinitelyTyped GitHub repository* for the specific `@types` package:
            *   Review recent commits for security-related changes.
            *   Check for open issues or pull requests related to security or compatibility *on the DefinitelyTyped repository*.
    3.  Document findings and actions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Use of `@types` packages from DefinitelyTyped with known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Severity:** Variable (Low to Critical)
    *   **Threat:** Incompatibility between `@types` from DefinitelyTyped and the library version.
        *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Threat:** Unawareness of potential issues discussed within the DefinitelyTyped community.
        *   **Severity:** Low

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly (Variable to Low).
    *   **Incompatibility:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
    *   **Awareness:** Risk reduced (Low to Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal audit schedule and checklist, including *consistent review of the DefinitelyTyped repository*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Type Definition Verification (Manual Review - DefinitelyTyped Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/type_definition_verification__manual_review_-_definitelytyped_focus_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Areas:** Determine which parts of your codebase rely most heavily on `@types` definitions from DefinitelyTyped.
    2.  **Manual Review (Targeted):** For these critical areas:
        *   Locate the relevant `@types` files (usually in `node_modules/@types`, sourced from DefinitelyTyped).
        *   Compare the type definitions against the *official documentation of the library* (not just the DefinitelyTyped definitions themselves).
        *   Look for discrepancies, omissions, or potential ambiguities *between the DefinitelyTyped definitions and the official documentation*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Inaccurate or incomplete type definitions from DefinitelyTyped.
        *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Threat:** Subtle type errors in DefinitelyTyped definitions that the compiler doesn't catch.
        *   **Severity:** Medium
    *   **Threat:** Misunderstanding of the API due to reliance on potentially incorrect DefinitelyTyped definitions.
        *   **Severity:** Low to Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Inaccurate Definitions:** Risk reduced significantly (Medium to Low) in reviewed areas.
    *   **Subtle Errors:** Risk reduced moderately (Medium to Low).
    *   **Misunderstanding:** Risk reduced (Low/Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Systematic process for identifying critical areas and performing targeted manual review *against official library documentation*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Forking and Maintaining (from DefinitelyTyped)](./mitigation_strategies/forking_and_maintaining__from_definitelytyped_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Need:** Determine if the existing `@types` package *on DefinitelyTyped* is severely outdated, incorrect, or missing.
    2.  **Fork (or Create):**
        *   If a DefinitelyTyped package exists, *fork it from the DefinitelyTyped repository on GitHub*.
        *   If no package exists, create a new repository (but consider contributing to DefinitelyTyped later).
    3.  **Maintain:**
        *   Make corrections/additions to the type definitions.
        *   Keep the forked definitions up-to-date.
    4.  **Contribute (Strongly Recommended):**
        *   Submit a pull request *to DefinitelyTyped* to contribute your changes back.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Severely outdated, incorrect, or missing type definitions *from DefinitelyTyped*.
        *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Threat:** Complete reliance on an unmaintained `@types` package *on DefinitelyTyped*.
        *   **Severity:** High

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Outdated/Incorrect Definitions:** Risk eliminated (High to None) for the forked package.
    *   **Reliance on Unmaintained Package:** Risk eliminated (High to None).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Process for evaluating when forking is necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitoring DefinitelyTyped Activity](./mitigation_strategies/monitoring_definitelytyped_activity.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Watch Repository:** On GitHub, "Watch" the *DefinitelyTyped repository* (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped). Configure notifications for:
        *   New issues
        *   New pull requests
        *   New commits
    2.  **Follow Discussions:** Follow relevant issues/pull requests *on the DefinitelyTyped repository* for packages you use heavily.
    3.  **Regularly Check:** Periodically visit the *DefinitelyTyped repository* and browse recent activity.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Unawareness of potential issues or vulnerabilities in `@types` packages *on DefinitelyTyped*.
        *   **Severity:** Low to Medium
    *   **Threat:** Being caught off-guard by breaking changes or deprecations *announced on DefinitelyTyped*.
        *   **Severity:** Low to Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unawareness:** Risk reduced (Low/Medium to Low).
    *   **Breaking Changes:** Risk reduced (Low/Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal requirement for team members to watch the DefinitelyTyped repository and disseminate information.
