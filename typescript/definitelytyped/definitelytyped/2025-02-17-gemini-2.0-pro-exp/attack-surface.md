# Attack Surface Analysis for definitelytyped/definitelytyped

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Type Definitions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_type_definitions.md)

*   **Attack Surface Area:** Malicious Type Definitions

    *   **Description:** Intentionally crafted type definitions containing malicious code or misrepresentations of the underlying JavaScript library's API.
    *   **How DefinitelyTyped Contributes:**  DefinitelyTyped relies on community contributions, creating an entry point for malicious actors to submit or modify type definitions.  The review process, while present, is not foolproof.
    *   **Example:** A type definition for a popular logging library (`@types/my-logger`) is modified to include a `postinstall` script in its `package.json`. This script, triggered during `npm install`, downloads and executes a malicious payload.  The type definition itself might appear harmless, but the associated metadata introduces the vulnerability.  Another example: a type definition for a function that takes a string as input is altered to accept `any`, bypassing type checking and potentially allowing injection attacks if the underlying JavaScript function doesn't properly sanitize its input.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code execution during the build process.
        *   Supply chain compromise affecting all users of the compromised type definition.
        *   Introduction of runtime vulnerabilities due to type mismatches.
        *   Data exfiltration during build.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Version Pinning:**  Use exact version numbers for `@types/*` packages (e.g., `@types/react@18.2.15`) in `package.json` to prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions.
        *   **Regular Manual Updates:**  Periodically review and *manually* update pinned versions after careful examination of the changelog and commit history.
        *   **Reputable Packages:**  Prioritize type definitions for well-known, actively maintained libraries with a strong community presence.
        *   **Selective Imports:** Import only the specific types needed, rather than the entire package, to reduce the attack surface (e.g., `import { useState } from 'react';` instead of `import * as React from 'react';`).
        *   **Security Advisory Monitoring:**  Actively monitor security advisories and community discussions related to DefinitelyTyped and the specific `@types/*` packages used.
        *   **Code Auditing (High-Security Contexts):** For critical applications, consider manual audits of the type definitions, focusing on areas interacting with external resources or the build process.
        * **Use Typescript strict mode**: Enable Typescript strict mode.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Type Definitions](./attack_surfaces/outdated_type_definitions.md)

*   **Attack Surface Area:** Outdated Type Definitions

    *   **Description:** Type definitions that do not accurately reflect the current API of the underlying JavaScript library due to lagging updates.
    *   **How DefinitelyTyped Contributes:**  Maintenance of type definitions relies on community effort, which can lag behind the development of the actual JavaScript libraries.
    *   **Example:** A library updates its API to include a new security check in a function, but the corresponding `@types/*` package is not updated. Developers, relying on the outdated type definition, might unknowingly bypass the new security check. Another example: a function's return type changes from `string` to `string | null`, but the type definition still claims it always returns `string`. This can lead to runtime errors if the developer doesn't handle the potential `null` value.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Runtime errors due to API mismatches.
        *   Indirect security vulnerabilities by masking new security features in the underlying library.
        *   Type confusion leading to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Cautious Updates:** Regularly update `@types/*` packages, but *always* review the changelog and test thoroughly after updating.
        *   **Official Documentation:**  Always cross-reference type definitions with the official documentation of the JavaScript library. Prioritize the official documentation in case of discrepancies.
        *   **Community Contributions:**  Contribute back to DefinitelyTyped to update outdated definitions if you encounter them.
        *   **Strategic `any` Usage (Last Resort):**  Use the `any` type sparingly and with clear comments to bypass type checking for specific, problematic areas, but understand this disables type safety.
        * **Check the library documentation**: Always check the original library documentation.
