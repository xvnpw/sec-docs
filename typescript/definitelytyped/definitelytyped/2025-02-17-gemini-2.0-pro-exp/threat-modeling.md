# Threat Model Analysis for definitelytyped/definitelytyped

## Threat: [Threat 1: Injection of Malicious Type Definitions](./threats/threat_1_injection_of_malicious_type_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits a pull request to DefinitelyTyped containing a type definition that deliberately misrepresents the behavior of a library function. The attacker might alter type signatures to allow wider input ranges than the underlying function actually handles, or incorrectly describe security properties (e.g., claiming strong cryptography when it's weak).  The goal is to trick developers into using the library insecurely.
    *   **Impact:** Developers, relying on the *incorrect* type definition, unknowingly introduce vulnerabilities into their application. This can lead to various security issues, including buffer overflows, injection attacks, or exposure of sensitive data, compromising application integrity and confidentiality.
    *   **Affected DefinitelyTyped Component:** Specific type definition files (`.d.ts` files) for individual packages within the `@types` namespace. This could affect any module, function, class, or interface defined within the malicious type definition.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the *source code* of the type definitions, especially for security-critical libraries, before using them. Look for discrepancies between the type definition and the library's documentation.
        *   **Prefer Official Types:** If the library author provides official TypeScript definitions (either bundled with the library or as a separate package), use those *instead* of DefinitelyTyped.
        *   **Community Vetting (Limited):** While DefinitelyTyped has a review process, it's not foolproof. Favor type definitions for widely used and well-maintained libraries.
        *   **Security Testing:** Conduct thorough security testing (penetration testing, fuzzing) of your application to identify vulnerabilities masked by incorrect type definitions.
        *   **Static Analysis (Limited Help):** Static analysis tools might offer some help, but are unlikely to catch subtle malicious modifications.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Compromised Maintainer Account](./threats/threat_2_compromised_maintainer_account.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the GitHub account of a DefinitelyTyped maintainer or a package author with commit access. The attacker uses this access to inject malicious code directly into type definitions, bypassing the usual pull request review process.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to Threat 1, but potentially much wider in scope.  This can lead to the widespread distribution of malicious type definitions, affecting a large number of applications. The attacker could modify many packages.
    *   **Affected DefinitelyTyped Component:** Potentially *any* type definition file (`.d.ts` file) within the repository, depending on the compromised account's permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Primarily for DefinitelyTyped Maintainers):** Strong account security (strong, unique passwords; two-factor authentication) is *essential* for maintainers.
        *   **(For Developers):** This is difficult to mitigate directly. Reliance on the DefinitelyTyped community's vigilance and response to compromised accounts is necessary. Monitor security advisories related to DefinitelyTyped.
        *   **Prefer Official Types:** Using official type definitions from library authors reduces reliance on DefinitelyTyped's infrastructure and maintainer accounts.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Outdated Type Definitions Leading to Use of Vulnerable APIs](./threats/threat_3_outdated_type_definitions_leading_to_use_of_vulnerable_apis.md)

*   **Description:** A library releases a security update that changes its API (e.g., deprecates a vulnerable function or modifies its parameters). The corresponding DefinitelyTyped definition is *not* updated promptly. Developers, unaware of the API change and security implications, continue using the vulnerable API because the type definitions don't reflect the update.
    *   **Impact:** The application remains vulnerable to the security issue addressed by the library update, even though the underlying library itself has been patched. This can lead to various security exploits. The outdated types *mask* the fact that the developer is using a vulnerable API.
    *   **Affected DefinitelyTyped Component:** Specific type definition files (`.d.ts` files) that are out of sync with the corresponding library version. This could affect any module, function, class, or interface that has changed in the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update your type definitions (using `npm update @types/...` or your package manager's equivalent) to the latest versions.
        *   **Monitor Changelogs:** Pay close attention to the changelogs of *both* the libraries you use *and* their corresponding DefinitelyTyped packages. Look for security-related updates and API changes.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system (npm, yarn) to track and manage versions of your type definitions.
        *   **Automated Dependency Checks:** Use tools that can automatically check for outdated dependencies and known vulnerabilities, although these tools may not always catch discrepancies between types and implementation.
