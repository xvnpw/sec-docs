# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nuxt/nuxt.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Server-Side Sanitization of User Data (within `asyncData` and `fetch`)](./mitigation_strategies/server-side_sanitization_of_user_data__within__asyncdata__and__fetch__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input Points:** Locate all instances where user-supplied data is used within Nuxt.js's `asyncData` and `fetch` methods, or any other server-side rendering context. This includes data from URL parameters, query strings, request bodies, and cookies.
2.  **Choose a Sanitization Library:** Install a robust *server-side* HTML sanitization library like `dompurify`.  (`npm install dompurify` or `yarn add dompurify`).
3.  **Import and Configure:** Import the library into the relevant components or modules. Configure it with a whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attributes. A stricter whitelist is generally better.
4.  **Sanitize Before Rendering:** *Before* the user data is used in any HTML template or passed to a component that renders HTML within the Nuxt.js SSR context, pass it through the sanitization function. Example:
    ```javascript
    import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

    export default {
      async asyncData({ params }) {
        const unsanitizedInput = params.userInput; // Example: from URL
        const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(unsanitizedInput, {
          ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong', 'a'], // Example
          ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href'],
        });
        return { myData: sanitizedInput };
      }
    }
    ```
5.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test with various inputs, including malicious payloads, to ensure effective sanitization.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Server-Side Rendered):** Severity: **High**. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that executes when the page is initially loaded from the server (specific to Nuxt's SSR).
    *   **HTML Injection (Server-Side):** Severity: **Medium**. Attackers can inject unwanted HTML, disrupting layout or functionality within the server-rendered content.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: **High**. Eliminates server-side rendered XSS.
    *   **HTML Injection:** Risk reduction: **High**. Prevents arbitrary HTML injection in SSR.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `components/UserProfile.vue` (using `dompurify` for bio sanitization).
    *   Example: `pages/blog/_id.vue` (sanitizing comment content).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `pages/search.vue` (search query not sanitized server-side).
    *   Example: `serverMiddleware/userData.js` (external API data not sanitized).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Exposing Sensitive Data in Initial HTML (via `asyncData`/`fetch`/`nuxtState`)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_exposing_sensitive_data_in_initial_html__via__asyncdata__fetch__nuxtstate__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** API keys, secrets, personal user information (beyond essential display data), internal configuration.
2.  **Refactor Data Fetching:** Modify components using `asyncData` or `fetch` to include sensitive data in the initial HTML payload. Fetch this data *client-side* after the initial page load.
3.  **Secure API Calls:** Client-side fetching must use secure API calls (HTTPS, authentication, authorization). Use environment variables for API keys.
4.  **Avoid `nuxtState` Misuse:** Do *not* store sensitive data in `nuxtState` unless absolutely necessary for client-side hydration. `nuxtState` is serialized into the initial HTML.
5.  **Test:** Verify sensitive data is *not* in "View Source" or network responses for the initial load.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Sensitive Data in SSR):** Severity: **High**. Attackers access keys, secrets, or user data by inspecting the initial HTML or network traffic (a Nuxt.js SSR-specific concern).
    *   **Credential Theft (via Initial HTML):** Severity: **High**. Credentials in the initial HTML are easily stolen.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: **High**. Prevents sensitive data exposure in the initial HTML.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Risk reduction: **High**. Eliminates credential exposure in the initial HTML.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `components/Dashboard.vue` (fetches data via authenticated API after mount).
    *   Example: `.env` file for API keys, accessed via `process.env`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `pages/admin.vue` (includes config data in `asyncData`).
    *   Example: Some user profile data unnecessarily in `nuxtState`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent Prototype Pollution in Nuxt.js SSR Context](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_prototype_pollution_in_nuxt_js_ssr_context.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Object Merging:** Locate where user-provided data is merged with server-side objects, especially in `asyncData`, `fetch`, or server middleware *within the Nuxt.js environment*.
2.  **Use Safe Merging Techniques:**
    *   **Shallow Copy:** For simple objects, `Object.assign({}, ...)` to create a *new* object. Validate keys *before* merging.
    *   **Deep Copy with Validation:** For nested objects, use `lodash.merge` *with careful configuration* or a custom deep copy with strict key validation.
    *   **Immutability:** Consider immutable data structures (e.g., `immutable-js`).
3.  **Update Dependencies:** Regularly update Nuxt.js, Vue.js, and object manipulation libraries to get security patches.
4.  **Test:** Create test cases to attempt prototype pollution exploits.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution (Server-Side in Nuxt.js):** Severity: **High**. Attackers modify JavaScript object behavior, potentially causing DoS, data corruption, or RCE on the *server* (specific to Nuxt's SSR).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution:** Risk reduction: **High**. Safe merging and updates mitigate this significantly.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `serverMiddleware/apiHandler.js` (uses `Object.assign` with key validation).
    *   Example: Regular dependency updates via `yarn upgrade`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `pages/userSettings.vue` (custom deep merge function, not audited).
    *   Example: No specific prototype pollution test suite.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Throttling for SSR API Calls (within `asyncData`/`fetch`)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_throttling_for_ssr_api_calls__within__asyncdata__fetch__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify API Calls:** Find all API calls within Nuxt.js's `asyncData`, `fetch`, or server middleware.
2.  **Choose a Rate Limiting Strategy:**
    *   **Server-Side Rate Limiting (Best):** Implement on your API server.
    *   **Nuxt Middleware Rate Limiting:** Use a Nuxt middleware to track and limit calls (e.g., by IP or session). Libraries like `rate-limiter-flexible` can help.
    *   **Client-Side Throttling (Less Effective):**  Use `lodash.throttle` (less effective, bypassable).
3.  **Configure Rate Limits:** Set limits based on expected usage and API server capacity.
4.  **Handle Rate Limit Exceeded:** Return clear errors (e.g., HTTP 429).
5.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Monitor API usage and adjust limits.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Targeting Nuxt.js SSR):** Severity: **Medium-High**. Attackers overwhelm the server with requests to `asyncData` or `fetch`, impacting availability (specific to how Nuxt.js handles SSR).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Server-Side):** Severity: **Medium**. Excessive API calls consume server resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduction: **Medium-High**. Rate limiting reduces DoS success against Nuxt.js SSR.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduction: **Medium**. Helps prevent excessive resource use.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Backend API server rate limiting.
    *   Example: `serverMiddleware/rateLimit.js` (basic IP-based limits).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Consistent client-side throttling missing.
    *   Example: Granular rate limiting (per user) not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Redirects in Nuxt.js Middleware](./mitigation_strategies/secure_redirects_in_nuxt_js_middleware.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Redirects:** Find where Nuxt.js middleware redirects users (`context.redirect`).
2.  **Validate Redirect URLs:**
    *   **Whitelist (Recommended):** Maintain a list of allowed URLs. Check the target URL against it.
    *   **Strict Pattern Matching:** If a whitelist isn't feasible, use strict pattern matching. Avoid overly permissive regex.
    *   **Avoid Direct User Input:** Never use user input directly as the URL without validation.
3.  **Test:** Try redirecting to malicious URLs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirect (via Nuxt.js Middleware):** Severity: **Medium**. Attackers manipulate URLs to send users to malicious sites (specific to how redirects are handled in Nuxt middleware).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirect:** Risk reduction: **High**. URL validation eliminates this.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `middleware/auth.js` (whitelist of allowed URLs after login).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `middleware/locale.js` (redirects based on language, validation not strict).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `nuxt.config.js` Configuration for `generate`](./mitigation_strategies/secure__nuxt_config_js__configuration_for__generate_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine any sensitive information (API keys, secrets) that might be used during the static site generation process (`nuxt generate`).
2.  **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data in environment variables (e.g., `.env` file).  Access these variables during the build process using `process.env`.  *Do not* hardcode secrets in components or the `nuxt.config.js` file itself.
3.  **Configure `generate` Property:** Ensure the `generate` property in `nuxt.config.js` is correctly configured to avoid including unnecessary files or routes that might expose sensitive information.  Use the `exclude` option if needed.
4. **Inspect Generated Files:** After running `nuxt generate`, carefully inspect the generated static files (usually in the `dist` directory) to confirm that no sensitive data has been inadvertently included.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Static Site Generation):** Severity: **High**.  Sensitive data included in statically generated files is publicly accessible (a specific concern with `nuxt generate`).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: **High**.  Proper configuration and environment variable usage prevent sensitive data from being included in the generated output.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: API keys are stored in `.env` and accessed via `process.env` during the build.
    *   Example: The `generate.exclude` property is used to prevent certain routes from being generated.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: A thorough review of the generated `dist` directory is not consistently performed after each build.
    *   Example: Some configuration values that could be considered sensitive are still hardcoded in `nuxt.config.js`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Plugin Usage](./mitigation_strategies/secure_plugin_usage.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Vet Third-Party Plugins:** Before integrating *any* Nuxt.js plugin, thoroughly research its reputation, security history, and maintenance status. Prefer plugins from trusted sources and with active communities.
2.  **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all Nuxt.js plugins up-to-date. Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly. Use `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` to identify outdated packages.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant plugins the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid plugins requiring excessive access. Review the plugin's documentation to understand its required permissions.
4. **Review Plugin Code (If Possible):** If the plugin is open-source, review its code for potential security issues, especially if it handles user input or interacts with external services.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins:** Severity: **Variable (Low to High)**. Plugins can introduce vulnerabilities if poorly written or malicious. This is a direct concern related to Nuxt.js's plugin ecosystem.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Severity: **Medium-High**. A compromised plugin repository could distribute malicious code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Plugins:** Risk reduction: **Medium**. Careful selection and updates reduce the risk.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk reduction: **Low-Medium**.  Vetting and updates provide some protection, but supply chain attacks are difficult to fully prevent.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Only plugins from the official Nuxt.js community or well-known developers are used.
    *   Example: Regular dependency updates are performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: A formal process for vetting new plugins is not in place.
    *   Example: Code review of plugins is not routinely performed.
