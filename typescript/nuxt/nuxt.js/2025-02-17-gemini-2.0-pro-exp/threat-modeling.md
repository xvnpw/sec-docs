# Threat Model Analysis for nuxt/nuxt.js

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Data Fetching](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_data_fetching.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., a URL parameter) that is passed to Nuxt's server-side data fetching functions (`asyncData`, `fetch`, or server-side API calls within plugins/middleware). The attacker uses this to make the server send requests to internal network resources (databases, internal APIs) or external services that it shouldn't access, potentially exfiltrating data or causing other harm. This is a *direct* Nuxt threat because these functions are core to Nuxt's SSR capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive internal data.
        *   Access to internal services and infrastructure.
        *   Potential for further attacks on internal systems.
        *   Circumvention of firewall rules.
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** `asyncData` method, `fetch` method (when used server-side), server-side `axios` (or similar) calls within plugins or middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *all* user-supplied input used in server-side data fetching. Use regular expressions or dedicated validation libraries.
        *   **Allow-listing:** Define an explicit allow-list of permitted URLs or domains for server-side requests. Reject any request that doesn't match the allow-list. *Never* use a block-list.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Nuxt.js server from sensitive internal resources using network segmentation (e.g., firewalls, VPCs).
        *   **Dedicated HTTP Client:** Use a dedicated HTTP client library (like `axios`) configured to prevent SSRF (e.g., by disallowing redirects to internal IP addresses).
        *   **Avoid Direct Input:** Do not directly pass user input into URLs. Construct URLs programmatically based on validated parameters.

## Threat: [SSR-Specific Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/ssr-specific_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data that is rendered during Server-Side Rendering (SSR). This is distinct from general XSS because the vulnerability arises *directly* from how Nuxt handles SSR and injects data into the initial HTML. If user-supplied data (even indirectly) influences the SSR output without proper escaping, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
        *   Theft of user cookies and session tokens.
        *   Defacement of the website.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** `asyncData`, `fetch` (data returned from these), any server-side data used in Vue templates, `v-html` directive (if used with unsanitized data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Context-Aware Escaping:** Use appropriate escaping functions for *all* data rendered during SSR. Vue's templating engine provides automatic escaping in most cases, but be cautious with `v-html`. Use `encodeURIComponent` for URL components, HTML entity encoding for HTML content.
        *   **Sanitization Libraries:** Use a dedicated HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove any potentially malicious HTML tags or attributes from user-supplied data *before* rendering it.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating the impact of XSS.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/plugin_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a third-party Nuxt plugin (or a custom plugin) to gain unauthorized access, execute code, or tamper with data. This could be due to outdated dependencies, insecure coding practices, or known vulnerabilities in the plugin. This is a *direct* Nuxt threat because plugins are integral to extending Nuxt's functionality.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies widely depending on the plugin's functionality. Could range from significant data leaks to complete server compromise.
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** Any installed Nuxt plugin (official or third-party).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Vetting:** Carefully review the code and security posture of any plugin before installing it. Check for known vulnerabilities and ensure it's actively maintained.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:** If possible, run plugins with the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Explore techniques to isolate plugins within a sandbox to limit their potential impact.

## Threat: [Middleware Redirection Tampering](./threats/middleware_redirection_tampering.md)

* **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-supplied input that is used by custom Nuxt *middleware* to determine a redirect target, causing users to be redirected to a malicious site (open redirect). This is a *direct* Nuxt threat as it leverages the Nuxt middleware system.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Users redirected to phishing sites or sites serving malware.
        *   Loss of user trust.
    * **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** Custom Nuxt middleware that handles redirects.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid User Input in Redirects:** Do not use user-supplied input directly in redirect URLs within middleware.
        *   **Allow-listing:** Use a predefined list of allowed redirect targets.
        *   **Indirect Redirection:** If dynamic redirects are necessary, use an intermediary lookup (e.g., a database table) to map user input to safe redirect targets, rather than directly using the input in the URL.
