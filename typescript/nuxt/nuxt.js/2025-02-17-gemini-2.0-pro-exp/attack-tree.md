## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured SSR Context -> Expose Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_ssr_context_-_expose_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path involves the attacker exploiting a misconfiguration in how the Nuxt.js application handles the server-side rendering (SSR) context. Developers might inadvertently expose sensitive data, such as API keys, database credentials, or internal server information, within the data passed to the client during SSR.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Reconnaissance:** The attacker inspects the rendered HTML source code, network requests (especially those fetching data for SSR), and JavaScript files for any clues of exposed data.
    *   **Exploitation:** If sensitive data is found, the attacker directly uses it for malicious purposes. For example, an exposed API key could be used to access protected resources or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Sub-attack: Read Server Files:** If a path traversal vulnerability exists within the SSR context handling, the attacker could craft requests to read arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Sub-attack: Access Environment Variables:** If environment variables are improperly exposed in the SSR context, the attacker can gain access to sensitive credentials or configuration settings.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common developer error)
*   **Impact:** High (Data breach, system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (Often requires only basic web inspection)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic web development knowledge)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring and code review)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nuxt-Specific Client-Side Features -> XSS via `v-html` in Nuxt Features (e.g., `$fetch`, `asyncData`)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nuxt-specific_client-side_features_-_xss_via__v-html__in_nuxt_features__e_g____$fetch____asy_78cc6f4b.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path focuses on exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that arise from the misuse of the `v-html` directive in Nuxt.js features like `$fetch` or `asyncData`.  `v-html` renders raw HTML, and if untrusted user input is passed to it without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Input:** The attacker identifies input fields or parameters that are used to populate data rendered with `v-html`.
    *   **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload designed to steal cookies, redirect the user, deface the page, or perform other harmful actions.
    *   **Inject Payload:** The attacker injects the payload into the vulnerable input field.
    *   **Exploitation:** When a user visits the affected page, the injected JavaScript executes in their browser, allowing the attacker to carry out their intended actions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misuse of `v-html`)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Session hijacking, defacement, data theft)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on the complexity of the input validation)
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Basic XSS knowledge)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires code review and dynamic analysis)

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Nuxt Core or its Dependencies -> Vulnerable Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_nuxt_core_or_its_dependencies_-_vulnerable_dependency.md)

*    **Description:** This path involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a dependency of Nuxt.js itself, or a transitive dependency (a dependency of a dependency).
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Dependency:** The attacker uses vulnerability scanners or monitors vulnerability databases (like CVE) to identify known vulnerabilities in the specific versions of Nuxt.js or its dependencies used by the application.
    *   **Obtain Exploit:** The attacker searches for publicly available exploits or develops their own exploit code based on the vulnerability details.
    *   **Exploitation:** The attacker uses the exploit to compromise the application. The specific actions depend on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., RCE, data exfiltration, denial of service).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependencies are a common attack vector)
*   **Impact:** Variable (Low to High, depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Variable (Low to High, depends on exploit availability)
*   **Skill Level:** Variable (Low to High, depends on exploit complexity)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires vulnerability scanning)

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Nuxt Core or its Dependencies -> Outdated Nuxt Version](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_nuxt_core_or_its_dependencies_-_outdated_nuxt_version.md)

*   **Description:** This is a specific, high-risk instance of the previous path.  Running an outdated version of Nuxt.js significantly increases the likelihood of having exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Identify Outdated Version:** The attacker determines the Nuxt.js version used by the application (often visible in HTTP headers, JavaScript files, or through fingerprinting techniques).
    *   **Find Known Vulnerabilities:** The attacker searches vulnerability databases for known vulnerabilities affecting that specific version.
    *   **Exploitation:** The attacker uses publicly available exploits or develops their own to compromise the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Many projects don't update promptly)
*   **Impact:** Variable (Low to High, depends on the vulnerabilities in the outdated version)
*   **Effort:** Low (Exploiting known vulnerabilities is often easier)
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Public exploits may be readily available)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Version numbers are often easily accessible)

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Nuxt Modules/Plugins -> Vulnerable Dependency in Module/Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_nuxt_modulesplugins_-_vulnerable_dependency_in_moduleplugin.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting a known vulnerability in a dependency of third-party Nuxt module or plugin.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Dependency:** The attacker uses vulnerability scanners or monitors vulnerability databases (like CVE) to identify known vulnerabilities in the specific versions of Nuxt modules/plugins or its dependencies used by the application.
    *   **Obtain Exploit:** The attacker searches for publicly available exploits or develops their own exploit code based on the vulnerability details.
    *   **Exploitation:** The attacker uses the exploit to compromise the application. The specific actions depend on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., RCE, data exfiltration, denial of service).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependencies are a common attack vector)
*   **Impact:** Variable (Low to High, depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Variable (Low to High, depends on exploit availability)
*   **Skill Level:** Variable (Low to High, depends on exploit complexity)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires vulnerability scanning)
