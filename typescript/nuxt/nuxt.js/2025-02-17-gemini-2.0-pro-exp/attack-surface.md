# Attack Surface Analysis for nuxt/nuxt.js

## Attack Surface: [Data Exposure via `asyncData` / `fetch` Errors](./attack_surfaces/data_exposure_via__asyncdata____fetch__errors.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data leakage through improper error handling in Nuxt's server-side data fetching methods.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** `asyncData` and `fetch` are core Nuxt.js SSR features, making their secure implementation paramount. This is a *direct* consequence of Nuxt's SSR design.
*   **Example:** An API call within `asyncData` fails, and the raw error response (containing a database connection string) is rendered directly into the HTML source.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of API keys, database credentials, internal data structures, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust try-catch blocks within `asyncData` and `fetch`.
    *   Log errors server-side; *never* expose raw error messages to the client.
    *   Return generic, user-friendly error messages (e.g., "An error occurred.  Please try again later.").
    *   Sanitize all data returned from APIs *before* passing it to the template. Avoid passing entire response objects.
    *   Consider using a dedicated error-handling middleware in Nuxt.

## Attack Surface: [SSR Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/ssr_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Overloading the server by repeatedly requesting pages that trigger resource-intensive Nuxt.js SSR operations.
    *   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js's SSR capability is the *direct* target of this attack.  Without SSR, this attack vector is significantly less impactful.
    *   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly requests a Nuxt page with a complex `asyncData` call that performs numerous database queries or external API calls.
    *   **Impact:** Server becomes unresponsive, denying service to legitimate users.  This can be more severe than a traditional DoS due to the server-side processing involved.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling, specifically targeting routes that utilize Nuxt's SSR.
        *   Optimize `asyncData` and `fetch` calls for performance. Use caching where appropriate (e.g., leveraging Nuxt's `serverCacheKey` in `asyncData`).
        *   Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Use a CDN to cache rendered HTML pages, reducing the load on the origin server.
        *   Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based XSS via `v-html` Hydration Mismatch](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_xss_via__v-html__hydration_mismatch.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting a hydration mismatch between server-rendered HTML (using Nuxt's SSR) and client-side Vue.js rendering, leading to DOM-based XSS, specifically when using `v-html`.
    *   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** This vulnerability is a *direct* result of the interaction between Nuxt.js's SSR, Vue.js's hydration mechanism, and the use of `v-html`.  The mismatch is the key.
    *   **Example:** The server renders `<div v-html="userComment"></div>` with initially sanitized content.  On the client, `userComment` is updated (perhaps via a WebSocket or user input) with malicious JavaScript.  During hydration, Vue.js re-renders the component, executing the attacker-controlled script.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or website defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strongly avoid** using `v-html` whenever possible. Use template interpolation (`{{ }}`) or `v-text` for displaying dynamic content.
        *   If `v-html` is *absolutely* necessary, thoroughly sanitize the input using a robust HTML sanitizer library (e.g., DOMPurify) *both* on the server-side (before Nuxt renders the HTML) *and* on the client-side (before hydration, if the data source is dynamic). This double sanitization is crucial.
        *   Ensure that the data used in `v-html` is absolutely consistent between the server and the client to prevent any hydration mismatches.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Exposure (via `publicRuntimeConfig`)](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_exposure__via__publicruntimeconfig__.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive environment variables (intended for server-side use only) being exposed to the client due to misconfiguration in Nuxt.
    *   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js's `publicRuntimeConfig` and `privateRuntimeConfig` mechanism is *directly* involved.  Incorrect usage is the root cause.
    *   **Example:** Accidentally placing a secret API key in Nuxt's `publicRuntimeConfig` instead of `privateRuntimeConfig`, making the key accessible in the browser's JavaScript context.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to APIs, databases, or other services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully and deliberately distinguish between `publicRuntimeConfig` (for client-accessible values) and `privateRuntimeConfig` (for server-only secrets) in your `nuxt.config.js`.
        *   Never place any secrets, API keys, or sensitive data in `publicRuntimeConfig`.
        *   Use a `.env` file for local development and proper environment variable management in your production environment (e.g., using your hosting provider's interface or a dedicated secrets management tool).
        *   Thoroughly review your `nuxt.config.js` to ensure no sensitive information is unintentionally exposed.
