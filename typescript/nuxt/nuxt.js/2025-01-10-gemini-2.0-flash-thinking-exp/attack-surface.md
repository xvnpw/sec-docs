# Attack Surface Analysis for nuxt/nuxt.js

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (SSR XSS)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_cross-site_scripting__ssr_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into server-rendered HTML, which are then executed in the user's browser.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt's server-side rendering makes it crucial to sanitize data before rendering it into HTML on the server. If server-side components or plugins directly output user-provided data without escaping, it creates an SSR XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of user accounts, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, and other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Output Escaping:**  Always escape user-provided data when rendering it server-side. Utilize templating engines with automatic escaping or explicitly escape data.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review server-side components and plugins for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [API Route Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_route_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, command injection) through API endpoints defined in the `server/api` directory.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt simplifies the creation of backend API endpoints. If these endpoints interact with databases or system commands without proper input sanitization and parameterized queries, they become vulnerable to injection attacks.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, potential server compromise through command injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs received by API routes.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure database users have only necessary permissions.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Execution:** Minimize or eliminate the use of functions that execute system commands based on user input.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Modules and Plugins](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_modules_and_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist in third-party npm packages (modules and plugins) used by the Nuxt.js application.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt applications rely heavily on the npm ecosystem for modules and plugins. Introducing vulnerable dependencies can directly expose the application to known security flaws.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Audits:** Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions.
    *   **Use a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Maintain an SBOM to track components.
    *   **Consider Alternative Libraries:** If a dependency is problematic, consider switching to a more secure alternative.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent Nuxt.js middleware that is intended to enforce security policies (e.g., authentication, authorization).
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt's middleware system allows developers to intercept requests. Incorrectly implemented or configured middleware can lead to bypasses, granting unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive routes or resources, potentially leading to data breaches or administrative control.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Middleware Testing:**  Rigorous testing of middleware logic to ensure it functions as intended.
    *   **Clear Route Matching Logic:**  Carefully define route matching patterns in middleware.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Have security experts review middleware implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets are exposed through configuration files or environment variables.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:**  Nuxt uses environment variables and configuration files (`nuxt.config.js`) to manage settings. If these are not handled securely, sensitive information can be leaked.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of associated services, data breaches, financial loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information in environment variables and access them using `process.env`.
    *   **Never Commit Secrets:** Avoid committing sensitive information directly to the codebase. Use `.gitignore`.
    *   **Secret Management Tools:** Utilize dedicated secret management tools or services.
    *   **Restrict Access to Configuration Files:** Limit access to configuration files in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Development Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/development_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** The Nuxt.js application is running in development mode in a production environment.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Development mode enables features like verbose error messages and potentially less strict security settings, not intended for production.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, easier exploitation of vulnerabilities due to detailed error messages.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Set `NODE_ENV=production`:** Ensure the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production` in production environments.
    *   **Disable Development-Specific Features:** Review the `nuxt.config.js` file and ensure development-specific features are disabled or configured appropriately for production.
