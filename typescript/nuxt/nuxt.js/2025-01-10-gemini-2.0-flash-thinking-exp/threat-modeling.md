# Threat Model Analysis for nuxt/nuxt.js

## Threat: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (SSR XSS)](./threats/server-side_cross-site_scripting__ssr_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is rendered on the server-side by Nuxt.js and then sent to the client. When the client-side JavaScript hydrates the page, the malicious script executes in the user's browser. This can happen if user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being used in server-side templates or within `asyncData`/`fetch` calls that directly render HTML.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, or redirecting them to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** Server-Side Rendering process, specifically template rendering and data fetching (`asyncData`, `fetch`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and escape user-provided data before rendering it on the server-side. Utilize Vue's template engine's automatic escaping features.
        *   Exercise caution when using `v-html` or similar directives that render raw HTML. Ensure the HTML source is trusted.
        *   Review and sanitize data returned from `asyncData` and `fetch` if it's used in templates without proper escaping.

## Threat: [Exposure of Server-Side Secrets via SSR](./threats/exposure_of_server-side_secrets_via_ssr.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or internal configuration details, intended for server-side use, is inadvertently included in the initial HTML payload rendered by the Nuxt.js server. This can occur if these secrets are directly accessed or logged during the SSR process and become part of the rendered output.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive credentials, allowing them to compromise backend systems, access protected resources, or impersonate the application.
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** Server-Side Rendering process, particularly when accessing environment variables or configuration within `asyncData`, `fetch`, or server middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly accessing sensitive environment variables or configuration within components that are rendered server-side.
        *   Utilize server middleware or API routes to fetch data that requires sensitive credentials, preventing direct exposure in the initial HTML.
        *   Ensure proper logging configurations to avoid accidentally logging sensitive information during SSR.
        *   Leverage Nuxt's environment variable handling features securely.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `asyncData` or `fetch`](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__asyncdata__or__fetch_.md)

*   **Description:** If the server-side rendering process, utilizing Nuxt.js's `asyncData` or `fetch`, makes external requests based on user-controlled input without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate these requests to target internal services or arbitrary external URLs.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially access internal resources not meant to be publicly accessible, perform port scanning on internal networks, or make requests to external services, potentially leading to further attacks or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** `asyncData` and `fetch` functions executed on the server-side.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize any user input that influences the URLs used in `asyncData` or `fetch` calls.
        *   Implement allow-lists of allowed domains or IP addresses for external requests.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs.
        *   Consider using a dedicated proxy service for making external requests from the server.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass](./threats/middleware_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  A vulnerability in custom Nuxt.js middleware allows attackers to bypass intended security checks, such as authentication or authorization, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected routes or resources. This can happen due to logical errors in the middleware's implementation or insufficient handling of different request scenarios within the Nuxt.js middleware pipeline.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could access restricted parts of the application, perform actions they are not authorized to do, or potentially escalate privileges.
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:**  Middleware functions defined in the `middleware/` directory or inline middleware within route definitions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test middleware logic with various input and request types to ensure it functions as intended and covers all edge cases.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing authentication and authorization logic in Nuxt.js middleware.
        *   Ensure middleware execution order is correct and prevents bypass scenarios within the Nuxt.js request lifecycle.
        *   Regularly review and audit custom middleware for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in `nuxt.config.js`](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in__nuxt_config_js_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might mistakenly store sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, directly within the `nuxt.config.js` file, a core configuration file for Nuxt.js applications. If this file is exposed (e.g., through a misconfigured server or accidentally committed to a public repository), attackers can easily access these secrets.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could gain access to critical credentials, allowing them to compromise backend systems or access protected resources.
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** `nuxt.config.js` file.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never store sensitive information directly in `nuxt.config.js` or any other configuration files within the codebase.
        *   Utilize environment variables and securely manage them using tools like `.env` files and Nuxt's built-in environment variable handling.
        *   Ensure that `.env` files are properly excluded from version control.

## Threat: [Client-Side Rehydration Mismatch Leading to XSS](./threats/client-side_rehydration_mismatch_leading_to_xss.md)

*   **Description:** If the server-rendered HTML generated by Nuxt.js and the client-side rendered HTML diverge due to unsanitized user input or incorrect handling of dynamic content, it can create opportunities for XSS vulnerabilities during the hydration process. The client-side Vue.js might interpret the mismatched HTML in a way that executes malicious scripts.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, or redirecting them to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** Client-side hydration process, Vue.js rendering within the Nuxt.js context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure consistent data sanitization and escaping on both the server-side (within Nuxt.js rendering) and client-side.
        *   Carefully handle dynamic content and user input to prevent discrepancies between server-rendered and client-rendered output within Nuxt.js components.
        *   Review and test components that heavily rely on dynamic rendering and user-provided data, focusing on the hydration process.
