While the attack path is stated simply, achieving "Compromise Nuxt.js Application" requires a series of steps exploiting vulnerabilities at different levels. Here's a detailed breakdown of potential sub-paths and attack vectors:

**1. Exploiting Client-Side Vulnerabilities:**

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * **Stored XSS:** Injecting malicious scripts into the database that are later rendered on the client-side for other users. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in user input handling, such as comments, profile information, or CMS content.
    * **Reflected XSS:**  Tricking users into clicking malicious links containing scripts that are then executed in their browser due to improper sanitization of URL parameters or form data.
    * **DOM-Based XSS:** Manipulating the client-side DOM directly through vulnerabilities in JavaScript code, potentially through insecure handling of user-provided data within the application's logic.
    * **Impact:**  Stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, injecting keyloggers, performing actions on behalf of the user, and potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
    * **Nuxt.js Specific Considerations:** Ensure proper escaping of data rendered in templates, especially when using `v-html` or directly manipulating the DOM. Be cautious with server-side rendering (SSR) and ensure data passed from the server is properly sanitized.

* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    * Tricking authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application by embedding malicious requests in external websites or emails.
    * **Impact:**  Changing user passwords, transferring funds, modifying data, or performing other privileged actions without the user's knowledge.
    * **Nuxt.js Specific Considerations:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests. Utilize Nuxt.js middleware to verify the presence and validity of these tokens.

* **Client-Side Logic Exploitation:**
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's JavaScript code, such as insecure data handling, flawed authentication logic, or improper access control on client-side routes.

* **Injection Attacks:**
    * **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  Injecting malicious SQL queries into database interactions through vulnerable input fields or parameters.
    * **Command Injection:**  Injecting malicious operating system commands through vulnerable input fields or parameters.
    * **NoSQL Injection:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in NoSQL databases to inject malicious queries or commands.
    * **Impact:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the database, modifying or deleting data, executing arbitrary commands on the server.
    * **Nuxt.js Specific Considerations:**  Sanitize user input before using it in database queries. Utilize parameterized queries or ORM/ODM features that provide built-in protection against injection attacks. Be cautious when interacting with the file system or executing external commands.

* **Authentication and Authorization Flaws:**
    * **Broken Authentication:** Weak password policies, insecure storage of credentials, lack of multi-factor authentication, session fixation vulnerabilities.
    * **Broken Authorization:**  Insufficient access controls, privilege escalation vulnerabilities, insecure direct object references (IDOR).
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to user accounts, bypassing security restrictions, gaining administrative privileges.
    * **Nuxt.js Specific Considerations:**  Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Leverage Nuxt.js middleware to protect routes and API endpoints. Securely store session tokens (e.g., using `httpOnly` and `secure` flags).

* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    * Tricking the server into making requests to unintended internal or external resources.
    * **Impact:**  Accessing internal services, reading sensitive files, performing port scans, potentially leading to further exploitation of internal infrastructure.
    * **Nuxt.js Specific Considerations:**  Sanitize and validate user-provided URLs before making external requests. Implement allow lists for permitted domains and protocols.

* **Insecure Deserialization:**
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious serialized objects.
    * **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service.
    * **Nuxt.js Specific Considerations:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data. If necessary, use secure deserialization libraries and carefully validate the input.

* **Vulnerabilities in Server Middleware and API Routes:**
    * Custom server middleware or API routes might contain vulnerabilities due to improper input validation, insecure logic, or reliance on vulnerable libraries.
    * **Impact:**  Similar to other server-side vulnerabilities, potentially leading to data breaches, code execution, or denial of service.
    * **Nuxt.js Specific Considerations:**  Thoroughly review and test custom server middleware and API routes. Ensure they follow secure coding practices and handle user input securely.

**3. Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities:**

* **Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies:** Nuxt.js applications rely on numerous Node.js packages (dependencies). Using outdated or vulnerable versions of these packages can expose the application to known security flaws.
* **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to any of the previously mentioned attack types, including remote code execution, XSS, or data breaches.
