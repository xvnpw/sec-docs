## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Nuxt.js Application](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_nuxt_js_application.md)

The attacker's ultimate goal is to gain control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

* Attackers target the server-side rendering process to inject malicious code or manipulate server behavior.
    * This path is high-risk due to the direct impact on users and the potential for significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SSR](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_ssr.md)

* Attackers inject malicious scripts into content rendered on the server.
    * Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Script in Server-Rendered Content](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_script_in_server-rendered_content.md)

The attacker's action of inserting the malicious script into the server-rendered HTML.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via SSR](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_ssr.md)

* Attackers manipulate the SSR logic to make unauthorized outbound requests from the server.
    * This can be used to access internal resources or external services.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Manipulate SSR Logic to Make Outbound Requests](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__manipulate_ssr_logic_to_make_outbound_requests.md)

The attacker's action of manipulating the server-side code to initiate external requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exposure via SSR](./attack_tree_paths/data_exposure_via_ssr.md)

Sensitive data is inadvertently leaked during the server-side rendering process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Access Sensitive Data During Server-Side Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__access_sensitive_data_during_server-side_rendering.md)

The attacker's ability to access sensitive information while the server is rendering the page.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Nuxt.js Configuration and Features](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__abuse_nuxt_js_configuration_and_features.md)

Attackers exploit weaknesses in Nuxt.js configuration or its module/plugin system.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit `nuxt.config.js` Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit__nuxt_config_js__misconfigurations.md)

Attackers target insecurely configured `nuxt.config.js` files.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Access Sensitive Information in Configuration (e.g., API Keys)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__access_sensitive_information_in_configuration__e_g___api_keys_.md)

The attacker gains access to sensitive credentials stored in the configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Nuxt.js Modules/Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__abuse_nuxt_js_modulesplugins.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in third-party or custom Nuxt.js modules and plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Modules](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_modules.md)

Attackers leverage known security flaws in external dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Identify Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__identify_known_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

The attacker's initial step of discovering vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Introduce Malicious Custom Modules/Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__introduce_malicious_custom_modulesplugins.md)

Attackers inject malicious code by creating or modifying custom modules/plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Code into Project](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_code_into_project.md)

The attacker's action of inserting harmful code into the project's codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Nuxt.js API Routes (If Used)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_nuxt_js_api_routes__if_used_.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities in the application's API endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Bypass Authentication/Authorization in API Routes](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__bypass_authenticationauthorization_in_api_routes.md)

Attackers circumvent security measures to gain unauthorized access to API functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Payloads into API Route Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_payloads_into_api_route_handlers.md)

Attackers insert malicious data into API requests to exploit backend systems (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage Development and Build Process Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__leverage_development_and_build_process_weaknesses.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the software development lifecycle.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Development Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromise_development_dependencies.md)

Attackers target the application's dependencies to introduce malicious code or exploit vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Development Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_development_dependencies.md)

Attackers leverage known security flaws in the project's development-time dependencies.
