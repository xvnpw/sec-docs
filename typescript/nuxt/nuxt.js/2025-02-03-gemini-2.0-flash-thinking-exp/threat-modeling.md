# Threat Model Analysis for nuxt/nuxt.js

## Threat: [Server-Side Component Injection](./threats/server-side_component_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Component Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into data rendered server-side by Nuxt.js. This code executes on the server during rendering, potentially allowing attackers to steal server-side secrets, perform SSRF, or gain unauthorized server access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Full server compromise, data breach, service disruption.
*   **Nuxt.js Component Affected:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Vue.js Components rendered server-side.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize all user inputs and external data before server-side rendering.
    *   Use Vue.js's built-in escaping mechanisms for template data.
    *   Avoid `v-html` with unsanitized user-provided content on the server.
    *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Threat: [Exposure of Server-Side Secrets during SSR/SSG](./threats/exposure_of_server-side_secrets_during_ssrssg.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Server-Side Secrets
*   **Description:** Server-side environment variables or configuration values (API keys, database credentials) are unintentionally exposed during SSR or SSG. Attackers can extract these secrets from client-side bundles, server logs, or static files to access backend systems and data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Data breach, unauthorized access to backend systems, potential financial loss.
*   **Nuxt.js Component Affected:** Environment Variables, `nuxt.config.js`, Server Context, SSR/SSG process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely manage environment variables using `.env` files (not committed to version control).
    *   Access secrets only within Nuxt.js server modules and context, avoiding client-side exposure.
    *   Minimize sensitive information in client-side `nuxt.config.js`.
    *   Regularly rotate sensitive credentials.
    *   Use secret scanning tools to prevent accidental exposure.

## Threat: [Rehydration Mismatches and Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./threats/rehydration_mismatches_and_client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Rehydration Mismatches leading to Client-Side Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** Inconsistencies between server-rendered HTML and client-side Vue.js components (rehydration mismatches) can lead to unexpected behavior, potentially creating client-side XSS vulnerabilities if server-rendered content relies on assumptions not replicated on the client.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Client-side XSS, application instability, potential denial of service for users.
*   **Nuxt.js Component Affected:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Client-Side Hydration, Vue.js Components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure consistent data handling and component logic between server and client.
    *   Thoroughly test SSR/SSG implementations to identify and resolve rehydration mismatches.
    *   Carefully manage state and dynamic content during rehydration for consistency.
    *   Utilize Vue.js devtools for rehydration debugging.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Modules/Plugins](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_modulesplugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Modules/Plugins
*   **Description:** Nuxt.js applications rely on npm modules and plugins, which can contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities in outdated or unmaintained dependencies to compromise the application or server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High to Critical:** Data breach, server compromise, or application malfunction, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Nuxt.js Component Affected:** Nuxt.js Modules, Plugins, `package.json`, `node_modules`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit dependencies using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   Keep dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
    *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning with tools like Snyk or Dependabot.
    *   Establish a robust dependency management strategy with vulnerability patching.

## Threat: [Malicious Modules/Plugins (Supply Chain Attacks)](./threats/malicious_modulesplugins__supply_chain_attacks_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Modules/Plugins (Supply Chain Attacks)
*   **Description:** Attackers compromise npm packages and inject malicious code into modules or plugins used by Nuxt.js applications. This can lead to backdoors, data theft, malicious modification of application behavior, or malware distribution to users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Full application compromise, data breach, widespread user impact, severe reputational damage.
*   **Nuxt.js Component Affected:** Nuxt.js Modules, Plugins, `package.json`, `node_modules`, npm ecosystem.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exercise caution when adding new dependencies, researching module maintainers and community reputation.
    *   Use `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` for consistent dependency versions.
    *   Consider using a private npm registry to control and vet dependencies.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to detect malicious dependencies.
    *   For critical dependencies, consider code review to identify potential malicious code.

## Threat: [Insecure `nuxt.config.js` Configuration](./threats/insecure__nuxt_config_js__configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure `nuxt.config.js` Configuration
*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in `nuxt.config.js` can introduce security weaknesses, such as exposing sensitive information client-side, disabling security headers, or insecure server options. Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to bypass security measures or extract sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Data exposure, XSS vulnerabilities, weakened security posture.
*   **Nuxt.js Component Affected:** `nuxt.config.js`, Configuration System, Security Headers Middleware, Server Options.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow security best practices when configuring `nuxt.config.js`.
    *   Avoid exposing sensitive data in client-side configurations.
    *   Enable and properly configure security headers in `nuxt.config.js`.
    *   Review and securely configure server options.
    *   Carefully configure routing and middleware for security policies.
    *   Regularly review `nuxt.config.js` for potential misconfigurations.

## Threat: [API Security Vulnerabilities in Server Routes](./threats/api_security_vulnerabilities_in_server_routes.md)

*   **Threat:** API Security Vulnerabilities in Server Routes
*   **Description:** Nuxt.js server routes (in `server/api`) are vulnerable to standard API security issues like injection flaws, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and lack of rate limiting. Attackers can exploit these to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, disrupt service, or steal sensitive information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High to Critical:** Data breach, unauthorized access, service disruption, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Nuxt.js Component Affected:** Server Routes (`server/api`), API Endpoints, Backend Logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply standard API security best practices to Nuxt.js server routes.

    *   Use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Implement rate limiting and DoS protection.
    *   Prevent Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) with proper authorization checks.
    *   Conduct regular API security testing and penetration testing.
