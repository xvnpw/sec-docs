*   **Dependency on External Ecosystem:** Nuxt.js heavily relies on Vue.js, Node.js, and the NPM ecosystem. Security of these external dependencies is a significant factor in Nuxt.js security.
*   **Data Flow (Simplified Server Deployment):**
    1.  User request comes in through the Internet.
    2.  Load Balancer distributes the request to an Application Server.
    3.  Application Server (Nuxt.js Application Container) processes the request using the Renderer and Core Modules.
    4.  Application may interact with a Database Server (optional).
    5.  Static assets may be served from a CDN (optional).
    6.  Response is sent back to the user through the Load Balancer.

This inferred architecture highlights the key components and their interactions, allowing us to focus security considerations on the most critical areas.
