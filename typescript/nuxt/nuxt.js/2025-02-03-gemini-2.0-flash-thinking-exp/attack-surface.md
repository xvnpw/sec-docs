# Attack Surface Analysis for nuxt/nuxt.js

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into server-rendered HTML, leading to script execution in users' browsers.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js's Server-Side Rendering (SSR) feature, while enhancing performance and SEO, directly contributes to this attack surface if developers fail to sanitize data before server-side rendering.
*   **Example:** Displaying unsanitized user-provided data within a Nuxt.js component that is rendered on the server. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the user data, which is then executed in the browsers of users viewing the page.
*   **Impact:** User session hijacking, data theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and potentially server-side compromise if the XSS is further exploited.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Server-Side Output Encoding:** Implement mandatory and robust server-side output encoding for all dynamic content rendered via SSR.
        *   **Templating Engine Safety:** Utilize Nuxt.js's templating engine features correctly to ensure safe output by default (e.g., prefer `v-text` over `v-html` for user-generated content).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the capabilities of injected scripts and reduce the impact of XSS.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on SSR components and data handling.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Server-Side Secrets via SSR](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_server-side_secrets_via_ssr.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional inclusion of sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, in the HTML source code during Server-Side Rendering.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js applications manage configurations and environment variables, and improper handling within SSR processes can lead to secrets being exposed in the client-side rendered HTML.
*   **Example:** Directly embedding an API key within a Nuxt.js component's template or accessing it in a server-side lifecycle hook in a way that results in the key being rendered in the HTML source code.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the exposed secret, leading to unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, and potential further system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Secret Management:** Employ secure environment variable management practices and avoid hardcoding secrets in Nuxt.js configuration files or component code.
        *   **Server-Side Only Access:** Access and utilize sensitive information exclusively on the server-side, ideally within Nuxt.js server middleware or API routes, preventing direct exposure in client-side code.
        *   **Environment Variable Isolation:** Ensure environment variables containing secrets are properly isolated and not inadvertently exposed to the client-side build process or rendered output.
        *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate any potential leaks of sensitive information during SSR.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Vulnerabilities in Nuxt.js API Routes](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_vulnerabilities_in_nuxt_js_api_routes.md)

*   **Description:** Presence of standard API security vulnerabilities (like Injection flaws, Broken Authentication, etc.) within API endpoints developed using Nuxt.js's serverless functions feature.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js simplifies API route creation, but the framework itself does not inherently enforce secure API development practices, making applications vulnerable if developers don't implement security measures.
*   **Example:** An API route in a Nuxt.js application that is susceptible to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization when querying a database based on user-provided parameters.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, server compromise, and potential denial of service, depending on the nature and exploitability of the API vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability and data sensitivity)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure API Development Practices:** Implement secure coding practices for all Nuxt.js API routes, including robust input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints to control access and protect sensitive operations.
        *   **API Security Best Practices:** Adhere to established API security best practices (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10) throughout the API development lifecycle.
        *   **Regular API Security Testing:** Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, specifically targeting Nuxt.js API routes.

## Attack Surface: [Development Mode Exposure in Production](./attack_surfaces/development_mode_exposure_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Running a Nuxt.js application in development mode within a production environment, which exposes debugging features and less secure configurations intended only for development.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js, like other frameworks, distinguishes between development and production environments. Misconfiguration during deployment can lead to accidentally running in development mode in production.
*   **Example:** Deploying a Nuxt.js application with the `NODE_ENV` environment variable set to `development` in a production setting. This can enable verbose logging, expose Vue.js devtools, and potentially bypass security optimizations, providing attackers with valuable debugging information and increasing the attack surface.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure through verbose logs and debug tools, increased attack surface due to less strict security settings, potential performance degradation, and easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (Increases the likelihood and impact of other vulnerabilities and information disclosure)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users (Deployment):**
        *   **Production Environment Configuration:** Always ensure the Nuxt.js application is deployed in production mode by explicitly setting the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production` during deployment.
        *   **Disable Development Features:**  Disable or remove all development-specific features, tools (like Vue.js devtools), and verbose logging in production builds and configurations.
        *   **Environment Management Automation:** Implement robust and automated environment variable management and deployment processes to prevent accidental development mode deployments.
        *   **Deployment Verification:** Verify the application's environment configuration in production after deployment to confirm it is running in production mode.
