# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Nuxt.js aims to provide a streamlined and efficient framework for building modern web applications with Vue.js.
  - Key priorities include developer experience, performance, flexibility, and scalability of applications built with Nuxt.js.
  - The project strives to be a leading framework in the Vue.js ecosystem, empowering developers to create high-quality web applications quickly and effectively.
  - Nuxt.js is open-source and community-driven, relying on contributions and feedback from its users to improve and evolve.
  - A significant goal is to maintain a vibrant and active community around Nuxt.js, providing support, resources, and a collaborative environment for developers.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the framework itself could impact a large number of applications built with Nuxt.js, leading to potential reputational damage and security incidents for users.
  - Dependence on community contributions for security fixes and updates could lead to delays in addressing vulnerabilities if the community response is slow or insufficient.
  - Lack of dedicated security resources or formal security audits could increase the risk of overlooking critical security flaws in the framework.
  - Compatibility issues with underlying technologies (Node.js, Vue.js, JavaScript ecosystem) or breaking changes in dependencies could disrupt development workflows and application stability.
  - Negative perception or loss of trust in the framework due to security incidents or lack of responsiveness to security concerns could lead to decreased adoption and community engagement.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Codebase - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny, which can help identify potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Community Contributions - Security patches and vulnerability reports can be submitted by the community through GitHub pull requests and issue reports. Implemented: GitHub Contribution Model.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Nuxt.js uses `package-lock.json` or similar to manage dependencies, helping to ensure consistent and reproducible builds and potentially mitigate supply chain risks. Implemented: Package Management (npm/yarn).
  - security control: Regular Updates - The Nuxt.js team releases updates and bug fixes, which may include security patches. Implemented: Release Cycle (observed from GitHub releases).
  - security control: Documentation - Security considerations and best practices for Nuxt.js applications are documented in the official Nuxt.js documentation. Implemented: nuxtjs.org documentation.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Audits -  The project may rely heavily on the community to identify and report security vulnerabilities, which might not be as comprehensive or timely as professional security audits.
  - accepted risk: Potential for Dependency Vulnerabilities - Nuxt.js depends on a large number of third-party libraries, which could introduce vulnerabilities. While dependency management helps, it doesn't eliminate the risk entirely.
  - accepted risk: Open Source Security Model - The open nature of the project means that vulnerability information is publicly accessible, potentially increasing the window of opportunity for attackers before patches are widely deployed.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Automated Security Scanning - Integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) into the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities in the codebase and dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a Security Response Process - Define a clear process for handling security vulnerability reports, including triage, patching, and public disclosure.
  - security control: Conduct Regular Security Audits - Perform periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential security weaknesses in the framework.
  - security control: Security Champions Program -  Establish a security champions program within the core team and community to promote security awareness and best practices.
  - security control:  Provide Security Hardening Guides - Create and maintain security hardening guides and best practices documentation specifically for Nuxt.js applications, covering topics like secure configuration, input validation, and output encoding.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Nuxt.js itself does not handle authentication directly, but applications built with Nuxt.js will likely require authentication mechanisms.
    - Security Requirement: Applications built with Nuxt.js should implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
    - Security Requirement: Nuxt.js documentation should provide guidance on secure authentication practices within Nuxt.js applications, including integration with common authentication providers and strategies.
  - Authorization:
    - Similar to authentication, authorization is application-specific but crucial for secure Nuxt.js applications.
    - Security Requirement: Applications built with Nuxt.js should implement proper authorization controls to manage user access to resources and functionalities based on roles and permissions.
    - Security Requirement: Nuxt.js documentation should offer best practices for implementing authorization in Nuxt.js applications, covering role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) concepts.
  - Input Validation:
    - Nuxt.js applications, especially those interacting with user input or external data sources, must perform thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks.
    - Security Requirement: Nuxt.js applications should validate all user inputs on both the client-side and server-side to prevent common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
    - Security Requirement: Nuxt.js framework should encourage and facilitate secure input handling practices, potentially through built-in validation utilities or recommendations in the documentation.
  - Cryptography:
    - Nuxt.js applications may need to handle sensitive data that requires encryption in transit and at rest.
    - Security Requirement: Applications built with Nuxt.js should utilize strong cryptography for protecting sensitive data, including HTTPS for communication and appropriate encryption methods for data storage.
    - Security Requirement: Nuxt.js documentation should provide guidance on using cryptography securely within Nuxt.js applications, emphasizing best practices for key management and algorithm selection.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and maintenance of the Nuxt.js framework itself.
  - Providing a secure and reliable framework for web developers to build applications.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trust of the Nuxt.js project within the developer community.
  - Ensuring the continued adoption and growth of the Nuxt.js ecosystem.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the Nuxt.js framework: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
  - User data within applications built with Nuxt.js: Sensitivity varies depending on the application. Nuxt.js itself does not handle user data, but applications built with it might handle highly sensitive data (e.g., personal information, financial data). Security of this data is the responsibility of the application developers.
  - Build artifacts and release packages: Medium sensitivity. Integrity is important to ensure that users download and use genuine and untampered versions of Nuxt.js.
  - Documentation and website content: Low sensitivity. Availability and integrity are important for user experience and trust.
