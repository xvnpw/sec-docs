# Attack Surface Analysis for nuxt/nuxt.js

## Attack Surface: [1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) XSS](./attack_surfaces/1__server-side_rendering__ssr__xss.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities arising from unsanitized data rendered on the server by Nuxt.js and injected into the HTML response.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js's core SSR feature directly contributes to this attack surface. When using `asyncData`, `fetch`, or server middleware to fetch and render dynamic content, Nuxt.js server-side rendering pipeline can become a vector for XSS if data is not properly handled.
*   **Example:** A Nuxt.js page uses `asyncData` to fetch blog post content from a CMS and renders it server-side. If the CMS content is not sanitized and contains malicious JavaScript, this script will execute in users' browsers when they visit the page.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, sensitive data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, and further attacks against users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided data and data from external sources *on the server-side* before rendering it in Nuxt.js components. Use robust server-side sanitization libraries.
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Ensure proper output encoding based on the context (HTML entity encoding for HTML, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript contexts) in Nuxt.js templates.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the capabilities of scripts executed in the browser, reducing the impact of XSS.

## Attack Surface: [2. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Nuxt.js SSR Logic](./attack_surfaces/2__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_nuxt_js_ssr_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Nuxt.js server-side rendering logic to force the server to make unintended requests to internal or external resources.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js features like `asyncData`, `fetch`, and server middleware, which are designed for server-side data fetching, can be misused to perform SSRF if user-controlled input influences the URLs or hosts being requested.
*   **Example:** A Nuxt.js application uses `asyncData` to fetch data from an API where the API endpoint is partially determined by a route parameter. If this parameter is not strictly validated, an attacker could manipulate it to make the Nuxt.js server request internal services (e.g., cloud metadata endpoints, internal databases) or arbitrary external URLs.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources and sensitive data, port scanning of internal networks, potential compromise of backend systems, denial of service against internal or external services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Robust Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input that is used to construct URLs or hostnames in `asyncData`, `fetch`, or server middleware.
        *   **URL Whitelisting and Blacklisting:** Implement strict whitelists of allowed domains or URLs for server-side requests. Blacklist known malicious or internal networks if necessary.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate backend services and internal networks from the internet. Restrict the Nuxt.js server's ability to make outbound requests to only essential external services.

## Attack Surface: [3. Injection Vulnerabilities in Nuxt.js API Routes (`server/api`)](./attack_surfaces/3__injection_vulnerabilities_in_nuxt_js_api_routes___serverapi__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within API routes defined in Nuxt.js's `server/api` directory to inject malicious code into backend systems.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js simplifies creating API endpoints within the `server/api` directory. These routes are standard Node.js/Express-like endpoints and inherit the risk of injection vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.) if input handling is insecure.
*   **Example:** A Nuxt.js API route in `server/api/items.js` retrieves items from a database based on a user-provided item ID. If the item ID is directly used in a raw SQL query without parameterization, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker could inject malicious SQL to bypass authorization, modify data, or extract sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, complete compromise of backend databases or systems, potential remote code execution on the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Secure API Development Practices:** Follow secure API development principles for all routes in `server/api`.
        *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs received by API routes before using them in backend operations.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure API routes operate with the minimum necessary privileges to access backend systems.

## Attack Surface: [4. Client-Side XSS in Nuxt.js Components and Plugins](./attack_surfaces/4__client-side_xss_in_nuxt_js_components_and_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities within client-side Nuxt.js components or plugins due to insecure handling of dynamic content.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Custom Nuxt.js components and third-party plugins, while extending functionality, can introduce client-side XSS if they render user-provided or external data without proper sanitization in the browser's context.
*   **Example:** A Nuxt.js component uses `v-html` to display user-generated content fetched from an API. If this content is not sanitized before being rendered with `v-html`, malicious JavaScript embedded in the content will execute in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, sensitive data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, and client-side attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Client-Side Sanitization:** Sanitize user-provided data and data from external sources before rendering it in client-side components. Use client-side sanitization libraries like DOMPurify.
        *   **Avoid `v-html` where possible:** Prefer using text interpolation (`{{ }}`) or component-based rendering over `v-html` for displaying dynamic content. If `v-html` is necessary, ensure rigorous sanitization.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of custom components and third-party plugins, especially those handling dynamic content.

## Attack Surface: [5. Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Nuxt.js Modules and Plugins](./attack_surfaces/5__vulnerabilities_in_third-party_nuxt_js_modules_and_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in third-party Nuxt.js modules and plugins that are integrated into the application.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js's module and plugin ecosystem, while beneficial for extending functionality, introduces a dependency on external code. Vulnerabilities in these third-party components can directly impact the security of the Nuxt.js application.
*   **Example:** A popular Nuxt.js module used for social media integration contains a remote code execution vulnerability. By including this module in a Nuxt.js project, the application becomes vulnerable to this RCE if the module is exploited.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and complete application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and module's role)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Careful Module/Plugin Selection:** Choose reputable, actively maintained, and security-conscious Nuxt.js modules and plugins. Research their security history and maintainer reputation.
        *   **Dependency Scanning and Auditing:** Implement dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party modules and plugins. Regularly audit dependencies for security issues.
        *   **Principle of Least Functionality:** Only include necessary modules and plugins. Avoid adding modules with excessive or unnecessary features that increase the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [6. Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables via Nuxt.js Configuration](./attack_surfaces/6__exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables_via_nuxt_js_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental exposure of sensitive information (API keys, secrets, credentials) stored in environment variables due to misconfiguration in Nuxt.js.
*   **Nuxt.js Contribution:** Nuxt.js's configuration system, particularly the use of `publicRuntimeConfig`, can lead to unintentional exposure of environment variables in the client-side bundle if not used correctly.
*   **Example:** An API key intended for server-side use is mistakenly placed in `publicRuntimeConfig` in `nuxt.config.js`. This API key becomes accessible in the client-side JavaScript bundle and can be extracted by inspecting the source code, potentially leading to unauthorized API access and abuse.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to APIs and services, data breaches, account compromise, and potential financial losses due to API abuse.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Proper Environment Variable Management:** Use `.env` files and Nuxt.js's `privateRuntimeConfig` for sensitive server-side environment variables. Only use `publicRuntimeConfig` for truly public, non-sensitive configuration.
        *   **Minimize Client-Side Configuration:** Avoid exposing any sensitive information to the client-side bundle through configuration.
        *   **Regular Configuration Review:** Regularly review `nuxt.config.js` and environment variable usage to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed to the client-side.
