# Threat Model Analysis for nuxt/nuxt.js

## Threat: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (SS-XSS)](./threats/server-side_cross-site_scripting__ss-xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into user-provided data. When the Nuxt.js application renders this data on the server-side *due to its SSR nature* without proper sanitization, the script executes in the server's context. This can allow the attacker to potentially access server-side resources, manipulate data, or compromise other users' sessions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Account compromise
        *   Data breach
        *   Server-side resource access
        *   Reputation damage
    *   **Affected Nuxt.js Component:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Vue Components rendered server-side, Template engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize all user inputs before rendering them server-side within Nuxt.js components.
        *   Utilize template engine's automatic escaping features in Nuxt.js templates.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers within Nuxt.js application configuration.
        *   Regularly update Nuxt.js and server-side components and dependencies.

## Threat: [Server-Side Component Vulnerabilities](./threats/server-side_component_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Vue components that are rendered on the server *within the Nuxt.js SSR context* or in their dependencies. This could be through known vulnerabilities in libraries or custom code flaws. Exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the server, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
        *   Information Disclosure
        *   Denial of Service (DoS)
