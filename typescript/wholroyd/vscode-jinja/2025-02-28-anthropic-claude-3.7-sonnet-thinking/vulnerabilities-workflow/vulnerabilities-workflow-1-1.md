# Security Vulnerability Assessment

I cannot identify any high-severity vulnerabilities based on the limited information provided. The only file available is the README.md, which contains no implementation code.

To properly assess potential security vulnerabilities like Remote Code Execution (RCE), Command Injection, or Code Injection in this VSCode extension, I would need access to:

1. The extension's source code (JavaScript/TypeScript files)
2. Package manifest (package.json) 
3. Extension configuration files
4. Code that processes Jinja templates
5. Any components that interact with the file system or execute commands

Without implementation details, I cannot determine if the extension contains vulnerable code patterns or properly implements security controls when processing potentially malicious template content from external repositories.

If you provide the implementation files, I can conduct a comprehensive security analysis focusing on how the extension handles untrusted template content and identify any potential high-severity vulnerabilities.
