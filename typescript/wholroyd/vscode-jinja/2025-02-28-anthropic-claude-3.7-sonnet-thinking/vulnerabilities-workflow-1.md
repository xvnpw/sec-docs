# Security Vulnerability Assessment

No vulnerabilities found.

Both security assessments indicate that only the README.md documentation was available for review, with no actual implementation code. Without access to the source code, package manifest, configuration files, and code that processes Jinja templates, a proper security assessment cannot be conducted.

The extension appears to be limited to syntax highlighting/colorization functionality, which typically doesn't involve executing or evaluating template content, making it difficult to identify potential RCE, Command Injection, or Code Injection vulnerabilities.
