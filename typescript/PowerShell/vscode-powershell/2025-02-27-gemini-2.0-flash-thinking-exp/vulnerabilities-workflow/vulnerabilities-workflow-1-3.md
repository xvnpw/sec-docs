## Vulnerability List for PowerShell VSCode Extension

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Open in ISE Feature

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker with control over system environment variables, specifically `windir`, can potentially inject commands when the "PowerShell: Open in ISE" command is executed.
    2. The extension constructs the path to `powershell_ise.exe` by appending to `process.env.windir`.
    3. This path, along with the currently opened file's path, is then passed to `ChildProcess.exec` for execution.
    4. If `process.env.windir` contains malicious characters or commands, these could be executed due to insufficient sanitization when constructing the command string.

- **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could allow an attacker to perform malicious actions on the user's system, such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising system integrity.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** Double quotes are used around the file path (`uri.fsPath`) when passed to `ChildProcess.exec`. However, this might not be sufficient to prevent command injection in all scenarios, especially if `process.env.windir` is maliciously crafted.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize `process.env.windir` and `uri.fsPath` to remove or escape any characters that could be interpreted as command separators or injection points before constructing the execution command.
    - **Secure Command Execution:** Use a safer method for executing the process that avoids shell interpretation, such as using array arguments instead of constructing a command string for `ChildProcess.spawn` or similar APIs.
    - **Environment Variable Validation:**  Consider validating the expected format and content of environment variables used in security-sensitive operations, although controlling or validating system-level environment variables might be challenging.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker has the ability to modify the `windir` environment variable on the user's system. While directly modifying system-level environment variables might require elevated privileges, there could be scenarios where user-level environment variables or other manipulation techniques could influence the value used by the extension.
    - A PowerShell file is open in VSCode, and the user executes the "PowerShell: Open in ISE" command.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/features/OpenInISE.ts`
    - Lines:
    ```typescript
    let ISEPath = process.env.windir ?? "C:\\Windows";
    // ... architecture check ...
    ISEPath += "\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell_ise.exe";
    ChildProcess.exec(`${ISEPath} -File "${uri.fsPath}"`).unref();
    ```
    - Visualization:
    ```
    process.env.windir (potentially attacker-controlled) --> ISEPath Construction --> ChildProcess.exec (command injection point) --> System Command Execution
    uri.fsPath (current file path) ------------------------^
    ```
    - The vulnerability lies in the direct string concatenation and execution without proper sanitization of `process.env.windir` and `uri.fsPath` when calling `ChildProcess.exec`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** On a Windows system, as a user, attempt to modify the `windir` environment variable to a malicious path, for example, by setting a user-level environment variable (if system-level modification is not feasible for testing). A malicious path could be something like `C:\Windows & calc &` to attempt to execute `calc.exe` upon command execution.
    2. **Execution:** Open VSCode with the PowerShell extension enabled. Open any PowerShell script file.
    3. **Trigger:** Execute the command "PowerShell: Open in ISE" from the command palette or context menu.
    4. **Verification:** Observe if `calc.exe` (or any other injected command) is executed. If `calc.exe` runs, it indicates successful command injection.
    5. **Cleanup:**  Reset the `windir` environment variable to its original, safe value.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Path Traversal and Arbitrary File Operations via Extension Commands

- **Description:**
    1. The PowerShell extension handles several requests from the language server that involve file paths, such as `OpenFileRequestType`, `SaveFileRequestType`, and `NewFileRequestType`.
    2. These requests carry file path information (`filePath`, `newPath`) originating from the language server.
    3. The extension client uses these paths in file system operations (e.g., `vscode.workspace.openTextDocument`, `vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile`) with some path resolution using `resolveFilePathWithCwd`.
    4. If a malicious or compromised language server sends crafted file paths (e.g., paths starting with `..` for traversal, or absolute paths to sensitive locations), and the extension client implicitly trusts these paths after `resolveFilePathWithCwd`, it could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities (reading files outside the workspace) or arbitrary file operations (writing/creating files in unexpected locations).
    5. While `resolveFilePathWithCwd` resolves paths against the CWD setting, it might not prevent all path traversal attempts if the server provides carefully crafted paths or if there are vulnerabilities in the path resolution logic itself.

- **Impact:**
    - **Path Traversal (File Read):** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the user's system that the VSCode process has access to, by tricking the extension to open or save files at traversed paths.
    - **Arbitrary File Write/Creation:** An attacker could potentially write or create files at arbitrary locations on the user's system, potentially leading to configuration changes, data corruption, or even code execution in some scenarios, by manipulating file save or new file operations.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High to Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The `resolveFilePathWithCwd` function is used to resolve file paths against the user's current working directory (CWD) setting. This provides some level of protection against relative path traversal from user-provided inputs.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Server Path Validation:** Implement robust validation and sanitization of file paths received from the language server *before* using them in any file system operations. This should include checks to:
        - Ensure paths are within expected boundaries (e.g., workspace or designated safe directories).
        - Canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and relative path components and prevent traversal using `..`.
        - Validate path components to prevent injection of special characters or path separators.
    - **Strict Path Handling:** Re-evaluate if absolute paths from the server should be implicitly trusted. Consider treating paths from the server as potentially untrusted and apply stricter validation or sandboxing.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the VSCode extension process operates with the minimum necessary file system privileges to limit the impact of potential path traversal or arbitrary file operations.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A malicious, compromised, or intentionally crafted language server is connected to the PowerShell VSCode extension.
    - The malicious server sends requests of type `OpenFileRequestType`, `SaveFileRequestType`, or `NewFileRequestType` with crafted `filePath` or `newPath` values designed to exploit path traversal or arbitrary file operations.
    - The user interacts with features that trigger these server requests, or the extension automatically processes these requests without user interaction if such features exist.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/features/ExtensionCommands.ts`
    - Relevant code sections are the handlers for `OpenFileRequestType`, `SaveFileRequestType`, and `NewFileRequestType` and the `resolveFilePathWithCwd` and `saveFileAs` functions.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**  Set up a mock language server that can send crafted responses to the VSCode extension. Configure the extension to connect to this mock server.
    2. **Crafted Server Response:** In the mock server, implement handlers for `OpenFileRequestType` and `SaveFileRequestType`. When these requests are received, the mock server should respond with a crafted `filePath` or `newPath` value that attempts path traversal. For example:
        - For `OpenFileRequestType`, send a `filePath` like `"../../../sensitive/file.txt"`.
        - For `SaveFileRequestType`, send a `newPath` like `"../../../malicious/file.ps1"`.
    3. **Trigger:** Trigger an extension command or action that causes the extension to send an `OpenFileRequestType` or `SaveFileRequestType` to the mock server. For example, this could be through a custom extension command that invokes the vulnerable functionality.
    4. **Verification (Path Traversal - File Read):** For `OpenFileRequestType`, after triggering the action, check if the extension attempts to open or access the file at the path `"../../../sensitive/file.txt"` relative to the workspace root or CWD. Monitor file system access attempts if possible.
    5. **Verification (Arbitrary File Write):** For `SaveFileRequestType`, after triggering the action, check if the extension attempts to write a file to the path `"../../../malicious/file.ps1"` relative to the workspace root or CWD. Check if the file is created at the unexpected location.
    6. **Analysis:** Analyze the extension's behavior to determine if it successfully prevents the path traversal or arbitrary file operation, or if it attempts to access or modify files at the malicious paths provided by the mock server.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Command Injection in Pester Tests Feature via Filename

- **Description:**
    1. The Pester Tests feature constructs a PowerShell command to run Pester tests, using `InvokePesterStub.ps1`.
    2. When launching tests, the extension takes the file path of the test file (`fileUri.fsPath`) and the test name (`testName`) and includes them as arguments in the PowerShell command.
    3. While the extension uses `utils.escapeSingleQuotes` to escape single quotes in `fileUri.fsPath` and `testName`, this might not be sufficient to prevent all forms of command injection if filenames or test names contain other malicious characters, particularly double quotes, backticks, or PowerShell command separators, which are not escaped by `escapeSingleQuotes`.
    4. If a user creates a PowerShell file or Pester test with a specially crafted name containing malicious commands, and then attempts to run Pester tests on that file or test, it could lead to command injection when the extension executes the Pester command.

- **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the PowerShell Editor Services process. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute malicious PowerShell code on the user's system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The `utils.escapeSingleQuotes` function is used to escape single quotes in the `fileUri.fsPath` and `testName` arguments before including them in the PowerShell command string.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Robust Input Sanitization:** Implement more comprehensive sanitization for `fileUri.fsPath` and `testName` that escapes or removes not only single quotes but also double quotes, backticks, PowerShell command separators (like `;`, `&`, `|`), and other potentially dangerous characters before constructing the Pester command.
    - **Parameterization (if feasible):** If possible, consider if the Pester command invocation can be parameterized in a way that avoids string interpolation and command string construction altogether, which would be a more robust approach to prevent command injection. However, with `vscode.debug.startDebugging` and PowerShell command-line arguments, direct parameterization might be limited.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the format and content of filenames and test names to ensure they conform to expected patterns and reject or sanitize inputs that contain suspicious characters.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A user opens or creates a PowerShell file or Pester test file with a filename or test name that is specially crafted to contain malicious commands.
    - The user then executes the "Run Pester Tests" or "Debug Pester Tests" command on this file or test, triggering the extension to construct and execute the Pester command.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/features/PesterTests.ts`
    - Relevant code section is the `createLaunchConfig` function, specifically how `fileUri.fsPath` and `testName` are used in constructing `launchConfig.args`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious Filename Creation:** Create a PowerShell script file with a filename crafted to contain a malicious command. For example, name the file `test_';calc;'.ps1` or `test_"` & calc & `".ps1`.
    2. **Trigger Pester Test:** Open VSCode with the PowerShell extension enabled. Open the maliciously named PowerShell script file. Right-click on the editor window or in the Explorer pane on this file and select "Run Pester Tests" or "Debug Pester Tests".
    3. **Verification:** Observe if `calc.exe` (or any other injected command) is executed when Pester tests are launched. If `calc.exe` runs, it indicates successful command injection due to the malicious filename.
    4. **Repeat with Malicious Test Name:** If Pester test names can be directly manipulated (e.g., through some configuration or input), try to create a Pester test with a malicious name and attempt to run tests to see if injection is possible through test names as well.
    5. **Test `escapeSingleQuotes` robustness:** Create filenames and test names with various combinations of single quotes, double quotes, backticks, semicolons, ampersands, pipes, and other special characters to thoroughly test if `escapeSingleQuotes` and the command construction logic are robust enough to prevent injection in all these cases.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Command Injection in Bug Report Generation

- **Description:**
    1. The "Generate Bug Report" feature executes a PowerShell command to retrieve PowerShell version information using `child_process.spawnSync`.
    2. The command is constructed using `this.sessionManager.PowerShellExeDetails.exePath` as the executable path and fixed arguments `["-NoProfile", "-NoLogo", "-Command", "$PSVersionTable | Out-String"]`.
    3. If `this.sessionManager.PowerShellExeDetails.exePath` is somehow compromised and points to a malicious executable instead of the legitimate PowerShell executable, executing the "Generate Bug Report" command would result in the execution of the malicious executable.
    4. This is a form of command injection where the "injected command" is the malicious executable pointed to by `PowerShellExeDetails.exePath`.

- **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the VSCode process. If `PowerShellExeDetails.exePath` is controlled by an attacker, they could execute arbitrary code on the user's system when the bug report generation feature is used.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None directly in the code snippet provided. The security relies on the assumption that `this.sessionManager.PowerShellExeDetails.exePath` always points to the legitimate PowerShell executable.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Executable Path Validation:** Implement validation to ensure that `this.sessionManager.PowerShellExeDetails.exePath` points to a trusted and expected PowerShell executable path. This could involve:
        - Path whitelisting: Check if the path is within a known safe directory for PowerShell executables.
        - Executable signature verification: Verify the digital signature of the executable to ensure it's genuinely from Microsoft.
        - Integrity checks: Periodically verify the integrity of the PowerShell executable path to detect if it has been tampered with or replaced.
    - **Error Handling and Fallback:** If the validation of `PowerShellExeDetails.exePath` fails, implement robust error handling to prevent command execution and inform the user about the potential security issue. Consider falling back to a safer method of gathering system information or disabling the bug report generation feature if the PowerShell executable path cannot be reliably verified.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** If possible, ensure that the process running the bug report generation feature operates with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact if command injection were to occur.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker has somehow managed to compromise or replace the PowerShell executable path that is being tracked by `this.sessionManager.PowerShellExeDetails.exePath` within the PowerShell VSCode extension's session.
    - The user then executes the "PowerShell.GenerateBugReport" command.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/features/GenerateBugReport.ts`
    - Relevant code section is the `getRuntimeInfo` function where `child_process.spawnSync` is called using `this.sessionManager.PowerShellExeDetails.exePath`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Executable Path Manipulation (Simulated):** In a test environment, simulate a scenario where `this.sessionManager.PowerShellExeDetails.exePath` is modified to point to a malicious executable. This might involve mocking the `SessionManager` or directly manipulating the `PowerShellExeDetails` property in a test context. The "malicious executable" could be a simple script or program that executes `calc.exe` or performs another easily observable action.
    2. **Trigger Bug Report:** Execute the "PowerShell.GenerateBugReport" command in VSCode.
    3. **Verification:** Observe if `calc.exe` (or the action of the malicious executable) is executed. If it is, it indicates successful command injection because the extension used the compromised executable path to run the bug report command.
    4. **Integrity Check Testing:** If mitigation involves executable path validation or signature verification, create test cases to specifically verify that these mitigation measures correctly detect and prevent command execution when `PowerShellExeDetails.exePath` is pointed to an invalid or untrusted executable.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via powerShellAdditionalExePaths Setting

- **Description:**
    1. The PowerShell extension allows users to specify additional PowerShell executable paths via the `powerShellAdditionalExePaths` setting.
    2. The `PowerShellExeFinder` uses these paths to enumerate available PowerShell installations.
    3. When the extension needs to execute PowerShell using a path from `powerShellAdditionalExePaths`, it might directly use this path without sufficient validation.
    4. If a user (or an attacker who can modify user settings) sets `powerShellAdditionalExePaths` to a malicious executable path or a path containing injected commands, this could lead to command injection when the extension attempts to launch PowerShell using this configured path.

- **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the VSCode process. An attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the user's system by manipulating the `powerShellAdditionalExePaths` setting.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The extension appears to directly use the paths provided in `powerShellAdditionalExePaths` without any sanitization or validation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate the paths provided in `powerShellAdditionalExePaths` setting. This should include checks to:
        - Ensure paths are valid executable paths and not just arbitrary commands.
        - Check for and remove or escape any characters that could be interpreted as command separators or injection points.
        - Whitelist or blacklist specific characters or path patterns.
    - **Secure Command Execution:** When launching PowerShell using a path from `powerShellAdditionalExePaths`, use secure methods to avoid shell interpretation, such as using array arguments with `ChildProcess.spawn` instead of constructing command strings.
    - **Setting Scope Limitation:** Consider if the `powerShellAdditionalExePaths` setting should be restricted to workspace or user settings only, and if there are scenarios where it could be maliciously set in less secure configuration scopes.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker has the ability to modify the user or workspace settings for the PowerShell VSCode extension. This could be achieved if the attacker has access to the user's VSCode settings file or can influence workspace settings (e.g., in a shared workspace).
    - The user then triggers an action in the extension that causes it to enumerate or use PowerShell installations, leading it to consider the malicious path from `powerShellAdditionalExePaths`.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/platform/PowerShellExeFinder.ts`
    - The `enumerateAdditionalPowerShellInstallations` function iterates over the paths in `powerShellAdditionalExePaths` and creates `PowerShellExeDetails` objects. These `PowerShellExeDetails` objects, including the `exePath`, are then used to launch PowerShell without validation.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Modify the user settings for the PowerShell extension to include a malicious path in `powerShellAdditionalExePaths`. For example, set `"powerShellAdditionalExePaths": ["C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe"]` (on Windows) or `"/usr/bin/gnome-calculator"` (on Linux). Alternatively, try to inject command like `"powerShellAdditionalExePaths": ["C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c calc.exe"]`.
    2. **Trigger:** Trigger an action in the PowerShell extension that causes it to enumerate and use PowerShell installations. This could be simply restarting VSCode or triggering a feature that requires PowerShell execution, like running a script or opening a PowerShell terminal.
    3. **Verification:** Observe if `calc.exe` (or any other injected command) is executed when the extension initializes or performs actions that involve PowerShell. If `calc.exe` runs, it indicates successful command injection via the `powerShellAdditionalExePaths` setting.
    4. **Test with different injection attempts:** Try various forms of command injection in `powerShellAdditionalExePaths` to see if any bypass potential basic sanitization and lead to command execution. For example, try paths with spaces, quotes, semicolons, backticks, etc.
