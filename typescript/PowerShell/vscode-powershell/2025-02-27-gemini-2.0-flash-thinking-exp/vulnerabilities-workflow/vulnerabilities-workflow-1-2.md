- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Working Directory Configuration in the Integrated Console
  - **Description:**
    The extension obtains the “cwd” (current working directory) setting from the workspace configuration (for example, via a maliciously supplied .vscode/settings.json) and then passes it—after untildify and basic file–existence checks—to the integrated PowerShell console without verifying that it lies within a trusted directory. An attacker supplying a specially crafted workspace can override settings so that later PowerShell processes run in an unexpected (or sensitive) directory rather than the intended workspace folder.
  - **Impact:**
    - Commands executed in the integrated console (or under debugging) could run in directories outside the intended workspace.
    - This misconfiguration may allow an attacker to cause unintended file modifications or escalate privileges if downstream processes rely on a trusted working directory.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code verifies that supplied “cwd” values exist and resolves relative paths against a selected workspace using functions such as `getChosenWorkspace` and `validateCwdSetting`.
    - The use of the `untildify` utility replaces a leading tilde with the user’s home directory.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no explicit check that the resolved “cwd” is restricted to a predefined whitelist (for example, the actual workspace directory or a set of approved directories).
    - No prompt or rejection is performed when the “cwd” falls outside an expected safe boundary.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to supply a malicious workspace configuration file (for example, a .vscode/settings.json that sets an unexpected “cwd”) which is loaded without proper trust evaluation.
    - The user must subsequently trigger a functionality that launches the integrated console using that “cwd” setting.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In **src/settings.ts**, the method `validateCwdSetting` retrieves the “cwd” value from VS Code’s configuration and calls `untildify` on it.
    - Later, in functions such as `getChosenWorkspace`, the resolved path is used without verifying that it remains within a trusted or expected directory boundary.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a workspace that includes a malicious .vscode/settings.json with “cwd” set to an absolute path outside the workspace (e.g. a system–sensitive directory).
    2. **Trigger:** Open the workspace in VS Code so that the extension loads this configuration and then launch a PowerShell terminal session.
    3. **Observation:** Examine the integrated console’s working directory to verify that it is set to the attacker–supplied value despite it being outside the trusted workspace.
    4. **Result:** Confirm that commands executed in the console are run in the attacker–controlled directory, thereby demonstrating the potential for privilege escalation or unintended file modifications.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Additional PowerShell Executable Path Configuration
  - **Description:**
    The extension allows additional PowerShell executables to be specified via the “powerShellAdditionalExePaths” setting in the workspace configuration. When enumerating these executables (in **src/platform.ts**), the supplied paths are only minimally preprocessed by stripping surrounding quotes (using the `stripQuotePair` utility) and via `untildify`. An attacker who supplies a specially crafted mapping through a malicious .vscode/settings.json can force the extension to register an arbitrary executable path. If the user later selects that installation—or if it is auto–selected—the extension may inadvertently launch attacker–controlled code instead of a trusted PowerShell executable.
  - **Impact:**
    - Launching an attacker–controlled executable in place of a genuine PowerShell session can result in arbitrary code execution under the user’s privileges.
    - This may lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or further infection through installation of malicious software.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code verifies that each supplied executable path exists (via functions like `checkIfFileExists`) and performs basic string processing (by stripping quotes and calling `untildify`).
    - However, no check is made to ensure that the supplied path lies within a trusted directory or is from a trusted source.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The extension should restrict additional executable paths to trusted locations—for example, by enforcing a whitelist of directories or by rejecting paths that do not reside within the workspace/trusted folders.
    - More robust sanitization and validation of the supplied executable paths should be implemented beyond just checking for file–existence.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to supply a malicious .vscode/settings.json file that sets “powerShellAdditionalExePaths” to include a mapping to a malicious executable.
    - The user must then open the malicious workspace and, either through auto–selection or manual choice, cause the extension to use the attacker–provided executable.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In **src/platform.ts**, within the method `enumerateAdditionalPowerShellInstallations`, the extension processes user–supplied executable paths by calling `stripQuotePair` and `untildify`.
    - There is no subsequent boundary check ensuring that the resulting absolute path is confined to a trusted directory.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a workspace that includes a malicious .vscode/settings.json in which “powerShellAdditionalExePaths” is configured to map a label (e.g. “Attack”) to a path such as “C:\temp\malicious.exe.” Ensure that a test executable (or simulation thereof) is present at that location.
    2. **Trigger:** Open the malicious workspace in VS Code so that the extension enumerates available PowerShell installations.
    3. **Observation:** Verify that the candidate executable list includes the attacker–configured entry (e.g. labeled “Attack” with path “C:\temp\malicious.exe”).
    4. **Result:** Demonstrate that if this executable is subsequently launched—either by user selection or auto–selection—it would lead to arbitrary code execution.
