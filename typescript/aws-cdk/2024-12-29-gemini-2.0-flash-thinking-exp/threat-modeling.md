*   **Threat:** Hardcoded Secrets in CDK Code
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's codebase (e.g., through a compromised developer machine or version control system) and discovers sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or private keys directly embedded within the CDK code. They can then use these credentials to access protected resources or impersonate legitimate users/services.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for data breaches, ability to compromise other systems or services using the exposed credentials.
    *   **Affected CDK Component:** General CDK code, specifically within the constructs where resources are defined and configured (e.g., when setting environment variables, connection strings, or API keys directly).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and retrieve sensitive information.
        *   Employ CDK constructs like `SecretValue.secretsManager()` or `StringParameter.valueFromLookup()` to fetch secrets during deployment.
        *   Avoid hardcoding any sensitive data directly in the CDK code.
        *   Implement code review processes to identify and remove any accidentally hardcoded secrets.
        *   Use static analysis tools like `cdk-nag` to scan CDK code for potential secrets.

*   **Threat:** Overly Permissive IAM Roles and Policies Defined in CDK
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits IAM roles or policies defined in the CDK code that grant excessive permissions to deployed resources. This allows them to perform actions beyond what is necessary for the application to function, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or resource manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to AWS resources, ability to modify or delete critical infrastructure components, potential for data breaches or denial of service.
    *   **Affected CDK Component:** `aws-cdk-lib.aws_iam.Role`, `aws-cdk-lib.aws_iam.PolicyStatement`, and other IAM-related constructs used to define permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining IAM roles and policies. Grant only the necessary permissions required for each resource.
        *   Utilize CDK's IAM policy generation features to create more granular and specific permissions.
        *   Employ tools like `cdk-nag` to identify overly permissive IAM policies.
        *   Regularly review and refine IAM policies defined in CDK as application requirements evolve.
        *   Consider using AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify unused or excessive permissions.

*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration of CDK Constructs Leading to Insecure Resources
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations in the AWS resources provisioned by CDK due to incorrect or insecure settings within the CDK constructs. Examples include S3 buckets with public read access, security groups with overly permissive inbound rules, or unencrypted data storage.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches due to exposed resources, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for resource hijacking or abuse.
    *   **Affected CDK Component:** Various CDK constructs representing AWS resources (e.g., `aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.Bucket`, `aws-cdk-lib.aws_ec2.SecurityGroup`, `aws-cdk-lib.aws_rds.DatabaseInstance`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the resource and the sensitivity of the data)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand the security implications of each CDK construct and its configuration options.
        *   Utilize CDK's built-in security features and best practices (e.g., setting `blockPublicAccesses` for S3 buckets).
        *   Employ static analysis tools like `cdk-nag` to identify potential misconfigurations.
        *   Implement code review processes to catch configuration errors before deployment.
        *   Use infrastructure testing frameworks to validate the security configuration of deployed resources.

*   **Threat:** Compromised CI/CD Pipeline Used for CDK Deployments
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline used to deploy CDK stacks (e.g., through stolen credentials or a vulnerability in the CI/CD system). They can then inject malicious code into the deployment process, modify infrastructure configurations, or deploy backdoors into the application's infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable infrastructure, unauthorized access to AWS resources, potential for complete compromise of the application and its data.
    *   **Affected CDK Component:** The deployment process orchestrated by the CI/CD pipeline, which interacts with the CDK CLI and AWS CloudFormation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the CI/CD pipeline with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
        *   Implement code signing and verification for CDK deployments to ensure only trusted code is deployed.
        *   Regularly audit the CI/CD pipeline for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dedicated deployment roles with the least necessary permissions for deploying CDK stacks.
        *   Implement segregation of duties for deployment processes.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the AWS CDK Library Itself
    *   **Description:** Like any software, the AWS CDK library itself could contain security vulnerabilities. If such vulnerabilities are discovered, attackers could potentially exploit them during the development or deployment process.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for attackers to compromise the development environment or the deployed infrastructure by exploiting vulnerabilities in the CDK library.
    *   **Affected CDK Component:** The AWS CDK library itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the AWS CDK CLI and library updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
        *   Monitor AWS security advisories and release notes for any reported vulnerabilities in CDK.
        *   Follow security best practices for software development and dependency management.
