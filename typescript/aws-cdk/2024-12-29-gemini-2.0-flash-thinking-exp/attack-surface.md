Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve AWS CDK, focusing on high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Supply Chain Attacks on CDK Dependencies**
    *   **Description:** Malicious code is introduced through compromised or vulnerable npm packages used as CDK constructs or dependencies.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** CDK projects heavily rely on npm packages for defining infrastructure. A compromised dependency can inject malicious code that executes during CDK synthesis or deployment, or even within the deployed resources.
    *   **Example:** A popular third-party CDK construct library is compromised, and a malicious update is published. Developers using this library unknowingly include the malicious code in their CDK application, leading to the deployment of backdoors in their infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities, backdoors, data exfiltration, or resource manipulation in the deployed infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit and review project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Pin dependency versions in `package.json` and avoid using wildcard or range versioning.
        *   Consider using a private npm registry to control and vet dependencies.
        *   Be cautious when using third-party CDK constructs and evaluate their trustworthiness and maintenance.

*   **Attack Surface: Secrets Management in CDK Code**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, database credentials) is inadvertently hardcoded or insecurely managed within CDK code.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** While CDK encourages using secure secret management services, developers might still accidentally embed secrets directly in their code or configuration files when defining infrastructure.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes a database password directly into a CDK construct defining an RDS instance. This password is then exposed in the version control system and potentially in the generated CloudFormation template.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to resources and potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode secrets directly in CDK code.
        *   Utilize AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and retrieve secrets.
        *   Use CDK's built-in mechanisms for referencing secrets from these services.
        *   Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent committing secrets.
        *   Regularly scan code repositories for accidentally committed secrets.

*   **Attack Surface: Overly Permissive Deployment Roles**
    *   **Description:** The IAM role used by the CDK for deployment has excessive permissions, allowing an attacker who compromises this role to perform actions beyond what is necessary.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** CDK deployments require an IAM role with permissions to create and manage AWS resources. The way this role is defined within the CDK code directly impacts its permissions. If defined too broadly, it increases the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** The CDK deployment role has `AdministratorAccess` policy attached. If this role is compromised, an attacker can create new IAM users, delete resources, or access sensitive data across the entire AWS account.
    *   **Impact:** Full or significant control over the AWS account, data breaches, resource deletion, and service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining the CDK deployment role.
        *   Grant only the necessary permissions required for the specific CDK application and its resources.
        *   Use fine-grained IAM policies and avoid broad wildcard permissions.
        *   Regularly review and refine the permissions of the deployment role.
        *   Consider using separate deployment roles for different environments or stages.

*   **Attack Surface: CloudFormation Template Manipulation (Pre-Deployment)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the generated CloudFormation template (within `cdk.out`) before deployment and modifies it to introduce malicious resources or configurations.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** CDK generates CloudFormation templates as an intermediary step. If the `cdk.out` directory, where these templates are stored, is not properly secured, the generated templates can be tampered with before deployment.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `cdk.out` directory on a build server and modifies the generated CloudFormation template to add a publicly accessible EC2 instance with a backdoor before the deployment is executed.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised infrastructure, introduction of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or unauthorized access points.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the build environment and restrict access to the `cdk.out` directory.
        *   Implement integrity checks or signing for the generated CloudFormation templates.
        *   Use secure CI/CD pipelines with proper access controls.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the CDK code that could be exposed in the generated template.
