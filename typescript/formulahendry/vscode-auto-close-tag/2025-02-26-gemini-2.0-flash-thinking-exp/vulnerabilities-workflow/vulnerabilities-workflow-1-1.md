### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Incorrect Tag Closure within JavaScript String Literals in HTML Attributes due to Inadequate Context Awareness
- Description:
    The "Auto Close Tag" extension uses regular expressions and a simple quote counting mechanism to identify tag boundaries and prevent closing tag insertion within string literals. This approach is insufficient for complex scenarios, especially JavaScript string literals embedded within HTML attributes. The extension can be tricked into incorrectly inserting closing tags inside these JavaScript strings. This leads to syntax errors and potentially disrupts JavaScript code execution when the HTML attribute is processed by a browser or JavaScript engine.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Open a file in VS Code with a language mode supported by the extension, such as HTML or JSX.
    2. Type or paste HTML code that includes an HTML attribute which contains a JavaScript string literal. For example: `<div onclick="alert('<p>')"></div>`.
    3. Place the text cursor immediately after the closing bracket `>` of a tag-like string within the JavaScript literal, such as after the `>` in `<p>` in the example.
    4. Type the character `/`.
    5. Observe that the extension incorrectly inserts a closing tag, attempting to close the HTML-like string within the JavaScript literal.

- Impact:
    Code corruption and potential runtime errors. Incorrectly inserted closing tags within JavaScript string literals can break the syntax of the JavaScript code. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the HTML is rendered or the JavaScript is executed. This could manifest as JavaScript errors, broken functionality, or in more subtle cases, incorrect application logic.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The extension attempts to avoid inserting tags in strings by counting quotes using `occurrenceCount` function and checking if the count of single quotes, double quotes, and backticks is even. This mitigation is insufficient and can be bypassed in cases of JavaScript string literals within HTML attributes.

- Missing Mitigations:
    The extension needs a more robust and context-aware parsing mechanism. Missing mitigations include:
    - Implementing a dedicated HTML parser to correctly understand the HTML document structure, differentiating between HTML tags, attributes, and JavaScript code within attributes.
    - Integrating a JavaScript parser to accurately identify string literals within JavaScript code segments embedded in HTML attributes.
    - Alternatively, improving the quote detection logic to handle escaped quotes and different types of string delimiters more accurately would be a less comprehensive but still helpful mitigation.

- Preconditions:
    1. VS Code with the "Auto Close Tag" extension installed and enabled.
    2. A file type supported by the extension is open (e.g., HTML, JSX).
    3. The user is editing HTML code that contains JavaScript event handlers or attributes with JavaScript string literals.
    4. The JavaScript string literal contains a string that resembles an HTML opening tag.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. The vulnerability is located in the `insertAutoCloseTag` function in `/code/src/extension.ts`.
    2. The function uses a regular expression `/ <([_a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9:\-_.]*)(?:\s+[^<>]*?[^\s/<>=]+?)*?\s?(\/|>)$/` to detect tags for auto-closing.
    3. It attempts to prevent incorrect closing inside strings using a simple quote counting mechanism: `((occurrenceCount(result[0], "'") % 2 === 0) && (occurrenceCount(result[0], "\"") % 2 === 0) && (occurrenceCount(result[0], "`") % 2 === 0))`.
    4. This quote counting is insufficient to handle JavaScript string literals within HTML attributes because it does not understand the context of HTML attributes and JavaScript strings.
    5. When the user types `/` after a tag-like string within a JavaScript literal in an HTML attribute, the regex incorrectly identifies it as a tag and the insufficient quote check fails to prevent the incorrect closing tag insertion.

    ```typescript
    function insertAutoCloseTag(event: vscode.TextDocumentChangeEvent): void {
        // ...
        if (((!isSublimeText3Mode || isFullMode) && isRightAngleBracket) ||
            (enableAutoCloseSelfClosingTag && event.contentChanges[0].text === "/")) {
            let textLine = editor.document.lineAt(selection.start);
            let text = textLine.text.substring(0, selection.start.character + 1);
            let result = /<([_a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9:\-_.]*)(?:\s+[^<>]*?[^\s/<>=]+?)*?\s?(\/|>)$/.exec(text); // Regex for tag detection
            if (result !== null && ((occurrenceCount(result[0], "'") % 2 === 0) // Quote counting logic
                && (occurrenceCount(result[0], "\"") % 2 === 0) && (occurrenceCount(result[0], "`") % 2 === 0))) {
                if (result[2] === ">") {
                    if (excludedTags.indexOf(result[1].toLowerCase()) === -1) {
                        editor.edit((editBuilder) => {
                            editBuilder.insert(originalPosition, "</" + result[1] + ">"); // Incorrect closing tag insertion
                        }).then(() => {
                            editor.selection = new vscode.Selection(originalPosition, originalPosition);
                        });
                    }
                } // ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Open VS Code.
    2. Create a new file (e.g., `test.html`).
    3. Set the language mode of the file to HTML or JSX.
    4. Paste the following HTML code into the editor:
        ```html
        <div onclick="alert('<p>')"></div>
        ```
    5. Place the cursor right after the closing bracket `>` within the `<p>` tag string in the `alert()` attribute: `<div onclick="alert('<p>█')"></div>` (where █ represents the cursor).
    6. Type `/`.
    7. Observe the code after the extension's action.

    Expected Result: The extension should not insert a closing tag, and the code should remain unchanged:
        ```html
        <div onclick="alert('<p>')"></div>
        ```

    Vulnerable Result: The extension incorrectly inserts a closing tag, modifying the code to something like:
        ```html
        <div onclick="alert('</p><p>')"></div>
        ```
        or
        ```html
        <div onclick="alert('<p></p>')"></div>
        ```
        or similar variations, demonstrating the vulnerability by breaking the JavaScript string literal and potentially the HTML structure.
