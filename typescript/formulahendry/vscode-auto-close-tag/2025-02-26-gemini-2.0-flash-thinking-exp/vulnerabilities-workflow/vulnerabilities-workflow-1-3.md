### Vulnerability List for Auto Close Tag Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Malicious Tag Name Injection

* Description:
    The Auto Close Tag extension allows a wide range of characters in HTML/XML tag names, including backticks (` `), due to the permissive regular expression used to parse tag names. By crafting a malicious tag name containing special characters, an attacker could potentially inject unexpected content or trigger unintended behavior in systems that process documents created or edited with this extension.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. Open a file in VSCode where the Auto Close Tag extension is active (e.g., plaintext, XML).
    2. Type an opening tag with a malicious name containing backticks, for example: `<tag``>`.
    3. Observe that the extension automatically inserts a closing tag that also includes the backticks: `</tag``>`.

* Impact:
    The primary impact is the potential for creating documents with non-standard or malicious tag names. If these documents are processed by other systems (e.g., web browsers, XML parsers, other extensions, or custom scripts) that are not designed to handle such tag names, it could lead to:
        -  Parsing errors in downstream systems.
        -  Unexpected behavior or misinterpretation of the document content.
        -  Potential for secondary injection vulnerabilities in systems that process these documents if they are not properly sanitized.
    While the immediate impact within VS Code itself might be low, the risk arises from the interaction with external systems that might process the generated documents.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The extension currently uses a regular expression that allows a broad range of characters in tag names.

* Missing mitigations:
    Input validation and sanitization for tag names. The extension should restrict the allowed characters in tag names to a safer subset, or sanitize tag names to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before inserting the closing tag. A more restrictive regular expression for tag names should be used. For standard HTML/XML, the allowed characters in tag names are well-defined and can be enforced.

* Preconditions:
    1. VSCode with the Auto Close Tag extension installed and enabled.
    2. The extension must be active for the current file type (either enabled by default or configured via `auto-close-tag.activationOnLanguage`).
    3. User must type an opening tag with a malicious tag name containing backticks or other potentially harmful characters.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **`extension.ts` - `insertAutoCloseTag` function:**
        - The function is triggered on `onDidChangeTextDocument` event.
        - It uses the following regex to identify tags: `/<([_a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9:\-_.]*)(?:\s+[^<>]*?[^\s/<>=]+?)*?\s?(\/|>)$/`
        - This regex, specifically `[_a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9:\-_.]*`, defines the allowed characters in tag names. It includes `_`, `a-zA-Z`, `0-9`, `:`, `-`, `_`, and `.`.  Notably, it *does not* explicitly exclude backticks or other potentially problematic characters.

    2. **`extension.ts` - `getCloseTag` function:**
        - This function also uses a similar regex to find tags in the text: `/<(\/?[_a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9:\-_.]*)(?:\s+[^<>]*?[^\s/<>=]+?)*?\s?>/g`
        - Again, the tag name part `[_a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9:\-_.]*` is permissive and allows characters beyond standard HTML/XML tag names.

    3. **Visualization:**
        ```
        insertAutoCloseTag (event) --> uses regex to match opening tag with permissive tag name pattern --> extracts tag name --> inserts closing tag with the same (potentially malicious) name
        getCloseTag (text, excludedTags) --> uses regex to find tags with permissive tag name pattern --> stack-based logic to find unclosed tags --> returns closing tag name based on the permissive pattern
        ```
    4. **Code Snippet:**
       ```typescript
       function insertAutoCloseTag(event: vscode.TextDocumentChangeEvent): void {
           // ...
           let textLine = editor.document.lineAt(selection.start);
           let text = textLine.text.substring(0, selection.start.character + 1);
           let result = /<([_a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9:\-_.]*)(?:\s+[^<>]*?[^\s/<>=]+?)*?\s?(\/|>)$/.exec(text); // Permissive regex
           if (result !== null && /* ... */) {
               if (result[2] === ">") {
                   if (excludedTags.indexOf(result[1].toLowerCase()) === -1) {
                       editor.edit((editBuilder) => {
                           editBuilder.insert(originalPosition, "</" + result[1] + ">"); // Inserts closing tag with extracted name
                       }).then(() => {
                           editor.selection = new vscode.Selection(originalPosition, originalPosition);
                       });
                   }
               }
               // ...
           }
           // ...
       }
       ```

* Security test case:
    1. Install the "Auto Close Tag" extension in VSCode.
    2. Open a new plaintext file in VSCode.
    3. Ensure that the `auto-close-tag.enableAutoCloseTag` setting is set to `true`. (default)
    4. Type the following opening tag: `<malicious``tag>` (note the backticks in the tag name).
    5. Observe that the extension automatically inserts the closing tag: `</malicious``tag>`.
    6. Save the file as `test.txt`.
    7. Open the `test.txt` file in a web browser or attempt to parse it with an XML parser.
    8. Check if the presence of backticks in the tag name causes parsing errors or unexpected behavior in the processing system. For example, in a browser, inspect the DOM to see how the browser handles the non-standard tag. In an XML parser, check for validation errors.
    9. If errors or unexpected behavior are observed in downstream systems due to the malicious tag name, the vulnerability is confirmed.
