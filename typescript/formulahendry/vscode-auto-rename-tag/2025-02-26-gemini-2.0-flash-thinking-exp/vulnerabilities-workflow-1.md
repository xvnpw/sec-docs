Here is a combined list of vulnerabilities, formatted as markdown, based on the provided information.

### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Incorrect Tag Renaming due to Improper Handling of Nested Curly Braces in JSX/TSX

  - **Description:**
    1. The `MultiLineStream.advanceUntilEitherChar` function in `/code/packages/service/src/htmlScanner/MultiLineStream.ts` scans input text and advances the stream until specific characters.
    2. For React code (JSX/TSX), it skips content within curly braces `{}` using a `stackSize` variable to track nesting.
    3. Incorrect `stackSize` management with deeply nested or malformed curly braces can lead to miscalculated tag boundaries.
    4. This can cause `doAutoRenameTag` in `/code/packages/service/src/doAutoRenameTag.ts` to identify incorrect tag pairs for renaming.
    5. Consequently, renaming a tag might incorrectly rename its pair or even rename a tag in an unrelated part of the document.
    6. An attacker can craft malicious JSX/TSX files with nested curly braces to exploit this. Opening and editing this file with "Auto Rename Tag" enabled could cause unintended code modifications due to incorrect tag renaming.

  - **Impact:**
    - High: Incorrect tag renaming can introduce subtle bugs, especially in complex JSX/TSX structures, leading to unexpected application behavior and potential security issues if critical functionalities are affected. In severe cases, it could corrupt code logic significantly by renaming tags outside the intended scope.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the code files specifically address nested curly brace handling in the scanner. Existing test cases in `/code/packages/extension-test/src/basic/autoRenameTag.test.ts` do not specifically target complex nested JSX structures that could expose this vulnerability. The test suite covers basic tag renaming across languages and scenarios but lacks specific coverage for deeply nested curly braces within JSX/TSX tags.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement comprehensive unit tests in `/code/packages/service/src/htmlScanner/MultiLineStream.ts` focusing on edge cases and deeply nested curly brace scenarios in JSX/TSX.
    - Review and refactor the curly brace handling logic in `MultiLineStream.advanceUntilEitherChar` to ensure correct `stackSize` management and prevent miscalculation of tag boundaries in complex JSX/TSX structures.
    - Consider adding input validation or sanitization in the server-side `doAutoRenameTag` function to handle potentially malicious tag inputs and prevent unexpected renaming behavior.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The victim must have the "Auto Rename Tag" extension installed and enabled in VSCode.
    - The victim must open a malicious JSX/TSX file crafted by the attacker in VSCode.
    - The victim must trigger the tag renaming functionality by editing a tag in the malicious file.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/packages/service/src/htmlScanner/MultiLineStream.ts`
    2. **Function:** `advanceUntilEitherChar`
    3. **React Specific Logic:**
       ```typescript
       if (isReact) {
           if (this.source[this.position] === '{') {
             let stackSize = 1;
             while (++this.position < this.source.length) {
               if (this.source[this.position] === '{') {
                 stackSize++;
               } else if (this.source[this.position] === '}') {
                 stackSize--;
                 if (stackSize === 0) {
                   this.position++;
                   break;
                 }
               }
             }
           } else if (this.source[this.position] === '}') {
             return false;
           }
         }
       ```
    4. **Analysis:** The nested `while` loop and `stackSize` management are critical. Errors in incrementing/decrementing `stackSize` or in the loop condition could cause premature loop exit or continuation beyond intended boundaries. This is especially true for unbalanced curly braces or specific sequences of braces and other characters.
    5. **Incorrect Position:** An incorrect `this.position` due to flawed curly brace handling will disrupt subsequent parsing by the scanner.
    6. **Impact on Tag Renaming:**  Incorrect tokenization from the scanner leads to incorrect tag renaming in `doAutoRenameTag`.
    7. **Code Status:** The curly brace handling logic in `MultiLineStream.advanceUntilEitherChar` remains unchanged. Robustness against complex or malformed nested structures is still a concern. No improvements to this specific section are observed.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create `malicious.jsx`.
    2. Insert the following code:
       ```jsx
       const MaliciousComponent = () => {
         return (
           <div>
             <Component
               prop1={() => {return {nested: {value: 'test'}}}}
             >
               <span className="original-tag">This is the original span</span>
             </Component>
             <div className="unrelated-div">This is an unrelated div</div>
           </div>
         );
       };
       ```
    3. Open `malicious.jsx` in VSCode with "Auto Rename Tag" enabled.
    4. Place cursor at the end of opening `<span>` tag: `<span|>className="original-tag">This is the original span</span>`.
    5. Type `1` to rename to `span1`.
    6. Observe if closing `</span>` is renamed to `</span1>`.
    7. **Expected Behavior:** Only `<span>` tags should rename to `<span>1` and `</span1>`. `<div>` and `<Component>` tags remain unchanged.
    8. **Vulnerable Behavior (Potential):** Incorrect nested curly brace handling may misinterpret tag structure, leading to:
        - Closing `</span>` tag not being renamed.
        - Incorrect tag renaming, such as unrelated `<div>` or `<Component>` tags.
        - Errors or unexpected extension behavior.
    9. **Verification:** Check if closing `</span>` is correctly renamed to `</span1>` and no other tags are unexpectedly renamed. Incorrect renaming indicates a vulnerability in nested curly brace handling.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Regular Expression Injection in the Tag Renaming Function

  - **Description:**
    The `doAutoRenameTag` function in `/packages/service/src/doAutoRenameTag.ts` determines the new tag name for renaming. When the new tag doesn't start with `</`, it extracts the "old tag name" from `oldWord` (using `oldWord.slice(1)`) and constructs a regular expression:
    ```js
    const match = text.slice(scanner.stream.position)
      .match(new RegExp(`</${oldTagName}`));
    ```
    Without escaping or sanitization of `oldTagName`, an attacker controlling `oldWord` can inject regex metacharacters, causing:
    - Unintended pattern matching (renaming wrong text)
    - Performance issues from catastrophic backtracking
    - Potentially corrupt document tag structure.

  - **Impact:**
    In malicious auto-rename-tag requests, unintended regex behavior can cause incorrect tag renaming. Crafted documents or requests could corrupt user's HTML/XML via unexpected text replacements. Worst-case: catastrophic backtracking freezes or crashes the extension process.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No escaping or input validation is applied to `oldTagName` before RegExp construction.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Escape all regex metacharacters in `oldTagName` before RegExp construction.
    - Validate `oldWord` against expected patterns (e.g., standard HTML tag name) before renaming.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker must be able to manipulate auto-rename-tag requests or crafted documents where `oldWord` is controlled.
    - Extension must process the renaming request, creating the unsanitized regex when user triggers tag rename.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/packages/service/src/doAutoRenameTag.ts`:
      ```js
      const oldTagName = oldWord.slice(1);
      ```
      and later:
      ```js
      const match = text.slice(scanner.stream.position).match(new RegExp(`</${oldTagName}`));
      ```
    - `oldTagName` is used directly in RegExp without sanitization. Special regex characters in `oldTagName` (parentheses, plus signs, quantifiers) become part of the regex, potentially changing simple literal matching to complex patterns with backtracking.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a test HTML document (e.g., `<div>...</div>`).
    2. Invoke `doAutoRenameTag` with:
       - `oldWord`: String starting with `<` and malicious regex (e.g., `<(a+)+`).
       - `newWord`: Corresponding new tag string (e.g., `<(other)>`).
    3. Measure if RegExp behaves unexpectedly (slow execution, wrong match).
    4. Verify that after escaping/validation, function matches valid tag names and behaves as expected.
