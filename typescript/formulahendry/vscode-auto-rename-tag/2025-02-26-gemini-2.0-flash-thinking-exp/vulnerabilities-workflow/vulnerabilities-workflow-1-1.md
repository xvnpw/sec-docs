### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Incorrect Tag Renaming due to Improper Handling of Nested Curly Braces in JSX/TSX
- Description:
    1. The `MultiLineStream.advanceUntilEitherChar` function in `/code/packages/service/src/htmlScanner/MultiLineStream.ts` is responsible for scanning the input text and advancing the stream until it encounters specific characters.
    2. When handling React code (JSX/TSX), this function includes logic to skip content within curly braces `{}` to correctly parse expressions within tags. This logic uses a `stackSize` variable to track nested curly braces.
    3. If the `stackSize` is not correctly managed when encountering deeply nested or malformed curly braces in JSX/TSX, the scanner might incorrectly calculate tag boundaries.
    4. This can lead to `doAutoRenameTag` in `/code/packages/service/src/doAutoRenameTag.ts` to identify incorrect tag pairs for renaming.
    5. As a result, when a user renames a tag, the paired tag might not be renamed correctly, or even worse, a wrong tag in a completely unrelated part of the document might be renamed.
    6. An attacker could craft a malicious JSX/TSX file with specific nested structures of curly braces to exploit this vulnerability. When a developer opens and edits this file with the "Auto Rename Tag" extension enabled, the attacker could cause unintended modifications in the code by triggering incorrect tag renaming.

- Impact:
    - High: Incorrect renaming of tags can lead to subtle bugs in the code, especially in complex JSX/TSX structures. This could cause unexpected behavior in the application and potential security issues if the renamed tags affect critical functionalities. In a worst-case scenario, if the vulnerability leads to renaming tags outside of the intended scope, it could corrupt the code logic significantly.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code files specifically addressing nested curly brace handling in the scanner. The existing test cases in `/code/packages/extension-test/src/basic/autoRenameTag.test.ts` and the newly provided test cases in the same file do not specifically target complex nested JSX structures that could expose this vulnerability.  The test suite focuses on basic tag renaming functionality across various languages and scenarios, including different tag structures, attributes, comments, and edge cases, but lacks specific coverage for deeply nested curly braces within JSX/TSX tags.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement more robust and comprehensive unit tests in `/code/packages/service/src/htmlScanner/MultiLineStream.ts` specifically targeting edge cases and deeply nested scenarios with curly braces in JSX/TSX.
    - Review and refactor the curly brace handling logic in `MultiLineStream.advanceUntilEitherChar` to ensure correct `stackSize` management and prevent miscalculation of tag boundaries in complex JSX/TSX structures.
    - Consider adding input validation or sanitization in the server-side `doAutoRenameTag` function to handle potentially malicious tag inputs and prevent unexpected renaming behavior.
- Preconditions:
    - The victim must have the "Auto Rename Tag" extension installed and enabled in VSCode.
    - The victim must open a malicious JSX/TSX file crafted by the attacker in VSCode.
    - The victim must trigger the tag renaming functionality by editing a tag in the malicious file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/packages/service/src/htmlScanner/MultiLineStream.ts`**
    2. **Function: `advanceUntilEitherChar`**
    3. Locate the React specific logic within the `while` loop:
    ```typescript
    if (isReact) {
        if (this.source[this.position] === '{') {
          let stackSize = 1;
          while (++this.position < this.source.length) {
            if (this.source[this.position] === '{') {
              stackSize++;
            } else if (this.source[this.position] === '}') {
              stackSize--;
              if (stackSize === 0) {
                this.position++;
                break;
              }
            }
          }
        } else if (this.source[this.position] === '}') {
          return false;
        }
      }
    ```
    4. Analyze the nested `while` loop and `stackSize` management. If there's an error in incrementing or decrementing `stackSize`, or in the loop condition, it could lead to exiting the loop prematurely or continuing past the intended boundary. For example, if the code does not correctly handle cases with unbalanced curly braces or specific sequences of braces and other characters, it could lead to `this.position` being set to an incorrect value.
    5. This incorrect `this.position` will then affect subsequent parsing by the scanner, leading to incorrect tokenization and ultimately incorrect tag renaming in `doAutoRenameTag`.
    6. The provided code in `MultiLineStream.ts` within the `advanceUntilEitherChar` function remains unchanged and the logic for handling nested curly braces is still present as described in the initial vulnerability report. This logic is crucial for correctly parsing JSX/TSX but remains a potential area for vulnerabilities if not robust enough to handle complex or malformed nested structures. No modifications or improvements to this specific section are observed in the current code files.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new JSX/TSX file, e.g., `malicious.jsx`.
    2. Insert the following malicious code into `malicious.jsx`. This code contains nested curly braces within a JSX tag, designed to potentially confuse the scanner:
    ```jsx
    const MaliciousComponent = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <Component
            prop1={() => {return {nested: {value: 'test'}}}}
          >
            <span className="original-tag">This is the original span</span>
          </Component>
          <div className="unrelated-div">This is an unrelated div</div>
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```
    3. Open `malicious.jsx` in VSCode with the "Auto Rename Tag" extension enabled.
    4. Place the cursor at the end of the opening `<span>` tag: `<span|>className="original-tag">This is the original span</span>`.
    5. Type `1` to rename the tag to `span1`.
    6. Observe if the closing `</span>` tag is correctly renamed to `</span1>`.
    7. **Expected Behavior (Without Vulnerability):** Only the `<span>` tags should be renamed to `<span>1` and `</span1>`. The `<div>` and `<Component>` tags should remain unchanged.
    8. **Vulnerable Behavior (Potential):** Due to incorrect handling of nested curly braces, the scanner might misinterpret the tag structure. This could result in:
        - The closing `</span>` tag not being renamed.
        - An incorrect tag, such as the unrelated `<div>` tag or even the `<Component>` tag, being renamed instead of or in addition to the `<span>` tags.
        - Error or unexpected behavior in the extension.
    9. Check if the closing `</span>` is correctly renamed to `</span1>` and that no other tags are unexpectedly renamed. If other tags are renamed, or the closing tag is not updated, it indicates a vulnerability in handling nested curly braces.
