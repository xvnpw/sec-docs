## Vulnerability List

There are no new valid high-rank vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that are exploitable by an external attacker and are not DoS or explicitly insecure code patterns.

It's important to note that while no high-rank vulnerabilities are immediately apparent, a more in-depth security audit, including dynamic analysis and fuzzing, might reveal less obvious issues.

Based on the files provided and the constraints given, the project appears to be reasonably secure in its current form regarding external attacker threats and high-rank vulnerabilities, excluding DoS and insecure code patterns explicitly used by developers.
