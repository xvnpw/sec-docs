- **Vulnerability Name:** Regular Expression Injection in the Tag Renaming Function

  - **Description:**
    The function `doAutoRenameTag` (found in *packages/service/src/doAutoRenameTag.ts*) is invoked by the auto–rename–tag logic to determine the new tag name for renaming. In the branch where the new tag does not start with a closing tag sign (`</`), the function extracts the “old tag name” from the supplied `oldWord` (by doing `oldWord.slice(1)`) and then constructs a new regular expression by using:
    ```js
    const match = text.slice(scanner.stream.position)
      .match(new RegExp(`</${oldTagName}`));
    ```
    Because no escaping or sanitization is performed on `oldTagName`, an attacker who is able to supply a malicious value for `oldWord` may inject unexpected regular expression metacharacters. This can lead to:
    - Unintended pattern matching (so that the function renames the wrong text)
    - Performance problems caused by catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine
    - In some cases, errant behavior that could potentially corrupt the document’s tag structure.

  - **Impact:**
    In a scenario where a malicious auto–rename–tag request is supplied, the unintended regular expression behavior may cause incorrect renaming of tags. An attacker (or a craftily prepared document) could corrupt the user’s HTML/XML by triggering unexpected text replacements. In worst–case scenarios, if the regex engine goes into catastrophic backtracking, it could freeze or crash the extension’s process.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    There is no escaping or input validation applied to `oldTagName` before it is interpolated into the RegExp constructor.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Escape all regular expression metacharacters in `oldTagName` before inserting it into a new RegExp.
    - Validate that the provided `oldWord` follows an expected pattern (for example, matches a standard HTML tag name) before using it for renaming.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply a manipulated auto–rename–tag request (or include a crafted document) where the `oldWord` parameter is under attacker control.
    - The extension must process the renaming request (e.g. when the user triggers a tag rename in a file) so that the unsanitized regular expression is created.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In *packages/service/src/doAutoRenameTag.ts*, the code extracts:
      ```js
      const oldTagName = oldWord.slice(1);
      ```
      and later uses it directly in:
      ```js
      const match = text.slice(scanner.stream.position).match(new RegExp(`</${oldTagName}`));
      ```
    - Because `oldTagName` is not processed to remove or escape special regex characters, any unexpected characters (such as parentheses, plus signs, or other quantifiers) become part of the regular expression. This could, for example, change a simple literal match into one that uses a nested capturing group with greedy quantifiers.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prepare a test document that contains valid HTML (for example, `<div>...</div>`).
    2. Invoke the auto–rename–tag request by calling `doAutoRenameTag` with parameters such that:
       - `oldWord` is set to a string starting with `<` and then containing malicious regex syntax (for example, `<(a+)+`).
       - `newWord` is set to a corresponding new tag string (such as `<(other)>` or similar).
    3. Measure whether the RegExp constructed by the function behaves unexpectedly (for example, by taking much longer to execute or by returning a wrong match).
    4. Verify that after applying proper escaping (or input validation) the function instead only matches valid tag names and behaves as expected.
