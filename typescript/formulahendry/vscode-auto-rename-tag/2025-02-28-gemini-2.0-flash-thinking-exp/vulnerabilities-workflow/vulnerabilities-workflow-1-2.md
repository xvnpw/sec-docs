## Vulnerability List

There are no high or critical rank vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that meet the specified criteria.

After reviewing the code, focusing on potential issues introduced by the project itself and excluding those related to insecure user code, documentation, or denial of service, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank could be identified.

The project primarily deals with parsing and renaming HTML/XML tags, and while there might be potential for logic errors or edge cases in parsing, these do not translate to high-rank security vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers to cause significant impact beyond potentially incorrect tag renaming.

The changelog mentions "potential security vulnerabilities" fixed in past versions, but without further details or access to the vulnerable code, it's impossible to assess their nature or if any similar vulnerabilities persist in the current codebase.

Therefore, based on the provided files and constraints, the vulnerability list is empty.
