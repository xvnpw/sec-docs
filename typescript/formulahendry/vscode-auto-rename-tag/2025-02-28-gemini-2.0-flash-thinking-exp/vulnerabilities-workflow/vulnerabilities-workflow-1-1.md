### Vulnerability 1: Incorrect Tag Renaming due to Parsing Errors in Complex HTML Structures

- Description:
    The extension's tag renaming functionality relies on a custom scanner to parse HTML/XML-like text. In complex HTML structures, especially those with nested comments, unusual tag attributes, or specific character combinations, the scanner might misinterpret the document structure. This can lead to incorrect identification of paired tags and consequently, incorrect or unintended tag renaming. For example, carefully crafted HTML with nested comments or tags within attributes might confuse the scanner, causing it to rename the wrong tags or parts of the document.

    Steps to trigger:
    1. Open a file with HTML-like content in VSCode.
    2. Paste a crafted HTML content containing complex structures such as nested comments, tags within attributes, or unusual character combinations, designed to confuse the parser. Example:
       ```html
       <!-- <div> comment start
       <div class="attribute-with-tag">
         <p>Some text</p>
         <div id="nested-div">
           <!-- Another comment <div> -->
           <span>Content inside nested div</span>
         </div>
       </div>
       comment end -->
       <div>This div should be renamed correctly</div>
       ```
    3. Place the cursor inside the opening tag of the last `<div>` (the one that says "This div should be renamed correctly"), right after the 'v' in `<div>`.
    4. Type any character to trigger tag renaming (e.g., type 'v' to change `<div>` to `<divv>`).

- Impact:
    Incorrect tag renaming can lead to unintended modification of the user's code. In complex projects, this can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to detect and debug. It can also lead to data loss or corruption if the user relies on the auto-renaming feature and it modifies code in unexpected ways.

- Vulnerability rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None apparent in the provided code. The extension uses a custom regex-based scanner which is prone to parsing errors in complex scenarios.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **Robust HTML parsing library**: Replace the custom regex-based scanner with a well-vetted and robust HTML parsing library. This would significantly reduce the risk of parsing errors and improve the accuracy of tag renaming, especially in complex HTML structures.
    - **Input sanitization/validation**: Implement input validation or sanitization to preprocess the HTML content before parsing. This could involve stripping potentially problematic structures or characters that are known to cause parsing issues, although this approach might be less effective than using a dedicated parsing library.
    - **Comprehensive test suite**: Expand the test suite to include more test cases specifically designed to cover complex HTML structures, nested comments, unusual attribute combinations, and edge cases. This would help in identifying and fixing parsing errors proactively.

- Preconditions:
    - User has the "Auto Rename Tag" extension installed and enabled in VSCode.
    - User opens a file with HTML-like content that contains complex or intentionally crafted structures designed to confuse the parser.
    - User triggers the auto-rename tag functionality by modifying a tag name within the opened document.

- Source code analysis:
    1. `packages/service/src/doAutoRenameTag.ts`: This function orchestrates the tag renaming process. It utilizes `createScannerFast` to create a scanner for parsing the document text.
    2. `packages/service/src/htmlScanner/htmlScannerFast.ts`: This file contains the `createScannerFast` function, which is responsible for tokenizing the HTML content. It uses regular expressions (`htmlTagNameRE`, `htmlAttributeNameRE`, `htmlAttributeValueRE`) for token recognition. The scanner's state machine (`ScannerStateFast`) and token types (`TokenTypeFast`) are also defined here.
    3. `packages/service/src/htmlScanner/MultiLineStream.ts`: The `MultiLineStream` class handles the streaming of the input text and implements complex logic within `advanceUntilEitherChar` and `goBackUntilEitherChar` methods. These methods are crucial for navigating the HTML structure, skipping quotes, and handling matching tag pairs. The complexity of this custom stream implementation, especially in handling nested structures and edge cases, is a potential source of parsing vulnerabilities.
    4. `packages/service/src/util/getNextClosingTagName.ts` and `packages/service/src/util/getPreviousOpenTagName.ts`: These utility functions rely on the `ScannerFast` to locate the corresponding closing and opening tags, respectively. If the scanner misinterprets the HTML structure due to its limitations, these utilities will also fail to identify the correct tag pairs, leading to incorrect renaming.

    The vulnerability arises from the custom regex-based parsing approach, which is inherently less robust than using a dedicated HTML parser. The complexity in `MultiLineStream` to handle HTML-specific features increases the likelihood of parsing errors when encountering complex or malformed HTML structures.

- Security test case:
    1. Open VSCode.
    2. Create a new file named `vulnerable.html` or open an existing HTML file.
    3. Paste the following HTML code into the file:
       ```html
       <!-- <div> comment start
       <div class="attribute-with-tag">
         <p>Some text</p>
         <div id="nested-div">
           <!-- Another comment <div> -->
           <span>Content inside nested div</span>
         </div>
       </div>
       comment end -->
       <div>This div should be renamed correctly</div>
       ```
    4. Place the text cursor right after the letter 'v' in the opening `<div>` tag of the last line (line 9), so it looks like `<div|>This div should be renamed correctly</div>`.
    5. Type the character 'v'.
    6. Observe the changes made by the extension.

    - **Expected Correct Behavior**: Only the last `<div>` tag and its corresponding closing tag on line 9 should be renamed to `<divv>` and `</divv>`.
    - **Vulnerable Behavior**: The extension incorrectly renames other tags or parts of the code in addition to, or instead of, the intended last `<div>` tag. For example, it might rename tags within comments or attributes, or fail to rename the last `<div>` correctly, indicating a parsing error due to the complex HTML structure.

    If the test case exhibits "Vulnerable Behavior", it confirms the presence of the vulnerability where complex HTML structures can lead to incorrect tag renaming due to parsing errors in the extension's custom scanner.
