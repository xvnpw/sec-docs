### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Command Injection via Executor Map Configuration

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Executor Map Configuration
- **Description:**
    The Code Runner extension allows users to customize how code is executed through various configuration settings, including `code-runner.executorMap`, `code-runner.executorMapByGlob`, and `code-runner.executorMapByFileExtension`. These settings define the commands used to run code for specific languages, file globs, or file extensions. A malicious user can inject arbitrary commands into these executor settings. When the extension runs code, it uses these user-defined executor commands, leading to the execution of injected commands on the user's system.

    **Steps to Trigger:**
    1. An attacker gains the ability to modify the workspace or user settings of a victim's VS Code environment. This could be through:
        - Collaboration in a shared workspace where settings are shared.
        - Social engineering to trick the victim into importing malicious settings.
        - Potentially exploiting other VS Code extension vulnerabilities to modify settings (though this is less direct).
    2. The attacker modifies the `code-runner.executorMap`, `code-runner.executorMapByGlob`, or `code-runner.executorMapByFileExtension` settings. For example, they could modify the executor for "javascript" to include a malicious command like `node && touch /tmp/pwned` (on Linux/macOS) or `node && type nul > pwned.txt` (on Windows).
    3. The victim opens or creates a file of the language or file type corresponding to the modified executor (e.g., a JavaScript file if the "javascript" executor was modified).
    4. The victim executes the code using Code Runner (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+N` or using the "Run Code" command).
    5. The Code Runner extension uses the modified executor command from the settings, which now includes the attacker's injected command.
    6. The `child_process.spawn` function executes the entire command string, including the injected malicious command.

- **Impact:**
    Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can have severe consequences, including:
    - **Data Theft:** Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the user's system.
    - **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware, ransomware, or other malicious software.
    - **System Compromise:** Attackers can gain persistent access to the system, potentially leading to further exploitation and control.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** If VS Code is run with elevated privileges (less common, but possible in some environments), the attacker's code will also run with those privileges.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The Code Runner extension directly uses the executor commands defined in the configuration settings without any input validation or sanitization. The code in `codeManager.ts` retrieves the executor from the configuration and passes it directly to `child_process.spawn` with `shell: true`, which allows for shell command injection.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The extension should validate and sanitize executor commands from user settings to prevent command injection. This could involve:
        - Restricting allowed characters in executor paths and arguments.
        - Using parameterized commands or command arrays instead of constructing command strings from user input.
        - Whitelisting allowed commands or command patterns.
    - **Security Warnings:** Display a clear warning to users about the security risks of modifying executor settings, especially when working in shared workspaces or importing settings from untrusted sources.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Consider if running code with `shell: true` is always necessary. If not, explore safer alternatives for command execution that avoid shell interpretation, although this might be complex given the flexibility users expect.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to modify the VS Code settings (user or workspace) related to the Code Runner extension's executor configurations (`code-runner.executorMap`, `code-runner.executorMapByGlob`, `code-runner.executorMapByFileExtension`).
    - The victim must then use the Code Runner extension to execute code for a language or file type that uses the modified executor setting.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/src/codeManager.ts`
    - **Function:** `getExecutor(languageId: string, fileExtension: string)`
        - This function retrieves the executor string from the configuration using `this._config.get<any>("executorMap")`, `this._config.get<any>("executorMapByGlob")`, and `this._config.get<any>("executorMapByFileExtension")`. The retrieved executor string is directly used without any sanitization.
    - **Function:** `executeCommandInOutputChannel(executor: string, appendFile: boolean = true)`
        - This function, and `executeCommandInTerminal`, calls `getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile` to construct the command string and then uses `child_process.spawn(command, [], { cwd: this._cwd, shell: true });` to execute the command.
        - The `shell: true` option in `spawn` is crucial for enabling command injection, as it interprets the command string through a shell, allowing for the execution of multiple commands and shell operators.
    - **Function:** `getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile(executor: string, appendFile: boolean = true)`
        - This function constructs the final command string by replacing placeholders in the executor string. However, it does not perform any sanitization on the executor string itself, which originates from user settings.

    ```
    User Settings (executorMap) --> getConfiguration("code-runner") --> get<any>("executorMap") --> getExecutor --> executor (unsanitized string) --> getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile --> command (still unsanitized) --> executeCommandInOutputChannel --> child_process.spawn(command, [], { shell: true }) --> Command Execution (Vulnerable to Injection)
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Open VS Code.
        - Open User Settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        - Search for "code-runner.executorMap" and edit the settings in `settings.json`.
        - Add or modify an entry in `executorMap` for a language you have installed (e.g., "javascript"). Set the executor value to: `"node && echo 'PWNED' > pwned.txt"`

    2. **Vulnerability Trigger:**
        - Create a new file named `test.js` (or any file type for which you modified the executor).
        - Add any JavaScript code (or leave it empty).
        - Run the code using Code Runner (press `Ctrl+Alt+N` or right-click in the editor and select "Run Code").

    3. **Verification:**
        - After the code execution finishes, check your workspace directory (the folder where you created `test.js`).
        - Verify if a file named `pwned.txt` has been created.
        - Open `pwned.txt` and check if it contains the text "PWNED".

    4. **Expected Result:**
        If the `pwned.txt` file is created and contains "PWNED", it confirms that the injected command `echo 'PWNED' > pwned.txt` was executed successfully, demonstrating command injection vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system by manipulating the Code Runner extension's settings. It is a **high-severity** vulnerability due to the potential for full system compromise.
