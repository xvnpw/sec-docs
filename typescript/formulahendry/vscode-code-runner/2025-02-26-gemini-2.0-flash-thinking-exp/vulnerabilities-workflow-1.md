### Combined Vulnerability List for Code Runner VSCode Extension

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified in the Code Runner VSCode extension. These vulnerabilities can potentially allow malicious actors to compromise user systems.

#### 1. Command Injection via Workspace Configuration

*   **Description:**
    1.  The Code Runner extension allows users to configure custom executors for different languages or file patterns through various settings including `code-runner.executorMap`, `code-runner.executorMapByGlob`, `code-runner.executorMapByFileExtension`, and `code-runner.customCommand`.
    2.  These settings are read from the VSCode configuration (workspace or user settings) and used to construct commands that are executed by the extension.
    3.  The extension utilizes `child_process.spawn` with `shell: true` to execute these commands.
    4.  An attacker who can modify these configuration settings (e.g., by contributing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file to a shared project, tricking a user into importing malicious settings, or having write access to workspace settings in a shared environment) can inject arbitrary shell commands into the executor strings. For instance, setting the Python executor to `python -c "import os; os.system('malicious_command')"`.
    5.  When a user opens the project in VSCode and runs code using Code Runner, the extension retrieves the malicious executor from the workspace settings.
    6.  The `getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile` function constructs the execution command using this attacker-controlled executor without proper sanitization.
    7.  Finally, the `executeCommandInOutputChannel` or `executeCommandInTerminal` functions execute the crafted command using `child_process.spawn`, leading to the execution of the attacker's injected commands by the system shell.

*   **Impact:**
    -   Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    -   An attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions. This allows for a wide range of malicious activities, including data theft, malware installation, and complete system compromise.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    -   None. The extension relies on user-provided configuration without proper sanitization or validation of the executor strings.
    -   File names are quoted using double quotes in the constructed command via the `quoteFileName` function. This offers limited protection against command injection in file paths but does not mitigate injection within the executor commands themselves. The quoting mechanism used (`quoteFileName`) is insufficient to prevent command injection in all cases when `shell: true` is used.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    -   Input sanitization and validation for all executor-related configuration settings (`code-runner.executorMap`, `code-runner.executorMapByGlob`, `code-runner.executorMapByFileExtension`, `code-runner.customCommand`).
    -   Consider using `shell: false` in `child_process.spawn` and constructing commands with arguments array instead of relying on `shell: true` to prevent shell injection. If `shell: true` is necessary for certain functionalities, implement robust input sanitization to escape shell metacharacters. Implement a strict allowlist of characters for executor paths and commands to prevent injection of shell metacharacters.
    -   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for extension configurations to restrict the characters and commands allowed in executor strings.
    -   Display a warning to users when custom executors or commands are configured, especially if they deviate from standard or expected values.
    -   Documentation warning users about the risks of modifying executor settings and advising them to only use trusted configurations.
    -   Consider sandboxing code execution or running processes with reduced privileges to limit the impact of successful command injection.

*   **Preconditions:**
    -   Attacker needs to be able to modify the VSCode workspace or user settings configuration for the victim. This could be achieved through:
        -   Contributing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file to a shared project (e.g., in a Git repository).
        -   Social engineering to trick a user into manually modifying their user or workspace settings to include malicious executors.
        -   The attacker must be able to modify the workspace settings (settings.json) of a project in a shared environment where they have write access.
    -   The user must execute code within the compromised workspace using the Code Runner extension.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1.  **`codeManager.ts`:** The core logic for command execution resides in `codeManager.ts`.
    2.  **`getExecutor` function:** This function retrieves the executor string from the configuration based on language ID, file extension, or filename glob. The `runCustomCommand` function also retrieves the custom command from the configuration (`customCommand`). These functions retrieve commands from settings without sanitization.
    3.  **`getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile` function:** This function takes the executor string and constructs the final command by replacing placeholders like `$fileName`, `$dir`, etc. and quoting the filename using `quoteFileName`. The executor string from configuration is used directly without sanitization.
    4.  **`executeCommandInOutputChannel` function:** This function uses `child_process.spawn(command, [], { cwd: this._cwd, shell: true })` to execute the command. The crucial part is `shell: true`, which makes the system shell interpret the `command` string, opening the door for command injection. The use of `shell: true` in `child_process.spawn` further increases the risk of command injection, as it allows shell expansion and interpretation of metacharacters within the command string.
    5.  **`quoteFileName` function:** This function simply adds double quotes around the filename: `'\"' + fileName + '\"'`. This is not sufficient to prevent command injection if the executor string itself contains malicious shell commands or if filenames contain special characters that bypass simple quoting.

    ```typescript
    // codeManager.ts - executeCommandInOutputChannel function (simplified)
    private async executeCommandInOutputChannel(executor: string, appendFile: boolean = true) {
        // ...
        const command = await this.getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile(executor, appendFile);
        this._process = spawn(command, [], { cwd: this._cwd, shell: true });
        // ...
    }

    // codeManager.ts - getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile function (simplified)
    private async getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile(executor: string, appendFile: boolean = true): Promise<string> {
        let cmd = executor; // Executor is taken directly from config without sanitization
        if (this._codeFile) {
            // ... placeholder replacement ...
        }
        return (cmd !== executor ? cmd : executor + (appendFile ? " " + this.quoteFileName(this._codeFile) : "")); // Command is constructed and returned
    }

    // codeManager.ts - quoteFileName function
    private quoteFileName(fileName: string): string {
        return '\"' + fileName + '\"';
    }
    ```

    **Vulnerability Flow:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Configuration Settings (executorMap, customCommand)] --> B(getExecutor);
        B --> C(getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile);
        C --> D(executeCommandInOutputChannel / executeCommandInTerminal);
        D --> E{child_process.spawn (shell: true)};
        E --> F[System Shell (Command Injection)];
    ```

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prerequisites:**
        -   VSCode installed with the Code Runner extension.
        -   A workspace folder opened in VSCode.
    2.  **Steps:**
        -   Open VSCode settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        -   Go to Workspace Settings.
        -   Search for "code-runner.executorMap" or "code-runner.customCommand".
        -   Click "Edit in settings.json" to modify the workspace settings.
        -   To test `executorMap`: Add or modify an entry in `code-runner.executorMap` for a language you will use for testing (e.g., "javascript"). Set the executor to a malicious command, for example:
            ```json
            {
                "code-runner.executorMap": {
                    "javascript": "node -e 'require(\"child_process\").execSync(\"calc.exe\"); process.exit()'"
                }
            }
            ```
            (For macOS/Linux, replace `calc.exe` with a command like `osascript -e 'display notification \"PWNED!\" with title \"Code Runner Vulnerability\"'` or `xmessage "PWNED!"` if xmessage is installed.)
        -   To test `customCommand`: Add or modify  `code-runner.customCommand` with a malicious command, for example:
            ```json
            {
                "code-runner.customCommand": "echo harmless && echo 'Malicious code executed'"
            }
            ```
        -   Save the settings.json file.
        -   If testing `executorMap`, create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `test.js`) in the workspace. The content of the file doesn't matter, it can be empty. If testing `customCommand`, this step is not needed.
        -   If testing `executorMap`, run the JavaScript file using Code Runner (e.g., right-click in the editor and select "Run Code", or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+N`). If testing `customCommand`, trigger the “Run Custom Command” command.
    3.  **Expected Behavior:**
        -   The injected command (`calc.exe` or equivalent for `executorMap`, or `echo harmless && echo 'Malicious code executed'` for `customCommand`) will be executed by the system shell. On Windows, Calculator application should open. On macOS/Linux, a notification should appear or a message box should be displayed, depending on the injected command. For `customCommand` test, both "harmless" and "Malicious code executed" should be printed in the output.
    4.  **Actual Behavior:**
        -   The injected command is executed, demonstrating arbitrary code execution. For `executorMap` test, Calculator opens (on Windows) or notification appears (on macOS/Linux). For `customCommand` test, both "harmless" and "Malicious code executed" are printed in the output.
    5.  **Verification:**
        -   For `executorMap` test, check if the injected command's effect is visible (e.g., Calculator opened, notification displayed).
        -   For `customCommand` test, observe the output channel and verify if both parts of the injected command are executed.
        -   For Python `executorMap` test with `touch /tmp/pwned_by_code_runner`, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_by_code_runner` exists by running the command `ls /tmp/pwned_by_code_runner` in a terminal. If the file exists, it confirms the command injection.

This test case confirms the command injection vulnerability by showing that a malicious executor or custom command defined in the workspace settings can be executed by the Code Runner extension.

#### 2. Arbitrary Command Execution via Unsanitized Shebang Parsing

*   **Description:**
    1.  When no explicit language is provided for a file, the extension checks the first line for a shebang line if the “respectShebang” setting is enabled (which is the default behavior).
    2.  In the `getExecutor` method, if the first line matches the regex `/^#!(?!\[)/`, the extension strips off the “#!” and uses the rest of the line as the executor command.
    3.  An attacker can craft a file whose first line is a malicious shebang (for example, including shell metacharacters or dangerous commands). For example: `#!/bin/bash -c "echo 'Exploited: Arbitrary code execution' && <malicious command>"`.
    4.  When a user opens this file and triggers the “Run Code” command, the extension will execute that unsanitized command using the system shell via `child_process.spawn` with `shell: true`.

*   **Impact:**
    -   Arbitrary command execution on the victim’s machine can be achieved.
    -   If an attacker's file is executed, they may run arbitrary system commands, leading to full system compromise or data exfiltration.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    -   The setting “respectShebang” is enabled by default to support legitimate shebang use.
    -   No additional sanitization or validation is performed on the shebang content.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    -   Validate and sanitize the contents of the shebang line before using it as an executor.
    -   Consider requiring explicit opt-in to execute shebang commands or implementing a whitelist of allowed commands.

*   **Preconditions:**
    -   The file to be run must have a first line beginning with `#!` that specifies a command.
    -   The user must run that file with the “Run Code” command without overriding the “respectShebang” setting.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    -   In `src/codeManager.ts`, the `getExecutor` method (around the lines checking `if (/^#!(?!\[)/.test(firstLineInFile))`) takes the unsanitized string following “#!” as the executor.
    -   This value is later passed into the helper function `getFinalCommandToRunCodeFile` and ultimately handed off to `child_process.spawn` with `shell: true`, without any verification.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  Create a test file (e.g., `malicious.txt`) with a first line such as:
        ```
        #!/bin/bash -c "echo 'Exploited: Arbitrary code execution' && calc.exe"
        ```
        (For macOS/Linux, replace `calc.exe` with a command like `osascript -e 'display notification \"PWNED!\" with title \"Code Runner Vulnerability\"'` or `xmessage "PWNED!"` if xmessage is installed.)
    2.  Open this file in VS Code.
    3.  Trigger the “Run Code” command (e.g., right-click in the editor and select "Run Code", or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+N`).
    4.  **Expected Behavior:** The command from the shebang is executed directly in the shell. On Windows, Calculator application should open. On macOS/Linux, a notification should appear or a message box should be displayed, depending on the injected command. The output should also show "Exploited: Arbitrary code execution".
    5.  **Actual Behavior:** The injected command is executed, demonstrating arbitrary code execution from the shebang line. The Calculator opens (on Windows) or notification appears (on macOS/Linux) and "Exploited: Arbitrary code execution" is printed in the output.
    6.  **Verification:** Check if the injected command's effect is visible (e.g., Calculator opened, notification displayed) and if the "Exploited: Arbitrary code execution" message is in the output, confirming the vulnerability.

#### 3. Predictable Temporary File Race Condition

*   **Description:**
    1.  When running selected code snippets (as opposed to whole files), the extension creates a temporary file for execution.
    2.  The filename is generated using a noncryptographic random string via `Math.random()` (via the helper function `rndName()`) or a custom configuration value (`temporaryFileName`).
    3.  Because the randomness is low entropy and the file creation does not use secure methods, an attacker who has write access to the temporary directory (typically returned by `os.tmpdir()`) may be able to predict the temporary file name.
    4.  The attacker might pre-create a symlink or file at that path.
    5.  When the extension writes the snippet’s contents (or later executes it), it overwrites or redirects to an unintended destination.

*   **Impact:**
    -   An attacker exploiting this weakness could potentially overwrite sensitive files or redirect execution to an attacker-controlled file.
    -   In multi-user environments where the temp directory is shared, this can lead to local privilege escalation or unintended code execution.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    -   A random string is appended to the temporary file name, but it is derived directly from `Math.random()` and no atomic file-creation mechanism is used.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    -   Use a cryptographically secure random generator for temporary file naming.
    -   Employ a safe temporary file creation API that atomically creates a file (or fails if the file already exists) rather than simply constructing a predictable file name and writing to it.

*   **Preconditions:**
    -   The attacker must have write access to the temporary directory on the victim’s machine.
    -   The attacker must be able to predict or preempt the temporary file name (or configure a malicious value for `temporaryFileName` via workspace settings).

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    -   In `src/codeManager.ts`, the method `createRandomFile` constructs a file name by using either the `temporaryFileName` configuration or concatenating `"temp"` with a value generated by `rndName()`.
    -   The function `rndName()` calls `Math.random().toString(36)` and formats the result, yielding a low-entropy, predictable string.
    -   The file is then written with `fs.writeFileSync` without any checks for preexistence or race conditions.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Prerequisites:** An environment where you can write to the system’s temporary directory.
    2.  **Steps:**
        -   Determine the predictable pattern used by Code Runner for temporary file names (e.g. by observing several generated file names when running code snippets). Note the directory and the naming convention.
        -   Pre-create a symbolic link in the temporary directory at a path matching the likely filename. For example, if the temporary file is predicted to be `/tmp/temp-abc123`, create a symlink `/tmp/temp-abc123` pointing to a sensitive file you want to overwrite, or a malicious script you want to execute.  You might need to run Code Runner a few times to observe the naming pattern and adjust your prediction.
        -   Alternatively, set `code-runner.temporaryFileName` in workspace settings to a predictable path in the temp directory.
        -   Run a code snippet in VSCode using Code Runner. This will trigger the creation of the temporary file.
    3.  **Expected Behavior:** The extension writes the code snippet's content to the predicted temporary file path, which is now a symlink. This might result in overwriting the target of the symlink or, if symlinked to an executable, potentially lead to unintended code execution when the temporary file is executed.
    4.  **Actual Behavior:** The code snippet content is written to the location pointed to by the symlink, demonstrating the race condition and the ability to redirect file writes. If symlinked to a sensitive file, it will be overwritten. If symlinked to an executable script and the extension attempts to execute the temporary file, the malicious script may be executed instead of the intended code snippet.
    5.  **Verification:**
        -   Check if the sensitive file (if you symlinked to one) has been overwritten with the content of the code snippet.
        -   If you symlinked to a malicious script, check if that script was executed when you ran the code snippet in Code Runner.
        -   Examine the file system at the symlink target to confirm that the write operation was redirected as expected due to the predictable temporary file name and the race condition.
