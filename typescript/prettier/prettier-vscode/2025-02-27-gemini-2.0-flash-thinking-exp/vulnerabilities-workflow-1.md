### Arbitrary Code Execution via Custom Prettier Module Resolution

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Custom Prettier Module Resolution
- **Description:**
    The Prettier extension allows users to specify a custom Prettier module path through the `prettier.prettierPath` setting. In trusted workspaces, the extension resolves this path using `getWorkspaceRelativePath` and then dynamically loads the module using Node's `require()` function. This module loading occurs in worker threads (`prettier-instance-worker.js`) or on the main thread, without sufficient validation to ensure the loaded module is a legitimate Prettier module.

    **Step-by-step to trigger the vulnerability:**
    1. Open a workspace that is marked as "trusted" in VS Code.
    2. Modify the workspace settings (typically in `settings.json`) to include a custom `prettierPath`, for example:
       ```json
       {
         "prettier.prettierPath": "./maliciousPrettier.js"
       }
       ```
    3. Create a malicious JavaScript file at the specified path (e.g., `./maliciousPrettier.js` in the workspace root). This file will contain arbitrary code to be executed.
    4. Trigger document formatting within the workspace. This can be done by using the "Format Document" command or through auto-formatting on save.
    5. The extension's module resolver retrieves the custom `prettierPath`, resolves it, and uses `require(modulePath)` to load it. This happens in either a worker thread via `PrettierWorkerInstance` or in the main thread via `PrettierMainThreadInstance`.
    6. The malicious module is executed within the extension's context, leading to arbitrary code execution.

- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine within the VSCode extension's context. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - Sensitive data exfiltration (e.g., source code, credentials, workspace data).
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
        - Further compromise of the user's system and potentially lateral movement within a network.
        - Modification or deletion of files within the workspace and potentially beyond.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - Workspace Trust: The extension description mentions Workspace Trust. In untrusted workspaces, the extension disables custom module paths by setting `prettierPath` and `configPath` to `undefined`. This mitigation, implemented in `util.ts` using the `getConfig` function, prevents direct manipulation of the `prettierPath` setting in untrusted workspaces. However, Workspace Trust **does not fully mitigate** the vulnerability in trusted workspaces or scenarios where a local Prettier module is resolved via `node_modules`. If a workspace contains `node_modules` with a Prettier installation, and an attacker can influence module resolution to point to a malicious module within `node_modules` or a similar path, the vulnerability remains exploitable even with Workspace Trust enabled.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation: The `modulePath` received in the worker thread and main thread should undergo strict validation. This validation should ensure:
        - The path points to a legitimate Prettier module.
        - The path is within the extension's expected scope or a confined set of trusted directories.
        - The path conforms to an allowed pattern, preventing traversal to unexpected locations.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: Implement stricter sandboxing or isolation for worker threads and potentially the main extension process. This would limit the impact of code execution within these contexts by restricting access to system resources, APIs, and sensitive data. Mechanisms like restricted process privileges or secure contexts could be explored.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) or similar security policies: Explore and implement security policies to restrict the resources that the extension can load and execute. While CSP is traditionally used for web-based extensions, analogous mechanisms might exist or be adaptable for VS Code extensions to control module loading.
    - Digital Signing or Integrity Checks: Consider verifying the digital signature or integrity of the loaded Prettier module. This would help ensure that only trusted and unmodified Prettier modules are executed, preventing the loading of malicious replacements.
    - User Notification or Confirmation: Implement a warning or confirmation prompt for users when a custom `prettierPath` is configured and about to be loaded in a trusted workspace. This would provide transparency and allow users to make informed decisions about loading potentially untrusted modules.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The VS Code workspace must be marked as "trusted". If the workspace is untrusted, the extension falls back to the bundled Prettier version, bypassing the custom path.
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence the workspace configuration. This can be achieved by:
        - Providing a malicious repository that includes a crafted `.vscode/settings.json` file with a malicious `prettier.prettierPath`.
        - In trusted workspaces, users themselves can modify workspace settings, including `prettier.prettierPath`.
        - Exploiting other potential vulnerabilities in the main thread message handling or settings processing that could indirectly allow control over the `modulePath`.
    - The user must trigger a formatting operation (e.g., "Format Document" command, auto-save formatting) to initiate the module loading and execution.

- **Source code analysis:**
    1. **Module Path Resolution:** In `ModuleResolver.ts`, within the `getPrettierInstance` method, the extension retrieves the `prettierPath` setting using `getConfig(...)`. It then utilizes `getWorkspaceRelativePath(fileName, prettierPath)` to resolve the path relative to the workspace root.
    2. **Dynamic Module Loading:** The resolved module path is passed to either `PrettierWorkerInstance` (for worker threads) or `PrettierMainThreadInstance` (for the main thread).
    3. **Worker Thread Loading:** In `prettier-instance-worker.js`, the `requireInstance(modulePath)` function directly calls `require(modulePath)` without any validation.
        ```javascript
        // /code/src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js
        const { parentPort } = require("worker_threads");
        const path2ModuleCache = new Map();

        function requireInstance(modulePath) {
            let prettierInstance = path2ModuleCache.get(modulePath);
            if (!prettierInstance) {
                prettierInstance = require(modulePath); // [VULNERABLE CODE] - Direct require without validation
                if (!prettierInstance.format) {
                    throw new Error("wrong instance");
                }
                path2ModuleCache.set(modulePath, prettierInstance);
            }
            return prettierInstance;
        }

        parentPort.on("message", ({ type, id, payload }) => {
            switch (type) {
                case "import": {
                    const { modulePath } = payload;
                    try {
                        const prettierInstance = requireInstance(modulePath); // modulePath passed to vulnerable function
                        parentPort.postMessage({ /* ... */ });
                    } catch {
                        parentPort.postMessage({ /* ... */ });
                    }
                    break;
                }
                // ...
            }
        });
        ```
    4. **Main Thread Loading:** Similar `require` call likely exists in the main thread instance (`PrettierMainThreadInstance`), although the provided code snippet focuses on the worker thread. The vulnerability is present in both execution paths if custom `prettierPath` is used.
    5. **Lack of Validation:** The core issue is the direct use of `require(modulePath)` without any sanitization or validation of `modulePath` before loading the module. This allows an attacker to control the loaded module and execute arbitrary code.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a trusted workspace in VS Code.
    2. **Inject Malicious Module:**
        - Create a file named `maliciousPrettier.js` at the workspace root with the following malicious content:
          ```javascript
          // maliciousPrettier.js
          const fs = require('fs');
          console.error("Malicious code executed from custom Prettier module!");
          // Malicious action: write a file to indicate code execution
          fs.writeFileSync('pwned.txt', 'Arbitrary code executed via custom Prettier module!');
          module.exports = { // Mock Prettier API
            version: '9.9.9',
            format: (source, options) => source,
            getFileInfo: async () => ({ ignored: false, inferredParser: 'babel' }),
            getSupportInfo: async () => ({ languages: [] }),
            clearConfigCache: async () => {},
            resolveConfigFile: async () => null,
            resolveConfig: async () => null
          };
          ```
        - Edit the workspace's `settings.json` file (create it if it doesn't exist in `.vscode` directory) to add:
          ```json
          {
            "prettier.prettierPath": "./maliciousPrettier.js"
          }
          ```
    3. **Trigger the Vulnerability:**
        - Open any formatable text document (e.g., a JavaScript file) within the workspace.
        - Execute the "Format Document" command (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+P`, then type "Format Document", or right-click in the editor and select "Format Document").
    4. **Observation:**
        - Check for the creation of the `pwned.txt` file in the workspace root. The presence of this file confirms that the malicious code within `maliciousPrettier.js` was executed.
        - Check the "Prettier" output panel in VS Code for the error message "Malicious code executed from custom Prettier module!" logged from `maliciousPrettier.js`.
    5. **Conclusion:**
        - If `pwned.txt` is created and/or the error message is present in the output panel, the test successfully demonstrates arbitrary code execution through the custom `prettierPath` vulnerability.
