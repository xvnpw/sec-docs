### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary module load in worker thread leading to code execution
- Description:
    1. The Prettier extension utilizes worker threads to perform code formatting, specifically in `prettier-instance-worker.js`.
    2. The `requireInstance` function within the worker thread is responsible for loading the Prettier module using `require(modulePath)`.
    3. The `modulePath` is received from the main extension thread via messages without sufficient validation.
    4. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `modulePath` to point to a malicious JavaScript file hosted remotely or locally.
    5. When the worker thread receives a crafted message with the malicious `modulePath`, it will execute `require(modulePath)`, leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the worker thread's context, which is within the extension's environment.
- Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine within the VSCode extension's context. This could lead to sensitive data exfiltration, installation of malware, or further compromise of the user's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Workspace Trust: The extension description mentions Workspace Trust, and it disables some features in untrusted workspaces. However, based on the code analysis of `src/util.ts` (from previous context) and the provided files, Workspace Trust disables some settings like `prettierPath`, `configPath`, `resolveGlobalModules`, `useEditorConfig`, `withNodeModules`, and `documentSelectors`. This prevents direct manipulation of `prettierPath` setting in untrusted workspaces, but it **does not prevent loading a local prettier module** if it is resolved via `node_modules` and passed as `modulePath` to the worker thread. Therefore, Workspace Trust does not fully mitigate this vulnerability, especially if a workspace contains `node_modules` with a prettier installation, which is a common scenario in JavaScript/Node.js projects.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: The `modulePath` received in the worker thread should be strictly validated to ensure it points to a legitimate Prettier module and not an arbitrary file.  Validation should include checks to ensure the path is within the extension's expected scope and points to a valid Prettier module.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation: Implement stricter sandboxing or isolation for worker threads to limit the impact of code execution within them.  This could involve using mechanisms to restrict the worker thread's access to system resources and APIs.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the resources that the extension can load and execute. While CSP might be more relevant for web-based extensions, exploring similar security policies for VS Code extensions could be beneficial.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to find a way to control the `modulePath` that is sent to the worker thread. While direct manipulation of `prettierPath` setting might be restricted by Workspace Trust in untrusted workspaces, other potential attack vectors might exist, such as:
        - Workspace settings: Even in trusted workspaces, users can modify workspace settings, including `prettier.prettierPath`.
        - Extension configuration files: If the extension uses configuration files that can influence module resolution and are user-writable, these could be exploited.
        - Vulnerabilities in main thread message handling: If there are vulnerabilities in how the main extension thread handles messages or settings, an attacker might be able to indirectly control the `modulePath`.
    - The user must have a workspace open that allows the extension to activate and attempt to load Prettier in a worker thread. This is likely to be the case in most common development scenarios, even with Workspace Trust enabled if a local prettier module is present in `node_modules`.
- Source code analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js` (No changes in provided files, same as previous analysis)
    ```javascript
    const { parentPort } = require("worker_threads");
    const path2ModuleCache = new Map();

    function requireInstance(modulePath) { // [1] modulePath is received as argument
        let prettierInstance = path2ModuleCache.get(modulePath);
        if (!prettierInstance) {
            prettierInstance = require(modulePath); // [2] require(modulePath) is called without validation
            if (!prettierInstance.format) {
                throw new Error("wrong instance");
            }
            path2ModuleCache.set(modulePath, prettierInstance);
        }
        return prettierInstance;
    }

    parentPort.on("message", ({ type, id, payload }) => { // [3] Message handler
        switch (type) {
            case "import": {
                const { modulePath } = payload; // [4] modulePath from payload
                try {
                    const prettierInstance = requireInstance(modulePath); // [5] modulePath passed to requireInstance
                    parentPort.postMessage({
                        type,
                        id,
                        payload: { version: prettierInstance.version },
                    });
                } catch {
                    parentPort.postMessage({
                        type,
                        id,
                        payload: { version: null },
                    });
                }
                break;
            }
            case "callMethod": { // ... }
        }
    });
    ```
    - [1] The `requireInstance` function takes `modulePath` as an argument.
    - [2] `require(modulePath)` is called directly with the provided `modulePath` without any validation or sanitization. This is the core of the vulnerability.
    - [3] `parentPort.on("message", ...)` sets up a message handler for messages received by the worker thread.
    - [4] `const { modulePath } = payload;` extracts `modulePath` from the message payload of type "import".
    - [5] `const prettierInstance = requireInstance(modulePath);` calls `requireInstance` with the extracted `modulePath`, leading to the vulnerable `require` call.

- Security test case:
    1. Prerequisites:
        - Attacker needs to be able to modify VS Code settings, specifically `prettier.prettierPath` or influence the resolved `modulePath` in other ways (e.g., by providing a workspace with specific `node_modules`).
        - VS Code Workspace Trust can be enabled or bypassed, but for this test, we will assume a trusted workspace for simplicity, or focus on scenarios where local `node_modules` can be leveraged.
    2. Setup Malicious Module:
        - Create a malicious JavaScript file (e.g., `malicious.js`) with the following content:
        ```javascript
        // malicious.js
        console.error("Malicious code executed from worker thread!");
        exports.version = "3.0.0"; // Mock version to satisfy extension's version check
        exports.format = function(text, options) {
            // Arbitrary code execution
            const { execSync } = require('child_process');
            execSync('touch /tmp/pwned_worker_thread'); // Example: create a file to indicate code execution in worker thread
            return text; // Return original text to avoid breaking formatting
        };
        exports.getSupportInfo = () => ({ languages: [] });
        exports.getFileInfo = () => Promise.resolve({ ignored: false });
        exports.clearConfigCache = () => Promise.resolve();
        exports.resolveConfigFile = () => Promise.resolve(null);
        exports.resolveConfig = () => Promise.resolve(null);
        ```
        - Host this file on a web server accessible to the test environment (e.g., `http://attacker.com/malicious.js`) or place it in a local accessible path. For simplicity, let's assume it's locally accessible at `/tmp/malicious.js`.
    3. Configure VS Code Settings (if applicable, for `prettierPath` manipulation):
        - Open VS Code settings (JSON).
        - Set `"prettier.prettierPath": "/tmp/malicious.js"`. This setting will be used by the extension to attempt to load the Prettier module from the malicious path.
    4. Open a Workspace:
        - Open any workspace in VS Code. For testing local `node_modules` resolution, create a simple workspace with `node_modules/prettier/index.js` being the malicious file.
        - Open a formatable file within the workspace (e.g., a JavaScript file).
    5. Trigger Formatting:
        - Execute the "Format Document" command (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+P` then type "Format Document").
    6. Verify Code Execution:
        - Check if the malicious code has been executed. In our example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_worker_thread` has been created.
        - Check the "Prettier" output panel in VS Code for the "Malicious code executed from worker thread!" error message logged in `malicious.js`.
        - If `/tmp/pwned_worker_thread` exists and/or the error message is in the output panel, the vulnerability is confirmed, especially if it occurs when formatting within a workspace that should trigger worker thread usage.
