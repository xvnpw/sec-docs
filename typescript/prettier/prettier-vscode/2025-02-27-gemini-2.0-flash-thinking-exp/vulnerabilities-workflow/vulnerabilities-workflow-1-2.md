## Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution via Custom Prettier Module Resolution

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Custom Prettier Module Resolution
- **Description:**  
  The extension lets users supply a custom module path through its configuration (via the setting `prettier.prettierPath`). In a trusted workspace the extension calls a helper function (using `getWorkspaceRelativePath`) and then—with no further validation—uses Node’s dynamic module loader (via a plain `require(...)` call in the worker thread or on the main thread) to load this module. An attacker who controls the workspace configuration (for example, by supplying a malicious repository and a settings.json file) can set `prettier.prettierPath` to point to a crafted module. When the extension later triggers formatting, it will load and execute that module, enabling arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the running VS Code extension host.

  **Step-by-step to trigger the vulnerability:**
  1. Open a workspace that is marked as “trusted” (so that custom paths are not disabled).
  2. Modify the workspace settings (usually in the settings.json file) to include a configuration entry such as:
     ```json
     {
       "prettier.prettierPath": "./maliciousPrettier.js"
     }
     ```
  3. Place a malicious JavaScript file at that path (relative to the workspace root) that performs an unwanted action (for example, writing sensitive data to disk or establishing an outbound network connection).
  4. Trigger document formatting (for example, by using the “Format Document” command).
  5. The extension’s module resolver picks up the custom `prettierPath`, resolves it via `getWorkspaceRelativePath`, and loads it using a plain `require()` call (in either the worker thread via `PrettierWorkerInstance` or in the main thread via `PrettierMainThreadInstance`).
  6. The malicious module is executed immediately, thereby compromising the extension host.

- **Impact:**  
  Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the VS Code extension host. An attacker who successfully triggers this may gain control over the user’s environment, be able to steal sensitive data, modify files, or perform further actions on the host machine with the user’s privileges.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The extension’s configuration getter (in `util.ts` using the `getConfig` function) automatically disables custom module paths (e.g. sets `prettierPath` and `configPath` to undefined) when the workspace is not trusted (i.e. when `workspace.isTrusted` is false). This prevents an attacker on untrusted workspaces from supplying arbitrary modules.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - **Path Validation and Restrictions:** No further validation is performed on the resolved module path. No check ensures that the custom path falls within a trusted directory (for example, within the workspace itself) or conforms to an allowed pattern.
  - **Sandboxing or Digital Signing:** The extension does not sandbox or verify the digital signature of the module being loaded; it trusts the file purely based on the “trusted workspace” flag.
  - **User Notification or Confirmation:** There is no additional warning to the user if a custom (and potentially arbitrary) module is loaded in a trusted workspace.

- **Preconditions:**  
  - The VS Code workspace must be marked as “trusted.” (If it were untrusted, the extension forces fallback to the bundled Prettier version.)  
  - An attacker must be able to influence or supply the workspace configuration (for example, via a malicious repository that includes a deliberately altered settings file).  
  - The user must trigger a formatting operation (e.g. via the “Format Document” command) so that the custom module gets loaded and executed.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In **ModuleResolver.ts** (within the `getPrettierInstance` method), the extension retrieves the user-specified `prettierPath` from the configuration via `getConfig(…)`. It then calls `getWorkspaceRelativePath(fileName, prettierPath)` to resolve the path relative to the workspace.  
  - If a custom path is found, it is later handed off to one of two classes (either `PrettierWorkerInstance` or `PrettierMainThreadInstance`) where the module is loaded by a dynamic `require(modulePath)` call (see, for example, the `requireInstance(modulePath)` function in **prettier-instance-worker.js**).  
  - This loading occurs without sanitizing or validating that the file is indeed a bona fide Prettier module, meaning an attacker may supply a module that executes arbitrary code.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:** Create a trusted workspace in VS Code.  
  2. **Inject Malicious Module:**  
     - Place a file named `maliciousPrettier.js` at the workspace root with contents similar to:
       ```js
       // maliciousPrettier.js
       const fs = require('fs');
       // Malicious action: write a file that proves execution
       fs.writeFileSync('hacked.txt', 'This code was executed!');
       module.exports = {
         version: '9.9.9',
         format: (source, options) => source,
         getFileInfo: async () => ({ ignored: false, inferredParser: 'babel' }),
         getSupportInfo: async () => ({ languages: [] }),
         clearConfigCache: async () => {},
         resolveConfigFile: async () => null,
         resolveConfig: async () => null
       };
       ```
     - Edit the workspace’s settings.json to add:
       ```json
       {
         "prettier.prettierPath": "./maliciousPrettier.js"
       }
       ```
  3. **Trigger the Vulnerability:**  
     - Open any text document in the workspace and run the “Format Document” command.
  4. **Observation:**  
     - Verify that the file `hacked.txt` is created at the workspace root or that some other observable malicious side effect occurs.  
  5. **Conclusion:**  
     - The test validates that the malicious module is loaded and executed, confirming arbitrary code execution.
