### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Prettier Module/Plugin Loading in Worker Thread

- Description:
    1. The VSCode Prettier extension utilizes worker threads to enhance performance for code formatting operations, especially for Prettier v3 and later versions.
    2. The worker thread, implemented in `/code/src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js`, is responsible for loading and executing the Prettier module.
    3. Critically, the worker thread dynamically loads the Prettier module using the `require(modulePath)` function, where `modulePath` is determined by the main extension thread.
    4. The `modulePath` can be influenced by user configurations, specifically the `prettier.prettierPath` setting, or through workspace configurations that specify Prettier plugins in files like `.prettierrc.json` or `prettier.config.js`.
    5. **Attack Vector 1 (prettier.prettierPath):** If a user configures `prettier.prettierPath` to point to a malicious JavaScript file, or if an attacker can manipulate workspace settings (e.g., by including a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` in a workspace) to set this path, the extension will instruct the worker thread to load this malicious path as the Prettier module.
    6. **Attack Vector 2 (Malicious Prettier Plugin):**  An attacker can craft a malicious Prettier plugin and configure a workspace (via `.prettierrc.json` or similar configuration files) to load this plugin, either from a local path within the workspace or from a publicly accessible (but attacker-controlled) npm package name.
    7. When the extension needs to format code in a workspace with a malicious configuration, the main thread resolves the `modulePath` (either directly from `prettier.prettierPath` or indirectly via plugin resolution) and sends it to the worker thread in a message.
    8. The worker thread, upon receiving the message containing the `modulePath`, executes `require(modulePath)`. Due to the lack of validation, if `modulePath` points to a malicious JavaScript file (either a direct path or a malicious plugin's entry point), the code within this file will be executed within the worker process.
    9. This allows for arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's worker thread, regardless of whether the malicious module is provided via `prettier.prettierPath` or as a Prettier plugin.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's worker thread.
    - This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the worker thread, which can lead to significant security consequences. Potential impacts include:
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious code can read and transmit sensitive data from the opened workspace, including source code, configuration files, and potentially environment variables or other accessible resources.
        - **Local System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the worker thread and the VSCode environment, arbitrary code execution could be leveraged to modify files, install backdoors, or perform other actions that compromise the user's local system.
        - **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** While worker threads are designed for isolation, vulnerabilities in the communication channels or the extension's architecture could potentially be exploited to escalate privileges or bypass security restrictions within VSCode.
        - **Denial of Service:** Malicious code could intentionally crash the worker thread or the entire VSCode extension, leading to a denial of service.
        - **Workspace Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify files within the workspace, inject malicious code into project files, or alter settings to further compromise the user or other collaborators.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Workspace Trust: VS Code's Workspace Trust feature provides a partial mitigation. When Workspace Trust is enabled and a workspace is marked as "untrusted," the Prettier extension ignores the `prettier.prettierPath` setting and uses the bundled version of Prettier. This prevents the direct `prettier.prettierPath` attack vector in untrusted workspaces.  However, Workspace Trust does not fully mitigate the risk from malicious plugins loaded via workspace configuration files in "trusted" workspaces. If a user trusts a malicious workspace, the extension will still load and execute plugins specified in workspace configuration.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation for `modulePath`: The extension lacks robust validation of the `modulePath` before it is passed to `require()` in the worker thread. There should be checks to ensure that the path points to a legitimate Prettier module or plugin and is within expected and safe locations.
    - Plugin Validation and Integrity Checks: For Prettier plugins, there is no validation of the plugin's integrity, source, or safety before loading. Mechanisms to verify plugin signatures, check against known malicious plugins, or restrict plugin sources to trusted repositories are missing.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation for worker thread: While worker threads provide some level of process separation, stronger sandboxing or isolation mechanisms could further limit the impact of arbitrary code execution within the worker process. This could involve restricting access to sensitive APIs or resources from within the worker thread.
    - User Awareness/Warnings: The extension should provide warnings to users when loading Prettier plugins, especially from workspace configurations. Users should be alerted to the potential risks associated with loading plugins from untrusted sources or workspaces and prompted to review and approve plugin loading.
    - Restriction of Module Loading Paths: Limit the paths from which modules can be loaded to a predefined safe list or enforce a strict allowlist approach for module resolution in the worker thread.

- Preconditions:
    1. The victim must have the VSCode Prettier extension installed.
    2. **For `prettier.prettierPath` attack:**
        - The attacker must be able to trick a user into opening a malicious workspace in VS Code.
        - The user must have Workspace Trust disabled, or explicitly trust the malicious workspace.
        - Either the user must have `prettier.prettierPath` configured to a custom path, or the attacker must be able to manipulate workspace settings (e.g., via `.vscode/settings.json`) to set `prettier.prettierPath` to a malicious JavaScript file.
    3. **For Malicious Plugin attack:**
        - The victim must open a workspace considered "trusted" by VS Code (or Workspace Trust disabled).
        - The malicious workspace must contain a Prettier configuration file (e.g., `.prettierrc.json`, `prettier.config.js`) that specifies a malicious Prettier plugin.
        - The Prettier configuration must be active and used by the extension when formatting a document in the workspace.
        - The resolved Prettier version should be v3 or higher to ensure the worker thread is utilized.

- Source code analysis:
    - `/code/src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js`:
        ```javascript
        const { parentPort } = require("worker_threads");
        const path2ModuleCache = new Map();

        function requireInstance(modulePath) {
          let prettierInstance = path2ModuleCache.get(modulePath);
          if (!prettierInstance) {
            prettierInstance = require(modulePath); // [VULNERABLE CODE] - modulePath from message is directly passed to require() without validation
            if (!prettierInstance.format) {
              throw new Error("wrong instance");
            }
            path2ModuleCache.set(modulePath, prettierInstance);
          }
          return prettierInstance;
        }

        parentPort.on("message", ({ type, id, payload }) => {
          switch (type) {
            case "import": {
              const { modulePath } = payload; // modulePath received from main thread message
              try {
                const prettierInstance = requireInstance(modulePath); // Loaded using require(modulePath)
                // ...
              } catch {
                // ...
              }
              break;
            }
            case "callMethod": {
              const { modulePath, methodName, methodArgs } = payload; // modulePath received from main thread message
              // ...
              let prettierInstance = path2ModuleCache.get(modulePath);
              if (!prettierInstance) {
                try {
                  prettierInstance = requireInstance(modulePath); // Loaded using require(modulePath)
                } catch (error) {
                  postError(error);
                }
              }
              // ...
              break;
            }
          }
        });
        ```

        ```
        - The `requireInstance` function in `prettier-instance-worker.js` is the core of the vulnerability. It directly uses the `modulePath` received from the main thread in a `require()` call without any validation. This allows loading and executing arbitrary JavaScript code if the main thread provides a malicious path.

- Security test case:

    **Test Case 1: Arbitrary Code Execution via `prettier.prettierPath`**
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-workspace-path`.
    2. Inside `malicious-workspace-path`, create a file named `malicious_prettier.js` with the following content:
        ```javascript
        module.exports = {
            format: (text) => {
                // Malicious code to execute when formatting is triggered
                require('fs').writeFileSync('/tmp/prettier-pwned-path', 'PWNED via prettierPath!');
                return text; // Return original text to avoid breaking formatting
            }
        };
        ```
    3. Inside `malicious-workspace-path`, create a directory named `.vscode`.
    4. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "prettier.prettierPath": "./malicious_prettier.js"
        }
        ```
    5. Open VS Code and open the `malicious-workspace-path` folder.
    6. Ensure that Workspace Trust is either disabled globally in VS Code settings (`"security.workspace.trust.enabled": false`) or that you choose to "Trust" the workspace when prompted.
    7. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `test_path.js`) in the `malicious-workspace-path` with any content that Prettier can format.
    8. Open `test_path.js` in the editor and trigger formatting by running the "Format Document" command (or enabling "Format On Save").
    9. After formatting, check if the file `/tmp/prettier-pwned-path` exists on your system. If it exists and contains "PWNED via prettierPath!", it indicates successful arbitrary code execution.

    **Test Case 2: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Prettier Plugin**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-prettier-plugin` with the following files:
            - `package.json`:
              ```json
              {
                "name": "malicious-prettier-plugin",
                "version": "1.0.0",
                "main": "index.js"
              }
              ```
            - `index.js`:
              ```javascript
              module.exports = {
                parsers: {
                  "malicious-parser": {
                    parse: function(text) {
                      const fs = require('fs');
                      fs.writeFileSync('/tmp/prettier-pwned-plugin', 'PWNED via plugin!');
                      return {
                        type: 'malicious-ast',
                        body: text
                      };
                    },
                    astFormat: 'malicious-ast',
                  },
                },
                printers: {
                  'malicious-ast': {
                    print: () => '/* Formatted by malicious plugin! */'
                  }
                },
                languages: [{
                    name: "malicious-lang",
                    parsers: ["malicious-parser"],
                    extensions: [".malicious"]
                }]
              };
              ```
        - In a separate directory, create a new VS Code workspace (e.g., `prettier-vuln-test-plugin`).
        - Inside `prettier-vuln-test-plugin`, create a `.prettierrc.json`:
          ```json
          {
            "plugins": ["./malicious-prettier-plugin"]
          }
          ```
        - Place the `malicious-prettier-plugin` directory inside the `prettier-vuln-test-plugin` workspace.
        - Create a file named `test_plugin.malicious` in `prettier-vuln-test-plugin` with some arbitrary content.

    2. **Action:**
        - Open the `prettier-vuln-test-plugin` workspace in VS Code. Trust the workspace when prompted.
        - Open the `test_plugin.malicious` file.
        - Trigger "Format Document" command (e.g., Shift+Alt+F).

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - After formatting, check if the file `/tmp/prettier-pwned-plugin` exists on your system. If it exists and contains "PWNED via plugin!", it confirms arbitrary code execution through a malicious Prettier plugin. Additionally, the `test_plugin.malicious` file should be formatted with the comment `/* Formatted by malicious plugin! */`.
