### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Module Load in Worker Thread

- Description:
    1. The VSCode Prettier extension utilizes worker threads to perform code formatting in the background.
    2. The worker thread, implemented in `/code/src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js`, dynamically loads the Prettier module using `require(modulePath)`.
    3. The `modulePath` is determined in the main extension thread in `/code/src/ModuleResolver.ts` and passed to the worker thread via messages.
    4. The `getPrettierInstance` function in `ModuleResolver.ts` resolves the Prettier module path, considering the `prettier.prettierPath` setting from VSCode configuration.
    5. If a user configures `prettier.prettierPath` to point to a malicious JavaScript file, or if an attacker can manipulate workspace settings to set this path, the extension will send this malicious path to the worker thread.
    6. The worker thread, upon receiving the message, will execute `require(modulePath)`, loading and running the malicious JavaScript code within the worker process.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's worker thread.
    - This could potentially lead to unauthorized actions, data exfiltration, or further system compromise depending on the privileges of the worker process and the security context of the VSCode environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Workspace Trust: When VS Code Workspace Trust is enabled and a workspace is marked as untrusted, the extension ignores the `prettier.prettierPath` setting and uses the bundled version of Prettier. This prevents loading of user-specified modules in untrusted workspaces, mitigating the vulnerability in this specific scenario.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation for `modulePath`: The extension lacks validation of the `modulePath` before it is passed to `require()` in the worker thread. Validating that the path points to a legitimate Prettier module and not an arbitrary file could prevent malicious code loading.
    - Sandboxing/Isolation for worker thread: While worker threads provide some level of process separation, stronger sandboxing or isolation mechanisms could further limit the impact of arbitrary code execution within the worker process.

- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker must be able to trick a user into opening a malicious workspace in VS Code.
    2. The user must have the `prettier.prettierPath` setting configured to use a custom path, or the attacker must be able to manipulate the workspace's settings (e.g., by modifying `.vscode/settings.json` in the malicious workspace) to set `prettier.prettierPath` to a malicious JavaScript file.
    3. VS Code Workspace Trust must be disabled, or the user must have explicitly trusted the malicious workspace to allow custom `prettierPath` settings to be applied.

- Source code analysis:
    - `/code/src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js`:
        ```javascript
        const { parentPort } = require("worker_threads");
        // ...
        parentPort.on("message", ({ type, id, payload }) => {
          switch (type) {
            case "import": {
              const { modulePath } = payload;
              try {
                const prettierInstance = requireInstance(modulePath); // [VULNERABLE CODE] - modulePath from message is directly passed to require()
                // ...
              } catch {
                // ...
              }
              break;
            }
            // ...
          }
        });

        }
        // ...
        ```

- Security test case:
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-workspace`.
    2. Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `malicious_prettier.js` with the following content:
        ```javascript
        module.exports = {
            format: (text) => {
                // Malicious code to execute when formatting is triggered
                require('fs').writeFileSync('/tmp/pwned', 'PWNED!');
                return text; // Return original text to avoid breaking formatting
            }
        };
        ```
    3. Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a directory named `.vscode`.
    4. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "prettier.prettierPath": "./malicious_prettier.js"
        }
        ```
    5. Open VS Code and open the `malicious-workspace` folder.
    6. Ensure that Workspace Trust is either disabled globally in VS Code settings (`"security.workspace.trust.enabled": false`) or that you choose to "Trust" the workspace when prompted (to allow `prettier.prettierPath` setting to take effect).
    7. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `test.js`) in the `malicious-workspace` with any content that Prettier can format.
    8. Open `test.js` in the editor and trigger formatting by running the "Format Document" command (or enabling "Format On Save").
    9. After formatting, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` exists on your system. If it exists and contains "PWNED!", it indicates that the malicious code in `malicious_prettier.js` was executed, confirming the vulnerability.
