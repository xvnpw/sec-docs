- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary module loading in worker thread
- Description: The `prettier-instance-worker.js` uses `require(modulePath)` to load the Prettier module in a worker thread based on the `modulePath` received from the main thread. If a malicious actor can control the `modulePath`, they could potentially load and execute arbitrary code within the worker thread's context when the extension attempts to format a document. An attacker could craft a malicious Javascript file and trick the extension into loading it as a Prettier module.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution within the worker thread's context. This could lead to various malicious activities such as data exfiltration, installing backdoors, or compromising the user's environment, depending on the permissions and capabilities of the worker thread and the VSCode extension host.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None apparent in the provided code snippet. The code directly uses `require(modulePath)` without any validation or sanitization of `modulePath`.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for `modulePath` to ensure it only points to legitimate Prettier modules or paths within the extension's expected scope.
    - Restricting the paths from which modules can be loaded to a predefined safe list.
    - Sandboxing or isolating the worker thread to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Code signature verification for loaded modules.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to find a way to control or influence the `modulePath` that is sent to the worker thread. This might be achieved by manipulating VS Code settings, workspace configurations, or exploiting other input mechanisms of the VSCode extension.
    - The VS Code workspace must not be in "untrusted workspace" mode, as this mode restricts loading of external modules.
- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js`
    - Step 1: The `parentPort.on("message", ...)` function is the entry point for messages from the main extension thread to the worker thread.
    - Step 2: Inside the message handler, the `callMethod` case is triggered when the main thread wants to invoke a method on the Prettier instance in the worker.
    - Step 3: The `payload.modulePath` from the message is directly passed to the `requireInstance` function.
    - Step 4: The `requireInstance` function uses `require(modulePath)` to load the module without any validation or sanitization of the `modulePath`.
    - Step 5: If a malicious `modulePath` is provided (e.g., pointing to a file on a network share or a local directory controlled by the attacker), `require()` will execute the code within that file in the context of the worker thread.

    ```
    [/code/src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js]
    parentPort.on("message", ({ type, id, payload }) => {
      switch (type) {
        case "callMethod": {
          const { modulePath, methodName, methodArgs } = payload; // modulePath is taken from message payload
          ...
          let prettierInstance = path2ModuleCache.get(modulePath);
          if (!prettierInstance) {
            try {
              prettierInstance = requireInstance(modulePath); // modulePath is used in require()
            } catch (error) {
              postError(error);
            }
          }
          ...
        }
      }
    });

    function requireInstance(modulePath) {
      ...
      prettierInstance = require(modulePath); // Vulnerability: Unvalidated modulePath in require()
      ...
      return prettierInstance;
    }
    ```

- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Create a malicious Javascript file named `malicious-prettier.js` with the following content in a world-writable temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp/malicious-prettier.js`):
    ```javascript
    // malicious-prettier.js
    module.exports = {
        version: '3.0.0', // Pretend to be a valid prettier module
        format: () => {
            // Malicious code execution - exfiltrate environment variables
            const fs = require('fs');
            fs.writeFileSync('/tmp/prettier-exfiltrated-env.json', JSON.stringify(process.env));
            return 'formatted by malicious prettier';
        },
        clearConfigCache: () => {},
        getSupportInfo: () => { return { languages: [] }; },
        getFileInfo: () => { return { ignored: false }; },
        resolveConfigFile: () => null,
        resolveConfig: () => null,
    };
    ```
    - Step 2: Configure the VS Code Prettier extension to use this malicious file as the Prettier module. This can be done by setting the `prettier.prettierPath` setting in VS Code settings.json to `/tmp/malicious-prettier.js`.
    - Step 3: Open any Javascript file in VS Code.
    - Step 4: Trigger document formatting by using the "Format Document" command (Shift+Alt+F or right-click and select "Format Document").
    - Step 5: After formatting, check if the file `/tmp/prettier-exfiltrated-env.json` exists and contains the environment variables. If the file is created and contains environment variables, it confirms that the malicious code in `malicious-prettier.js` was executed by the extension due to arbitrary module loading.
    - Step 6: Examine the formatted document. It should contain "formatted by malicious prettier", indicating the malicious module was indeed loaded and used for formatting.
