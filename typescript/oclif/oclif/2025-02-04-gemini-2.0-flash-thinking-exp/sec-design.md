# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, oclif, aims to provide a robust and extensible framework for building command-line interfaces (CLIs) in Node.js. The primary business priority is to empower developers to create high-quality, user-friendly CLIs efficiently. The goal is to establish oclif as the leading framework for Node.js CLI development, fostering a strong community and ecosystem around it.

Key business risks associated with this project include:

- Security vulnerabilities in the oclif framework could be inherited by all CLIs built using it, potentially impacting a wide range of users and systems.
- Poor design or lack of usability in oclif could hinder developer adoption and limit its impact, failing to achieve the goal of becoming the leading framework.
- Insufficient community support or documentation could lead to developer frustration and slower adoption rates.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the oclif project are based on standard open-source software development practices and the GitHub platform.

- security control: Code reviews are conducted via GitHub pull requests before merging code changes. This process is described in the project's contribution guidelines and is visible in the pull request history on GitHub.
- security control: Dependency management is enforced using `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent and reproducible builds. This file is present in the repository root.
- security control: Static code analysis and linting are likely employed during development, although specific tools and configurations are not explicitly documented in the repository. It is assumed that standard JavaScript/Node.js linters are used.
- accepted risk: As an open-source project, vulnerabilities, once discovered and publicly disclosed, become known to a wider audience, potentially increasing the window of opportunity for exploitation before patches are widely adopted.

Recommended security controls to enhance the security posture of the oclif project:

- security control: Implement automated security scanning of dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or dedicated dependency scanning services in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits of the oclif codebase, potentially engaging external security experts to review the framework for vulnerabilities.
- security control: Incorporate input validation best practices into the oclif framework itself, providing developers with tools and guidance to easily validate CLI inputs and prevent common injection vulnerabilities in CLIs built with oclif.

Security requirements for the oclif project and CLIs built with it:

- Authentication: While oclif itself does not directly handle authentication, CLIs built with oclif frequently require authentication to access protected resources. Oclif should provide patterns and best practices for implementing secure authentication mechanisms within CLIs, such as using secure credential storage and established authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, API keys).
- Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is typically implemented within CLIs built with oclif. Oclif should offer guidance on implementing robust authorization models, ensuring that CLIs can control access to sensitive operations based on user roles or permissions.
- Input Validation: Input validation is critical for CLIs to prevent vulnerabilities like command injection, path traversal, and cross-site scripting (in CLI outputs that might be rendered in a browser or other UI). Oclif must emphasize and facilitate input validation for all CLI arguments and options. This includes validating data types, formats, and ranges, as well as sanitizing inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Cryptography: CLIs often handle sensitive data and require cryptographic operations for secure communication, data storage, or integrity checks. Oclif should not directly implement cryptography, but it should ensure that CLIs built with oclif can easily integrate secure cryptographic libraries and follow best practices for key management and cryptographic algorithm selection.

## DEPLOYMENT

Oclif framework itself is primarily deployed as an npm package. CLIs built with oclif can be deployed in various ways depending on their purpose and target users. Possible deployment scenarios for CLIs include:

1.  **npm Global Installation:** CLIs can be published to npm and installed globally using `npm install -g <cli-name>`. This makes the CLI available system-wide.
2.  **npm Local Installation:** CLIs can be installed locally within a project using `npm install <cli-name>`. This makes the CLI available within the project's `node_modules/.bin` directory.
3.  **Standalone Executables:** CLIs can be packaged into standalone executables using tools like `pkg` or `nexe`. This allows distribution and execution without requiring Node.js to be pre-installed.
4.  **Containerized Deployment:** CLIs can be containerized using Docker and deployed in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

For the purpose of this design document, we will focus on the **npm Global Installation** scenario for the oclif framework itself and a CLI built with oclif.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by oclif and CLIs built with it:

- Development and distribution of command-line tools: Oclif facilitates the creation and distribution of CLIs, which are essential tools for developers and system administrators. Disruptions or vulnerabilities in oclif can impact the entire ecosystem of CLIs built with it.
- Automation and scripting: CLIs are often used for automation and scripting tasks. Vulnerabilities in CLIs can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise through malicious scripts.

Data being protected and its sensitivity:

- Source code of oclif framework: Publicly available on GitHub, low sensitivity in terms of confidentiality, but integrity and availability are crucial. Tampering with the source code or making it unavailable would severely impact the project and its users.
- Source code of CLIs built with oclif: Sensitivity depends on the specific CLI. Some CLIs might be open-source, while others might be proprietary and contain sensitive business logic or algorithms. The sensitivity ranges from low to high depending on the CLI.
- Configuration data for oclif and CLIs: Configuration data might contain sensitive information like API keys, credentials, or database connection strings. The sensitivity is high for configuration data containing secrets.
- User input to CLIs: User input can be potentially malicious and needs to be treated with caution. Input validation is crucial to prevent injection attacks and protect the CLI and underlying systems. Sensitivity of user input depends on the context of the CLI and the data being processed.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What specific static analysis tools and linters are currently used in the oclif project's CI/CD pipeline?
- Are there any plans for formal security audits of the oclif framework?
- Are there any guidelines or best practices documented for developers building CLIs with oclif regarding security aspects like input validation, authentication, and authorization?
- What mechanisms are in place to verify the integrity and authenticity of oclif packages published to npm?

Assumptions:

- The oclif project follows standard open-source development best practices, including code reviews and dependency management.
- Security is considered an important aspect by the oclif maintainers, although it might not be explicitly documented in detail.
- The oclif project relies on the security features provided by the Node.js runtime and the npm ecosystem.
- CLIs built with oclif are expected to implement their own security measures for authentication, authorization, and data protection, as oclif primarily provides the framework structure and not built-in security features for these aspects.
