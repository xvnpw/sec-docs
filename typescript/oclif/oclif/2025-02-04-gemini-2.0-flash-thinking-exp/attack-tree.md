## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Command Parsing Vulnerabilities -> Command Injection:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_command_parsing_vulnerabilities_-_command_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Command Injection occurs when an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into arguments that are processed and executed by the application's system shell.
    *   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        *   **Exploit Command Parsing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the broad category of attacks targeting how Oclif parses commands.
        *   **Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:** The specific vulnerability of injecting shell commands.
        *   **Argument passed to shell execution (e.g., `exec`, `spawn`) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  The condition where a command argument is directly used in shell execution, creating the injection point.
        *   **Insufficient input sanitization/validation [CRITICAL NODE]:** The root cause that allows command injection to be successful. Lack of proper input checks enables malicious commands to be passed through.
    *   **Breakdown of Steps:**
        *   **Identify vulnerable command argument:** The attacker first needs to find a command argument that is used in a way that allows shell execution.
        *   **Argument passed to shell execution (e.g., `exec`, `spawn`):** Confirm that this argument indeed reaches a shell execution function in the application's code.
        *   **Insufficient input sanitization/validation:** Verify that the application does not properly sanitize or validate this argument, allowing shell metacharacters or commands to be injected.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and complete control over the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Plugin System Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Plugin Installation:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_plugin_system_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious Plugin Installation involves tricking a user or system into installing a plugin that contains malicious code.
    *   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        *   **Exploit Plugin System Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Attacks targeting the plugin mechanism of Oclif.
        *   **Malicious Plugin Installation [CRITICAL NODE]:** The specific attack of installing a harmful plugin.
        *   **Social Engineering / Deception [CRITICAL NODE]:**  The method used to trick users into installing malicious plugins.
        *   **Trick user into installing malicious plugin (e.g., typosquatting, fake documentation):** Specific social engineering techniques to deceive users.
        *   **Plugin Registry Compromise (less likely, but consider supply chain) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  A more advanced attack where the plugin source itself is compromised.
        *   **Compromise npm registry or similar plugin source:**  Targeting the central repository of plugins.
    *   **Breakdown of Steps:**
        *   **Social Engineering / Deception:** The attacker crafts a scenario to deceive a user into installing a malicious plugin. This could involve:
            *   **Typosquatting:** Creating a plugin with a name similar to a popular legitimate plugin, hoping users will misspell the name during installation.
            *   **Fake Documentation:** Creating fake documentation or tutorials that recommend installing a malicious plugin.
        *   **Trick user into installing malicious plugin:** The user, deceived by social engineering, installs the malicious plugin.
        *   **Plugin Registry Compromise (less likely, but consider supply chain):** Alternatively, in a more sophisticated attack, the attacker could compromise the plugin registry itself and inject malicious code into legitimate plugins or updates.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Malicious plugins can execute arbitrary code within the application's context upon installation or execution. This can lead to data theft, system compromise, backdoors, and complete application takeover. Supply chain compromise via plugin registry is even more devastating as it can affect many users.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Plugin System Vulnerabilities -> Vulnerable Plugin Code:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_plugin_system_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerable_plugin_code.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Vulnerable Plugin Code exploits security flaws within the code of a plugin or its dependencies.
    *   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        *   **Exploit Plugin System Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attacks targeting the plugin mechanism.
        *   **Vulnerable Plugin Code [CRITICAL NODE]:** The specific vulnerability arising from flaws in plugin code.
        *   **Plugin dependencies have known vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Vulnerabilities originating from the plugin's dependencies.
    *   **Breakdown of Steps:**
        *   **Plugin contains vulnerabilities (code flaws, dependency issues):** A plugin, either due to poor coding practices or outdated dependencies, contains security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Plugin dependencies have known vulnerabilities:** Specifically, the plugin's dependencies are identified to have known exploitable vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Vulnerable plugins can be exploited in various ways depending on the nature of the vulnerability. This could range from information disclosure and data manipulation to remote code execution, depending on the specific flaw and the plugin's privileges within the application. Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities is a common and easily automated attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Oclif Core and Plugins -> Outdated Oclif Core Dependencies & Outdated Plugin Dependencies:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_oclif_core_and_plugins_-_outdated_oclif_core_dependencies_&_7eb553a2.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies used by Oclif core or its plugins.
    *   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        *   **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Oclif Core and Plugins [CRITICAL NODE]:** Broad category of attacks targeting dependencies.
        *   **Outdated Oclif Core Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:** Vulnerabilities in dependencies of Oclif core.
        *   **Known vulnerabilities in dependencies are exploitable [CRITICAL NODE]:** The core issue of exploitable flaws in dependencies.
        *   **Outdated Plugin Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:** Vulnerabilities in dependencies of plugins.
    *   **Breakdown of Steps:**
        *   **Oclif core/Plugins use vulnerable dependencies:** Identify that Oclif core or a plugin is using outdated dependencies.
        *   **Dependencies not regularly updated:** Confirm that the dependencies are not being kept up-to-date, increasing the likelihood of known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Known vulnerabilities in dependencies are exploitable:** Verify that these outdated dependencies have known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Critical. The impact depends heavily on the specific vulnerability in the outdated dependency. Some vulnerabilities might lead to information disclosure or DoS, while others can allow remote code execution, leading to critical system compromise. Dependency vulnerabilities are often easily exploitable with readily available exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Insecure User-Written Command Logic -> SQL Injection (if command interacts with database):](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_insecure_user-written_command_logic_-_sql_injection__if_command_interacts_with_database_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** SQL Injection occurs when user-provided input is improperly incorporated into SQL queries, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query and potentially gain unauthorized access to or modify database data.
    *   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Command Handlers [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Focus on vulnerabilities introduced in the application's command logic.
        *   **SQL Injection (if command interacts with database) [CRITICAL NODE]:** The specific vulnerability of SQL Injection.
    *   **Breakdown of Steps:**
        *   **Developer introduces vulnerabilities in command logic:** The developer writing the command handler code fails to properly sanitize user input that is used in database queries.
        *   **SQL Injection (if command interacts with database):** If the command handler interacts with a database, and user input is directly used in SQL queries without proper parameterization or escaping, SQL injection becomes possible.
    *   **Impact:** Critical (if DB contains sensitive data). SQL Injection can allow attackers to bypass authentication, read sensitive data from the database, modify or delete data, and in some cases, even execute operating system commands on the database server. If the database contains critical or sensitive information, the impact is severe.
