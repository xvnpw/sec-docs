# Threat Model Analysis for oclif/oclif

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation
*   **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious oclif plugin from an untrusted source. The attacker could distribute this plugin through social engineering, compromised websites, or by impersonating legitimate plugin sources. Once installed, the malicious plugin can execute arbitrary code within the context of the CLI application.
*   **Impact:** Installation of malware, backdoors, or other malicious code on the user's system. This can lead to data theft, system compromise, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected oclif component:** `@oclif/plugin-plugins` module (specifically, plugin installation and management functionalities).
*   **Risk severity:** High
*   **Mitigation strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Signing and Verification:** Implement plugin signing and verification mechanisms to ensure plugins are from trusted developers and haven't been tampered with.
    *   **Trusted Plugin Repositories:** Recommend or enforce the use of official or trusted plugin repositories. Clearly communicate the risks of installing plugins from unknown sources to users.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing/Permissions (Advanced):** Explore and implement plugin sandboxing or permission models to limit the capabilities of plugins and restrict their access to sensitive system resources.
    *   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of installing plugins from untrusted sources and provide clear instructions on how to safely manage plugins.

## Threat: [Malicious Updates (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/malicious_updates__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Updates (Supply Chain Attack)
*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the update mechanism of the oclif application to distribute malicious updates to users. This could involve compromising the update server, intercepting update communications (if insecure channels are used), or exploiting vulnerabilities in the update process itself. Users unknowingly download and install a compromised version of the CLI application.
*   **Impact:** Widespread distribution of malware or compromised versions of the CLI application to users. This can affect a large number of systems and lead to significant data breaches, system compromise, and loss of user trust.
*   **Affected oclif component:** `@oclif/plugin-update` module (if used for auto-updates) or custom update mechanisms implemented by the developer.
*   **Risk severity:** High
*   **Mitigation strategies:**
    *   **Secure Update Channels (HTTPS):** Use HTTPS for all update communication to ensure confidentiality and integrity and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Code Signing for Updates:** Digitally sign application updates to guarantee authenticity and integrity. Verify signatures before applying updates to ensure they originate from a trusted source and haven't been tampered with.
    *   **Update Integrity Verification (Checksums/Hashes):** Use checksums or cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of downloaded updates before installation.
    *   **Secure Update Server Infrastructure:** Harden and secure the infrastructure hosting the update server to prevent unauthorized access and tampering. Implement access controls, monitoring, and regular security audits.
