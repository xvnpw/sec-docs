## Attack Tree Path: [1. Plugin Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK] (Overall Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__plugin_vulnerabilities__high_risk___overall_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path focuses on exploiting weaknesses related to oclif's plugin system.  The plugin architecture extends the functionality of the core CLI, but it also introduces a significant attack surface.
*   **Why High Risk:** Plugins can be developed by third parties, and users may install them from various sources, increasing the risk of malicious or vulnerable code being introduced.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a. Malicious Plugin Installation [HIGH RISK] (Sub-Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_a__malicious_plugin_installation__high_risk___sub-path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker tricks the user into installing a malicious plugin or compromises the plugin distribution mechanism.
*   **Why High Risk:** Direct execution of attacker-controlled code within the oclif application context.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.1. Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_1__social_engineering.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Description:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing emails, fake websites) to persuade the user to install a malicious plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.2. Typosquatting](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_2__typosquatting.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Description:** The attacker creates a plugin with a name very similar to a legitimate plugin, hoping users will accidentally install the malicious one.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.a.3. Compromised Plugin Repository](./attack_tree_paths/1_a_3__compromised_plugin_repository.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Description:** The attacker compromises the official plugin repository or a commonly used third-party repository, allowing them to distribute malicious plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b. Vulnerable Dependency in Plugin [HIGH RISK] (Sub-Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_b__vulnerable_dependency_in_plugin__high_risk___sub-path_.md)

*   **Description:** A legitimate plugin includes a vulnerable third-party library.
*   **Why High Risk/Critical:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in dependencies is a common and often easy attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b.1. Known Vulnerability (CVE) {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1_b_1__known_vulnerability__cve__{critical}.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Description:** The plugin uses a library with a publicly known vulnerability. Attackers can often find readily available exploit code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b.2. Zero-Day Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/1_b_2__zero-day_vulnerability.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Description:** The plugin uses a library with an unknown vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.b.3 Supply Chain Attack](./attack_tree_paths/1_b_3_supply_chain_attack.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** High to Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Description:** The dependency itself is compromised at its source.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Command Argument/Flag Injection [HIGH RISK] (Overall Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3__command_argumentflag_injection__high_risk___overall_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path focuses on exploiting how the application *using* oclif handles user-supplied input (arguments and flags) passed to oclif commands.
*   **Why High Risk:**  This is a classic attack vector, and vulnerabilities in application-specific code are often easier to find than in well-vetted frameworks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.a. Unsanitized Input to oclif API [HIGH RISK] (Sub-Path)](./attack_tree_paths/3_a__unsanitized_input_to_oclif_api__high_risk___sub-path_.md)

*   **Description:** The application doesn't properly sanitize user input before passing it to oclif's API.
*   **Why High Risk/Critical:**  Leads to classic injection vulnerabilities with potentially severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.a.1. Shell Injection {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3_a_1__shell_injection_{critical}.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Description:** User input is used to construct shell commands without proper escaping, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary shell code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.a.2. SQL Injection (if oclif interacts with a database) {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3_a_2__sql_injection__if_oclif_interacts_with_a_database__{critical}.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Description:** Unsanitized user input is used in SQL queries, allowing attackers to manipulate the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.a.3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (if oclif output is displayed in a web interface) {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3_a_3__cross-site_scripting__xss___if_oclif_output_is_displayed_in_a_web_interface__{critical}.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Description:**  oclif command output containing unsanitized user input is displayed in a web interface without proper escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.b. Command Overloading {CRITICAL} (Overall Node)](./attack_tree_paths/3_b__command_overloading_{critical}__overall_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting how oclif handles multiple flags or arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
*   **Why Critical:** Highlights the importance of thorough testing and input validation for all command-line interactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.b.1. Unexpected Flag Combinations](./attack_tree_paths/3_b_1__unexpected_flag_combinations.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium
