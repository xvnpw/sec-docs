### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in `askpass.sh` via Unsanitized Arguments

- **Description:**
    1. The `askpass.sh` script is used to handle password prompts for Git operations within the Git Graph extension.
    2. This script takes arguments from Git and passes them to a Node.js script (`VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE`, `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN`). Specifically, arguments from Git command are passed as `$*` to the Node.js script.
    3. The `askpass.sh` script uses `$*` to pass all arguments directly to the Node.js script without sanitization.
    4. The Node.js script (`askpassMain.ts`) receives these arguments, specifically `argv[2]` as `request` and `argv[4]` as part of `host`, and uses them to construct a prompt message in a VSCode input box.
    5. While `askpassMain.ts` itself does not directly execute shell commands based on these arguments, the vulnerability arises from the initial unsanitized passing of arguments in `askpass.sh`.
    6. If Git commands constructed by the extension pass user-controlled or externally influenced strings as arguments that eventually reach `askpass.sh`, an attacker could inject malicious commands.
    7. By crafting specific Git commands that trigger the `askpass.sh` script and include malicious payloads in arguments (e.g., username, remote URL), an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system. The exact injection point needs to be within the Git command construction and argument passing logic in the extension's codebase (files not yet provided).

- **Impact:**
    - Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the machine where the VSCode extension is running.
    - This could lead to various malicious activities, including data theft, system compromise, installation of malware, or further propagation of attacks within the network.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Based on the provided files, there are no explicit mitigations visible in the `askpass.sh` script itself or in the Node.js `askpassMain.ts` script.
    - The current PROJECT FILES batch (`/code/web/settingsWidget.ts`) does not include any changes or mitigations for this vulnerability.
    - No mitigations are implemented in the newly provided files.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input sanitization in `askpass.sh`**: Before passing arguments to the Node.js script, `askpass.sh` should sanitize the input to prevent shell command injection. This could involve validating and escaping shell arguments.
    - **Input sanitization within the Node.js askpass script (`askpassMain.ts`)**: Although `askpassMain.ts` itself does not execute shell commands with the arguments, sanitization here could provide defense in depth if arguments are later used in an unsafe manner.
    - **Secure Git command construction in the extension**: The extension code that constructs and executes Git commands (files not yet provided) must be reviewed to ensure that user-controlled input or external data is not directly incorporated into Git command arguments without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    - **Consider safer alternatives to shell script for handling password prompts**: Explore if password prompts can be handled directly within Node.js or using safer APIs to avoid shell command injection risks altogether.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The Git Graph extension must be installed and active in VSCode.
    - The attacker needs to trigger a Git operation that uses the `askpass.sh` script for authentication (e.g., accessing a private repository over HTTPS or SSH that requires password authentication).
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the arguments passed to the `askpass.sh` script via the Git command. This influence point would be in the Git command construction logic within the extension's source code (files not yet provided).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/src/askpass/askpass.sh` (No changes in current PROJECT FILES batch, analysis remains the same)
    - ```sh
      #!/bin/sh
      VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE=`mktemp`
      VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" $*
      cat $VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE
      rm $VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE
      ```
    - **Vulnerable Step:** The line `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" $*` is vulnerable because `$*` expands to all arguments passed to `askpass.sh` and is directly appended to the command executed without sanitization.
    - **File:** `/code/src/askpass/askpassMain.ts` (No changes in current PROJECT FILES batch, analysis remains the same)
    - ```typescript
      import * as fs from 'fs';
      import * as http from 'http';

      function fatal(err: any): void { ... }
      function main(argv: string[]): void {
          if (argv.length !== 5) return fatal('Wrong number of arguments');
          if (!process.env['VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_HANDLE']) return fatal('Missing handle');
          if (!process.env['VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE']) return fatal('Missing pipe');

          const output = process.env['VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE']!;
          const socketPath = process.env['VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_HANDLE']!;

          const req = http.request({ socketPath, path: '/', method: 'POST' }, res => { ... });

          req.on('error', () => fatal('Error in request'));
          req.write(JSON.stringify({ request: argv[2], host: argv[4].substring(1, argv[4].length - 2) })); // Arguments are used here
          req.end();
      }
      main(process.argv);
      ```
    - **Argument Usage in `askpassMain.ts`:**  `askpassMain.ts` uses `argv[2]` as the `request` and extracts host information from `argv[4]` to construct the prompt message for the VSCode input box. While `askpassMain.ts` itself does not execute shell commands with these arguments, the unsanitized nature of how `askpass.sh` passes these arguments from Git commands is still a concern. The vulnerability relies on the Git command construction and argument passing logic within the extension's main codebase (files not yet analyzed) to be the eventual injection point.

    - **Visualization:** (No changes, visualization from previous analysis remains valid)

    ```
    [Git Command with Askpass] --> askpass.sh (arguments: $* from Git command)
                                        |
                                        V
    askpass.sh executes:  [Node.js executable] [Node.js askpass script] $*
                                        |
                                        V
    [Node.js askpass script processes arguments ($*) to build prompt - ARGUMENTS ARE USED HERE]
                                        |
                                        V
    [Node.js askpass script outputs password to pipe]
                                        |
                                        V
    askpass.sh reads password from pipe using 'cat'
                                        |
                                        V
    [Password returned to Git Command]
    ```

- **Security Test Case:** (No changes, test case from previous analysis remains valid)
    1. **Precondition:** Set up a private Git repository that requires password authentication over HTTPS. Ensure that Git Graph extension is active and configured to handle Git operations for this repository.
    2. **Craft Malicious Git Command:** Construct a Git command that will trigger the `askpass.sh` script and allows injecting arguments. For example, try to clone the private repository with a specially crafted username or repository URL that includes shell injection payloads.
        - Example Git clone command (proof of concept - might need adjustments based on how Git and extension handle URLs and usernames):
          ```bash
          git clone https://"$(touch /tmp/pwned_askpass_username_injection)".attacker.com@github.com/user/repo.git
          ```
          or
          ```bash
          git clone https://user:'"$(touch /tmp/pwned_askpass_password_injection)"'@github.com/user/repo.git
          ```
        - **Note:** The exact injection point and syntax might require experimentation as it depends on how Git passes arguments to askpass and how the Node.js script processes them. The goal is to have the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned_askpass_injection` executed on the system.
    3. **Execute Git Command in VSCode:** Use the Git Graph extension to initiate the crafted Git command (e.g., try to add the repository using "Add Git Repository..." if direct clone command is not easily triggered through the extension UI, or perform a Fetch/Pull operation).
    4. **Observe System for Command Execution:** After executing the Git command, check if the injected command was executed. In the example above, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_askpass_username_injection` or `/tmp/pwned_askpass_password_injection` was created.
    5. **Verify Vulnerability:** If the file `/tmp/pwned_askpass_injection` is created, it confirms that command injection was successful via arguments passed to `askpass.sh`.

This vulnerability requires further investigation of the Git command construction logic within the Git Graph extension's codebase (files not yet provided) to pinpoint the exact injection vector and confirm exploitability. The direct passing of `$*` in `askpass.sh` remains a critical security concern.

---
**Note:** No new vulnerabilities with a rank of high or above were identified in the provided PROJECT FILES (`/code/web/settingsWidget.ts`). The `Command Injection in askpass.sh via Unsanitized Arguments` vulnerability remains valid based on the current analysis and is still considered a critical risk. Further investigation of the Git command construction logic in the extension and potential sanitization in `askpass.sh` is still required.
