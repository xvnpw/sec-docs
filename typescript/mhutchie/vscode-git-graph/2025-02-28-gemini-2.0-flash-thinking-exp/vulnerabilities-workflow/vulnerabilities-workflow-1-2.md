Based on your instructions, both listed vulnerabilities meet the inclusion criteria (valid, not mitigated, rank >= high) and do not fall under the exclusion criteria (not due to insecure code patterns in project files, not only missing documentation, not DoS).

Therefore, the updated vulnerability list is the same as the original list. Here it is in markdown format:

## Vulnerability List for Git Graph Extension

* Vulnerability Name: **Command Injection via Integrated Terminal Shell Setting**
* Description: The "Integrated Terminal Shell" setting allows users to specify the path to a shell executable. If a malicious user can modify this setting (e.g., through workspace settings in a shared repository or by tricking a user into importing a malicious settings file), they could inject arbitrary commands into the shell path. When Git Graph opens a terminal using this setting, the injected commands would be executed.
* Impact: Critical. Arbitrary code execution in the context of the VSCode extension host. An attacker could gain full control of the user's machine, steal credentials, or modify files.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The extension directly uses the user-provided path without validation.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the "Integrated Terminal Shell" setting.
    - Restricting the setting scope to User Settings only, preventing workspace-level modification.
    - Displaying a warning message to users when they are about to open a terminal using a custom shell, especially if it's not a standard shell path.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to modify the "git-graph.integratedTerminalShell" setting. This could be achieved through:
        - Workspace settings in a shared repository.
        - Tricking a user into importing a malicious settings file.
        - Compromising the user's machine to modify user settings.
    - The user must then trigger an action that opens the integrated terminal from Git Graph, such as an interactive rebase.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/config.ts` (Not provided in PROJECT FILES, assuming from CURRENT_VULNERABILITIES)
    ```typescript
    get integratedTerminalShell() {
        return this.config.get('integratedTerminalShell', '');
    }
    ```
    This code snippet (assumed to be in `config.ts`) shows that the `integratedTerminalShell` setting is directly retrieved from the configuration without any validation.

    - File: `/code/src/utils.ts`
    ```typescript
    export function openGitTerminal(cwd: string, gitPath: string, command: string | null, name: string) {
        let p = process.env['PATH'] || '', sep = isWindows() ? ';' : ':';
        if (p !== '' && !p.endsWith(sep)) p += sep;
        p += path.dirname(gitPath);

        const options: vscode.TerminalOptions = {
            cwd: cwd,
            name: 'Git Graph: ' + name,
            env: { 'PATH': p }
        };
        const shell = getConfig().integratedTerminalShell; // Calls the config.ts getter
        if (shell !== '') options.shellPath = shell; // <-- Vulnerability here

        const terminal = vscode.window.createTerminal(options);
        if (command !== null) {
            terminal.sendText('git ' + command);
        }
        terminal.show();
    }
    ```
    In `utils.ts`, the `openGitTerminal` function retrieves the `integratedTerminalShell` setting using `getConfig().integratedTerminalShell`, which in turn calls the getter in `config.ts`. This `shell` variable, which is directly derived from user configuration, is then assigned to `options.shellPath` without any sanitization or validation before being passed to `vscode.window.createTerminal(options)`. This direct usage of user-controlled configuration as `shellPath` leads to the command injection vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Set the "git-graph.integratedTerminalShell" setting in workspace settings to a malicious command, for example: `/bin/bash -c "touch /tmp/pwned"` (or `cmd.exe /c "echo pwned > %TEMP%\\pwned.txt"` on Windows).
    2. Open Git Graph for a repository.
    3. Initiate an action that opens the integrated terminal (e.g., start an interactive rebase from a branch context menu).
    4. Observe that the malicious command is executed when the terminal is opened. In this example, a file named "pwned" should be created in the `/tmp` directory (or in the `%TEMP%` directory on Windows).

* Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `git-graph.integratedTerminalShell` setting.
    - Restricting the setting scope to User Settings only.
    - Warning message when custom shell is used.

* Vulnerability Name: **Potential Open Redirect in Pull Request Creation URLs**
* Description: The Pull Request Creation feature in Git Graph allows users to configure custom Pull Request providers using a template URL. If a malicious user provides a template URL that leads to an open redirect vulnerability on a pull request platform (like GitHub, GitLab, or a custom provider), an attacker could potentially craft a malicious link. If a victim clicks such a crafted pull request link, they could be redirected to a malicious website after briefly visiting the legitimate pull request platform.
* Impact: High. Open redirect can be used for phishing attacks. An attacker could trick users into visiting malicious websites that look like legitimate login pages or software download sites, potentially leading to credential theft or malware installation.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The extension uses the user-provided template URL directly to construct the pull request link.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the template URL to prevent open redirects.
    - Checking and validating the domain of the generated pull request URL against a whitelist of trusted pull request platforms.
    - Displaying a warning message to users when opening a pull request link, especially if it's for a custom provider.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to configure a custom Pull Request provider or modify an existing one (e.g., through workspace settings in a shared repository or by tricking a user into importing a malicious settings file).
    - The configured template URL must contain an open redirect vulnerability on the pull request platform.
    - The user must then trigger the "Create Pull Request" action, and click on the generated link.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/config.ts` (Not provided in PROJECT FILES, assuming from CURRENT_VULNERABILITIES)
    ```typescript
    get customPullRequestProviders(): CustomPullRequestProvider[] {
        let providers = this.config.get('customPullRequestProviders', <any[]>[]);
        return Array.isArray(providers)
            ? providers
                .filter((provider) => typeof provider.name === 'string' && typeof provider.templateUrl === 'string')
                .map((provider) => ({ name: provider.name, templateUrl: provider.templateUrl }))
            : [];
    }
    ```
    This code (assumed to be in `config.ts`) retrieves the `customPullRequestProviders` setting and maps the `templateUrl` directly without any validation.

    - File: `/code/src/utils.ts`
    ```typescript
    export function createPullRequest(config: PullRequestConfig, sourceOwner: string, sourceRepo: string, sourceBranch: string) {
        let templateUrl;
        switch (config.provider) {
            case PullRequestProvider.Bitbucket:
                templateUrl = '$1/$2/$3/pull-requests/new?source=$2/$3::$4&dest=$5/$6::$8';
                break;
            case PullRequestProvider.Custom:
                templateUrl = config.custom.templateUrl; // <-- Vulnerability here
                break;
            case PullRequestProvider.GitHub:
                templateUrl = '$1/$5/$6/compare/$8...$2:$4';
                break;
            case PullRequestProvider.GitLab:
                templateUrl = '$1/$2/$3/-/merge_requests/new?merge_request[source_branch]=$4&merge_request[target_branch]=$8' +
                    (config.destProjectId !== '' ? '&merge_request[target_project_id]=$7' : '');
                break;
        }

        const urlFieldValues = [
            config.hostRootUrl,
            sourceOwner, sourceRepo, sourceBranch,
            config.destOwner, config.destRepo, config.destProjectId, config.destBranch
        ];

        const url = templateUrl.replace(/\$([1-8])/g, (_, index) => urlFieldValues[parseInt(index) - 1]);

        return openExternalUrl(url, 'Pull Request URL');
    }
    ```
    In `utils.ts`, the `createPullRequest` function directly uses the `templateUrl` from the configuration for `PullRequestProvider.Custom` without any validation. The function then substitutes placeholders in the `templateUrl` but does not validate the final URL before calling `openExternalUrl(url, 'Pull Request URL')`. This allows for a malicious `templateUrl` containing an open redirect to be used, leading to the vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Configure a custom Pull Request provider with a template URL that contains an open redirect vulnerability. For example, if `https://github.com` has an open redirect at `https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph?redirect_uri=MALICIOUS_URL`, configure the template URL as `https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph?redirect_uri=$1`. Replace `$1` with a placeholder that will be substituted with the host URL (e.g., `$1` for host root URL).
    2. Open Git Graph for a repository.
    3. Right-click on a branch and select "Create Pull Request".
    4. Observe the generated Pull Request URL. It should contain the malicious redirect URL.
    5. Click on the "Create Pull Request" button.
    6. Observe that after briefly visiting the legitimate pull request platform (e.g., `github.com`), you are redirected to `MALICIOUS_URL`.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the template URL.
    - Whitelisting trusted domains for pull request URLs.
    - Warning message before opening pull request URLs, especially for custom providers.
