## Vulnerability List for Git Graph VSCode Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection via Arbitrary Git Configuration Settings
* Description:
    1. An attacker can modify the Git configuration (either local, global, or system config if permissions allow) to inject malicious commands.
    2. Git Graph uses Git commands extensively, and some commands might be influenced by Git configuration settings.
    3. If Git Graph executes a Git command that is affected by a malicious configuration, the injected commands from Git config could be executed.
    4. For example, if a Git command uses a feature that consults `hooksPath` or similar configuration and Git Graph executes this command, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code.
* Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided project files. The code in `dataSource.ts` executes Git commands using `cp.spawn` without any visible sanitization or validation of Git configurations that could influence command execution.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement sanitization of Git configuration values, especially for settings that can influence command execution paths or hook execution.
    - Consider running Git commands in a sandboxed environment, although this might be complex for a VSCode extension.
    - Review all Git commands executed by the extension and identify if any are susceptible to Git configuration injection.
* Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to have write access to Git configuration files (e.g., `.git/config` in a repository, global or system Git config if permissions allow). For external attacker, this is unlikely to be directly achievable in most scenarios. However, if an attacker can somehow influence a developer's environment setup or repository configuration, this becomes a valid precondition.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: /code/src/dataSource.ts**: The `DataSource` class is responsible for executing Git commands using `child_process.spawn`. Functions like `_spawnGit` and `spawnGit` are central to this process.
    2. **Command Execution**: The `_spawnGit` function in `dataSource.ts` directly uses `cp.spawn(this.gitExecutable.path, args, { cwd: repo, env: Object.assign({}, process.env, this.askpassEnv) })` to execute Git commands. The `args` are constructed based on extension logic and user actions, but there's no explicit sanitization against malicious Git configurations.
    3. **Configuration Influence**: Git commands can be influenced by various Git configuration settings. If a malicious user can modify Git configuration to inject commands (e.g., by altering `core.pager`, `core.editor`, `hooksPath`), and if Git Graph executes a command that respects these settings, command injection is possible.
    4. **Lack of Sanitization**: Examining `dataSource.ts` and `utils.ts`, there is no code that sanitizes or validates Git configuration values before executing Git commands. The environment variables are passed to `cp.spawn` using `Object.assign({}, process.env, this.askpassEnv)`, which includes the user's environment and potentially malicious Git configurations.
    5. **Visualization**:

        D --> E[Arbitrary Code Execution]
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a Git repository and open it in VSCode.
        - Configure a malicious Git config setting. For example, in the local repository `.git/config`, set `core.pager` to a malicious script:
        ```ini
        [core]
            pager = !/path/to/malicious/script.sh
        ```
        - Create a simple `malicious/script.sh` that, for example, creates a file in the `/tmp` directory:
        ```sh
        #!/bin/sh
        echo "Vulnerable" > /tmp/gitgraph_vulnerable
        ```
        - Make `malicious/script.sh` executable: `chmod +x malicious/script.sh`
        - Ensure that the `git.path` setting in VSCode points to the Git executable that will use this configuration.
    2. **Trigger:**
        - Open the Git Graph view for the repository.
        - Perform actions within Git Graph that might trigger the use of Git pager, or other potentially vulnerable Git commands (e.g., viewing commit details, which might use pager for long commit messages or diffs, depending on how Git Graph implements it). Actions involving Git config reading and manipulation should be particularly examined.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Check if the `/tmp/gitgraph_vulnerable` file exists after performing actions in Git Graph.
        - If the file exists, it indicates that the malicious script set in Git config was executed by Git Graph, proving the command injection vulnerability.

* Vulnerability Name: Potential XSS Vulnerability in Rendered Commit Messages via Markdown
* Description:
    1. Git Graph renders commit messages and tag details using a subset of Markdown.
    2. If the Markdown rendering process is not properly sanitized, an attacker could craft a commit message or tag message containing malicious Markdown, such as JavaScript code embedded in `<img>` or `<a>` tags.
    3. When Git Graph displays this commit message or tag detail in the webview, the malicious JavaScript could be executed, leading to XSS.
* Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Git Graph webview. This could potentially lead to session hijacking, sensitive data theft (if any is accessible in the webview context), or further exploitation within the VSCode environment.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The description mentions "Parse and render a frequently used subset of inline Markdown formatting rules... Markdown parsing can be disabled using the extension setting `git-graph.markdown`." However, based on the files, the exact sanitization implementation is not evident, and relying solely on a subset might not be sufficient to prevent all XSS vectors.
    - The `gitGraphView.ts` (not in current files) `getHtmlForWebview` function includes a Content Security Policy (CSP), which can help mitigate XSS by restricting the sources from which the webview can load resources and execute scripts. However, without reviewing the rendering logic, it's hard to assess if it's fully protected.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization of rendered Markdown content to prevent XSS attacks. Use a well-vetted Markdown sanitization library to ensure that all potential XSS vectors are effectively neutralized.
    - Review and strengthen CSP if needed to ensure it effectively restricts execution of inline scripts and loading of unsafe resources.
* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious Markdown into a commit message or tag message in a Git repository that is viewed using Git Graph. This is a common scenario in collaborative development environments where commit messages are often visible to multiple users.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: /code/src/gitGraphView.ts (not provided in PROJECT FILES but from previous analysis):**  Examine the `getHtmlForWebview` function, specifically how commit messages and tag details are rendered in the webview.
    2. **Markdown Rendering Logic:** Identify the code responsible for Markdown parsing and rendering. Look for the usage of any Markdown parsing libraries and check if they include sanitization mechanisms. If custom Markdown rendering is implemented, analyze it for potential XSS vulnerabilities, particularly in handling `<img>`, `<a>`, and `<script>` tags, or HTML attributes like `href` and `src`.
    3. **File: /code/CHANGELOG.md:**  The changelog for version 1.27.0 mentions "#364 Parse and render a frequently used subset of inline Markdown formatting rules... Markdown parsing can be disabled using the extension setting `git-graph.markdown`.". This confirms Markdown rendering is present and configurable, highlighting it as a potential area for XSS.
    4. **Security Review of Markdown Library/Implementation:** If a library is used, check its documentation regarding security and XSS prevention. If custom implementation is present, conduct a thorough security review of the code.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a Git repository and open it in VSCode.
        - Create a commit with a malicious Markdown payload in the commit message. For example:
        ```
        git commit -m "This commit contains <img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS Vulnerability!\")'> malicious code."
        ```
        - Alternatively, create an annotated tag with a similar malicious payload in the tag message.
    2. **Trigger:**
        - Open the Git Graph view for the repository.
        - View the Git Graph view and ensure that the commit (or tag) with the malicious Markdown is visible.
        - Open the Commit Details View for the commit containing the malicious payload.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Check if the alert box `"XSS Vulnerability!"` is displayed when the Commit Details View is opened.
        - If the alert box is displayed, it confirms that the malicious JavaScript embedded in the commit message was executed, proving the XSS vulnerability.
        - Also, test with other XSS vectors, such as `<a>` tags with `javascript:` URLs, and different Markdown injection techniques.

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure 'Integrated Terminal Shell' Setting leading to Potential Command Execution
* Description:
    1. The extension allows users to configure the 'Integrated Terminal Shell' setting (`git-graph.integratedTerminalShell`).
    2. This setting specifies the shell executable to be used when Git Graph opens the Visual Studio Code Integrated Terminal, for example, during interactive rebasing.
    3. If a user is tricked or unknowingly configures this setting to point to a malicious script instead of a legitimate shell executable, arbitrary commands can be executed when Git Graph attempts to open a terminal.
* Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The documentation for the setting states: "For security reasons, this setting can only be specified in the User Settings, not in the Workspace Settings." This is a partial mitigation, preventing repository-level configuration from overriding this setting, making it harder for attackers to directly inject malicious settings via repository configuration. However, it doesn't prevent a user from being socially engineered into changing their User Settings.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement validation and sanitization of the 'Integrated Terminal Shell' setting to ensure that it points to a known, legitimate shell executable.
    - Warn the user explicitly if the configured path is unusual or potentially insecure.
    - Consider removing or deprecating this setting entirely, as opening terminals with custom shells can introduce significant security risks.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must configure the 'Integrated Terminal Shell' setting to point to a malicious executable. This often requires social engineering or tricking the user into changing their settings.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: /code/src/config.ts (not provided in PROJECT FILES but from previous analysis):** Examine the `integratedTerminalShell` property in the `Config` class to confirm how this setting is retrieved and used.
    2. **File: /code/src/utils.ts:** Search for usages of `config.integratedTerminalShell` to identify where this setting is used. Specifically, look at the `openGitTerminal` function.
    3. **Code Flow Analysis:** The `openGitTerminal` function in `utils.ts` takes `gitPath` and `command` as arguments and uses `vscode.window.createTerminal({ shellPath: shell, ...options })` where `shell` is derived from `getConfig().integratedTerminalShell;`. There is no validation or sanitization of the `shell` path before using it to spawn a terminal.
    4. **Vulnerability**: If a user sets `git-graph.integratedTerminalShell` to a malicious script, then any action within Git Graph that calls `openGitTerminal` (e.g., interactive rebase as mentioned in `dataSource.ts`) will execute the malicious script instead of the intended shell, leading to arbitrary code execution.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a malicious script (e.g., `malicious_shell.sh`) that, for instance, creates a file in the `/tmp` directory:
        ```sh
        #!/bin/sh
        echo "Vulnerable Terminal" > /tmp/gitgraph_terminal_vulnerable
        ```
        - Make `malicious_shell.sh` executable: `chmod +x malicious_shell.sh`
        - In VSCode User Settings, set `git-graph.integratedTerminalShell` to the path of the malicious script (e.g., `"/path/to/malicious_shell.sh"`).
    2. **Trigger:**
        - Open the Git Graph view for a repository.
        - Initiate an action that opens an integrated terminal, such as starting an interactive rebase from a branch context menu (as mentioned in `dataSource.ts` rebase function).
    3. **Verification:**
        - Check if the `/tmp/gitgraph_terminal_vulnerable` file exists after triggering the terminal opening action.
        - If the file exists, it indicates that the malicious script set in the 'Integrated Terminal Shell' setting was executed when Git Graph opened the terminal, proving the command execution vulnerability.
