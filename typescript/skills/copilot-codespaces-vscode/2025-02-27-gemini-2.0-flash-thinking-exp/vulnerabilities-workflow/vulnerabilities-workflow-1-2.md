- **Vulnerability Name:** GitHub Actions Output Injection via Unsanitized Step File

- **Description:**  
  Multiple GitHub Actions workflows (in files such as `0-welcome.yml`, `1-copilot-extension.yml`, `2-skills-javascript.yml`, `3-copilot-hub.yml`, and `4-copilot-comment.yml`) use a command that reads the contents of the file `.github/steps/-step.txt` and writes the value directly to the GitHub Actions output variable. Specifically, each workflow contains a step similar to:  
  ```
  - id: get_step
    run: echo "current_step=$(cat ./.github/steps/-step.txt)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  ```  
  Because the file content is not validated or sanitized, an external attacker who is able to modify `.github/steps/-step.txt` (for example, via a malicious pull request) can inject newline characters and command-like strings. This injection can result in the creation of additional outputs or even arbitrary key-value pairs that downstream steps rely on, effectively allowing the attacker to manipulate the workflow’s behavior.

- **Impact:**  
  An attacker could inject malicious payloads that lead to arbitrary command execution in the GitHub Actions runner environment. Such injected commands may allow the execution of unintended shell commands, leakage of sensitive environment information, or further manipulation of the build and deployment process. Since the actions run with the repository’s GitHub token (and corresponding permissions), a successful exploitation might compromise the integrity of the CI/CD pipeline and expose sensitive secrets.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  None. The workflows directly read the entire content of `.github/steps/-step.txt` without any sanitization or validation before appending it to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Sanitize the content retrieved from `.github/steps/-step.txt` to remove or escape newline characters and any unsafe tokens before writing to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`.  
  - Enforce strict validation (or even restrict updates) of the `.github/steps/-step.txt` file to ensure that only trusted values are used.  
  - Consider using GitHub Actions input parameters or environment variables (supplied by trusted sources) instead of a file that can be modified by contributions.

- **Preconditions:**  
  - The repository is public (or contributions from less trusted users are allowed), meaning an external attacker may submit a pull request that modifies `.github/steps/-step.txt`.  
  - The changes to the step file are merged (or run in an environment where workflow triggers allow untrusted contributions) so that the unsanitized content is read during the workflow execution.  
  - The GitHub Actions environment processes the injected output, causing downstream steps to misbehave or execute injected commands.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  1. In each workflow file (e.g., `/code/.github/workflows/0-welcome.yml`), the following step is used to determine the current step number:  
     ```
     - id: get_step
       run: echo "current_step=$(cat ./.github/steps/-step.txt)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
     ```
  2. The command reads the entire content of the file `.github/steps/-step.txt` via `cat` and immediately appends it to the file pointed to by `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`.  
  3. If an attacker edits `.github/steps/-step.txt` and embeds a payload such as:  
     ```
     1
     malicious_command=echo "Injected vulnerability triggered"
     ```  
     the output written to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` becomes multiline.  
  4. GitHub Actions treats each line as a separate key-value pair, meaning that the injected `malicious_command` variable may later be interpreted or used by subsequent jobs or steps.  
  5. As a result, the attacker’s payload is effectively introduced into the runner’s environment, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution or manipulation of the CI/CD process.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Fork and Prepare:**  
     - Fork the repository and check out a new branch for testing.  
     - Locate the file `.github/steps/-step.txt` in your fork.
  2. **Inject Payload:**  
     - Edit `.github/steps/-step.txt` to include a payload that spans multiple lines. For example, change its content to:  
       ```
       1
       injected_variable=echo "This is an injection test"
       ```
  3. **Submit a Pull Request:**  
     - Commit the change and submit a pull request with the modified `.github/steps/-step.txt`.  
     - (For testing purposes, ensure that your repository settings or CI/CD test environment allow the workflow to run without interference.)
  4. **Trigger the Workflow:**  
     - Merge the pull request (or trigger the workflow manually if allowed by your setup) so that the GitHub Actions workflows are executed.
  5. **Monitor Workflow Logs:**  
     - In the GitHub Actions logs, locate the output of the `get_step` step.  
     - Verify whether the log shows the injected key-value pair (e.g., an extra output named `injected_variable` with the value `echo "This is an injection test"`).
  6. **Evaluate Impact:**  
     - Check the subsequent jobs that use the `current_step` output for any misbehavior or unexpected execution that may be attributed to the injection.  
     - Document the unexpected behavior in the logs as evidence of the vulnerability.
