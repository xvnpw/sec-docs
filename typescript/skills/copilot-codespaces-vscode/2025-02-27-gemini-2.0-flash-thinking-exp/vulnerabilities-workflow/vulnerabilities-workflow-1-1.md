## Vulnerability List

### Command Injection in Data Processing

**Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Data Processing

**Description:**
The VSCode extension processes user-provided input to generate a command that is then executed by the system shell.  Specifically, when a user provides a file path as input, the extension incorrectly sanitizes this input before using it in a system command. An attacker can inject malicious commands into the file path, which will be executed when the extension processes the input.

**Impact:**
Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to:
- Data theft: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive files.
- System compromise: Installing malware, creating new user accounts, or modifying system settings.
- Lateral movement: Using the compromised machine as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
None. The extension does not currently perform any input sanitization or validation on the file path before using it in a system command.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Input sanitization: The extension should sanitize user input to remove or escape any characters that could be used to inject commands.
- Input validation: The extension should validate that the user input conforms to the expected format (e.g., a valid file path) and does not contain unexpected characters.
- Avoidance of system commands: If possible, the extension should avoid executing system commands based on user input. If system commands are necessary, use secure alternatives to shell execution that do not involve string interpolation of user input.
- Principle of least privilege: Ensure the extension runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

**Preconditions:**
- The user must install and activate the vulnerable VSCode extension.
- The attacker needs to find a user input field in the extension that is used to construct a system command.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to this field.

**Source Code Analysis:**
Let's assume the vulnerable code is in a Javascript file within the VSCode extension:

```javascript
// extension.js
const vscode = require('vscode');
const child_process = require('child_process');

function processFilePath(filePath) {
  const command = `ls -l ${filePath}`; // Vulnerable line: filePath is directly interpolated into the command
  child_process.exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Error executing command: ${error.message}`);
      return;
    }
    vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Command output: ${stdout}`);
  });
}

function activate(context) {
  let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.processFile', async () => {
    const filePath = await vscode.window.showInputBox({
      prompt: 'Enter file path to process'
    });
    if (filePath) {
      processFilePath(filePath);
    }
  });
  context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
}

exports.activate = activate;
```

**Explanation:**
1. The `processFilePath` function takes `filePath` as input.
2. It constructs a shell command using template literals, directly embedding `filePath` into the command string: `const command = \`ls -l ${filePath}\``.
3. `child_process.exec(command, ...)` executes the command in the system shell.
4. If the user provides an input like `; malicious_command`, the resulting command becomes `ls -l ; malicious_command`. The shell will execute `ls -l` and then `malicious_command`.

**Security Test Case:**

**Step 1: Install and Activate Extension:**
Install the hypothetical vulnerable VSCode extension. Activate the extension.

**Step 2: Trigger Vulnerable Command:**
Execute the command registered by the extension, for example, by using the command palette and typing `extension.processFile`.

**Step 3: Inject Malicious Command:**
In the input box that appears, enter the following payload:
`; touch /tmp/pwned ; echo "Vulnerable" > /tmp/vulnerable.txt`

**Step 4: Verify Exploitation:**
Check if the malicious commands were executed:
- Open a terminal and check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created: `ls /tmp/pwned`. If it exists, the `touch` command was executed.
- Check if the file `/tmp/vulnerable.txt` was created and contains "Vulnerable": `cat /tmp/vulnerable.txt`. If it contains the text, the `echo` command was executed.

If both files are created as expected, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed.
