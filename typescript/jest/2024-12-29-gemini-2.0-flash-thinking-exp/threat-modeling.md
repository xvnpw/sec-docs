### High and Critical Jest Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Test Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker, either an insider or someone who has gained access to the codebase, could inject malicious code into a test file. This code would be executed by the **Jest Test Runner** during the testing process. The attacker might aim to exfiltrate sensitive data accessible during testing (e.g., environment variables, configuration), modify files, or even attempt to establish a backdoor.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, compromise of the testing environment, potential for further attacks on other systems if the test environment has network access, false sense of security if malicious tests are designed to pass despite underlying vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Jest Component:** Test Runner, Test Files
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all test code changes.
        *   Enforce strong access controls and authentication for the code repository and development environment.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools and linters on test files to detect suspicious patterns.
        *   Consider running tests in isolated, sandboxed environments with limited access to sensitive resources.
        *   Regularly audit test code for any unexpected or suspicious behavior.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion in Tests
    *   **Description:** A malicious actor or poorly written tests could intentionally or unintentionally create tests that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during execution. This could lead to a denial of service for the testing environment, slowing down development or preventing timely deployments. The **Jest Test Runner** is directly responsible for executing these tests and managing resources.
    *   **Impact:** Delayed deployments, inability to run tests, increased infrastructure costs, potential instability of the testing environment.
    *   **Affected Jest Component:** Test Runner
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement timeouts for individual tests and test suites to prevent runaway processes.
        *   Monitor resource usage during test execution and set thresholds for alerts.
        *   Enforce limits on the number of concurrent tests running.
        *   Educate developers on writing efficient and performant tests.

*   **Threat:** Configuration Vulnerabilities Leading to Relaxed Security
    *   **Description:** Incorrect or insecure **Jest Configuration** settings could weaken the security posture of the testing process. For example, disabling security features or allowing tests to run with elevated privileges unnecessarily. An attacker exploiting these misconfigurations could gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code more easily through the **Jest Test Runner**.
    *   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, potential for privilege escalation within the testing environment, easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Jest Component:** Jest Configuration
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(While the previous classification was Medium, the potential for privilege escalation can make this High in certain contexts. We'll keep it as High given the direct involvement of Jest configuration impacting security)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices when configuring Jest.
        *   Review the `jest.config.js` file (or equivalent configuration) carefully for any potentially insecure settings.
        *   Avoid running tests with unnecessary privileges.
        *   Understand the security implications of different Jest configuration options before enabling or disabling them.

*   **Threat:** Code Injection via Improperly Sanitized Test Mocks/Spies
    *   **Description:** If **Jest Mocks** or **Spies** are used to simulate external dependencies or functions, and the data or logic within these mocks is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code or data that gets executed during the test run by the **Jest Test Runner**. This is more likely if the mock logic involves evaluating strings or using dynamic code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution vulnerabilities within the testing context, potential for unintended side effects or data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Jest Component:** Mocks, Spies
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(Similar to Configuration Vulnerabilities, the potential for code execution can elevate this to High in certain scenarios. We'll classify it as High due to the direct involvement of Jest features leading to potential code execution)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and validate the implementation of test mocks and spies.
        *   Avoid using dynamic or user-provided data directly within mock implementations without proper sanitization and validation.
        *   Ensure mocks and spies only simulate the intended behavior and do not introduce unintended side effects or vulnerabilities.
        *   Prefer using predefined values or controlled data within mocks.
