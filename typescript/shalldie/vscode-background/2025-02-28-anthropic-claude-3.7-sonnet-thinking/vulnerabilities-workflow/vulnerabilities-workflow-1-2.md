# VSCode Extension Vulnerabilities

## Arbitrary Code Injection via Malicious Patch Generation

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Injection via Malicious Patch Generation

- **Description:**  
  The extension "patches" VSCode's core JavaScript file by dynamically generating a block of JavaScript code (a "patch") that is appended to the VSCode runtime file. The patch is generated by modules in the PatchGenerator family (for example, in the Editor, Sidebar, Panel, and Fullscreen patch generators) without performing any cryptographic integrity checks, strict validation, or sanitization of the generated content.  
  A threat actor who provides a manipulated (malicious) repository could alter the patch generation code or its configuration defaults so that the produced patch includes arbitrary JavaScript payloads. When the extension calls its "applyPatch" routine (via the Background.setup method), the malicious patch is appended onto VSCode's main JavaScript file (using the markers "// vscode-background‐start …" and "// vscode-background‐end"). Because VSCode executes this patched JS file on startup, the injected payload would execute in the context of VSCode—potentially giving the attacker remote code execution (RCE) capabilities.

- **Impact:**  
  - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected JavaScript payload runs with the privileges of the VSCode process. An attacker could execute arbitrary commands or modify the runtime behavior of VSCode and, in worst‑case scenarios, escalate privileges.  
  - **Persistence:** Since the patch is written into a core file that is reloaded on every restart, the malicious payload can persist until the patch is removed.  
  - **Compromise of Developer Environment:** As many developers rely on VSCode for daily coding work (and might even run it with elevated privileges in some cases), this vulnerability directly leads to a compromise of the development environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The extension uses a **file-locking mechanism** (via the "lockfile" package and custom lock/unlock functions in the utility namespace) during the patch application process so that concurrent accesses are controlled.  
  - It inspects the current patch state of the target file (by checking for markers like the version string, e.g. `${BACKGROUND_VER}.${VERSION}`) so that patches are not applied repeatedly if already "patched."  
  - However, these mechanisms are aimed at preventing inconsistent writes rather than sanitizing or verifying the integrity of the patch content.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - **Integrity Verification:** There is no digital signature or hash verification of the patch script before appending it to the VSCode source file.  
  - **Sanitization/Validation of Generated Code:** The generated patch code is formed by string concatenation and JSON serialization of configuration values without checking that no malicious payload is inserted.  
  - **Authorization of Repository Content:** There is no mechanism to verify that the extension's source code (including the patch-generation modules) has not been tampered with before installation.

- **Preconditions:**  
  - The victim must install the manipulated (malicious) extension repository.  
  - The extension's feature is enabled (typically via `"background.enabled": true` in the user settings).  
  - The attacker must successfully inject altered logic into one or more of the patch generator modules (for example, by providing malicious defaults or code changes in the repository that will be compiled into the final patch).  
  - The environment must allow the extension to write to VSCode's core files (which is normally the case if VSCode is installed in a location with write permission or if elevated privileges are used).

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In **`src/extension.ts`**, the activation routine instantiates a `Background` object and then calls its asynchronous `setup()` method.  
  - The `setup()` method (in **`src/background/Background.ts`**) calls `applyPatch()` if the extension is enabled and if the target JS file is not already patched with the latest version.  
  - The `applyPatch()` method gathers configuration options (including settings for images, styles, intervals, etc.) and passes them to `PatchGenerator.create()`.  
  - In **`src/background/PatchGenerator/index.ts`**, several specialized patch generators (for editor, sidebar, panel, and fullscreen) are invoked. Their output is concatenated and then passed through uglify-js before being returned as a single script.  
  - Finally, in **`src/background/PatchFile/PatchFile.javascript.ts`**, the method `applyPatches()` reads the current VSCode JS file (located via `vscodePath.jsPath`), "cleans" previous patches by removing anything between the markers, and then appends the new patch.  
  - Because no validation is applied to the generated script from `PatchGenerator.create()`, if any of the patch generating modules is altered (for example, to include a malicious payload), that payload will be concatenated into the final script and executed on VSCode restart.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup a Test Environment:**  
     - Install VSCode (or code‑server) on a test machine where changes to the VSCode installation file are permitted.  
     - Create a test instance where the extension is installed from a controlled (malicious) repository version.
  2. **Manipulate the Repository:**  
     - Alter the patch generator module (for example, in **`src/background/PatchGenerator/PatchGenerator.editor.ts`**) so that the generated patch code includes an unmistakable payload (e.g., a command such as `console.error("RCE triggered")` or an invocation of `require('child_process').exec('calc')` on Windows).  
     - Build the extension with these modifications.
  3. **Simulate User Actions:**  
     - Set `"background.enabled": true` in the user settings and reload VSCode so that the extension's activation routine is run.  
     - Verify that the extension's setup routine detects that patching is necessary and calls `applyPatch()`.
  4. **Observe the Effects:**  
     - Open the patched VSCode JavaScript file (e.g. the file at `vscodePath.jsPath`) and check that the malicious payload appears between the markers `// vscode-background-start` and `// vscode-background-end`.  
     - Restart VSCode and verify (via debug console logs or by observing the payload's effect) that the injected malicious code executes.
  5. **Report the Findings:**  
     - Confirm that the attacker-controlled payload runs with the privileges of the VSCode process, proving that the extension permits arbitrary code injection without adequate mitigation.
