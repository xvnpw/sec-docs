### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. CSS Injection via Custom Styles

- **Vulnerability Name:** CSS Injection via Custom Styles
- **Description:**
    The vscode-background extension allows users to customize the background image style through the `background.editor.style` and `background.editor.styles` settings in `settings.json`. These settings are directly injected into the CSS code that is dynamically generated and applied to the VSCode workbench. If a user provides malicious CSS code within these settings, it will be injected into VSCode's stylesheet, potentially leading to UI redressing, information disclosure, or other client-side attacks within the VSCode environment. An attacker can craft malicious CSS to alter the appearance of the editor, sidebar, panel, or fullscreen areas in unexpected and potentially harmful ways.
    To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a user to install the vscode-background extension and then either:
    1.  Manually modify the user settings (`settings.json`) with malicious CSS.
    2.  Trick the user into importing settings that include malicious CSS, for example, by sharing a malicious settings file or workspace configuration.
    3.  If there is another extension that can programmatically modify user settings, this could be leveraged to inject malicious CSS.
- **Impact:**
    Successful CSS injection can lead to:
    - **UI Redressing/Spoofing:** Attackers can alter the appearance of VSCode's UI to mimic legitimate prompts, dialogs, or other UI elements, potentially tricking users into performing unintended actions (e.g., clicking on fake buttons, entering information into spoofed input fields).
    - **Information Disclosure (Limited):** While full data exfiltration is unlikely via CSS alone, attackers might be able to subtly reveal information displayed in the UI by manipulating styles (e.g., making text or elements visible/invisible based on certain conditions, although scope within VSCode is limited).
    - **Usability Issues:** Malicious CSS can severely degrade the usability of VSCode by hiding important UI elements, making text unreadable, or causing layout issues.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly applies the styles provided in the configuration without any sanitization or validation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** The extension should sanitize or validate the CSS code provided in `background.editor.style` and `background.editor.styles` settings to remove or escape potentially harmful CSS properties or values. A Content Security Policy (CSP) could also be considered, although modifying VSCode's core CSP might be complex and beyond the scope of an extension. A simpler approach would be to restrict allowed CSS properties to a safe subset or use a CSS parser to validate the provided styles.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the vscode-background extension installed.
    - The user must configure the `background.editor.style` or `background.editor.styles` settings with malicious CSS.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`src/background/PatchGenerator/PatchGenerator.editor.ts`:**
        - The `EditorPatchGenerator` class reads the `style` and `styles` configurations from `this.config`.
        - The `getStyleByOptions` method in `EditorPatchGenerator` takes a `style` object as input and converts it into a CSS string.
        - This method directly iterates through the provided style object and constructs CSS rules without any sanitization.
        - ```typescript
          private getStyleByOptions(style: Record<string, string>, useFront: boolean): string {
              // ...
              return Object.entries(style)
                  .filter(([key]) => !excludeKeys.includes(key))
                  .map(([key, value]) => `${key}: ${value};`)
                  .join('');
          }
          ```
        - The `imageStyles` getter uses `getStyleByOptions` to generate styles based on the user-provided `style` and `styles` configurations.
        - ```typescript
          private get imageStyles() {
              const { images, style, styles, useFront } = this.curConfig;

              return images.map((img, index) => {
                  return this.getStyleByOptions(
                      {
                          ...style,
                          ...styles[index],
                          'background-image': `url(${img})`
                      },
                      useFront
                  );
              });
          }
          ```
        - The generated `imageStyles` are then embedded into the `styleTemplate` and eventually injected into VSCode's stylesheet.

    2. **`src/background/PatchGenerator/PatchGenerator.base.ts`:**
        - The `AbsPatchGenerator` class and its subclasses are responsible for generating the patch script that includes the CSS with user-provided styles.
        - The `create` method in `AbsPatchGenerator` compiles the CSS and script into a string that is later applied as a patch to VSCode's files.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Install the `vscode-background` extension.
    2. Open VSCode settings (`settings.json`).
    3. Add the following configuration to your user settings to inject malicious CSS into the editor style:
        ```json
        "background.editor": {
            "useFront": true,
            "style": {
                "opacity": "1",
                "pointer-events": "auto !important",
                "z-index": "10000 !important",
                "position": "fixed !important",
                "top": "0 !important",
                "left": "0 !important",
                "width": "100% !important",
                "height": "100% !important",
                "background-color": "red !important",
                "content": "'Malicious Overlay' !important",
                "font-size": "40px !important",
                "color": "white !important",
                "display": "flex !important",
                "justify-content": "center !important",
                "align-items": "center !important"
            },
            "images": []
        }
        ```
    4. Save the `settings.json` file. VSCode may prompt to restart or reload the window for the settings to take effect. Reload VSCode as prompted.
    5. Observe that the VSCode editor area is now covered by a red overlay with white text "Malicious Overlay". This demonstrates that arbitrary CSS from the `style` setting has been injected and is affecting the VSCode UI, effectively performing a CSS injection attack.
    6. To further test, try more sophisticated CSS injections that attempt to hide UI elements, change text context, or other manipulations to assess the extent of the vulnerability. For example, try to hide the file explorer sidebar using CSS injection targeting sidebar elements.

This test case confirms that the extension is vulnerable to CSS injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-provided style configurations.
