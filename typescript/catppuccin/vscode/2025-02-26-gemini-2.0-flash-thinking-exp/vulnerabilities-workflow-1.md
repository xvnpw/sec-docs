## Combined Vulnerability List

This document consolidates identified vulnerabilities in the Catppuccin VSCode extension, combining information from multiple reports and removing duplicates. Each vulnerability is detailed with its description, impact, rank, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and a security test case.

### Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary File Overwrite via Symlink Race in Theme Build Script

- **Description:**
    The theme build process, which is part of the pre-packaging hook, generates theme JSON files. This process iterates over the target themes directory and deletes existing files before writing new ones. Critically, it lacks validation to ensure each file is a regular file. An attacker with write access to the mutable extension installation can create a symbolic link within the themes directory, pointing to an arbitrary file elsewhere on the disk. When the build script executes, it will follow this symbolic link, leading to unintended deletion or overwriting of files outside the intended themes folder.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to delete or arbitrarily modify files beyond the trusted themes directory. In a severe scenario, this could lead to the modification or deletion of critical application or system files, severely compromising system integrity and potentially leading to application malfunction or broader system instability.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • The theme generation hook does not currently perform any runtime checks or file-type validations when iterating through files in the themes directory. It does not check for symbolic links and proceeds with file operations without verifying the file type.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Implement validation for each file before deletion. This validation should include:
        - Resolving the true path of the file.
        - Confirming that the resolved path is within the trusted themes directory.
        - Ensuring that symbolic links are not followed during file deletion.

- **Preconditions:**
    • The VSCode extension must be installed in a mutable (non-declarative) environment. This is common in standard installations where the extension files are directly accessible.
    • A low-privileged attacker must have the ability to write to the themes folder within the extension's installation directory. This could be achieved through local system access or other means of compromising the local environment.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The theme-generation hook, located in `hooks/generateThemes.ts`, initiates the theme build process. It starts by creating the themes folder using `mkdir`.
    2. The script then iterates through all supported theme flavors. For each flavor, it calls a function to compile the theme (e.g., `compileTheme`).
    3. Subsequently, the script writes the generated theme JSON file using a statement similar to:
       ```typescript
       writeFile(path.join(repoRoot, 'themes', `${flavor}.json`), ...)
       ```
       This `writeFile` operation is performed without any preceding checks to determine if the target path is a regular file or a symbolic link.
    4. If an attacker has placed a symbolic link within the themes folder, the `writeFile` operation will follow this link. As a result, the write operation (and potentially a preceding delete operation if the script attempts to clean up before writing) will affect the file at the symbolic link's target location, potentially overwriting or deleting files outside the intended themes directory.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up a testing environment where the extension is installed non-declaratively, ensuring the themes folder is mutable and accessible.
    2. Navigate to the themes directory within the extension's installation path.
    3. Create a malicious symbolic link inside this themes folder, naming it `malicious.json`. This symbolic link should point to a sensitive file outside of the themes folder, for example, a harmless but identifiable system file for testing purposes.
    4. Trigger the theme build process. This can typically be done by re-packaging the extension or running the specific command that invokes the theme generation hook.
    5. After the build process completes, check the file that the `malicious.json` symbolic link was pointing to.
    6. Verify if the target file has been either deleted or overwritten, indicating successful exploitation of the symlink race vulnerability.
    7. Confirm by reviewing the code or logs that no checks were performed by the theme generation hook to validate the file type or resolved path before attempting deletion or modification, thus confirming the vulnerability.


### Vulnerability 2: Forced Global Icon Theme Override via Automatic Sync Mechanism

- **Description:**
    The extension includes a “sync” feature designed to automatically update the user’s global icon theme to match the active Catppuccin color theme. Within the `syncToIconPack()` function in `src/utils.ts`, the extension checks if the Catppuccin icon pack extension is installed and if the currently active color theme is a Catppuccin theme. If both conditions are met, the extension proceeds to unconditionally update the global `iconTheme` setting using a predefined mapping. This update occurs without any user prompt, consent verification, or notification.

- **Impact:**
    By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can force a change to the user's global icon theme without their explicit consent. This can be achieved by introducing a malicious or unexpected workspace configuration, such as a workspace's `.vscode/settings.json` file that forcibly sets the active color theme to a Catppuccin theme. Such unauthorized configuration changes can be leveraged for UI-spoofing or social-engineering attacks, where a manipulated UI could mislead users or mask malicious activities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • The extension includes checks to ensure that the currently active UI theme is one of the supported Catppuccin themes.
    • It also verifies that the Catppuccin icon pack extension is installed before attempting to update the global configuration. These checks act as conditional triggers for the automatic update but do not prevent the forced override if the conditions are met.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Implement a user confirmation prompt or notification before changing the global `"iconTheme"` setting. Users should be informed and asked for permission before any global configuration changes are applied by the extension.
    • Provide a configuration override option that allows users to disable or control the automatic icon theme synchronization feature. This could be a setting that defaults to off or provides options for different levels of synchronization.
    • Enhance validation of workspace configuration sources. Implement checks to ensure that workspace settings are from trusted sources and not maliciously crafted to trigger unwanted global setting changes.

- **Preconditions:**
    • The workspace must contain a `.vscode/settings.json` file that includes the setting `"workbench.colorTheme"` set to one of the Catppuccin themes. This configuration forces the workspace to use a specific Catppuccin color theme.
    • The extension configuration setting `"catppuccin.syncWithIconPack"` must be enabled. This setting activates the automatic icon theme synchronization feature.
    • The Catppuccin icon pack extension must be installed in VSCode. The sync feature depends on the presence of the icon pack extension to apply the corresponding icon theme.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The `syncToIconPack()` function, located in `src/utils.ts`, is responsible for the automatic icon theme synchronization.
    2. It begins by retrieving the active UI theme using `getActiveTheme()`. This function reads the global color theme setting or uses a preferred theme if auto-detection is enabled.
    3. The function then validates the active UI theme against a predefined mapping of Catppuccin color themes to their corresponding icon pack themes. For example, it maps `"Catppuccin Latte"` to `"catppuccin-latte"`.
    4. If a matching theme is found in the mapping, the extension proceeds to update the global `"iconTheme"` setting by calling:
       ```typescript
       workspace.getConfiguration("workbench").update("iconTheme", iconTheme, ConfigurationTarget.Global)
       ```
       This command updates the global configuration of VSCode, specifically the `"iconTheme"` setting, to the determined Catppuccin icon pack theme. Critically, this update is performed without any user confirmation, notification, or consent mechanism.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prepare a workspace environment. Create a new directory and within it, create a `.vscode` folder. Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file.
    2. In `settings.json`, specify a Catppuccin color theme by adding the following JSON content:
       ```json
       {
           "workbench.colorTheme": "Catppuccin Mocha"
       }
       ```
    3. Ensure that the `"catppuccin.syncWithIconPack"` setting in the Catppuccin theme extension is enabled. This setting is usually enabled by default.
    4. Install both the Catppuccin theme extension and the Catppuccin icon pack extension in VSCode.
    5. Open the workspace you prepared in VSCode.
    6. Observe the behavior of VSCode upon opening the workspace or shortly thereafter.
    7. Verify that the global `"iconTheme"` setting has been automatically updated to the corresponding Catppuccin icon pack theme (e.g., `"catppuccin-mocha"` for `"Catppuccin Mocha"` color theme). You can check this in the VSCode settings (File > Preferences > Settings) under "Icon Theme".
    8. Confirm that this update occurred without any user notification, confirmation prompt, or explicit consent request from the Catppuccin theme extension. This confirms the vulnerability of forced global icon theme override.


### Vulnerability 3: Theme Customization Injection

- **Description:**
    This vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of user-provided configurations within the Catppuccin VSCode extension's theme customization features. An attacker can craft a malicious VSCode settings JSON file containing specially crafted values in `catppuccin.colorOverrides` or `catppuccin.customUIColors` settings. By tricking a user into applying this malicious settings file (e.g., through settings synchronization or sharing), the attacker can inject potentially harmful content into the generated theme JSON files. When VSCode loads and applies the theme, this injected content can lead to unexpected behavior, ranging from UI corruption to potentially more severe issues. The vulnerability is specifically due to the direct use of hex color values from the `customUIColors` setting without proper runtime sanitization.

- **Impact:**
    The primary impact is UI corruption within VSCode. Maliciously injected strings can disrupt the expected theme rendering, potentially making VSCode difficult or confusing to use. While less likely, there is a theoretical risk of more severe issues if VSCode's theme processing engine is vulnerable to injection attacks. Although a full sandbox escape from theme files is improbable, unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities in VSCode’s theme handling could be triggered.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • JSON schema validation is defined for `customUIColors` in `schemas/customUIColors.schema.json`, including `format: "color-hex"` to validate hex color codes. This schema is used for VSCode settings validation. However, this schema validation is likely only used by VSCode for settings UI validation and does not prevent the extension from processing and injecting potentially malicious hex color strings into the theme files at runtime. There are no known runtime sanitizations implemented in the provided code.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Implement robust input sanitization for `catppuccin.colorOverrides` and `catppuccin.customUIColors` settings at runtime. All user-provided values, particularly hex color codes in `customUIColors`, must be thoroughly validated and sanitized before being used to generate theme files. The existing JSON schema validation is insufficient as it does not operate at runtime.
    • Perform validation of color values and any other injected content at runtime to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious or unexpected characters or commands. For hex colors, validation should confirm they are valid hex codes and do not include control characters or escape sequences that could be misinterpreted by the JSON parser or VSCode theme engine.
    • Consider adopting safer methods for applying customizations that avoid direct injection of raw user inputs into theme files. Explore using a controlled templating engine or a more robust configuration merging mechanism that properly encodes or escapes user-provided values to prevent injection.

- **Preconditions:**
    • A user must import or manually apply a malicious VSCode settings JSON configuration file. This file must contain specially crafted `catppuccin.colorOverrides` or `catppuccin.customUIColors` settings designed to exploit the injection vulnerability.
    • The `utils.updateThemes()` function and related theme generation logic in the Catppuccin VSCode extension must be vulnerable to injection due to the lack of sufficient input sanitization at runtime, specifically in how hex color values in `customUIColors` are handled.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `/code/packages/catppuccin-vsc/src/utils.ts`, the `updateThemes()` function is responsible for regenerating theme files based on the current configuration. This function calls `compileTheme()` from `/code/packages/catppuccin-vsc/src/theme/index.ts`.
    2. In `/code/packages/catppuccin-vsc/src/theme/index.ts`, the `compileTheme()` function merges `colorOverrides` directly into the theme's color palette. The relevant code snippet is:
        ```typescript
        const palette: CatppuccinPalette = {
            ...ctpPalette,
            ...options.colorOverrides?.all,
            ...options.colorOverrides?.[flavor],
        };
        ```
    3. In `/code/packages/catppuccin-vsc/src/theme/ui/customNames.ts`, the `customNamedColors()` function processes `customUIColors`. It uses `parseCustomUiColor()` to validate color names against the Catppuccin palette or "accent". However, if a provided value is already in hex format (determined by `hexColorRegex.test(v)`), it is used directly without further validation. The relevant code snippet is:
        ```typescript
        const customUIColors = {
            ...options.customUIColors.all,
            ...options.customUIColors[flavor],
        };

        for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(customUIColors)) {
            // don't change custom hex colors
            if (hexColorRegex.test(v)) continue;

            const [parsedColor, opacityValue] = parseCustomUiColor(k, v);

            // ... (color name validation logic for non-hex values) ...

            customUIColors[k] = opacity(color, opacityValue);
        }
        ```
    4. This direct use of hex color values from user settings in `customUIColors`, bypassing deeper sanitization at runtime, creates the injection vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious strings disguised as hex colors, which, when processed by VSCode's theme engine, can lead to unexpected behavior or UI corruption.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious VSCode settings JSON file named `malicious_catppuccin_settings.json` with the following content. This test case targets the `customUIColors` setting and injects a string that is formatted as a valid hex color to bypass the hex color format check, but contains a malicious JSON injection string designed to break JSON syntax or cause UI issues:
        ```jsonc
        {
            "workbench.colorTheme": "Catppuccin Mocha",
            "catppuccin.customUIColors": {
                "all": {
                    "activityBar.background": "\";Malicious JSON Injection String\""
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    2. Open Visual Studio Code with the Catppuccin theme extension installed and activated.
    3. Open the VSCode settings editor (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings on macOS).
    4. Click on the "..." icon in the top-right corner of the Settings editor and select "Open Settings (JSON)" to open your `settings.json` file.
    5. Copy the entire content of `malicious_catppuccin_settings.json` and paste it into your `settings.json` file, merging it with your existing settings.
    6. Save the `settings.json` file. Saving the settings will trigger the `workspace.onDidChangeConfiguration` event, which in turn should cause the Catppuccin extension to regenerate the theme files using the newly applied malicious settings.
    7. Observe Visual Studio Code for any signs of UI corruption, errors, or unexpected behavior. Pay close attention to the Activity Bar background color and the overall theme rendering. Also, check the VSCode Developer Tools console (Help > Toggle Developer Tools) for any JavaScript errors or console outputs.
    8. (Optional, for deeper analysis): Inspect the generated theme JSON files. These files are typically located in the extension's `themes` directory within your VSCode profile. Verify if the malicious string was injected into the theme file as intended. Look for syntax errors or corrupted JSON structure, particularly around the `activityBar.background` setting in the relevant generated theme file (e.g., `mocha.json`). This step confirms that the malicious string was successfully injected into the theme file, ready to be processed by VSCode.
