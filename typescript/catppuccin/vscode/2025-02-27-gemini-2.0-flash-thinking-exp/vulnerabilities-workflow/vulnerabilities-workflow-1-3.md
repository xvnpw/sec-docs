### Vulnerability List for Catppuccin VSCode Extension

* Vulnerability Name: UI Redress/Misleading UI via Color Manipulation
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious VSCode `settings.json` file containing specific `catppuccin.colorOverrides` or `catppuccin.customUIColors` settings.
    2. The attacker social engineers a victim user into applying this malicious `settings.json` file to their VSCode instance. This could be achieved by sharing the file as a seemingly helpful customization or theme snippet.
    3. Once the user applies these settings, the VSCode UI is drastically altered based on the attacker's specifications.
    4. This alteration can range from making text invisible by setting foreground and background colors to be identical, to misrepresenting error messages as informational messages by changing their color scheme.
* Impact:
    - Degraded User Experience: The VSCode UI becomes significantly less usable, potentially hindering the user's workflow and productivity due to obscured or misleading visual elements.
    - Potential for Phishing/Social Engineering: A misleading UI can be crafted to trick users into unintended actions within VSCode, mimicking legitimate prompts or disguising malicious activities as benign. While not direct code execution, it lowers the user's security awareness and could be a precursor to other attacks.
    - UI Redress Attacks: The altered UI can be designed to deface or disrupt the user's expected VSCode environment, causing frustration and loss of trust in the extension or even VSCode itself if the user is not technically savvy.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Input validation exists in `packages/catppuccin-vsc/src/theme/ui/customNames.ts` to check for valid color names, hex codes, and opacity values. This validation prevents injection of arbitrary code through color settings but does not prevent logically valid but visually harmful color combinations.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement checks to prevent extreme or misleading color combinations. This could involve:
        - Contrast ratio checks to ensure text remains readable against backgrounds.
        - Limits on how drastically certain UI element colors can be overridden to prevent complete invisibility or misrepresentation of UI elements' purpose (e.g., error messages).
    - Alternatively, provide clearer warnings to users about the risks of applying custom `colorOverrides` and `customUIColors`, especially from untrusted sources. This warning could be displayed when the extension detects non-default color customizations.
* Preconditions:
    - The victim user must have the Catppuccin VSCode extension installed.
    - The attacker needs to successfully social engineer the victim user into importing and applying a malicious `settings.json` file or manually adding the malicious color customizations to their VSCode settings.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability stems from the customization features provided by the extension, specifically the `catppuccin.colorOverrides` and `catppuccin.customUIColors` settings.
    - In `packages/catppuccin-vsc/src/theme/ui/customNames.ts`, the `customNamedColors` function processes these settings. While input validation is present to ensure color values are syntactically correct (valid color names or hex codes), there is no logic to prevent semantically harmful combinations.
    - For example, the following setting is considered valid by the input validation:
    ```jsonc
    "catppuccin.colorOverrides": {
        "all": {
          "text": "#000000",
          "base": "#000000"
        }
    }
    ```
    - This setting will pass validation because `#000000` is a valid hex code, but applying it will make text invisible against the black background, leading to a degraded user experience.
    - Similarly, UI elements can be misleadingly recolored using `customUIColors` without any checks to ensure UI usability or prevent misrepresentation of element roles (e.g., making error icons look like info icons).
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Ensure VSCode with the Catppuccin extension is installed.
    2. **Malicious Settings File Creation:** Create a `malicious_settings.json` file with the following content to make text invisible:
    ```jsonc
    {
      "catppuccin.colorOverrides": {
        "all": {
          "text": "#000000",
          "base": "#000000"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    3. **Victim Action:** Instruct a test user (victim) to:
        - Open VSCode settings (JSON).
        - Copy and paste the content of `malicious_settings.json` into their VSCode `settings.json` file, merging it with their existing settings.
        - Save the `settings.json` file.
    4. **Verification:** Observe the VSCode editor and UI elements. Confirm that text elements are now invisible or extremely hard to read due to the foreground and background colors being the same.
    5. **Cleanup:** Remove the added malicious settings from `settings.json` to restore normal theme appearance.

    1. **Setup:** Ensure VSCode with the Catppuccin extension is installed.
    2. **Malicious Settings File Creation:** Create a `misleading_settings.json` file with the following content to misrepresent errors as info messages:
    ```jsonc
    {
      "catppuccin.customUIColors": {
        "all": {
          "editorError.foreground": "blue",
          "editorError.background": "surface0",
          "problemsErrorIcon.foreground": "blue"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    3. **Victim Action:** Instruct a test user (victim) to:
        - Open VSCode settings (JSON).
        - Copy and paste the content of `misleading_settings.json` into their VSCode `settings.json` file, merging it with their existing settings.
        - Save the `settings.json` file.
    4. **Verification:**
        - Introduce a syntax error in a code file (e.g., remove a semicolon in JavaScript).
        - Observe the error squiggly line and the error icon in the Problems panel.
        - Confirm that the error is now styled with blue colors, resembling info messages rather than error indicators.
    5. **Cleanup:** Remove the added malicious settings from `settings.json` to restore normal theme appearance.
