Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving `graphql-js`, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Query Complexity Attacks (Denial of Service)**
    *   **Description:** Malicious actors craft excessively complex or deeply nested GraphQL queries that consume significant server resources (CPU, memory) during parsing and execution, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How graphql-js Contributes:** `graphql-js` is responsible for parsing and validating the structure of incoming queries and then orchestrating the execution of resolvers. It will attempt to process even extremely complex queries if not configured with limitations.
    *   **Example:** A query with many nested levels of relationships or a large number of aliased fields within a single query.
        ```graphql
        query {
          me {
            posts {
              comments {
                author {
                  posts {
                    comments {
                      # ... many more nested levels
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Server overload, application slowdown, potential service outage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query complexity analysis and limiting (e.g., using libraries that calculate query cost based on depth, breadth, and field complexity).
        *   Set timeouts for query execution to prevent long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
        *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single client within a given timeframe.
        *   Consider using persisted queries to allow only predefined, vetted queries.

*   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Resolvers**
    *   **Description:** Resolvers are the functions that fetch data for GraphQL fields. If these resolvers are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities like SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, or authorization bypasses.
    *   **How graphql-js Contributes:** `graphql-js` executes the resolvers defined in the schema. It doesn't inherently protect against vulnerabilities within the resolver logic itself.
    *   **Example:** A resolver that directly concatenates user-provided input into a database query without proper sanitization.
        ```javascript
        // In a resolver for a 'searchUsers' field
        const searchTerm = args.name;
        const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%${searchTerm}%'`; // Vulnerable to SQL injection
        const results = await db.query(query);
        return results;
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure coding practices in resolvers, including input validation, sanitization, and parameterized queries.
        *   Enforce proper authorization checks within resolvers to ensure users can only access data they are permitted to see.
        *   Regularly audit and review resolver code for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Use ORM/ODM libraries that provide built-in protection against injection attacks.

*   **Subscription Authorization Issues (if implemented)**
    *   **Description:** When using GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates, inadequate authorization checks can allow unauthorized users to subscribe to and receive sensitive data.
    *   **How graphql-js Contributes:** `graphql-js` handles the management of subscriptions and the delivery of payloads. The authorization logic for who can subscribe to specific events needs to be implemented by the developer.
    *   **Example:** A user subscribing to updates for resources they don't own or have permission to access.
        ```graphql
        subscription onNewOrder {
          newOrder {
            id
            customerDetails {
              name
              address
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        Without proper authorization, any user could potentially receive details of all new orders.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to real-time data streams.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks when establishing subscriptions, verifying the user's permissions to access the subscribed data.
        *   Use secure authentication mechanisms for subscription connections.
        *   Carefully design subscription topics and payloads to minimize the risk of exposing sensitive information to unauthorized subscribers.
