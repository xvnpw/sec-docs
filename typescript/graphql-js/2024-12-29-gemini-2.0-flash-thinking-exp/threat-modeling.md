### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving graphql-js

This document outlines potential security threats with high or critical severity that directly involve the `graphql-js` library.

*   **Threat:** Complex Query Attacks (Query Depth/Breadth Exploitation)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts deeply nested or excessively wide queries with numerous fields and connections. When executed, these queries consume significant server resources (CPU, memory), potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or severe performance degradation for legitimate users. This directly impacts `graphql-js`'s query execution engine.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation, increased server costs.
    *   **Affected Component:** `graphql-js/src/execution/execute.js` (the core execution engine responsible for resolving the query).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement query depth limits to prevent excessively nested queries. Implement query complexity analysis and limits based on factors like the number of fields, arguments, and connections. Consider using persisted queries to allow only predefined, vetted queries.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Directives or Aliases Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker might craft queries using malicious or unexpected directives. While `graphql-js` validates the syntax of directives, vulnerabilities could arise in the core logic of how `graphql-js` processes and applies these directives, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors during query execution. Similarly, while `graphql-js` handles aliases, vulnerabilities in its alias processing could be exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for unexpected application behavior, errors during query execution, or in some scenarios, information disclosure if the directive processing logic is flawed.
    *   **Affected Component:** `graphql-js/src/execution/directives.js` (the module responsible for handling directives), potentially `graphql-js/src/execution/execute.js` for alias processing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Thoroughly review the `graphql-js` library's code for potential vulnerabilities in directive and alias processing. Keep the `graphql-js` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches. Avoid relying on complex or unusual directive usage patterns that might expose edge cases in `graphql-js`'s implementation.
