## Vulnerability List for vscode-jest Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Module Load via Webpack Configuration Injection in `jest-snapshot-loader`
* Description:
    1. A malicious actor could attempt to inject into the Webpack configuration of the vscode-jest extension.
    2. The attacker would specifically target the `replacements` array within the options of the `jest-snapshot-loader.js`.
    3. By successfully injecting malicious data into the `replacements` array, the attacker gains control over the `replacement` path used in `require` statements within the loader.
    4. When the extension processes files from the `jest-snapshot` package, the `jest-snapshot-loader.js` is invoked.
    5. The loader uses the attacker-controlled `replacement` path in a `require()` call.
    6. This results in the extension loading and potentially executing an arbitrary module specified by the attacker.
* Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the context of the VSCode extension.
    - An attacker could leverage this to perform various malicious actions on the user's system, including:
        - Stealing sensitive credentials or tokens.
        - Modifying or deleting user files.
        - Injecting further malicious code into the workspace.
        - Escalating privileges or compromising the user's development environment.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The `replacements` array in `webpack.config.js` is currently defined statically within the extension's source code.
    - This means the replacement paths are determined by the extension developers and are not directly influenced by user input or external sources under normal circumstances.
    - This static configuration significantly reduces the immediate risk of exploitation as there is no readily apparent injection point for external attackers to directly manipulate this configuration in the released extension.
* Missing mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust validation and sanitization for any part of the Webpack configuration that could be dynamically loaded or influenced by external sources in the future. Ensure that any external configuration data is strictly checked against a safe schema to prevent injection of malicious paths or code.
    - **Secure Alternatives to Dynamic `require`:** Explore and implement more secure alternatives to dynamic `require` calls within the `jest-snapshot-loader.js` if feasible. If dynamic module loading is necessary, restrict the possible `replacement` paths to a predefined safe list or use a mechanism to verify the integrity and safety of the modules being loaded.
    - **Webpack Configuration Security Review:** Conduct a thorough security review of the entire Webpack configuration to identify any other potential injection points or misconfigurations that could be exploited to inject malicious code or alter the extension's behavior.
* Preconditions:
    - For this vulnerability to be exploitable, an attacker must first find a way to inject or modify the Webpack configuration that is used to bundle the vscode-jest extension.
    - This precondition implies that there would need to be another vulnerability within VSCode itself, the extension's build process, or any intermediary systems that could allow an attacker to alter the extension's packaged code.
    - Without a separate vulnerability allowing for configuration injection, directly exploiting this issue is not possible in a standard installation of the vscode-jest extension from the marketplace.
* Source code analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/webpack/webpack.config.js`**:
        - This file configures Webpack for bundling the vscode-jest extension.
        - It defines the use of a custom loader, `jest-snapshot-loader.js`, for JavaScript files within the `jest-snapshot` package.
        - It statically defines the `replacements` array which is passed as options to the `jest-snapshot-loader.js`.
        ```javascript
        module.exports = (env) => {
            // ...
            const replacements = [
                { packageName: '@babel/generator', replacement: dummyModulePath },
                { packageName: '@babel/core', replacement: dummyModulePath },
                {
                  packageName: './src/InlineSnapshots.ts',
                  replacement: dummyModulePath,
                },
            ];
            // ...
            module: {
              rules: [
                {
                  test: /\.js$/,
                  include: [...addMatchingFiles('jest-snapshot', '**/*.js')],
                  use: [
                    {
                      loader: path.resolve(__dirname, './jest-snapshot-loader.js'),
                      options: { replacements },
                    },
                  ],
                },
              ],
            },
            // ...
        }
        ```
    2. **File: `/code/webpack/jest-snapshot-loader.js`**:
        - This custom Webpack loader is designed to modify the source code of `jest-snapshot` package files during the bundling process.
        - It retrieves the `replacements` array from the loader options.
        - It iterates through each replacement configuration, which includes a `packageName` and a `replacement` path.
        - For each configuration, it constructs regular expressions to find `require()` calls for the specified `packageName`.
        - It then replaces the matched `require()` calls with a new `require()` statement that uses the `replacement` path.
        - **Vulnerable Code Snippet**:
        ```javascript
        module.exports = function (source) {
            // ...
            const options = loaderUtils.getOptions(this);
            const replacements = options.replacements;

            let replacedSource = source;

            replacements.forEach(({ packageName, replacement }) => {
                const regex = new RegExp(
                    `require\\(require\\.resolve\\(['"]${packageName}['"],\\s*{[^}]*}\\)\\)`,
                    'g'
                );
                if (regex.test(replacedSource)) {
                    replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(regex, `require('${replacement}')`);
                }

                // Also replace direct require statements
                const directRequireRegex = new RegExp(`__webpack_require__\\(['"]${packageName}['"]\\)`, 'g');
                if (directRequireRegex.test(replacedSource)) {
                    replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(directRequireRegex, `require('${replacement}')`);
                }
            });

            return replacedSource;
        };
        ```
        - The vulnerability lies in the line `replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(regex, \`require('${replacement}')\`);` and `replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(directRequireRegex, \`require('${replacement}')\`);`.
        - The `replacement` variable, if attacker-controlled through Webpack configuration injection, could contain a path to a malicious module.
        - When Webpack bundles the extension, these `require()` statements would be resolved and included in the final bundle.
        - If the injected module path points to a malicious script, it would be executed when the extension's code that uses the modified `jest-snapshot` package is run in VSCode.

* Security test case:
    1. **Preparation**:
        - **Modify `webpack.config.js` for testing (Simulate Configuration Injection):**
            - Temporarily modify the `webpack.config.js` to allow an environment variable to control the `replacements` option for `jest-snapshot-loader`.
            - Add the following code inside the `module.exports = (env) => { ... }` function, before the `return` statement:
            ```javascript
            const dynamicReplacements = env.INJECTED_REPLACEMENTS ? JSON.parse(env.INJECTED_REPLACEMENTS) : replacements;
            const webpackConfigReplacements = dynamicReplacements;
            ```
            - Replace `options: { replacements }` in the `jest-snapshot-loader` rule with `options: { replacements: webpackConfigReplacements }`.
        - **Create Malicious Module (`malicious.js`):**
            - Create a new file named `malicious.js` in the root directory of the project (or any accessible path).
            - Add the following malicious code to `malicious.js`:
            ```javascript
            console.error('VULNERABILITY TEST: Malicious code executed!');
            // Simulate a more harmful action (for demonstration - DO NOT use in production testing)
            // require('fs').writeFileSync('pwned.txt', 'You have been PWNED!');
            ```
        - **Build Extension with Modification:**
            - Build the extension using Webpack with this modified configuration.
    2. **Exploit Attempt**:
        - **Run VSCode in Extension Development Mode:**
            - Open VSCode and run it in Extension Development Host mode (e.g., by pressing F5 in the vscode-jest project).
        - **Set Environment Variable (INJECTED_REPLACEMENTS):**
            - Before launching or within the launch configuration, set an environment variable `INJECTED_REPLACEMENTS` with a JSON string that defines a malicious replacement. For example:
            ```json
            [
              { "packageName": "@babel/generator", "replacement": "./malicious.js" }
            ]
            ```
            - In `launch.json` configuration, add `env` section:
            ```json
            "env": {
              "INJECTED_REPLACEMENTS": "[{\"packageName\": \"@babel/generator\", \"replacement\": \"./malicious.js\"}]"
            }
            ```
        - **Trigger Extension Functionality:**
            - Activate the vscode-jest extension in the Extension Development Host (if not already active).
            - Perform actions that would cause the extension to load and use modules from the `jest-snapshot` package. This could be running tests, enabling coverage, or any feature that triggers the extension's core logic.
    3. **Verification**:
        - **Check for Malicious Code Execution:**
            - Open the Developer Tools Console in the Extension Development Host (`Help` > `Toggle Developer Tools`).
            - Check the console output for the message `VULNERABILITY TEST: Malicious code executed!`. If this message is present, it indicates that the malicious module (`malicious.js`) was successfully loaded and executed due to the injected Webpack configuration.
            - (Optional, and for testing environment only): Check if the `pwned.txt` file was created in your workspace, indicating file system access, if you uncommented the `writeFileSync` line in `malicious.js`.
    4. **Cleanup (Crucial):**
        - **Revert `webpack.config.js`:**
            - **IMPORTANT:** Undo the changes made to `webpack.config.js` to remove the environment variable-based configuration injection for `replacements`. Restore the original static `replacements` array.
        - **Rebuild Extension (Clean Build):**
            - Perform a clean build of the extension to ensure that the testing modifications are completely removed from the production build.
        - **Delete `malicious.js`:**
            - Delete the `malicious.js` file created for testing purposes.

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection via Terminal Link Provider
* Description:
    1. The `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider` parses terminal links with the scheme `ExecutableLinkScheme`.
    2. The provider extracts the command name and arguments from the URI path and query parameters.
    3. It uses `vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, folderName, args)` to execute the extracted command.
    4. If the `command` or `args` are not properly validated, an attacker could inject malicious commands or arguments through a crafted terminal link.
    5. An attacker could potentially control the terminal output (e.g., by influencing jest output if it's displayed in the terminal) to include such a malicious link.
    6. When a user clicks on this link, the extension will execute the attacker-specified command with the provided arguments.
* Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution within the context of VSCode.
    - An attacker could potentially execute any VSCode command, possibly leading to:
        - Workspace manipulation.
        - Data exfiltration.
        - Execution of arbitrary code if VSCode commands allow it.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None apparent.
* Missing mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust validation and sanitization for the `command` and `args` extracted from the terminal link URI. Sanitize or reject commands and arguments that are not expected or safe.
    - **Command Whitelisting:** Implement a whitelist of allowed commands that can be executed via terminal links. Only allow predefined, safe commands to be executed.
    - **Security Review of Command Execution:**  Conduct a thorough security review of the usage of `vscode.commands.executeCommand` in the `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider` to understand the full scope of potential risks. Consider if executing arbitrary commands from terminal links is necessary and if there are safer alternatives.
* Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence the terminal output that is processed by the `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider`.
    - The user must click on the malicious link in the terminal output.
* Source code analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/src/terminal-link-provider.ts`**:
        - This file implements the `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider` class, which is responsible for providing terminal links and handling them.
        - The `provideTerminalLinks` method uses a regular expression to find URIs with the scheme `vscode-jest://` in the terminal output.
        - The `handleTerminalLink` method parses the URI to extract the folder name, command, and arguments.
        - **Vulnerable Code Snippet**:
        ```typescript
        async handleTerminalLink(link: ExecutableTerminalLink): Promise<void> {
            try {
              const uri = vscode.Uri.parse(link.data);
              const folderName = decodeURIComponent(uri.authority);
              const command = decodeURIComponent(uri.path).substring(1);
              const args = uri.query && JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(uri.query));
              await vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, folderName, args);
            } catch (error) {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Failed to handle link "${link.data}": ${error}`);
            }
          }
        ```
        - The vulnerability lies in the line `await vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, folderName, args);`.
        - The `command` variable is directly passed to `vscode.commands.executeCommand` without any validation.
        - The `args` variable, parsed from the URI query string using `JSON.parse`, is also passed directly to `vscode.commands.executeCommand` without validation.
        - An attacker who can control the terminal output could inject a malicious URI that, when clicked by a user, would execute an arbitrary VSCode command with attacker-controlled arguments.

* Security test case:
    1. **Preparation**:
        - **Install vscode-jest extension**.
        - **Create a test workspace**.
        - **Modify `src/terminal-link-provider.ts` (for testing)**: Add `console.log` before `vscode.commands.executeCommand` to print the `command` and `args` to observe the parsed values.
        ```typescript
          async handleTerminalLink(link: ExecutableTerminalLink): Promise<void> {
            try {
              const uri = vscode.Uri.parse(link.data);
              const folderName = decodeURIComponent(uri.authority);
              const command = decodeURIComponent(uri.path).substring(1);
              const args = uri.query && JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(uri.query));

              console.log('Executing command:', command); // Added console log
              console.log('With arguments:', args);       // Added console log

              await vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, folderName, args);
            } catch (error) {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Failed to handle link "${link.data}": ${error}`);
            }
          }
        ```
        - **Rebuild and install the modified extension**.
    2. **Exploit Attempt**:
        - **Craft Malicious Terminal Link**: `vscode-jest://testFolder/vscode.open?{"resource":"file:///etc/passwd"}`
        - **Simulate Malicious Terminal Output**: To simulate malicious terminal output, you can modify the extension to output a crafted link. For example, you could temporarily modify the `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider.provideTerminalLinks` to always return a link with the malicious payload, or modify jest output to include the crafted link. For a simpler test without modifying jest output, you can directly trigger `handleTerminalLink` from the Developer Tools console.
        - **Trigger `handleTerminalLink`**:
            Open Developer Tools in VSCode, find or instantiate `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider` (you might need to get an instance from the extension's exports if it's not globally available). Then, execute the following in the console:
            ```javascript
            const provider = <instance of ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider>; // Replace with actual instance retrieval
            const maliciousLink = { data: 'vscode-jest-exec://testFolder/vscode.open?{"resource":"file:///etc/passwd"}' };
            provider.handleTerminalLink(maliciousLink);
            ```
            To get the instance of `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider`, you might need to inspect the extension's activation code and find how it's exported. If it's not easily accessible, you may need to resort to modifying the extension code to make it accessible for testing.
    3. **Verification**:
        - **Observe Console Output**: Check the console in Developer Tools for the `console.log` output from the modified `handleTerminalLink` method. Verify that the `command` and `args` are parsed as expected (e.g., `command` is `vscode.open` and `args` is `{"resource":"file:///etc/passwd"}`).
        - **Check for Command Execution**: Observe if VSCode attempts to open `/etc/passwd`. An error might occur due to permissions, but the attempt indicates successful command injection.
    4. **Cleanup**:
        - Revert any code modifications in `src/terminal-link-provider.ts`.
        - Rebuild and reinstall the original extension.
