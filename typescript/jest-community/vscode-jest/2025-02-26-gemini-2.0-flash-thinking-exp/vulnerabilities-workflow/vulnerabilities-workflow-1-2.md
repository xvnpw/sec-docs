- **Vulnerability: Command Injection via Unvalidated `jest.jestCommandLine` Configuration**
  - **Description:**
    An attacker who can inject a malicious string into the `jest.jestCommandLine` setting (for example via a compromised workspace settings file) can force the extension to build a shell command using that unsanitized input. The extension simply concatenates the user‑supplied value with fixed command parts and then executes the resulting string via a shell. This lack of strict validation or use of a safe API (such as passing an arguments array) means that dangerous shell metacharacters (for instance, “;”, “&”, or “`”) may be injected into the live command.
    *Steps to trigger:*
    1. Modify the workspace’s `.vscode/settings.json` so that the Jest command line is set to something like:
       ```json
       { "jest.jestCommandLine": "jest --watch; echo INJECTED" }
       ```
    2. Open the workspace in VS Code so that the extension reads this configuration.
    3. When the extension launches the test process, the unsanitized string is interpolated into a shell command and “echo INJECTED” (or any other injected command) is executed.
  - **Impact:**
    Arbitrary command execution in the environment where VS Code (and hence the extension) is running. This can lead to system compromise or complete takeover if executed with high privileges.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • The extension uses basic escaping routines and relies on VS Code’s trusted APIs when retrieving configuration.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • A comprehensive whitelist‑based validation/sanitization of the input (allowing only safe characters).
    • Use of child process APIs that accept an array of arguments to completely avoid shell interpolation.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker must have the ability to modify or inject a malicious `jest.jestCommandLine` value (for example, via a compromised workspace settings file).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    • The extension retrieves the Jest command line setting via VS Code’s configuration APIs without performing a strict character check.
    • It then concatenates the provided value with fixed command fragments and passes it to the shell.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a trusted workspace, update `.vscode/settings.json` with:
       ```json
       { "jest.jestCommandLine": "jest --watch; echo INJECTED" }
       ```
    2. Open the workspace in VS Code and start a test run.
    3. Inspect the shell output or logs to verify whether “INJECTED” is output—confirming that the injected command ran.

- **Vulnerability: Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Terminal Link Handling**
  - **Description:**
    The extension registers a terminal link provider that transforms specially formatted URIs (using a custom scheme) embedded in terminal output into commands executed via VS Code’s command API. If an attacker is able to inject a terminal link with attacker‑controlled command names or parameters, the provider will decode the link and pass the parameters directly to `vscode.commands.executeCommand` without rigorous validation.
    *Steps to trigger:*
    1. Craft terminal output that includes a link formatted with the custom scheme (for example:
       `vscode-jest://workspace/evilCommand?%7B%22arg%22%3A%22malicious%22%7D`).
    2. Cause this output to appear in a trusted workspace (for example, by pasting into the integrated terminal or via a malicious log message).
    3. Click the malicious link displayed in the terminal.
    4. The extension decodes the URI and immediately executes the command (here, “evilCommand”) with the supplied parameters.
  - **Impact:**
    Unauthorized command execution within the VS Code environment. An attacker could trigger commands that modify extension state or execute further actions compromising the host.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • The terminal link provider checks that the URI adheres to the expected custom scheme and performs only basic error handling.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Enforcement of a strict whitelist of allowed command names.
    • Rigorous validation/sanitization of URI parameters prior to executing any command.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker must be able to inject or force the display of a malicious terminal link in a trusted workspace (for example, by tampering with log output or tricking the user into pasting a crafted link).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    • The terminal link provider decodes the URI, extracts the command and its arguments, and calls `vscode.commands.executeCommand` without performing a full validation of the decoded parameters.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Simulate terminal output that includes a crafted link such as:
       ```
       vscode-jest://workspace/evilCommand?%7B%22arg%22%3A%22malicious%22%7D
       ```
    2. Click on this link in the integrated terminal.
    3. Verify—via logs or side‑effects—that “evilCommand” was executed with the attacker‑controlled parameter.

- **Vulnerability: Potential Command Injection via Insufficient Escaping of Test Name Patterns**
  - **Description:**
    When constructing shell commands to run tests, the extension injects test names into the command string. Although a custom escaping routine is applied, it does not filter out all dangerous shell metacharacters. An attacker may craft a test name containing characters such as “;” so that when it is interpolated into the shell command, an additional command is executed.
    *Steps to trigger:*
    1. In a trusted workspace, modify or create a test file so that a test has a name like:
       ```js
       test("myTest; echo INJECTED", () => { expect(true).toBe(true); });
       ```
    2. Use the extension to run the tests so that a shell command is built including the test name.
    3. If the escaping routine fails to filter out the semicolon and other metacharacters, the extra command (`echo INJECTED`) will be executed.
  - **Impact:**
    Arbitrary command execution during test runs. This could lead to unintended shell command execution and potential system compromise.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • A custom escaping routine is applied to test names before they are embedded into shell commands.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Strengthening the escaping routine to enforce a strict whitelist of allowed characters.
    • Using subprocess APIs that accept an argument array to avoid shell interpolation altogether.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker must be able to supply or modify test files (for example, via a malicious pull request) to include a test name with embedded shell metacharacters.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    • The extension extracts test names from test files and applies an escaping routine before constructing the shell command.
    • However, the escaping routine does not fully filter out dangerous metacharacters (such as “;”), leaving open the possibility for command injection.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Add a test file with the following content to a trusted workspace:
       ```js
       test("myTest; echo INJECTED", () => { expect(true).toBe(true); });
       ```
    2. Run the tests using the extension.
    3. Observe (via dry-run logs or output) whether “echo INJECTED” is executed as part of the command—confirming command injection.

- **Vulnerability: Directory Traversal via Misconfigured `jest.rootPath` Setting**
  - **Description:**
    The extension reads the `jest.rootPath` configuration from the workspace settings and resolves it into an absolute path using a helper function (for example, `toAbsoluteRootPath`). The implementation does not verify whether this resolved path lies inside the workspace folder. An attacker who can modify the workspace settings may specify a relative path containing directory traversal elements (for example, `"../../"`). When accepted, the extension will run Jest against a directory outside the intended project boundary.
    *Steps to trigger:*
    1. Edit the workspace’s `.vscode/settings.json` (or otherwise supply a malicious settings file) so that it includes an entry such as:
       ```json
       { "jest.rootPath": "../../" }
       ```
    2. Open the workspace in VS Code. The extension calls `toAbsoluteRootPath(workspaceFolder, rootPath)` using the unsanitized value.
    3. During test runs or other Jest processes, the extension will operate with a resolved rootPath that points outside the workspace.
  - **Impact:**
    The use of a rootPath pointing outside the intended project boundary can lead to information disclosure—exposing files or directory contents outside the project—as well as executing Jest in an unintended directory. This may enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive file data or cause further escalation.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • The extension performs an existence check on the target directory using `existsSync`, but it does not verify that the resulting absolute path is contained within the workspace.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Enforcing bounds checking on the computed absolute path to ensure it is a subdirectory of the workspace folder.
    • Sanitizing the input to reject directory traversal tokens (for example, “..”) that would result in a rootPath outside of the workspace.
  - **Preconditions:**
    The attacker must be able to modify or supply a workspace settings file that sets a malicious `jest.rootPath` value.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    • In the extension’s setup tasks (for example, in `setup-jest-cmdline.ts` via `getWizardSettings`) and helper routines (such as `validateRootPath` in the wizard helper), the extension calls `toAbsoluteRootPath(workspaceFolder, rootPath)` using the value provided in configuration without verifying that the resolved path remains within the workspace folder.
    • This omission means that a relative value like `"../../"` can resolve to a directory outside the intended project directory.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In the workspace’s `.vscode/settings.json`, set:
       ```json
       { "jest.rootPath": "../../" }
       ```
    2. Open the workspace in VS Code so that the extension loads this configuration.
    3. Trigger a test run (or any feature that uses `jest.rootPath`) and inspect logs or behavior to determine whether the resolved path points outside the workspace.
    4. If the extension runs Jest in a directory outside of the workspace (or if file lists from outside the project are disclosed), the vulnerability is confirmed.
