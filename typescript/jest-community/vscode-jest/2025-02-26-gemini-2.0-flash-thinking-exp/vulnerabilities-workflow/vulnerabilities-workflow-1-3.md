## Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:**  Webpack Configuration potentially allows arbitrary code execution via `jest-snapshot-loader.js` and `dummy-module.js`

- **Description:**
    1. The `webpack.config.js` configures a custom loader `jest-snapshot-loader.js` for `.js` files within `node_modules/jest-snapshot`.
    2. `jest-snapshot-loader.js` uses regular expressions to find and replace `require` statements for specific packages (`@babel/generator`, `@babel/core`, `./src/InlineSnapshots.ts`) with `require('dummy-module.js')`.
    3. `dummy-module.js` is a module that throws errors when any of its properties or methods are accessed.
    4. While the intended purpose is to strip unnecessary dependencies and optimize the bundle size, a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the webpack setup or loader could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
    5. If an attacker could somehow modify the `webpack.config.js` or `jest-snapshot-loader.js` during the build process (e.g., via a supply chain attack or compromised build environment), they could change the `replacement` path in `jest-snapshot-loader.js` to point to a malicious JavaScript file instead of `dummy-module.js`.
    6. When webpack bundles the extension, it would use the modified `jest-snapshot-loader.js` and replace the targeted `require` statements with `require('path/to/malicious/file.js')`.
    7. Upon loading the extension, webpack would execute the malicious JavaScript code during the module loading phase, potentially giving the attacker arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's context.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's context. This could allow an attacker to:
        - Steal user credentials or tokens managed by VSCode.
        - Modify files on the user's system with VSCode's permissions.
        - Inject malicious code into opened projects.
        - Exfiltrate sensitive data from the user's workspace.
        - Potentially gain further access to the user's system depending on VSCode's privileges.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The current configuration in `webpack.config.js` and `jest-snapshot-loader.js` is intended for optimization and replaces modules with a safe `dummy-module.js` that throws errors, not with arbitrary code.
    - The `packageName` and `replacement` values in `webpack.config.js` are hardcoded and controlled by the project developers, reducing the risk of direct external manipulation through configuration.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Integrity checks for build process:** Implement measures to ensure the integrity of the build process and prevent unauthorized modifications to `webpack.config.js`, `jest-snapshot-loader.js`, and other build-related files. This could include using signed commits, verifying checksums of build tools and dependencies, and using a hardened build environment.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While CSP is more relevant for web applications, exploring if VSCode extension context allows for any form of CSP-like restrictions to limit the execution of dynamically loaded code or external resources could be beneficial as a defense-in-depth measure.
    - **Regular security audits of build configurations and custom loaders:** Periodically review webpack configurations and custom loaders like `jest-snapshot-loader.js` for potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to compromise the build pipeline or development environment to modify `webpack.config.js` or `jest-snapshot-loader.js` to point the `replacement` to a malicious file.
    - The user must install a compromised version of the VSCode extension built using the malicious configuration.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: /code/webpack/webpack.config.js**
        ```javascript
        ...
        const dummyModulePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'dummy-module.js').replace(/\\/g, '/');

        const replacements = [
          { packageName: '@babel/generator', replacement: dummyModulePath },
          { packageName: '@babel/core', replacement: dummyModulePath },
          {
            packageName: './src/InlineSnapshots.ts',
            replacement: dummyModulePath,
          },
        ];
        ...
        module: {
          rules: [
            ...
            {
              test: /\.js$/,
              include: [...addMatchingFiles('jest-snapshot', '**/*.js')],
              use: [
                {
                  loader: path.resolve(__dirname, './jest-snapshot-loader.js'),
                  options: { replacements },
                },
              ],
            },
          ],
        },
        ...
        ```
        - This section of the `webpack.config.js` defines the use of `jest-snapshot-loader.js` for JavaScript files within the `jest-snapshot` package.
        - The `replacements` array controls which packages are replaced and with what module. Currently, it's set to `dummyModulePath`, which is safe.

    - **File: /code/webpack/jest-snapshot-loader.js**
        ```javascript
        ...
        module.exports = function (source) {
          ...
          replacements.forEach(({ packageName, replacement }) => {
            const regex = new RegExp(
              `require\\(require\\.resolve\\(['"]${packageName}['"],\\s*{[^}]*}\\)\\)`,
              'g'
            );
            if (regex.test(replacedSource)) {
              replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(regex, `require('${replacement}')`);
            }

            // Also replace direct require statements
            const directRequireRegex = new RegExp(`__webpack_require__\\(['"]${packageName}['"]\\)`, 'g');
            if (directRequireRegex.test(replacedSource)) {
              replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(directRequireRegex, `require('${replacement}')`);
            }
          });

          return replacedSource;
        };
        ```
        - This loader uses regex-based replacement to modify the source code.
        - If an attacker could alter the `replacement` value passed to the loader (through `webpack.config.js` modification), they could inject arbitrary `require` statements.

    - **File: /code/webpack/dummy-module.js**
        ```javascript
        ...
        module.exports = createThrowingProxy('dummy-module');
        ```
        - This module is intended as a safe replacement, throwing errors on access, preventing unintended code execution in normal circumstances.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup a compromised build environment:** Simulate a compromised build environment where you can modify the project files before the extension is packaged.
    2. **Modify `webpack.config.js`:**
        - Change the `dummyModulePath` in `webpack.config.js` to point to a malicious JavaScript file. For example, create a file `malicious.js` with code like `console.error("Vulnerable!"); require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/pwned');` and set `dummyModulePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'malicious.js').replace(/\\/g, '/');`.
    3. **Build the extension:** Package the VSCode extension using the modified `webpack.config.js`. Run `vsce package` or the equivalent build command.
    4. **Install the compromised extension:** Install the generated `.vsix` package in VSCode.
    5. **Activate the extension:** Activate the vscode-jest extension in VSCode.
    6. **Observe the impact:** Check if the code in `malicious.js` is executed when the extension loads or performs actions that would trigger the loading of the replaced modules. In this example, check if `/tmp/pwned` file is created and if "Vulnerable!" is logged in console. If the `touch /tmp/pwned` command is executed, it confirms arbitrary code execution.
    7. **Verify vulnerability:** If the malicious code executes successfully, it demonstrates that modifying the webpack configuration to replace modules with attacker-controlled files can lead to arbitrary code execution when the extension is loaded.

This test case demonstrates the *potential* for arbitrary code execution if the build process is compromised. While not directly exploitable by an external attacker against a released extension, it highlights a critical vulnerability in the build pipeline and supply chain security of the project.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary command execution via `vscode-jest` terminal links

- **Description:**
    1. The `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider` class is registered as a terminal link provider for the `vscode-jest` scheme.
    2. The `provideTerminalLinks` function uses a regular expression to find URIs with the `vscode-jest` scheme in the terminal output.
    3. When a user clicks on a link, the `handleTerminalLink` function is called.
    4. `handleTerminalLink` parses the URI, extracts the folder name, command, and arguments from the URI path and query parameters.
    5. It then uses `vscode.commands.executeCommand` to execute the extracted command with the extracted folder name and arguments.
    6. An attacker who can control the terminal output (e.g., through a test script or a malicious extension that writes to the terminal) can inject a malicious `vscode-jest` URI.
    7. If a user clicks on this malicious link, the `handleTerminalLink` function will execute the command specified in the URI, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution within the VSCode context.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**. Arbitrary command execution within the VSCode extension's context. This could allow an attacker to:
        - Steal user credentials or tokens managed by VSCode.
        - Modify files on the user's system with VSCode's permissions.
        - Inject malicious code into opened projects.
        - Exfiltrate sensitive data from the user's workspace.
        - Potentially gain further access to the user's system depending on VSCode's privileges.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No input validation or sanitization is performed on the command or arguments extracted from the URI before executing `vscode.commands.executeCommand`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of the command and arguments extracted from the URI in the `handleTerminalLink` function.
        - Whitelist allowed commands: Only allow execution of a predefined set of safe commands.
        - Validate arguments: Ensure arguments are of the expected type and format and do not contain malicious payloads.
        - Consider removing the feature: If secure command execution is not essential, consider removing the terminal link execution feature altogether.
    - **User awareness:** Display a warning message to the user before executing commands from terminal links, especially if the link originates from untrusted sources.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious `vscode-jest` URI into the terminal output. This could be achieved by:
        - Compromising a test script that is executed in the terminal.
        - Creating a malicious extension that writes to the terminal and includes the malicious link.
    - The user must click on the malicious `vscode-jest` link in the terminal output.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: /code/src/terminal-link-provider.ts**
        ```typescript
        ...
        export class ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider
          implements vscode.TerminalLinkProvider<ExecutableTerminalLink>
        {
          async handleTerminalLink(link: ExecutableTerminalLink): Promise<void> {
            try {
              const uri = vscode.Uri.parse(link.data);
              const folderName = decodeURIComponent(uri.authority);
              const command = decodeURIComponent(uri.path).substring(1);
              const args = uri.query && JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(uri.query));
              await vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, folderName, args); // Vulnerable line
            } catch (error) {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Failed to handle link "${link.data}": ${error}`);
            }
          }
        ...
        ```
        - The `handleTerminalLink` function in `/code/src/terminal-link-provider.ts` directly executes commands using `vscode.commands.executeCommand` based on the URI parsed from the terminal output without any validation or sanitization of the command or arguments.
        - The `command` and `args` are extracted from the URI using `decodeURIComponent` and `JSON.parse`, which can be manipulated by an attacker to inject arbitrary commands and arguments.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Create a test file:** Create a JavaScript or TypeScript file in a workspace folder.
    2. **Modify test output:** Modify the test execution process (e.g., by modifying a test file or configuration) to print a malicious `vscode-jest` URI to the terminal output when tests are run. For example, in a test file, add a `console.log` statement that outputs the following link:
        ```
        console.log('vscode-jest://test-workspace/evilCommand?{"arg":"malicious"}');
        ```
        where `evilCommand` is a command you want to execute (e.g., `vscode-jest.openOutputPanel`).
    3. **Run tests in terminal:** Execute the tests in the VSCode integrated terminal, ensuring that the malicious link is printed to the terminal output.
    4. **Click on the malicious link:** In the terminal output, click on the generated `vscode-jest` link.
    5. **Observe the impact:** Observe if the command specified in the malicious link (`evilCommand`) is executed. For example, if you used `vscode-jest.openOutputPanel`, check if the output panel is opened. To further verify arbitrary command execution, try to execute a more harmful command if possible in test environment (be cautious in production). For example, try to trigger a command that shows a message box or interacts with the file system in a controlled test environment.
    6. **Verify vulnerability:** If the command from the malicious link executes successfully when clicked, it confirms the arbitrary command execution vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates that an attacker who can control the terminal output and convince a user to click a crafted link can achieve arbitrary command execution within the VSCode context.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via `jestCommandLine` in Debug Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. The `DebugConfigurationProvider.ts` creates debug configurations based on the `jestCommandLine` setting.
    2. The `createDebugConfig` function in `DebugConfigurationProvider.ts` uses `parseCmdLine` to parse the `jestCommandLine` setting.
    3. The `parseCmdLine` function splits the command line into command and arguments but does not sanitize them.
    4. The setup wizard, specifically `setup-jest-cmdline.ts`, allows users to edit the `jestCommandLine` setting through the `editJestCmdLine` function and `showActionInputBox`.
    5. An attacker could potentially trick a user into entering a malicious command in the "Jest Command Line" input box during the setup wizard process.
    6. When the user starts debugging tests using the generated debug configuration, the `DebugConfigurationProvider.ts` will use the malicious `jestCommandLine`.
    7. `vscode.debug.startDebugging` will execute the command specified in the `program` and `args` properties of the debug configuration, which now contains the injected malicious command, leading to arbitrary command execution within the VSCode context.

- **Impact:**
    - **High**. Arbitrary command execution within the VSCode extension's context. This could allow an attacker to:
        - Steal user credentials or tokens managed by VSCode.
        - Modify files on the user's system with VSCode's permissions.
        - Inject malicious code into opened projects.
        - Exfiltrate sensitive data from the user's workspace.
        - Potentially gain further access to the user's system depending on VSCode's privileges.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The `validateCommandLine` function in `wizard-helper.ts` performs basic validation for npm scripts and empty commands, but it's insufficient to prevent command injection.
    - `escapeRegExp` and `escapeQuotes` are used in `resolveDebugConfiguration` and `resolveDebugConfig2` for test name and test path, but not for the main command itself.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input sanitization and validation for `jestCommandLine`:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of the `jestCommandLine` input in the setup wizard to prevent command injection.
        - Whitelist allowed commands or command patterns.
        - Sanitize or escape special characters in the command and arguments.
        - Warn users about the security risks of entering untrusted commands.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** Consider if the debug configuration needs to execute arbitrary commands. If not, restrict the command execution capabilities.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must run the setup wizard and be tricked into entering a malicious command in the "Jest Command Line" input box.
    - The user must then start debugging tests using the generated debug configuration.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File: /code/src/DebugConfigurationProvider.ts**
        ```typescript
        ...
        createDebugConfig(
          workspace: vscode.WorkspaceFolder,
          options?: DebugConfigOptions
        ): vscode.DebugConfiguration {
          ...
          if (options?.jestCommandLine) {
            const [cmd, ...cmdArgs] = parseCmdLine(options.jestCommandLine); // Vulnerable line: parseCmdLine does not sanitize
            if (!cmd) {
              throw new Error(`invalid cmdLine: ${options.jestCommandLine}`);
            }
            const pmConfig = this.usePM(cmd, cmdArgs);
            if (pmConfig) {
              args = [...cmdArgs, ...pmConfig.args, ...config.args];
              override = { ...pmConfig, args };
            } else {
              let program = ... // Construct program path
              program = this.adjustProgram(program);
              args = [...cmdArgs, ...config.args];
              override = { program, args }; // Vulnerable line: program and args are used in debug config without sanitization
            }
          }
          ...
          const finalConfig: vscode.DebugConfiguration = { ...config, cwd, ...override };
          return finalConfig;
        }
        ```
        - `parseCmdLine` in `createDebugConfig` parses the `jestCommandLine` without sanitization.
        - The parsed `cmd` and `cmdArgs` are used to construct the `program` and `args` properties of the debug configuration, which are then executed by VSCode when debugging starts.

    - **File: /code/src/setup-wizard/tasks/setup-jest-cmdline.ts**
        ```typescript
        ...
        const editJestCmdLine = async (): Promise<WizardStatus> => {
          const editedValue = await showActionInputBox<string>({ // User input is obtained here
            title: 'Enter Jest Command Line',
            value: settings.jestCommandLine,
            prompt: 'Note: the command line should match how you run jest tests in terminal ',
            enableBackButton: true,
            verbose: context.verbose,
          });
          settings.jestCommandLine = editedValue; // User input is directly assigned to settings.jestCommandLine
          return 'success';
        };
        ...
        ```
        - The `editJestCmdLine` function uses `showActionInputBox` to get user input for `jestCommandLine`.
        - The user-provided input is directly assigned to `settings.jestCommandLine` without sanitization.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Open the setup wizard:** Run the "Jest: Setup Extension" command.
    2. **Select "Setup Jest Command"**: Choose the "Setup Jest Command" option in the wizard menu.
    3. **Enter malicious command:** In the "Enter Jest Command Line" input box, enter a malicious command, for example: `npm test -- ; touch /tmp/pwned`.
    4. **Save settings:** Complete the setup wizard and save the settings.
    5. **Generate debug configuration:** Run the "Jest: Generate Debug Configuration" command or trigger debug configuration generation through other means.
    6. **Start debugging:** Start debugging any Jest test using the generated debug configuration (e.g., by clicking "Debug Test" code lens).
    7. **Observe the impact:** Check if the malicious command is executed. In this example, check if the `/tmp/pwned` file is created. If the file is created, it confirms arbitrary command execution.
    8. **Verify vulnerability:** If the malicious command executes successfully, it demonstrates the command injection vulnerability through `jestCommandLine`.
