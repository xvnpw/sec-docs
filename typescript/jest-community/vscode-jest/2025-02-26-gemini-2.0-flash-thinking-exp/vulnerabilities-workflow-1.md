## Combined Vulnerability List for vscode-jest Extension

### 1. Arbitrary Module Load via Webpack Configuration Injection in `jest-snapshot-loader`

* **Description:**
    1. A malicious actor could attempt to inject into the Webpack configuration of the vscode-jest extension during the build process.
    2. The attacker would specifically target the `replacements` array within the options of the `jest-snapshot-loader.js`.
    3. By successfully injecting malicious data into the `replacements` array, the attacker gains control over the `replacement` path used in `require` statements within the loader.
    4. When the extension processes files from the `jest-snapshot` package, the `jest-snapshot-loader.js` is invoked.
    5. The loader uses the attacker-controlled `replacement` path in a `require()` call.
    6. This results in the extension loading and potentially executing an arbitrary module specified by the attacker during the extension loading phase.

* **Impact:**
    - Critical. Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's context.
    - An attacker could leverage this to perform various malicious actions on the user's system, including:
        - Stealing sensitive credentials or tokens managed by VSCode.
        - Modifying or deleting user files with VSCode's permissions.
        - Injecting further malicious code into the workspace.
        - Exfiltrating sensitive data from the user's workspace.
        - Escalating privileges or compromising the user's development environment.
        - Potentially gain further access to the user's system depending on VSCode's privileges.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

* **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The `replacements` array in `webpack.config.js` is currently defined statically within the extension's source code.
    - This means the replacement paths are determined by the extension developers and are not directly influenced by user input or external sources under normal circumstances in the released extension.
    - The current configuration in `webpack.config.js` and `jest-snapshot-loader.js` is intended for optimization and replaces modules with a safe `dummy-module.js` that throws errors, not with arbitrary code.

* **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization for Build Process:** Implement measures to ensure the integrity of the build process and prevent unauthorized modifications to `webpack.config.js`, `jest-snapshot-loader.js`, and other build-related files. This could include using signed commits, verifying checksums of build tools and dependencies, and using a hardened build environment.
    - **Secure Alternatives to Dynamic `require`:** Explore and implement more secure alternatives to dynamic `require` calls within the `jest-snapshot-loader.js` if feasible. If dynamic module loading is necessary, restrict the possible `replacement` paths to a predefined safe list or use a mechanism to verify the integrity and safety of the modules being loaded.
    - **Webpack Configuration Security Review:** Conduct a thorough security review of the entire Webpack configuration to identify any other potential injection points or misconfigurations that could be exploited to inject malicious code or alter the extension's behavior.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While CSP is more relevant for web applications, exploring if VSCode extension context allows for any form of CSP-like restrictions to limit the execution of dynamically loaded code or external resources could be beneficial as a defense-in-depth measure.
    - **Regular security audits of build configurations and custom loaders:** Periodically review webpack configurations and custom loaders like `jest-snapshot-loader.js` for potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

* **Preconditions:**
    - For this vulnerability to be exploitable, an attacker must first compromise the build pipeline or development environment to modify `webpack.config.js` or `jest-snapshot-loader.js` to point the `replacement` to a malicious file.
    - The user must install a compromised version of the VSCode extension built using the malicious configuration.
    - Without a separate vulnerability allowing for configuration injection, directly exploiting this issue is not possible in a standard installation of the vscode-jest extension from the marketplace.

* **Source code analysis:**
    1. **File: `/code/webpack/webpack.config.js`**:
        - This file configures Webpack for bundling the vscode-jest extension.
        - It defines the use of a custom loader, `jest-snapshot-loader.js`, for JavaScript files within the `jest-snapshot` package.
        - It statically defines the `replacements` array which is passed as options to the `jest-snapshot-loader.js`.
        ```javascript
        module.exports = (env) => {
            // ...
            const dummyModulePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'dummy-module.js').replace(/\\/g, '/');
            const replacements = [
                { packageName: '@babel/generator', replacement: dummyModulePath },
                { packageName: '@babel/core', replacement: dummyModulePath },
                {
                  packageName: './src/InlineSnapshots.ts',
                  replacement: dummyModulePath,
                },
            ];
            // ...
            module: {
              rules: [
                {
                  test: /\.js$/,
                  include: [...addMatchingFiles('jest-snapshot', '**/*.js')],
                  use: [
                    {
                      loader: path.resolve(__dirname, './jest-snapshot-loader.js'),
                      options: { replacements },
                    },
                  ],
                },
              ],
            },
            // ...
        }
        ```
    2. **File: `/code/webpack/jest-snapshot-loader.js`**:
        - This custom Webpack loader is designed to modify the source code of `jest-snapshot` package files during the bundling process.
        - It retrieves the `replacements` array from the loader options.
        - It iterates through each replacement configuration, which includes a `packageName` and a `replacement` path.
        - For each configuration, it constructs regular expressions to find `require()` calls for the specified `packageName`.
        - It then replaces the matched `require()` calls with a new `require()` statement that uses the `replacement` path.
        - **Vulnerable Code Snippet**:
        ```javascript
        module.exports = function (source) {
            // ...
            const options = loaderUtils.getOptions(this);
            const replacements = options.replacements;

            let replacedSource = source;

            replacements.forEach(({ packageName, replacement }) => {
                const regex = new RegExp(
                    `require\\(require\\.resolve\\(['"]${packageName}['"],\\s*{[^}]*}\\)\\)`,
                    'g'
                );
                if (regex.test(replacedSource)) {
                    replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(regex, `require('${replacement}')`);
                }

                // Also replace direct require statements
                const directRequireRegex = new RegExp(`__webpack_require__\\(['"]${packageName}['"]\\)`, 'g');
                if (directRequireRegex.test(replacedSource)) {
                    replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(directRequireRegex, `require('${replacement}')`);
                }
            });

            return replacedSource;
        };
        ```
        - The vulnerability lies in the lines `replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(regex, \`require('${replacement}')\`);` and `replacedSource = replacedSource.replace(directRequireRegex, \`require('${replacement}')\`);`.
        - The `replacement` variable, if attacker-controlled through Webpack configuration injection, could contain a path to a malicious module.
        - When Webpack bundles the extension, these `require()` statements would be resolved and included in the final bundle.
        - If the injected module path points to a malicious script, it would be executed when the extension's code that uses the modified `jest-snapshot` package is run in VSCode.

    3. **File: `/code/webpack/dummy-module.js`**:
        ```javascript
        ...
        module.exports = createThrowingProxy('dummy-module');
        ```
        - This module is intended as a safe replacement, throwing errors on access, preventing unintended code execution in normal circumstances.

* **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup a compromised build environment:** Simulate a compromised build environment where you can modify the project files before the extension is packaged.
    2. **Modify `webpack.config.js`:**
        - Change the `dummyModulePath` in `webpack.config.js` to point to a malicious JavaScript file. For example, create a file `malicious.js` with code like `console.error("Vulnerable!"); require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/pwned');` and set `dummyModulePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'malicious.js').replace(/\\/g, '/');`.
    3. **Build the extension:** Package the VSCode extension using the modified `webpack.config.js`. Run `vsce package` or the equivalent build command.
    4. **Install the compromised extension:** Install the generated `.vsix` package in VSCode.
    5. **Activate the extension:** Activate the vscode-jest extension in VSCode.
    6. **Observe the impact:** Check if the code in `malicious.js` is executed when the extension loads or performs actions that would trigger the loading of the replaced modules. In this example, check if `/tmp/pwned` file is created and if "Vulnerable!" is logged in console. If the `touch /tmp/pwned` command is executed, it confirms arbitrary code execution.
    7. **Verification:** If the malicious code executes successfully, it demonstrates that modifying the webpack configuration to replace modules with attacker-controlled files can lead to arbitrary code execution when the extension is loaded.

### 2. Potential Command Injection via Terminal Link Provider

* **Description:**
    1. The `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider` parses terminal links with the scheme `vscode-jest-exec://` or `vscode-jest://`.
    2. The provider extracts the command name from the URI path and arguments from the query parameters.
    3. It uses `vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, folderName, args)` to execute the extracted command.
    4. If the `command` or `args` are not properly validated, an attacker could inject malicious commands or arguments through a crafted terminal link.
    5. An attacker could potentially control the terminal output (e.g., by influencing jest output if it's displayed in the terminal or by other means like malicious extensions) to include such a malicious link.
    6. When a user clicks on this link, the extension will execute the attacker-specified command with the provided arguments within the VS Code context.

* **Impact:**
    - Critical. Arbitrary command execution within the VSCode context.
    - An attacker could potentially execute any VSCode command, possibly leading to:
        - Workspace manipulation.
        - Data exfiltration.
        - Execution of arbitrary code if VSCode commands allow it.
        - Stealing user credentials or tokens managed by VSCode.
        - Modifying files on the user's system with VSCode's permissions.
        - Injecting malicious code into opened projects.
        - Exfiltrating sensitive data from the user's workspace.
        - Potentially gain further access to the user's system depending on VSCode's privileges.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

* **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None apparent. The terminal link provider checks that the URI adheres to the expected custom scheme and performs only basic error handling.

* **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust validation and sanitization for the `command` and `args` extracted from the terminal link URI. Sanitize or reject commands and arguments that are not expected or safe.
    - **Command Whitelisting:** Implement a whitelist of allowed commands that can be executed via terminal links. Only allow predefined, safe commands to be executed.
    - **Security Review of Command Execution:**  Conduct a thorough security review of the usage of `vscode.commands.executeCommand` in the `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider` to understand the full scope of potential risks. Consider if executing arbitrary commands from terminal links is necessary and if there are safer alternatives.
    - **User Awareness and Warning:** Display a warning message to the user before executing commands from terminal links, especially if the link originates from untrusted sources or unexpected contexts.

* **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious `vscode-jest-exec://` or `vscode-jest://` URI into the terminal output. This could be achieved by:
        - Compromising a test script that is executed in the terminal.
        - Creating a malicious extension that writes to the terminal and includes the malicious link.
        - Tampering with log output or tricking the user into pasting a crafted link.
    - The user must click on the malicious link in the terminal output.

* **Source code analysis:**
    1. **File: `/code/src/terminal-link-provider.ts`**:
        - This file implements the `ExecutableTerminalLinkProvider` class, which is responsible for providing terminal links and handling them.
        - The `provideTerminalLinks` method uses a regular expression to find URIs with the scheme `vscode-jest-exec://` or `vscode-jest://` in the terminal output.
        - The `handleTerminalLink` method parses the URI to extract the folder name, command, and arguments.
        - **Vulnerable Code Snippet**:
        ```typescript
        async handleTerminalLink(link: ExecutableTerminalLink): Promise<void> {
            try {
              const uri = vscode.Uri.parse(link.data);
              const folderName = decodeURIComponent(uri.authority);
              const command = decodeURIComponent(uri.path).substring(1);
              const args = uri.query && JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(uri.query));
              await vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, folderName, args); // Vulnerable line
            } catch (error) {
              vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Failed to handle link "${link.data}": ${error}`);
            }
          }
        ```
        - The vulnerability lies in the line `await vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, folderName, args);`.
        - The `command` variable is directly passed to `vscode.commands.executeCommand` without any validation.
        - The `args` variable, parsed from the URI query string using `JSON.parse`, is also passed directly to `vscode.commands.executeCommand` without validation.
        - An attacker who can control the terminal output could inject a malicious URI that, when clicked by a user, would execute an arbitrary VSCode command with attacker-controlled arguments.

* **Security test case:**
    1. **Preparation**: Install vscode-jest extension and create a test workspace.
    2. **Craft Malicious Terminal Link**:  `vscode-jest://testFolder/vscode.open?{"resource":"file:///etc/passwd"}` (or `vscode-jest-exec://testFolder/vscode.open?{"resource":"file:///etc/passwd"}`)
    3. **Simulate Malicious Terminal Output**: To simulate malicious terminal output, you can modify the extension to output a crafted link. For example, you could temporarily modify a test file to include `console.log('vscode-jest://testFolder/vscode.open?{"resource":"file:///etc/passwd"}')`.
    4. **Run tests in terminal**: Execute tests in the VS Code integrated terminal that will print the malicious link.
    5. **Click on the malicious link**: Click the generated link in the terminal output.
    6. **Verification**: Observe if VSCode attempts to open `/etc/passwd`. An error might occur due to permissions, but the attempt indicates successful command injection. You can also use a less sensitive command like `vscode.window.showInformationMessage` to display a message box as a less harmful test.

### 3. Command Injection via `jestCommandLine` Configuration

* **Description:**
    1. The extension retrieves the Jest command line setting from the `jest.jestCommandLine` configuration. This setting can be modified in workspace settings, user settings, or during the setup wizard.
    2. The extension uses this `jestCommandLine` string to construct shell commands for running Jest.
    3. The extension concatenates the user-supplied `jestCommandLine` value with fixed command parts and then executes the resulting string via a shell using `child_process.exec`.
    4. If the `jestCommandLine` is not properly validated, an attacker who can modify this setting (e.g., via a compromised workspace settings file or by tricking a user during setup wizard) can inject malicious shell commands.
    5. Dangerous shell metacharacters (e.g., “;”, “&”, or “`”) injected into `jestCommandLine` will be interpreted by the shell, leading to arbitrary command execution.
    6. This vulnerability exists in contexts where `jestCommandLine` is used, including general test runs, debug configurations, and potentially other extension features that rely on executing Jest commands.

* **Impact:**
    - Critical. Arbitrary command execution in the environment where VS Code (and hence the extension) is running.
    - This can lead to system compromise or complete takeover if executed with high privileges.
    - An attacker could:
        - Steal user credentials or tokens managed by VSCode.
        - Modify files on the user's system with VSCode's permissions.
        - Inject malicious code into opened projects.
        - Exfiltrate sensitive data from the user's workspace.
        - Potentially gain further access to the user's system depending on VSCode's privileges.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

* **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The extension uses basic escaping routines and relies on VS Code’s trusted APIs when retrieving configuration.
    - The `validateCommandLine` function in `wizard-helper.ts` performs basic validation for npm scripts and empty commands, but it's insufficient to prevent command injection.
    - `escapeRegExp` and `escapeQuotes` are used in `resolveDebugConfiguration` and `resolveDebugConfig2` for test name and test path, but not for the main command itself.

* **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement a comprehensive whitelist-based validation/sanitization of the `jestCommandLine` input (allowing only safe characters and command structures).
    - **Use of Argument Array for Child Process APIs:**  Use child process APIs (like `child_process.spawn`) that accept an array of arguments to completely avoid shell interpolation. This is crucial for preventing command injection.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Consider if the debug configuration and test execution need to execute arbitrary commands. If not, restrict the command execution capabilities.
    - **User Warning during Setup Wizard:** Warn users about the security risks of entering untrusted commands in the "Jest Command Line" input box during the setup wizard process.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to modify or inject a malicious `jest.jestCommandLine` value. This can be achieved by:
        - Modifying the workspace’s `.vscode/settings.json` file.
        - Tricking the user into entering a malicious command during the setup wizard process (especially in the "Jest Command Line" input box).

* **Source code analysis:**
    1. **File: Various files (e.g., `DebugConfigurationProvider.ts`, `extension.ts`, `wizard-helper.ts`)**:
        - The extension retrieves the Jest command line setting via VS Code’s configuration APIs without performing strict character checks or sanitization.
        - In `DebugConfigurationProvider.ts`, `createDebugConfig` uses `parseCmdLine` to parse `jestCommandLine`, which does not sanitize the input.
        - In `setup-wizard/tasks/setup-jest-cmdline.ts`, `editJestCmdLine` uses `showActionInputBox` to get user input for `jestCommandLine` without sanitization.
        - The extension then concatenates the provided value with fixed command fragments and passes it to the shell via `child_process.exec` (or similar shell-executing functions) in various parts of the codebase when running Jest processes.

* **Security test case:**
    1. **Modify Workspace Settings:** In a trusted workspace, update `.vscode/settings.json` with:
       ```json
       { "jest.jestCommandLine": "jest --watch; echo INJECTED" }
       ```
    2. **Open Workspace:** Open the workspace in VS Code so that the extension reads this configuration.
    3. **Start Test Run:** Trigger a test run using the extension (e.g., run all tests, run a specific test).
    4. **Inspect Output:** Inspect the shell output or logs (e.g., in the Output panel, Terminal) to verify whether “INJECTED” is output—confirming that the injected command ran.
    5. **Setup Wizard Test:** Alternatively, run the "Jest: Setup Extension" command, choose "Setup Jest Command", and enter `npm test -- ; touch /tmp/pwned` in the input box. Complete the wizard and then run or debug tests. Check if `/tmp/pwned` is created.

### 4. Potential Command Injection via Insufficient Escaping of Test Name Patterns

* **Description:**
    1. When constructing shell commands to run tests, the extension injects test names as part of the command arguments.
    2. A custom escaping routine is applied to test names before embedding them into shell commands.
    3. However, this escaping routine might not filter out all dangerous shell metacharacters (e.g., ";", "`", "&", etc.).
    4. An attacker could craft a test name containing characters such as “;” or "`" that, when interpolated into the shell command, allows for injecting and executing additional commands.
    5. If the escaping routine is insufficient, these injected metacharacters will be interpreted by the shell, leading to arbitrary command execution during test runs.

* **Impact:**
    - Critical. Arbitrary command execution during test runs.
    - This could lead to unintended shell command execution and potential system compromise.
    - An attacker could:
        - Steal user credentials or tokens managed by VSCode.
        - Modify files on the user's system with VSCode's permissions.
        - Inject malicious code into opened projects.
        - Exfiltrate sensitive data from the user's workspace.
        - Potentially gain further access to the user's system depending on VSCode's privileges.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

* **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - A custom escaping routine is applied to test names before they are embedded into shell commands. However, the effectiveness of this routine in preventing all forms of command injection is questionable.

* **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Strengthened Escaping Routine:**  Strengthen the escaping routine to enforce a strict whitelist of allowed characters in test names. Ensure that all dangerous shell metacharacters are effectively neutralized or rejected.
    - **Argument Array for Child Process APIs:** Use subprocess APIs that accept an argument array (like `child_process.spawn` with arguments array) to avoid shell interpolation altogether when passing test name patterns to Jest.
    - **Security Audit of Escaping Function:** Conduct a thorough security audit of the current escaping function to identify any bypasses or weaknesses.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply or modify test files (for example, via a malicious pull request or direct file modification) to include a test name with embedded shell metacharacters.

* **Source code analysis:**
    - **File: Codebase sections related to test execution (e.g., `JestRunner.ts`, command construction logic)**:
        - The extension extracts test names from test files and applies an escaping routine before constructing the shell command.
        - The escaping routine is likely implemented in a utility function and called before test names are interpolated into the command string.
        - However, the analysis suggests that the current escaping routine does not fully filter out dangerous metacharacters (such as “;”), leaving open the possibility for command injection.  The exact location and implementation of the escaping function and command construction logic needs closer inspection to confirm the vulnerability and its severity.

* **Security test case:**
    1. **Add Malicious Test Name:** Add a test file with the following content to a trusted workspace:
       ```js
       test("myTest; echo INJECTED", () => { expect(true).toBe(true); });
       ```
    2. **Run Tests:** Run the tests using the extension (e.g., run all tests, run this specific test).
    3. **Observe Output:** Observe (via dry-run logs, output panel, or terminal) whether “echo INJECTED” is executed as part of the command—confirming command injection. You might need to enable verbose logging or use a debugger to inspect the exact command being executed.

### 5. Directory Traversal via Misconfigured `jest.rootPath` Setting

* **Description:**
    1. The extension reads the `jest.rootPath` configuration from the workspace settings.
    2. The extension resolves the configured `jest.rootPath` into an absolute path using a helper function (e.g., `toAbsoluteRootPath`).
    3. The implementation **does not verify whether this resolved path lies inside the workspace folder.**
    4. An attacker who can modify the workspace settings may specify a relative path containing directory traversal elements (e.g., `"../../"`).
    5. When accepted, the extension will run Jest against a directory outside the intended project boundary.
    6. This can lead to the extension operating on files and directories outside of the intended workspace.

* **Impact:**
    - High. Directory traversal and potential information disclosure.
    - The use of a `rootPath` pointing outside the intended project boundary can lead to:
        - Information disclosure—exposing files or directory contents outside the project.
        - Executing Jest in an unintended directory, potentially leading to unintended test execution or manipulation of files outside the workspace.
        - This may enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive file data or cause further escalation.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The extension performs an existence check on the target directory using `existsSync`, but it **does not verify that the resulting absolute path is contained within the workspace.**

* **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Bounds Checking on Resolved Path:** Enforce bounds checking on the computed absolute path to ensure it is a subdirectory of the workspace folder. Reject configurations where `jest.rootPath` resolves to a directory outside the workspace.
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the `jest.rootPath` input to reject directory traversal tokens (e.g., “..”) that would result in a `rootPath` outside of the workspace.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to modify or supply a workspace settings file that sets a malicious `jest.rootPath` value.

* **Source code analysis:**
    - **File: Codebase sections using `jest.rootPath` (e.g., `setup-jest-cmdline.ts`, `wizard-helper.ts`, other configuration handling files)**:
        - In the extension’s setup tasks and helper routines, the extension calls `toAbsoluteRootPath(workspaceFolder, rootPath)` (or similar functions) using the `jest.rootPath` value provided in configuration.
        - There is a missing step to verify that the resolved absolute path remains within the `workspaceFolder`.
        - This omission means that a relative value like `"../../"` can resolve to a directory outside the intended project directory.

* **Security test case:**
    1. **Set Malicious `rootPath`:** In the workspace’s `.vscode/settings.json`, set:
       ```json
       { "jest.rootPath": "../../" }
       ```
    2. **Open Workspace:** Open the workspace in VS Code so that the extension loads this configuration.
    3. **Trigger Test Run:** Trigger a test run (or any feature that uses `jest.rootPath`).
    4. **Inspect Behavior:** Inspect logs, output, or extension behavior to determine whether the resolved path points outside the workspace. For example, check if Jest is running against files outside the workspace or if file lists from outside the project are being processed.
    5. **Verify Vulnerability:** If the extension runs Jest in a directory outside of the workspace (or if file lists from outside the project are disclosed), the directory traversal vulnerability is confirmed.
