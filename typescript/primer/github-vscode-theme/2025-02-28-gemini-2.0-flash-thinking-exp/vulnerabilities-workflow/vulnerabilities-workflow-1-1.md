Okay, I understand the instructions.

Based on your statement, there are no vulnerabilities that meet the specified criteria (high or critical rank, exploitable by external attacker, not DoS, not developer insecure code, not just missing documentation, valid and not mitigated).

Therefore, the vulnerability list is empty.

Here is the markdown formatted output reflecting that there are no vulnerabilities meeting the criteria:
