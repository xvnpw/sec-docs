## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified vulnerabilities in the project. Each vulnerability is described in detail, including its potential impact, rank, existing mitigations, missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and a security test case to verify the vulnerability.

### 1. Command Injection via Unquoted Shell Arguments in Diff Workflow

**Description:**

In the GitHub Actions workflow defined in the file `.github/workflows/diff.yml`, a shell script step iterates over JSON files in the `themes` directory using a plain for-loop. The script uses an unquoted variable (`$file`) to build a `diff` command. An external attacker, by submitting a pull request with a specially crafted filename containing shell metacharacters (e.g., a filename with a semicolon or backticks) in the `themes` folder, can inject arbitrary commands into the shell command line when the diff job runs. The shell interpolates the malicious filename without proper quoting, leading to command injection.

**Impact:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the GitHub Actions runner. This can compromise the build environment, potentially exposing secrets, corrupting the build process, and enabling further attacks.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**

No quoting or input validation is applied to the filename variable within the `diff` command in the workflow script.

**Missing Mitigations:**

The shell command should employ safe quoting of the filename variable, such as using `"$file"` when constructing the command. Alternatively, a safer approach would be to iterate over a trusted list of filenames or utilize tools that avoid shell interpolation altogether.

**Preconditions:**

An attacker must be capable of submitting a pull request that adds or renames a file within the `themes` directory. The filename must include shell metacharacters to facilitate command injection.

**Source Code Analysis:**

In the `.github/workflows/diff.yml` file, the following code snippet is responsible for computing the diff:

```yaml
diff=$(for file in themes/*.json
  do
    diff -U 1 base/$file $file
  done)
```

The vulnerability arises because the variable `$file` is not enclosed in quotes. This lack of quoting causes the shell to directly interpret the contents of `$file` as part of the command. For instance, if an attacker introduces a file named `malicious.json; rm -rf /`, the executed command might become:

```bash
diff -U 1 base/malicious.json; rm -rf / malicious.json; rm -rf /
```

This example clearly demonstrates how command injection is possible due to the unquoted variable.

**Security Test Case:**

1.  **Fork the Repository and Create a Branch:** Begin by forking the repository to your personal account and create a new branch for testing purposes.
2.  **Add a Malicious File:** Within your branch, navigate to the `themes` directory and add a new file with a name containing shell metacharacters. For example, name the file `test.json; echo "vulnerable" > injected.txt`.
3.  **Open a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request from your branch to the main repository.
4.  **Trigger GitHub Actions Workflows:** The pull request will automatically trigger the GitHub Actions workflows, including the `diff` job.
5.  **Examine Workflow Logs:** Review the logs from the `Diff` workflow step. Look for evidence that the injected command was executed. For instance, check if the string "vulnerable" was echoed in the logs or if the file `injected.txt` was unexpectedly created on the runner.
6.  **Verify Mitigation (Optional):** Implement the suggested mitigation by quoting the filename variable (e.g., `"$file"`) in the workflow file. Repeat steps 1-5 to confirm that the injected command is no longer executed when filenames are properly quoted.

### 2. Prototype Pollution via Unrestricted Property Iteration in `changeColorToHexAlphas`

**Description:**

The `changeColorToHexAlphas` function in the theme-generation module (`src/theme.js`) is designed to recursively traverse a raw colors configuration object and convert color values to hexadecimal strings. However, the implementation uses a `for...in` loop to iterate over object properties without checking if these properties are own properties of the object, neglecting to use `hasOwnProperty` or `Object.keys()`. If an attacker can supply a malicious JSON configuration containing inherited properties, such as a `__proto__` key, these inherited properties will be processed and set on the object. This can lead to prototype pollution, where properties are inadvertently added to `Object.prototype`, potentially altering the behavior of all objects in the application.

**Impact:**

Prototype pollution can have significant and widespread consequences. An attacker might manipulate objects throughout the extension to bypass security checks, alter intended functionality, or, in severe cases and when combined with other vulnerabilities, achieve arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**

The current implementation of the `changeColorToHexAlphas` function does not include any mitigations to prevent prototype pollution. It iterates over all enumerable properties, including inherited ones.

**Missing Mitigations:**

The code should be updated to iterate exclusively over own properties of the object. This can be achieved by using `Object.keys(obj).forEach(...)` or by incorporating a check like `if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, keys))` before processing each property within the `for...in` loop.

**Preconditions:**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted JSON configuration (or override file) for theme colors that includes unexpected inherited keys, specifically a key named `__proto__`. While theme files are typically part of the extension's package, if a user override mechanism is introduced in the future, or if the package's JSON files are compromised through a supply-chain attack, this vulnerability could be triggered.

**Source Code Analysis:**

The vulnerable function `changeColorToHexAlphas` is located in `src/theme.js`. The relevant code section is:

```javascript
function changeColorToHexAlphas(obj) {
  if (typeof obj === 'object') {
    for (var keys in obj) {
      if (typeof obj[keys] === 'object') {
        changeColorToHexAlphas(obj[keys])
      } else {
        let keyValue = obj[keys]
        if(chroma.valid(keyValue)){
          obj[keys] = chroma(keyValue).hex();
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return obj;
}
```

The `for (var keys in obj)` loop iterates through all enumerable properties of `obj`, including those inherited from the prototype chain. If a malicious input like the following is processed:

```javascript
let maliciousInput = {
  "__proto__": { "polluted": true },
  "validColor": "#abcdef"
};
```

After `changeColorToHexAlphas(maliciousInput)` is executed, the prototype of all objects will be modified to include a new property `polluted` with the value `true`.

**Security Test Case:**

1.  **Construct a Malicious Object:** In a controlled testing environment (or an isolated test file), create a malicious JavaScript object designed to exploit prototype pollution:
    ```javascript
    let maliciousInput = {
      "__proto__": { "polluted": true },
      "validColor": "#abcdef"
    };
    ```
2.  **Call the Vulnerable Function:** Execute the `changeColorToHexAlphas` function with the malicious object as input:
    ```javascript
    changeColorToHexAlphas(maliciousInput);
    ```
3.  **Check for Prototype Pollution:** After the function call, verify if the prototype of a plain JavaScript object has been altered. You can do this by checking if the `polluted` property exists and is set to `true` on a newly created object's prototype:
    ```javascript
    if (({}).polluted === true) {
      console.error("Prototype polluted!");
    }
    ```
4.  **Confirm Mitigation (Optional):** Implement the suggested mitigation by modifying the `changeColorToHexAlphas` function to iterate only over own properties. Rerun the test with the malicious input to confirm that prototype pollution no longer occurs after applying the fix.
5.  **Validate User-Supplied JSON Sanitization (If Applicable):** If user-supplied JSON for theme overrides is supported in the future, ensure that any user input is sanitized to reject dangerous keys like `__proto__` before processing it with `changeColorToHexAlphas` or similar functions.
