### Remote Code Execution via `vscode.eval`/`vscode.eval_async`

- Vulnerability Name: Remote Code Execution via `vscode.eval`/`vscode.eval_async`

- Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a Neovim configuration or plugin that utilizes the `vscode.eval` or `vscode.eval_async` Lua API functions.
    2. Within the Neovim Lua code, the attacker can pass arbitrary Javascript code as a string argument to `vscode.eval` or `vscode.eval_async`.
    3. When the VSCode Neovim extension executes this Lua code, it will pass the Javascript string to the `eval_for_client` function in `src/actions_eval.ts`.
    4. The `eval_for_client` function uses the Javascript `eval()` function to execute the provided string.
    5. Because the `eval()` function executes the string as Javascript code within the VSCode extension host process, the attacker can execute arbitrary code, bypassing any sandboxing and gaining full access to the VSCode API and Node.js environment.

- Impact:
    - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the VSCode extension host process. This gives the attacker full control over the extension's privileges, which can include:
        - Accessing and modifying files on the user's file system.
        - Stealing sensitive information, such as credentials or API keys, that VSCode or other extensions might have access to.
        - Installing malicious extensions or modifying existing ones.
        - Injecting malicious code into opened files.
        - Potentially escalating privileges to the user's account if the VSCode extension host process has higher privileges.
        - General system compromise depending on the permissions of the VSCode process.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses `eval()` without any sanitization or restrictions on the input code. The API is exposed without any input sanitization or access control and is intended for legitimate extension functionality.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The extension should not directly execute arbitrary Javascript code provided from Neovim. Instead of using `eval()`, consider safer alternatives like a restricted Javascript sandbox or completely removing the ability to execute arbitrary Javascript code.
    - API restriction: Limit the capabilities of the `vscode.eval` and `vscode.eval_async` APIs to only allow specific, safe operations instead of arbitrary code execution. Consider if such powerful API access is absolutely necessary for the core functionality of the extension. If not, restricting or removing these APIs would be the most effective mitigation.
    - Principle of least privilege: Restrict the capabilities of the Javascript code executed via `vscode.eval` and `vscode.eval_async` to the bare minimum required. However, given the nature of the API, complete mitigation without breaking functionality might be challenging.
    - User warning: If arbitrary code execution is intended functionality, clearly document the security risks and warn users about the dangers of using untrusted Neovim configurations or plugins that utilize these APIs. However, this is not a proper mitigation but rather a disclosure of risk.
    - Documentation explicitly warning against executing untrusted Javascript code via this API. However, documentation alone is not a mitigation against direct exploitation.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the Neovim configuration or install a malicious Neovim plugin that utilizes the `vscode.eval` or `vscode.eval_async` APIs. For an external attacker, this usually means tricking a user into using a malicious Neovim configuration.
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute commands within Neovim, which is the standard threat model for VSCode extensions integrating with external editors.
    - The extension must be running and the Neovim instance connected to the extension must be under the attacker's control or influence (e.g., through a malicious Neovim configuration).
    - The user must have the VSCode Neovim extension installed.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/actions_eval.ts`
    ```typescript
    import _vscode from "vscode";
    import { createLogger } from "./logger";

    const vscode = _vscode;
    const logger = createLogger("eval");

    export async function eval_for_client(code: string, args: any): Promise<any> {
        void args;

        const func: () => Promise<any> = eval("async () => {" + code + "}"); // Vulnerable line: Using eval() to execute code argument

        const result = await func();

        let data: string | undefined;
        try {
            data = JSON.stringify(result);
        } catch (e) {
            throw new Error(`Return value of eval not JSON serializable: ${e}`);
        }

        return data ? JSON.parse(data) : data;
    }
    ```
    - The `eval_for_client` function takes a `code` string as input, which is directly concatenated into a string that is then executed using Javascript's `eval()` function.
    - Any Javascript code injected into the `code` variable will be executed with the full privileges of the VSCode extension host.
    - There is no sanitization or validation of the `code` argument before it is passed to `eval()`.
    - File: `/code/src/actions.ts`
    ```typescript
        this.add("eval", (code: string, args: any) => eval_for_client(code, args));
        this.add("eval_async", (code: string, args: any, callback: string) => { //Note: eval_async is not in the API doc, but it exists in code
            eval_for_client(code, args).then(
                (result) => {
                    if (callback) {
                        this.client?.executeLua('require"vscode.api".invoke_callback(...)', [
                            callback,
                            result,
                            false,
                        ]);
                    }
                },
                (err: Error) => {
                    if (callback) {
                        this.client?.executeLua('require"vscode.api".invoke_callback(...)', [callback, err.message, true]);
                    }
                },
            );
        });
    ```
    - The `actions.ts` file registers the `eval` and `eval_async` actions, which are callable from Neovim.
    - These actions directly pass the `code` argument to the vulnerable `eval_for_client` function.
    - API Exposure: The `vscode.eval` and `vscode.eval_async` functions are exposed to Neovim Lua scripts through the `vscode` module (see `/code/README.md` and `/code/runtime/lua/vscode.lua`).
    - Full Access to VSCode API: Code executed via `eval()` has access to the `vscode` global, which provides the entire VSCode API. This allows the attacker to perform any action that the VSCode extension is capable of.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup: Install the vscode-neovim extension. Ensure Neovim is installed and configured for use with the extension. Have a publicly accessible instance of a VSCode project where you can modify Neovim configuration files. No specific Neovim configuration is needed beyond the extension's requirements as the vulnerability can be triggered via the API.
    2. Create or modify a Neovim configuration file (`init.lua` or `init.vim`) in your Neovim configuration directory (e.g., `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` or `~/.vimrc`).
    3. Add the following Lua code to `init.lua` (or equivalent VimScript to `init.vim`) to trigger the vulnerability, for example by creating a file in the `/tmp/` directory:
    ```lua
    vim.api.nvim_command [[
        lua
            local vscode = require('vscode')
            local command = "require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/pwned')"
            vscode.eval(command)
    ]]
    ```
    Alternatively, to display a visible message in VSCode:
    ```lua
    vim.api.nvim_command [[
      nnoremap <leader>x :lua require('vscode').eval("vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Vulnerability Triggered!')")<CR>
    ]]
    ```
    Or to interact with the clipboard:
    ```lua
    vim.api.nvim_command [[
      nnoremap <leader>x :lua require('vscode').eval("vscode.env.clipboard.writeText('Exploited!')")<CR>
    ]]
    ```
    Or using `:lua` command directly in Neovim:
    ```vimscript
    :lua require('vscode').eval('require("child_process").exec("touch /tmp/pwned")', {})
    ```
    Or using `:lua` to show information message:
    ```vimscript
    :lua require('vscode').eval('vscode.window.showInformationMessage("PWNED!")', {})
    ```
    4. Open VSCode with this Neovim configuration active and open any text file in VSCode.
    5. Trigger the vulnerability. If you used the file creation payload, observe: After VSCode starts and the extension initializes Neovim, a file named `pwned` will be created in the `/tmp/` directory (or the equivalent temporary directory on the target system). If you used the keybinding payload, enter normal mode (if not already in normal mode) and press `<leader>x` (by default, `<leader>` is `\`, so press `\x`).
    6. Verify Impact. If you used the file creation payload, check for the existence of the `/tmp/pwned` file. If the file exists, it confirms that arbitrary code execution was achieved through the `vscode.eval` API. If you used the message payload, an error message box or information message box with the specified text should appear in VSCode, confirming code execution. If you used the clipboard payload, try pasting (e.g., `Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V`) in another application. The clipboard should contain "Exploited!", demonstrating the ability to interact with system functionalities via RCE.
    7. Cleanup: Delete the `/tmp/pwned` file if it was created.

This vulnerability allows for critical impact, as it enables arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension host, making it a critical vulnerability.
