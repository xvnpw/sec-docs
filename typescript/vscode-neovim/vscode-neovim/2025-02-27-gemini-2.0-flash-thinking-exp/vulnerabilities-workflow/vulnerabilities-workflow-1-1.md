## Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Javascript Code Injection in `eval_for_client`
  - Description: The `eval_for_client` function in `/code/src/actions_eval.ts` evaluates Javascript code received from Neovim using the `eval()` function. This allows for arbitrary Javascript code execution if an attacker can control the `code` parameter passed to this function.
  - Impact: Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension context. An attacker could potentially exfiltrate sensitive information, install malware, or further compromise the user's system by controlling the behavior of the VSCode editor.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly uses `eval()` without any sanitization or validation of the input.
  - Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The `code` parameter should be strictly validated and sanitized to prevent execution of malicious Javascript code.
    - Avoid `eval()`:  Using `eval()` to execute arbitrary code is inherently unsafe. A safer alternative should be used, or the functionality should be restricted to prevent arbitrary code execution.
  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send a `vscode-action` notification to the extension with the action name `eval` and a malicious Javascript code string as the `code` argument.
    - This can be achieved by a malicious Neovim plugin, a compromised Neovim configuration, or if the user executes a malicious command within Neovim that triggers this action.
  - Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/actions_eval.ts`
    - Step 1: The `eval_for_client` function is defined to accept a `code` string and `args` as input.
    - Step 2: The function uses `eval("async () => {" + code + "}")` to create an asynchronous function from the provided `code` string.
    - Step 3: This dynamically created function is then executed using `await func()`.
    - Step 4: The result is serialized to JSON and returned.
    ```typescript
    // /code/src/actions_eval.ts
    export async function eval_for_client(code: string, args: any): Promise<any> {
        void args;

        const func: () => Promise<any> = eval("async () => {" + code + "}"); // Vulnerable line
        const result = await func();

        let data: string | undefined;
        try {
            data = JSON.stringify(result);
        } catch (e) {
            throw new Error(`Return value of eval not JSON serializable: ${e}`);
        }

        return data ? JSON.parse(data) : data;
    }
    ```

          A[Neovim (Attacker Controlled)] --> B(vscode-neovim Extension);
          B -- vscode-action: eval, {code: "malicious code"} --> C[actions.ts: runAction];
          C --> D[actions.ts: ActionManager.run];
          D --> E[actions.ts: commands.executeCommand("neovim:eval")];
          E --> F[actions.ts: eval_for_client];
          F --> G[actions_eval.ts: eval(code)];
          G --> H[Arbitrary Javascript Code Execution in VSCode Extension Context];
      ```
  - Security test case:
    - Step 1: Install and activate the vscode-neovim extension in VSCode.
    - Step 2: Open any text file in VSCode to ensure the extension is active.
    - Step 3: Open the Neovim editor (either embedded or a separate Neovim instance connected to VSCode).
    - Step 4: In Neovim, execute the following Lua command:
      ```vimscript
      :lua require'vscode'.run_action('eval', {code='vscode.window.showErrorMessage("Vulnerable to Javascript Injection!")'})
      ```
    - Step 5: Observe that a VSCode error message box appears with the text "Vulnerable to Javascript Injection!".
    - Step 6: This confirms that arbitrary Javascript code provided from Neovim can be executed within the VSCode extension context via the `eval` action. An attacker can replace `"vscode.window.showErrorMessage(\"Vulnerable to Javascript Injection!\")"` with more malicious Javascript code to further compromise the system.

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Path Traversal in `handleOpenFile`
  - Description: The `handleOpenFile` function in `/code/src/buffer_manager.ts` uses `path.resolve` to construct file paths based on the `fileName` received from Neovim's `open-file` event. If an attacker can control the `fileName` parameter, they might be able to perform path traversal attacks and access files outside of the workspace.
  - Impact: An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the user's system if they can control the `fileName` parameter in the `open-file` event. This could lead to information disclosure.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code uses `path.resolve` without sanitizing or validating the `fileName`.
  - Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Validate and sanitize the `fileName` parameter to prevent path traversal characters like `..` or absolute paths.
    - Use `path.join` instead of `path.resolve`: `path.join` is generally safer for joining path segments and preventing traversal.
  - Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send an `open-file` event to the extension with a malicious `fileName` string.
    - This can be achieved by a malicious Neovim plugin, a compromised Neovim configuration, or if the user executes a malicious command within Neovim that triggers this action with attacker controlled filename.
  - Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/buffer_manager.ts`
    - Step 1: The `handleOpenFile` function is called when the `open-file` event is received from Neovim.
    - Step 2: The function extracts the `fileName` from the event data.
    - Step 3: The function calls `this.findPathFromFileName(normalizedName)` to resolve the file path.
    - Step 4: `findPathFromFileName` uses `path.resolve(folders[0].uri.fsPath, name)` which can be vulnerable to path traversal.
    ```typescript
    // /code/src/buffer_manager.ts
    private findPathFromFileName(name: string): string {
        const folders = workspace.workspaceFolders;
        return folders && folders.length > 0 ? path.resolve(folders[0].uri.fsPath, name) : name; // Vulnerable line
    }

    private async handleOpenFile(data: EventBusData<"open-file">) {
        const [fileName, close] = data;
        ...
        else {
            const normalizedName = fileName.trim();
            let uri = Uri.from({ scheme: "file", path: this.findPathFromFileName(normalizedName) }); // Call to vulnerable function
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
    ```
    - Visualization:
      ```mermaid
      graph LR
          A[Neovim (Attacker Controlled)] --> B(vscode-neovim Extension);
          B -- open-file: {fileName: "malicious/path"} --> C[buffer_manager.ts: handleOpenFile];
          C --> D[buffer_manager.ts: findPathFromFileName];
          D --> E[path.resolve(workspaceRoot, fileName)];
          E --> F[Potential Path Traversal];
      ```
  - Security test case:
    - Step 1: Install and activate the vscode-neovim extension in VSCode.
    - Step 2: Open a workspace in VSCode.
    - Step 3: Open the Neovim editor (either embedded or a separate Neovim instance connected to VSCode).
    - Step 4: In Neovim, execute the following Lua command:
      ```vimscript
      :lua require'vscode'.run_action('open-file', {'../../../sensitive_file.txt'})
      ```
      Replace `../../../sensitive_file.txt` with a path to a file you want to test for access (e.g., a file outside of your workspace but accessible by your user).
    - Step 5: Check if VSCode opens the file specified in the path traversal attempt. If it does, the vulnerability is confirmed.
