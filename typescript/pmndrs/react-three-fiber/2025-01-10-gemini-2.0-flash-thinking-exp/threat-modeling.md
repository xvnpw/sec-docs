# Threat Model Analysis for pmndrs/react-three-fiber

## Threat: [Shader Injection via Dynamic Shader Modification](./threats/shader_injection_via_dynamic_shader_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Shader Injection via Dynamic Shader Modification
    *   **Description:** If the application uses `react-three-fiber` components like `<shaderMaterial>` or `<RawShaderMaterial>` and allows user-controlled data to directly influence the shader source code (e.g., through `uniforms` that construct GLSL strings or by directly manipulating shader chunks within the component's implementation), an attacker can inject malicious shader code. This is a direct consequence of how `r3f` allows developers to define and manipulate shaders.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution on the GPU (potentially impacting the entire system), denial of service by creating resource-intensive or infinite loop shaders, or visual manipulation for phishing or misleading purposes.
    *   **Affected react-three-fiber Component:**  `<shaderMaterial>`, `<RawShaderMaterial>`, components that utilize `uniforms` or `glsl` template literals for dynamic shader generation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic shader generation based on untrusted input if possible.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used to construct shader code within `r3f` components.
        *   Use pre-defined shader options or a limited set of safe parameters instead of allowing arbitrary shader code manipulation through `r3f`'s API.
        *   Consider using a shader validation or sanitization library if dynamic generation is unavoidable within the `r3f` context.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Raycasting Logic within `react-three-fiber` Event Handlers](./threats/insecure_handling_of_raycasting_logic_within__react-three-fiber__event_handlers.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of Raycasting Logic within `react-three-fiber` Event Handlers
    *   **Description:** If the application relies on `react-three-fiber`'s event handlers (like `onPointerClick`, `onPointerMove`) and uses raycasting within these handlers to determine which 3D object was interacted with, vulnerabilities can arise if the logic for handling these interactions is not secure. An attacker could manipulate input (e.g., mouse position) to trigger actions on unintended objects, especially if the raycasting logic doesn't properly account for object hierarchy, visibility, or intended interaction targets defined within the `r3f` component structure.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to unauthorized actions within the 3D environment, potentially bypassing intended security controls or triggering unintended application behavior due to misidentification of the targeted object within the `r3f` scene.
    *   **Affected react-three-fiber Component:** Event handlers (`onPointerClick`, `onPointerMove`, etc.), potentially custom components that implement raycasting logic using `useFrame` and `Raycaster` within the `r3f` context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust validation and authorization checks for actions triggered by raycasting within `r3f` event handlers.
        *   Be mindful of the precision and potential for manipulation of raycasting coordinates within the `r3f` event handling context.
        *   Carefully structure your `r3f` scene and event handlers to ensure that interactions target the intended objects.
        *   Consider using event propagation and bubbling within the `r3f` component tree to manage interactions more predictably.
        *   Implement checks to verify the target object's properties or tags before executing sensitive actions.
