# Attack Surface Analysis for pmndrs/react-three-fiber

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injection via Props/State for Scene Rendering](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injection_via_propsstate_for_scene_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious or unexpected data into the application's state or props that are used to define the 3D scene rendered by `react-three-fiber`. This can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or denial-of-service.
    *   **How React-Three-Fiber Contributes:** `react-three-fiber` components directly render the 3D scene based on the data provided through React props and state. If this data is compromised, the rendered scene can be manipulated, leading to client-side issues.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies user profile data that includes a color value used for an object's material in the 3D scene. They inject a very long string, causing a rendering error or performance issues due to excessive memory allocation handled by `react-three-fiber`'s rendering loop.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side errors, denial-of-service (performance degradation or crashes specifically within the `react-three-fiber` rendering context), unexpected visual behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all data used for geometry creation, material properties, object transformations, and other scene-defining attributes *before* passing them as props to `react-three-fiber` components.
        *   Implement strict type checking (e.g., PropTypes or TypeScript) to enforce expected data types for props passed to `react-three-fiber` components.
        *   Consider using immutable data structures to prevent accidental or malicious modifications that could affect the `react-three-fiber` scene.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitable Vulnerabilities in Loaded 3D Assets](./attack_surfaces/exploitable_vulnerabilities_in_loaded_3d_assets.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload or provide links to maliciously crafted 3D models (e.g., GLTF, OBJ) or textures that exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic of `three.js` loaders *used by* `react-three-fiber`.
    *   **How React-Three-Fiber Contributes:** `react-three-fiber` relies on `three.js` loaders to load external assets. While the vulnerability may be in `three.js`, the act of loading and rendering these assets within a `react-three-fiber` application is the point of exposure.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted GLTF file that exploits a buffer overflow in the GLTFLoader. When `react-three-fiber` attempts to load and render this model, it causes a client-side crash.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side crashes, denial-of-service specifically related to the `react-three-fiber` rendering process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust server-side validation and sanitization of uploaded 3D models and textures *before* they are served to the client and loaded by `react-three-fiber` loaders.
        *   Restrict the file types allowed for upload to only necessary and well-understood formats.
        *   Ensure the application uses the latest versions of `three.js` and `react-three-fiber` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the loaders.
        *   If feasible, process and sanitize 3D assets on the server-side using dedicated libraries before making them available for `react-three-fiber` to load.
