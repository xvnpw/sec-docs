## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise React-three-fiber Application -> Execute Arbitrary Code within Application Context](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_react-three-fiber_application_-_execute_arbitrary_code_within_application__b26cef0a.md)

*   **Goal:** The attacker aims to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, gaining full control over its functionality and data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Three.js Vulnerabilities via react-three-fiber:**
        *   **Inject Malicious 3D Models [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in Three.js loaders (e.g., GLTFLoader) to inject and execute code during model parsing.
            *   Supplying crafted 3D models that contain embedded JavaScript which gets executed by the rendering engine or related libraries (if such auto-execution vulnerabilities exist).
    *   **Exploit React-three-fiber Specific Rendering Logic:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how react-three-fiber handles props and events [CRITICAL NODE]:
            *   Injecting malicious data through React props that, when processed by react-three-fiber, leads to code execution.
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in event handling mechanisms within react-three-fiber to trigger unintended code execution.
    *   **Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vulnerabilities related to react-three-fiber (if applicable):**
        *   Injecting malicious data during the server-side rendering process that is then executed on the client-side when the application is loaded.
        *   Exploiting inconsistencies between how rendering is handled on the server and the client to inject malicious code that is only effective in the client environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Goal:** The attacker aims to make the application unavailable or unusable for legitimate users.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion via Rendering [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Supply excessively complex 3D models that overload the rendering pipeline [CRITICAL NODE]:
            *   Providing 3D models with an extremely high polygon count or intricate details that consume excessive CPU and GPU resources, leading to application freezes or crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exfiltrate Sensitive Information (Indirectly via Scene Manipulation) -> Embed Sensitive Data within 3D Models or Textures](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exfiltrate_sensitive_information__indirectly_via_scene_manipulation__-_embed_sensitive_f2ab6959.md)

*   **Goal:** The attacker aims to exfiltrate sensitive information from the application without direct access to the underlying data stores.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Embed Sensitive Data within 3D Models or Textures [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Concealing sensitive data within the geometry data of 3D models or the pixel data of textures using steganographic techniques.
        *   Utilizing advanced steganographic methods to embed data within the visual aspects of the 3D scene, making it difficult to detect without specific analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Shaders](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_shaders.md)

*   **Goal:** The attacker aims to execute code on the GPU or cause a denial of service by exploiting shader vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in shader compilation or execution to run arbitrary code on the GPU, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   Injecting shaders that contain infinite loops or perform computationally intensive operations, leading to GPU resource exhaustion and application crashes.
