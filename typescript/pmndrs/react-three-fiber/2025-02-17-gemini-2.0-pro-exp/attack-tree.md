## Attack Tree Path: [{1.1. Malicious Props}](./attack_tree_paths/{1_1__malicious_props}.md)

*   **Description:** This is the entry point for attacks that leverage vulnerabilities in how `react-three-fiber` handles props passed to its components. If R3F doesn't properly sanitize or validate these props *before* passing them to Three.js, an attacker could inject malicious data.
*   **Why Critical:** Common entry point, high potential impact if exploited.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [{1.1.1 XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)}](./attack_tree_paths/{1_1_1_xss__cross-site_scripting_}.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript (e.g., `<script>` tags) into a prop that is ultimately used in a way that allows the script to execute. This is less common in R3F than in traditional web apps because R3F deals primarily with 3D scene data, but it's still possible, especially with custom shaders or text geometries.
*   **Why Critical:** High impact (client-side code execution), relatively low effort/skill compared to other code execution paths.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Rigorous input sanitization using a library like DOMPurify *before* the data reaches the R3F component. Sanitize *all* props, even those you believe are safe.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.2 Code Injection]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_2_code_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects arbitrary Three.js code through a prop that is used to dynamically construct Three.js objects or code (e.g., a prop that defines a shader). This could lead to manipulation of the scene, access to sensitive data, or denial of service.
*   **Why Critical:** Very high impact (full control over the 3D scene, potential for client-side code execution).
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Avoid using props to dynamically generate Three.js code. If necessary, use a strict allowlist approach. *Never* use `eval()` or `new Function()` with user input. Consider a template system with strict escaping.

## Attack Tree Path: [{2.2. Three.js Dependency Issues}](./attack_tree_paths/{2_2__three_js_dependency_issues}.md)

*   **Description:** This represents vulnerabilities stemming from the use of Three.js as a dependency. R3F relies on Three.js, so vulnerabilities in Three.js can be exposed through R3F.
*   **Why Critical:** High potential impact, especially if a known vulnerability exists.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [{2.2.1 Vulnerable Three.js Version}](./attack_tree_paths/{2_2_1_vulnerable_three_js_version}.md)

*   **Description:** The application is using a version of Three.js that has known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Attackers can often find readily available exploits for these vulnerabilities.
*   **Why Critical:** High likelihood (if updates are neglected), very high impact (depending on the vulnerability), very low effort (often using publicly available exploits). This is the *most* practically critical node.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:** Keep Three.js up-to-date with the latest stable release. Regularly check for security advisories. Use dependency management tools (npm, yarn) to track and update dependencies automatically. Implement vulnerability scanning.
