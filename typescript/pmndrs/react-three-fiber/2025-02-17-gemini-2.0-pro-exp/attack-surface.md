## Attack Surface: [Untrusted 3D Model Loading (R3F-Facilitated)](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_3d_model_loading__r3f-facilitated_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the parsing and rendering of 3D model files (GLTF, OBJ, etc.) loaded from external or user-provided sources, *specifically through R3F's loading mechanisms*.
*   **How `react-three-fiber` Contributes:** R3F provides the React components and hooks (e.g., `useLoader`) that developers use to load and integrate these models into the scene.  While the parsing itself is handled by Three.js, R3F *is the entry point* for this process within the React application.  This makes R3F a critical point of control for implementing mitigations.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted GLTF file designed to exploit a (hypothetical) buffer overflow vulnerability in Three.js's texture parsing logic.  The application uses R3F's `useLoader` to load this model.  If the vulnerability is triggered, it could (in a very rare, worst-case scenario) lead to arbitrary code execution. More realistically, a complex model causes a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) is highly likely.  Arbitrary code execution is *extremely* rare but theoretically possible if a severe underlying vulnerability exists in Three.js.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is readily achievable; code execution is extremely rare but high impact).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (at the R3F loading point):**
        *   **File Type:** Enforce strict file type checks *before* passing the file to `useLoader` or similar R3F functions.
        *   **File Size:** Limit file size *before* passing to R3F.
        *   **Complexity Checks (using `gltf-validator` or similar):**  Ideally, perform these checks *before* even allowing the file to be processed by R3F.  This prevents R3F from even attempting to load a potentially dangerous model.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use a strict CSP to limit the origins from which models and textures can be loaded. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Sandboxing (if feasible):** Explore loading models in a Web Worker or sandboxed iframe. This is a more advanced technique but provides strong isolation.
    *   **Server-Side Validation:** Validate models on the server *before* they are ever made available to the R3F loading mechanisms on the client.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Three.js and R3F updated. This is crucial for patching any discovered vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Shader Code (R3F-Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_shader_code__r3f-enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in custom shaders (GLSL) *when user input directly or indirectly influences the shader code used within R3F components*.
*   **How `react-three-fiber` Contributes:** R3F allows developers to define and apply custom shaders to materials within the React component tree.  If any part of the shader code is constructed or modified based on user input, *and this input is not rigorously sanitized*, it creates a direct attack vector through R3F.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to adjust a "glow intensity" parameter, which is then directly used as a multiplier within a GLSL shader.  An attacker provides a value that includes malicious GLSL code (e.g., `1.0; for(;;){}`), causing an infinite loop in the shader and freezing the GPU.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (GPU resource exhaustion) is highly likely. Information disclosure via timing attacks is possible but less likely.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is easily achievable).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User-Influenced Shader Code:** The *most important* mitigation is to **never** allow user input to directly or indirectly construct GLSL code strings. Use pre-defined, vetted shaders.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization (if absolutely unavoidable):** If user input *must* influence shader *parameters* (not the code itself), implement extremely rigorous sanitization and validation:
        *   **Whitelisting:** Only allow a very limited set of known-safe values.
        *   **Type Checking:** Ensure the input is of the correct data type (e.g., a number, a specific string from a predefined list).
        *   **Range Checks:** Enforce strict minimum and maximum values for numeric inputs.
        *   **No Code Injection:** Absolutely prevent any user input from being concatenated into the GLSL code string. Use shader uniforms (passed as props to R3F components) to control shader parameters safely.
    *   **Server-Side Shader Compilation (if possible):** Compile shaders on the server to catch syntax errors and potentially some malicious patterns before they reach the client. This adds a layer of defense.
