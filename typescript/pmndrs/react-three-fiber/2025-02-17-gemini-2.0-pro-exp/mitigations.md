# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pmndrs/react-three-fiber

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of User-Provided 3D Models](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_user-provided_3d_models.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **User Input:** When a user provides a 3D model (e.g., GLTF, GLB), it's *not* directly loaded into the `react-three-fiber` scene.
    2.  **Server-Side Processing (Critical):** The model is processed on a secure server.  This is crucial because it moves the most vulnerable parsing and processing steps away from the client's browser.
    3.  **Sandboxed Environment:** The server uses a sandboxed environment (Docker, WebAssembly, serverless function) to isolate the model processing.
    4.  **Model Inspection (within Sandbox):**
        *   Parse the model using a secure 3D parsing library (potentially a `three.js` loader compiled to WebAssembly for added security).
        *   Extract metadata: file size, vertices, faces, materials, textures, animations, custom shaders, embedded scripts.
        *   Check metadata against strict, predefined limits (max file size, max polygons, no custom shaders, etc.).
        *   Validate external resource references (texture URLs, etc.) against allowed origins.
    5.  **Model Transformation (Optional):** Simplify or optimize the model within the sandbox (reduce polygons, downscale textures).
    6.  **Safe Model Delivery:** Send *only* the validated/transformed model data to the client. This could be a new GLTF/GLB or a JSON representation.
    7.  **Client-Side Loading (react-three-fiber):** The `react-three-fiber` application uses the `<Canvas>` component and appropriate loaders (e.g., `useLoader(GLTFLoader, ...)` from `@react-three/drei`) to load the *safe* model data received from the server.  Crucially, the loaders are used *only* with the pre-validated data.
    8. **CSP:** Use a strict Content Security Policy, especially `object-src`, `img-src`, and `media-src`, to control resource origins.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents loading large/complex models that could crash the browser.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of models exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Low-Medium Severity):** Minimizes exploits in loaders or drivers (server-side processing is key).
    *   **CORS Violations (Medium Severity):** CSP helps prevent loading malicious resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced (shifted to server-side).
    *   **CORS Violations:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Server-side upload and basic file size check in `/server/modelUpload.js`.
    *   Partial CSP in `/client/public/index.html` (missing `object-src`).
    *   Client-side loading using `useLoader` in `/client/src/components/ModelViewer.js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Full sandboxed processing and detailed model inspection are missing.
    *   Polygon/texture limits, shader checks are missing.
    *   `object-src` is missing from CSP.
    *   No dedicated 3D model validation library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Shader Security - Parameterized Shaders](./mitigation_strategies/shader_security_-_parameterized_shaders.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **No Raw GLSL:** The application *never* accepts raw GLSL code from users.
    2.  **Predefined Shaders:** A set of secure, pre-written GLSL shaders are defined within the application's codebase (e.g., `/client/src/shaders/`).
    3.  **Parameterization:** These shaders expose a limited set of parameters (uniforms) to control their behavior (color, intensity, texture coordinates).
    4.  **UI Controls:** The UI provides controls (sliders, color pickers) to adjust these parameters.
    5.  **Server-Side Validation (Optional):** Parameter values can be validated server-side.
    6.  **Shader Compilation (react-three-fiber):**  `react-three-fiber` components (e.g., custom materials extending `THREE.ShaderMaterial`) use the *predefined* shaders.  The application sets the uniform values based on the validated user input.  This is a direct use of `react-three-fiber`'s capabilities to manage shader materials and their properties.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents malicious shaders (rendering issues, infinite loops).
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of shader side-channel attacks.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Low Severity):** Eliminates user-injected GLSL.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk almost eliminated.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk eliminated.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Predefined shaders in `/client/src/shaders/`.
    *   UI controls for parameters.
    *   `react-three-fiber` components use these shaders in `/client/src/components/CustomMaterialObject.js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Server-side parameter validation is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `useFrame` and Animation Logic](./mitigation_strategies/secure__useframe__and_animation_logic.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **No Untrusted Code:** Code within the `useFrame` hook (from `@react-three/fiber`) comes *only* from the trusted application codebase.
    2.  **Input Sanitization:** Data from user input (mouse, keyboard) influencing `useFrame` is sanitized and validated *before* use.
    3.  **Rate Limiting:** If user interactions trigger `useFrame` updates, rate limiting prevents excessive updates.  For example, scene updates based on mouse movement might be capped at 60 times per second.
    4.  **State Management:** Scene state changes within `useFrame` are managed through a well-defined system (React's `useState`, Zustand, Redux) for consistency and to prevent race conditions.  This is crucial for how `react-three-fiber` interacts with React's reconciliation process.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive updates/calculations in `useFrame`.
    *   **Unintended Scene Manipulation (Low-Medium Severity):** Prevents malicious code from altering the scene.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Unintended Scene Manipulation:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   `useFrame` logic in trusted components.
    *   Basic input sanitization on mouse coordinates in `/client/src/components/InteractiveObject.js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Rate limiting is missing for mouse updates.
    *   More comprehensive input validation could be added.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Texture Loading](./mitigation_strategies/secure_texture_loading.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Server-Side Processing:** User-uploaded images for textures are processed server-side.
    2.  **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to predefined maximum dimensions on the server.
    3.  **Format Conversion:** Images are converted to a safe format (JPEG, PNG) on the server.
    4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** The `img-src` directive in the CSP restricts texture origins (application's server, trusted CDN).
    5.  **Client-Side Validation:** Before loading a texture (using `useLoader(THREE.TextureLoader, ...)` or similar in `react-three-fiber`), the client-side code checks the image URL against a whitelist (redundant with CSP). This is a direct interaction with `react-three-fiber`'s loading mechanisms.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents loading huge images.
    *   **Exploits in Image Decoders (Low-Medium Severity):** Server-side processing reduces risk.
    *   **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) violations (Medium Severity):** CSP and client-side checks prevent loading malicious images.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Exploits in Image Decoders:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **CORS Violations:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   `img-src` in CSP in `/client/public/index.html`.
    *   Texture loading using `useLoader` in `/client/src/components/TexturedObject.js`

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Server-side image processing is missing.
    *   Client-side origin validation is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Event Handling within the react-three-fiber scene.](./mitigation_strategies/secure_event_handling_within_the_react-three-fiber_scene.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Event Listener Attachment:** Event listeners (clicks, hovers, drags) are attached to 3D objects using `react-three-fiber`'s event handling system (e.g., the `onClick`, `onPointerOver`, etc. props on mesh components).  This is a *direct* use of the library's API.
    2.  **Data Sanitization:** Data from the event (mouse coordinates, intersection points) is sanitized *before* being used to modify the scene or application state.  Check data types, ranges, and escape special characters.
    3.  **Rate Limiting:** Event handlers triggering significant actions (server updates, scene modifications) are rate-limited (e.g., one action per second).
    4. **Input Validation:** Validate data type and structure from event handlers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low-Medium Severity):** Rate limiting prevents event floods.
    *   **Unintended Scene Manipulation (Low Severity):** Sanitization prevents malicious data from altering the scene.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Unintended Scene Manipulation:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Event listeners attached via `react-three-fiber` in `/client/src/components/InteractiveObject.js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Data sanitization and rate limiting are missing.
