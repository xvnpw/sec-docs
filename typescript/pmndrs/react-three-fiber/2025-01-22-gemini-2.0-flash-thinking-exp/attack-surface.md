# Attack Surface Analysis for pmndrs/react-three-fiber

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Three.js)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__three_js_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities present in the core Three.js library, upon which `react-three-fiber` is built.
*   **How React-Three-Fiber Contributes:** `react-three-fiber` applications directly utilize Three.js for rendering. Exploits against Three.js directly impact the security of `react-three-fiber` applications.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in Three.js allows for arbitrary code execution when processing a maliciously crafted GLTF model. A `react-three-fiber` application using the vulnerable Three.js version becomes susceptible to RCE by serving or processing such a model.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Client-side crashes, potentially data breaches if RCE is achieved.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Immediately update Three.js:**  Prioritize updating Three.js to the latest stable version upon release of security patches or vulnerability disclosures.
        *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Implement and regularly run dependency scanning tools to proactively identify and address known vulnerabilities in Three.js.
        *   **Security Monitoring & Alerts:** Subscribe to security advisories and set up alerts for Three.js to be notified of new vulnerabilities promptly.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Third-Party Three.js Ecosystem Libraries - Loaders & Core Extensions)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_third-party_three_js_ecosystem_libraries_-_loaders_&_core_exten_d10b21d9.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities within third-party libraries that are essential for common `react-three-fiber` application functionalities, particularly model loaders (e.g., GLTFLoader, DRACOLoader) and libraries extending core Three.js features.
*   **How React-Three-Fiber Contributes:** `react-three-fiber` applications frequently rely on loaders to import 3D assets and extensions for advanced features. Vulnerabilities in these critical libraries directly expose `react-three-fiber` applications.
*   **Example:** A critical buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a specific version of GLTFLoader. A `react-three-fiber` application using this vulnerable loader can be exploited by serving a maliciously crafted GLTF file, potentially leading to RCE on the user's machine when the model is loaded.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Client-side crashes, potentially data breaches if RCE is achieved.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability and the compromised library's role).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Prioritize Updates for Critical Libraries:** Treat updates for loaders and core extension libraries with the same urgency as Three.js core updates.
        *   **Thorough Library Vetting:**  Carefully evaluate the security posture and update frequency of third-party libraries before incorporating them into `react-three-fiber` projects.
        *   **Dependency Scanning with Focus on Loaders:** Ensure dependency scanning tools specifically cover and prioritize vulnerabilities in model loaders and other critical ecosystem libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious 3D Models & Textures Exploiting Loader Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malicious_3d_models_&_textures_exploiting_loader_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Serving or allowing users to upload malicious 3D models or textures specifically crafted to exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in model loader libraries used by `react-three-fiber` applications.
*   **How React-Three-Fiber Contributes:** `react-three-fiber` applications are designed to load and process 3D assets. If these assets are malicious and target loader vulnerabilities, the `react-three-fiber` application becomes the attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a GLTF model that triggers a heap overflow vulnerability in the GLTFLoader being used by a `react-three-fiber` application. When a user loads or the application serves this model, the vulnerability is triggered, potentially leading to RCE.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Client-side crashes, potentially data breaches if RCE is achieved.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (if RCE is possible through loader exploitation).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Asset Delivery Pipeline:** Implement a secure pipeline for delivering 3D assets, ensuring assets are from trusted sources and potentially scanned for known malicious patterns (though this is complex for binary formats).
        *   **Input Validation & Sanitization (Limited for Binary Formats):** While deep sanitization of binary 3D formats is challenging, implement basic validation like file size limits and format checks.
        *   **Regularly Update Loaders:**  Keep model loader libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities that malicious models might exploit.
        *   **Consider Sandboxing Asset Loading:** Explore sandboxing techniques for asset loading processes to limit the impact of potential loader exploits.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Avoid Untrusted 3D Content:** Be extremely cautious about loading 3D models from unknown or untrusted sources, especially in applications where you are unsure of the security measures in place.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization of Custom Scene Data (If Implemented)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization_of_custom_scene_data__if_implemented_.md)

*   **Description:**  If a `react-three-fiber` application implements custom scene data formats and uses unsafe deserialization practices, it can create a critical attack surface.
*   **How React-Three-Fiber Contributes:**  While `react-three-fiber` itself doesn't mandate custom scene formats, applications built with it might introduce them for specific needs. If deserialization of these custom formats is insecure, it becomes a vulnerability within the `react-three-fiber` application context.
*   **Example:** A `react-three-fiber` application uses a custom binary format to store scene graphs.  An unsafe deserialization routine is used to parse this format. An attacker crafts malicious scene data that, when deserialized, exploits a buffer overflow or other vulnerability in the deserialization code, leading to RCE.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Corruption, Denial of Service (DoS), potentially complete system compromise if RCE is achieved.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Avoid Custom Binary Formats if Possible:**  Prefer well-established and secure formats like JSON for scene descriptions where feasible.
        *   **Secure Deserialization Practices:** If custom formats are necessary, use secure deserialization techniques and libraries. Rigorously validate all input data during deserialization.
        *   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all data being deserialized.
        *   **Sandboxing Deserialization:**  Sandbox the deserialization process to contain potential exploits and limit their impact.
