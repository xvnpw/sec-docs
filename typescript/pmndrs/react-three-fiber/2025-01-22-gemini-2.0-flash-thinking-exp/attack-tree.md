## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in 3D Asset Loading & Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_3d_asset_loading_&_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious 3D Model Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **[CRITICAL] Inject Maliciously Crafted 3D Model (e.g., .gltf, .obj)**
            *   **Details:** Attacker injects a maliciously crafted 3D model file (like .gltf or .obj) into the application. This could be done if the application allows users to upload or specify URLs for 3D models. The malicious model aims to exploit vulnerabilities in the Three.js loaders used by `react-three-fiber` to parse these files.
            *   **Potential Exploits:**
                *   **Parser Vulnerabilities:** Trigger buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other vulnerabilities in the Three.js model parsers.
                *   **Excessive Geometry/Complexity:**  Include extremely high polygon counts or complex scene structures within the model to cause client-side resource exhaustion (CPU, GPU, memory), leading to Denial of Service (DoS).
                *   **Malicious Shaders (embedded in models):** Some model formats can embed shader code. A malicious model could contain shaders designed to cause rendering errors, performance degradation, or potentially exploit shader compilation vulnerabilities (less common in web context).
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all 3D models before loading them into the application. This includes checking file formats, sizes, and potentially using secure parsing libraries if available.
                *   **Resource Limits:** Implement strict resource limits on the complexity of loaded models. Limit polygon counts, texture sizes, and scene graph depth.
                *   **Secure Loaders:** Ensure you are using updated and robust versions of Three.js loaders. Regularly update Three.js to patch any known vulnerabilities.
                *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  If possible, use CSP to restrict the sources from which 3D models can be loaded, reducing the attack surface.
        *   **[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Textures**
            *   **Details:** Attacker injects malicious texture files (like .png, .jpg) into the application. Similar to models, this could happen through user uploads or URL specifications. Malicious textures aim to exploit vulnerabilities in image processing or cause resource exhaustion.
            *   **Potential Exploits:**
                *   **Image Processing Vulnerabilities:** Exploit vulnerabilities in the browser's or underlying image processing libraries used by Three.js to load and decode textures. This could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
                *   **Excessively Large Textures:** Inject extremely large texture files to cause memory exhaustion on the client-side, leading to DoS.
                *   **Malicious Texture Content:**  While less direct, textures could be crafted to display misleading or harmful visual content, leading to defacement or social engineering attacks.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all texture files before loading. Check file formats, sizes, and potentially use secure image processing libraries.
                *   **Size Limits:** Implement strict size limits on texture files to prevent memory exhaustion.
                *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use CSP to restrict texture sources if possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Event Handling & Interaction Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_event_handling_&_interaction_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Input Flooding/DoS via 3D Interactions [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **[CRITICAL] Send Excessive Interaction Events (Mouse, Keyboard, Touch)**
            *   **Details:** Attacker floods the application with a massive number of interaction events targeting the 3D scene. These events could be mouse movements, clicks, touch events, or any other interaction the application handles in the 3D context. The goal is to overwhelm the application's event handling logic and resources, leading to DoS.
            *   **Potential Exploits:**
                *   **Client-Side DoS:**  Overwhelm the browser's JavaScript engine and rendering pipeline with excessive event processing, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash on the user's device.
                *   **Server-Side DoS (if events are processed server-side):** If interaction events are sent to the server for processing (e.g., for multiplayer games or analytics), flooding events can overwhelm the server, leading to server-side DoS.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on incoming interaction events, both on the client-side and server-side if applicable. Limit the number of events processed per second or per time interval.
                *   **Debouncing/Throttling:** Use debouncing or throttling techniques to reduce the frequency of event processing, especially for events like mousemove.
                *   **Optimize Event Handlers:** Optimize the event handling logic in `react-three-fiber` components to be as efficient as possible. Avoid unnecessary computations or rendering updates within event handlers.
                *   **Input Validation:** Validate interaction event data to ensure it is within expected ranges and formats, preventing malformed events from causing issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit R3F/Three.js API Misuse or Bugs [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_r3fthree_js_api_misuse_or_bugs__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Trigger Memory Leaks via R3F/Three.js Usage [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **[CRITICAL] Cause Memory Leaks through Improper Object Disposal**
            *   **Details:** This vulnerability arises from improper memory management in the application's `react-three-fiber` components. Developers might forget to correctly dispose of Three.js objects (geometries, materials, textures, scenes, etc.) when components unmount, objects are removed from the scene, or resources are no longer needed. In WebGL, these objects often hold GPU resources, and failing to dispose of them leads to memory leaks.
            *   **Potential Exploits:**
                *   **Client-Side DoS (Long-Term):**  Memory leaks accumulate over time as users interact with the application. Eventually, the browser's memory usage increases to a point where it becomes slow, unresponsive, or crashes. This is a form of long-term or slow DoS.
                *   **Degraded Performance:** Even before crashing, memory leaks can lead to significant performance degradation as the browser struggles to manage increasing memory usage.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   **Strict Memory Management:** Educate developers on the importance of memory management in Three.js and WebGL. Emphasize the need to explicitly dispose of Three.js objects when they are no longer needed.
                *   **`useEffect` Cleanup Functions:**  Use `useEffect` cleanup functions in React components to dispose of Three.js objects when components unmount.
                *   **Object Disposal Best Practices:** Follow Three.js best practices for object disposal. Ensure that geometries, materials, textures, and other Three.js objects are properly disposed of using `.dispose()` methods.
                *   **Memory Profiling:** Use browser memory profiling tools during development and testing to actively detect and fix memory leaks. Regularly monitor memory usage during application development.
                *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews specifically focused on memory management in `react-three-fiber` components.
