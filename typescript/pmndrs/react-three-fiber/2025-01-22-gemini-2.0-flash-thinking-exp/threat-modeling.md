# Threat Model Analysis for pmndrs/react-three-fiber

## Threat: [Client-Side Rendering Overload](./threats/client-side_rendering_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts or injects a 3D scene with excessive complexity (high polygon count, numerous objects, inefficient shaders). This scene, when rendered by `react-three-fiber` on the user's browser, consumes excessive CPU and GPU resources. The attacker might achieve this by manipulating scene loading parameters, exploiting vulnerabilities in scene generation logic, or through malicious advertisements injecting heavy 3D content.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service on the client-side. User's browser becomes unresponsive, application crashes, or device performance severely degrades. This can lead to user frustration, inability to use the application, and potential data loss if the browser crashes unexpectedly.
    *   **Affected Component:** `react-three-fiber` core rendering loop, `<Canvas>` component, scene graph management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement scene complexity limits based on target hardware capabilities.
        *   Utilize level of detail (LOD) techniques to reduce polygon count for distant objects.
        *   Employ frustum culling and occlusion culling to avoid rendering objects outside the viewport or hidden behind other objects.
        *   Optimize shaders for performance and avoid computationally expensive operations in fragment shaders.
        *   Implement performance monitoring and adaptive rendering to adjust scene complexity dynamically.
        *   Validate and sanitize any user-provided scene parameters or assets to prevent injection of overly complex scenes.

## Threat: [Shader Compilation DoS](./threats/shader_compilation_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides or injects maliciously crafted or extremely complex shader code (GLSL) that `react-three-fiber` attempts to compile. This compilation process can be very resource-intensive on the client's GPU and CPU. Repeated or concurrent attempts to compile such shaders can lead to browser freezing or crashes. Attackers might exploit user-provided shader functionality or inject malicious shaders through vulnerabilities in asset loading or scene manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service on the client-side. Browser becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive shader compilation load.  Application becomes unusable.
    *   **Affected Component:** `react-three-fiber` shader compilation pipeline, `<shaderMaterial>` component, custom shader loading/handling logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Pre-compile shaders whenever possible and cache compiled shaders to avoid repeated compilation.
        *   Limit the complexity of user-provided shaders if the application allows custom shaders.
        *   Implement timeouts for shader compilation processes to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   Sanitize and rigorously validate any user-provided shader code to detect and reject malicious or overly complex shaders.
        *   Restrict the use of dynamic shader generation if possible.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Memory/GPU)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__memorygpu_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker forces the application to load extremely large 3D assets (models, textures, audio files) exceeding client memory (RAM and GPU memory) capacity. This can be achieved by manipulating asset URLs, exploiting vulnerabilities in asset loading mechanisms, or through malicious content injection.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service on the client-side. Browser crashes due to out-of-memory errors, application becomes unstable, or system performance degrades significantly.
    *   **Affected Component:** `react-three-fiber` asset loading mechanisms (e.g., `useLoader`), texture and model loading libraries (e.g., `three.js` loaders), `<Texture>` and `<Model>` components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict asset size limits and enforce them during asset loading.
        *   Utilize asset compression techniques (e.g., texture compression, model optimization) to reduce asset sizes.
        *   Implement texture and model streaming to load assets on demand and unload unused assets.
        *   Implement resource management strategies to proactively unload unused assets and manage memory usage.
        *   Validate and sanitize asset URLs and sources to prevent loading from untrusted or malicious locations.
        *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict asset loading origins.

## Threat: [Scene Data Disclosure via Browser Tools](./threats/scene_data_disclosure_via_browser_tools.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the user's browser (e.g., through physical access or remote access malware) can use browser developer tools (WebGL inspector, network tab, memory inspector) to inspect the rendered 3D scene. This allows them to extract model geometry, textures, shader code, and potentially sensitive data embedded within the scene.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure. Confidential 3D model designs, game assets, proprietary rendering techniques, or sensitive data visualized in 3D can be exposed to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Affected Component:** `react-three-fiber` scene graph, all components rendering scene data, underlying `three.js` scene and objects.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid embedding highly sensitive data directly within client-side 3D scene assets if possible.
        *   Consider obfuscation or encryption of sensitive scene data if client-side rendering is unavoidable (complex and may impact performance).
