# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pmndrs/react-three-fiber

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) Directives Specifically for 3D Assets](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__directives_specifically_for_3d_assets.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify 3D Asset Sources:**  Document all domains and origins from which your `react-three-fiber` application loads 3D models (GLTF/GLB, OBJ, etc.) and textures (images, videos) used within the 3D scene.
    2.  **Configure CSP Header for Asset Directives:** On your web server, configure the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header, focusing on directives relevant to 3D assets.
    3.  **Define 3D Asset-Specific Directives:** Use CSP directives to restrict loading of 3D assets to trusted sources:
        *   `img-src`:  Specifically control sources for textures used in `react-three-fiber` scenes.
        *   `media-src`: Control sources for video textures used in `react-three-fiber` scenes.
        *   `connect-src`: If you dynamically load 3D models or textures via JavaScript within your `react-three-fiber` components (e.g., using `fetch` in `useLoader`), control allowed origins for these network requests.
        *   Use `'self'` to allow assets from your own domain. List specific trusted domains for external 3D asset sources.
    4.  **Test and Enforce CSP for 3D Assets:** Deploy the CSP and test your `react-three-fiber` application, specifically checking that 3D assets load correctly and that unauthorized sources are blocked by CSP violations in the browser console. Enforce the policy after testing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious 3D Asset Injection (High Severity):** Attackers injecting malicious 3D models or textures into the `react-three-fiber` scene by compromising asset storage or exploiting vulnerabilities to load assets from attacker-controlled domains. This can lead to visual defacement, client-side XSS if models contain embedded scripts (less common in typical 3D formats but possible), or client-side DoS by loading excessively complex models.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via 3D Asset Loading (Medium Severity):** An attacker might attempt to exfiltrate data by crafting a malicious `react-three-fiber` scene that tries to load a 3D asset from a domain they control, potentially embedding sensitive data in the asset request URL triggered by `react-three-fiber`'s asset loading mechanisms.

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of malicious 3D asset injection and data exfiltration related to assets used in `react-three-fiber`. CSP specifically limits where `react-three-fiber` can load its visual resources from.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, a basic CSP is implemented, but it lacks specific directives tailored for 3D assets used by `react-three-fiber`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** CSP needs to be enhanced with specific `img-src`, `media-src`, and `connect-src` directives that explicitly control origins for 3D models and textures loaded and rendered by `react-three-fiber`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Externally Hosted Three.js and 3D Assets](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_subresource_integrity__sri__for_externally_hosted_three_js_and_3d_assets.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI Hashes for Three.js and 3D Assets:** For Three.js library files if loaded from a CDN, and for any externally hosted 3D models or textures used in your `react-three-fiber` application, generate SRI hashes.
    2.  **Integrate SRI Attributes in `react-three-fiber` Context:** When including Three.js library scripts (if external) or when dynamically loading external 3D assets within your `react-three-fiber` components, use SRI attributes. For Three.js scripts, add the `integrity` attribute to `<script>` tags. For dynamically loaded 3D assets, ensure that the loading mechanism (e.g., `fetch` and `useLoader`) can verify the integrity of downloaded assets against pre-calculated hashes (this might require custom implementation depending on your asset loading approach).
    3.  **Browser Verification for `react-three-fiber` Assets:** The browser will verify the integrity of Three.js scripts. For 3D assets, you need to ensure your loading process integrates SRI verification to prevent `react-three-fiber` from using potentially compromised assets.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CDN Compromise of Three.js or 3D Assets (Medium to High Severity):** If a CDN hosting Three.js or your 3D assets is compromised, attackers could replace these files with malicious versions. SRI prevents `react-three-fiber` from using these compromised resources.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Three.js or 3D Assets (Medium Severity):** SRI ensures that even if asset requests are intercepted, `react-three-fiber` will only use assets that match the expected integrity hash.

*   **Impact:** Moderately to significantly reduces the risk of using compromised Three.js library or 3D assets in your `react-three-fiber` application. SRI adds an integrity check layer specifically for resources critical to `react-three-fiber`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for main JavaScript bundles, but not specifically for Three.js library if externally hosted or for 3D models and textures used by `react-three-fiber`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** SRI needs to be implemented for Three.js library files if loaded from a CDN and for all externally hosted 3D models and textures loaded and used within `react-three-fiber` scenes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Complexity and Size of 3D Models and Textures Rendered by `react-three-fiber`](./mitigation_strategies/limit_complexity_and_size_of_3d_models_and_textures_rendered_by__react-three-fiber_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Performance Budgets for `react-three-fiber` Scenes:** Define performance budgets specifically for your `react-three-fiber` scenes, including maximum polygon counts for models, texture resolutions, and overall scene complexity that `react-three-fiber` should handle.
    2.  **Asset Optimization Pipeline for `react-three-fiber`:** Implement an asset optimization pipeline that processes 3D models and textures *before* they are used in `react-three-fiber`. This pipeline should:
        *   **Reduce Polygon Count for `react-three-fiber` Models:** Use mesh simplification to reduce polygons in models intended for `react-three-fiber`.
        *   **Compress Textures for `react-three-fiber`:** Use texture compression (KTX2, WebP) to optimize textures for efficient rendering in `react-three-fiber`.
        *   **Resize Textures for `react-three-fiber`:** Resize textures to appropriate resolutions for their use in `react-three-fiber` scenes.
    3.  **Level of Detail (LOD) in `react-three-fiber`:** Implement LOD within your `react-three-fiber` scenes. Use lower-detail models and textures for objects further from the camera, managed within your `react-three-fiber` component logic.
    4.  **Client-Side Resource Management in `react-three-fiber`:** Within your `react-three-fiber` components, manage resources to unload or reduce resolution of assets that are not currently visible or actively rendered by `react-three-fiber`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via `react-three-fiber` Rendering (Medium to High Severity):** Loading excessively complex or large assets into `react-three-fiber` can overwhelm the browser's rendering capabilities, leading to performance degradation, crashes, or freezing specifically within the 3D scene rendered by `react-three-fiber`.
    *   **Performance Degradation in `react-three-fiber` Applications (Medium Severity):** Unoptimized assets will result in poor performance of the `react-three-fiber` application, slow frame rates, and a degraded user experience within the 3D environment.

*   **Impact:** Moderately to significantly reduces the risk of client-side DoS and performance issues directly related to `react-three-fiber` rendering performance. Asset optimization and LOD are crucial for ensuring smooth and performant 3D experiences built with `react-three-fiber`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic texture compression is used for some textures in `react-three-fiber` scenes.

*   **Missing Implementation:** A comprehensive asset optimization pipeline tailored for `react-three-fiber` assets, including polygon reduction, texture resizing, and full LOD implementation within `react-three-fiber` components, is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting and Resource Management for Asset Loading and Rendering *within* `react-three-fiber`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_and_resource_management_for_asset_loading_and_rendering_within__react-three-_b8bab658.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rate Limiting for 3D Asset Requests:** Implement rate limiting on the server-side for requests specifically for 3D models and textures used by `react-three-fiber`, especially if these assets are loaded dynamically based on user interaction within the 3D scene.
    2.  **Client-Side Request Queuing in `react-three-fiber`:** Within your `react-three-fiber` application, implement client-side request queuing to manage asset loading requests initiated by `react-three-fiber` components, preventing overwhelming the network or server with simultaneous asset loads.
    3.  **Resource Limits in `react-three-fiber` Scene:** Within your `react-three-fiber` scene management, implement limits on the number of objects, textures, and materials actively loaded and rendered *at any given time* by `react-three-fiber`.
    4.  **Memory Management within `react-three-fiber` Components:**  Within your `react-three-fiber` components, implement memory management practices to dispose of geometries, materials, and textures managed by `react-three-fiber` when they are no longer needed or visible in the scene. Use `dispose()` methods provided by Three.js within `react-three-fiber`'s lifecycle management.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via 3D Asset Flooding (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers could attempt to overload the server or client by triggering a large number of 3D asset loading requests specifically for the `react-three-fiber` application. Rate limiting and request queuing mitigate this.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Client-Side) in `react-three-fiber` (Medium Severity):** Uncontrolled loading and rendering of assets within `react-three-fiber` can lead to excessive memory consumption and CPU usage, causing performance issues or crashes specifically within the 3D application.

*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of DoS attacks and client-side resource exhaustion related to asset loading and rendering *within* `react-three-fiber`. Resource management ensures the stability and performance of the `react-three-fiber` application.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic rate limiting is on API endpoints, but not specifically for 3D asset loading requests initiated by `react-three-fiber`. Memory management within `react-three-fiber` components is not consistently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Specific rate limiting for 3D asset loading, client-side request queuing within `react-three-fiber`, and comprehensive resource management (including explicit disposal of Three.js objects) within `react-three-fiber` components are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Validate User Input Used to Manipulate the `react-three-fiber` Scene](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_validate_user_input_used_to_manipulate_the__react-three-fiber__scene.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Input Points in `react-three-fiber`:** Determine all points where user input (mouse, keyboard, UI controls) directly controls or manipulates elements within the `react-three-fiber` scene (e.g., object transformations, animations, material properties).
    2.  **Input Validation for `react-three-fiber` Interactions:** Implement validation for all user inputs that drive changes in the `react-three-fiber` scene, on both client and server-side (server-side being critical for security). Validate data types, ranges, and formats relevant to the specific manipulations within `react-three-fiber`.
    3.  **Input Sanitization for `react-three-fiber` Actions:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection if user-provided strings are used to:
        *   Dynamically modify shaders in `react-three-fiber` (highly discouraged due to complexity and risk).
        *   Construct strings that might be used in any form of dynamic code execution related to `react-three-fiber` (avoid this).
        *   Modify DOM elements *outside* the `react-three-fiber` canvas based on 3D scene interactions (sanitize before DOM manipulation).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Script Injection (XSS) via `react-three-fiber` Interactions (Medium to High Severity):** If user input controlling the `react-three-fiber` scene is improperly handled and reflected in UI elements or scene text without sanitization, attackers could inject scripts. While direct XSS within the 3D scene itself is less common, vulnerabilities can arise in related UI or interactions driven by the 3D scene state.
    *   **Logic Bugs and Unexpected `react-three-fiber` Behavior (Medium Severity):** Invalid user input could cause unexpected behavior or errors within the `react-three-fiber` scene, potentially leading to application instability or exploitable logic flaws.

*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of client-side script injection and logic errors arising from user input that manipulates the `react-three-fiber` scene.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic client-side validation for some user inputs, but server-side validation and sanitization specifically for inputs affecting the `react-three-fiber` scene are not consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive server-side validation and sanitization for all user inputs that directly control or modify the `react-three-fiber` scene are needed.
