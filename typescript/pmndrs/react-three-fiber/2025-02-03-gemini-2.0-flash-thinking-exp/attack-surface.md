# Attack Surface Analysis for pmndrs/react-three-fiber

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Three.js)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__three_js_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the underlying Three.js library, which `react-three-fiber` relies upon, due to using outdated versions.
*   **How React-Three-Fiber Contributes:** `react-three-fiber` applications are directly vulnerable to Three.js vulnerabilities if the dependency is not kept up-to-date.  The application's security posture is tied to the security of its Three.js dependency managed through `react-three-fiber`'s ecosystem.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability in a specific version of Three.js allows for arbitrary code execution when processing a maliciously crafted GLTF model. A `react-three-fiber` application using this vulnerable Three.js version, upon loading such a model, becomes susceptible to code execution on the user's machine.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise, sensitive data access, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly maintain up-to-date `react-three-fiber` and Three.js dependencies:** Regularly update both libraries to the latest stable versions. Utilize dependency management tools and automated security checks to ensure timely updates and vulnerability patching.
    *   **Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning:** Integrate tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated security scanning solutions into the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify and address vulnerable dependencies before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious 3D Models Exploiting Loader Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malicious_3d_models_exploiting_loader_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Loading and processing 3D models from untrusted sources that are specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities within Three.js model loaders (used by `react-three-fiber`).
*   **How React-Three-Fiber Contributes:** `react-three-fiber` applications commonly use Three.js loaders (like GLTFLoader, OBJLoader) to render 3D content. If the application loads models from user-generated content, external APIs, or untrusted sources without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable to exploits targeting these loaders.
*   **Example:** A maliciously crafted GLTF model is designed to trigger a buffer overflow vulnerability in the GLTFLoader within Three.js. When a `react-three-fiber` application loads and attempts to parse this model, it can lead to code execution on the client's machine or a denial-of-service crash.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, memory corruption, potential for cross-site scripting (if combined with other vulnerabilities).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if code execution is possible, High for DoS or memory corruption)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict 3D model sources to highly trusted origins:**  Prefer loading models from internal, controlled sources or reputable and vetted asset providers. Avoid loading models directly from user uploads or untrusted external APIs without rigorous validation.
    *   **Implement robust server-side 3D model validation and sanitization:** Before serving models to the `react-three-fiber` application, perform thorough server-side validation to check for malformed structures, excessive complexity, and potential exploit payloads. Reject or sanitize models that fail validation.
    *   **Consider sandboxed model loading:** Explore techniques to isolate the model loading and parsing process within a sandboxed environment to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities. This might involve using web workers or other isolation mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Shaders (GLSL) Leading to GPU Exploitation or DoS](./attack_surfaces/malicious_shaders__glsl__leading_to_gpu_exploitation_or_dos.md)

*   **Description:** Injection or loading of malicious GLSL shaders, which are executed directly on the user's GPU, potentially leading to denial of service by exhausting GPU resources or, in more severe scenarios, exploiting GPU driver vulnerabilities.
*   **How React-Three-Fiber Contributes:** `react-three-fiber` applications utilize shaders for rendering effects and custom materials. If the application allows users to provide or modify shader code, or if shaders are loaded from untrusted sources, it introduces a high-risk attack surface.
*   **Example:** A malicious GLSL shader is injected into a `react-three-fiber` application. This shader is designed to create an infinite loop or perform computationally intensive operations on the GPU, causing the user's browser to freeze, crash, or become unresponsive due to GPU resource exhaustion (DoS). In a theoretical worst-case scenario, a shader could attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying GPU driver.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (GPU resource exhaustion, browser crash), potential (though less likely in web context) GPU driver exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (High for DoS via GPU exhaustion, potentially Critical in theoretical driver exploit scenarios)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly avoid or severely limit user-provided shader code:**  The most effective mitigation is to prevent users from providing or modifying shader code entirely. If custom shaders are absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization.
    *   **Shader whitelisting and pre-vetting:** If custom shaders are required, maintain a whitelist of approved and vetted shaders.  Thoroughly review and test all shaders before allowing them to be used in the application.
    *   **Implement resource limits and monitoring for shader execution:**  If dynamic shaders are used, implement mechanisms to monitor GPU resource usage and potentially terminate or throttle shader execution if it exceeds predefined limits, preventing DoS.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for shader sources:** If shaders are loaded from external sources, use CSP to restrict the origins from which shader code can be loaded, limiting the risk of loading from compromised or malicious sources.
