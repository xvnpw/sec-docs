## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in 3D Asset Loading & Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_3d_asset_loading_&_handling.md)

*   **Description:** This path targets vulnerabilities arising from the process of loading and handling external 3D assets (models and textures) within the `react-three-fiber` application.  Applications often rely on user-provided or externally sourced 3D content, making this a common and exploitable attack surface.

*   **Critical Node: Inject Maliciously Crafted 3D Model (e.g., .gltf, .obj)**
    *   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   An attacker injects a maliciously crafted 3D model file (e.g., in `.gltf`, `.obj` format) into the application's asset loading pipeline.
        *   This model is designed to exploit parser vulnerabilities within the Three.js loaders used by `react-three-fiber`.
        *   The malicious model could contain:
            *   Excessive geometry leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
            *   Complex or malformed shaders embedded within the model, causing rendering errors or potentially more severe issues.
            *   Exploits targeting buffer overflows or other memory corruption vulnerabilities during the parsing process.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all 3D models before loading them into the application.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on the complexity of loaded models, such as maximum polygon count, vertex count, and file size.
        *   **Secure Loaders:** Use robust and up-to-date Three.js loaders. Regularly update Three.js to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which assets can be loaded, reducing the risk of loading malicious assets from untrusted origins.
    *   **Risk Assessment:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Moderate (DoS, Defacement, Client-side Resource Exhaustion)
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Textures**
    *   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   An attacker injects malicious texture files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`) into the application's texture loading process.
        *   These textures can be malicious in several ways:
            *   Exploiting image processing vulnerabilities in the browser's or underlying libraries' image decoding capabilities.
            *   Being excessively large, leading to memory exhaustion and DoS.
            *   Containing embedded malicious code (less common in typical image formats, but theoretically possible in some scenarios or with format-specific vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all texture files before loading. Check file types, sizes, and potentially perform basic image integrity checks.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement size limits on textures to prevent loading excessively large files.
        *   **Secure Image Processing:** Rely on secure and updated browser image processing capabilities. Keep browsers updated.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use CSP to restrict texture loading sources.
    *   **Risk Assessment:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Moderate (DoS, Defacement, Client-side Resource Exhaustion)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Event Handling & Interaction Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_event_handling_&_interaction_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the `react-three-fiber` application handles user interactions within the 3D scene, particularly event handling for mouse, keyboard, and touch inputs.

*   **Critical Node: Send Excessive Interaction Events (Mouse, Keyboard, Touch)**
    *   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   An attacker floods the application with a massive number of interaction events targeting the 3D scene.
        *   This can be achieved by automated scripts or tools that rapidly generate mouse movements, clicks, touch events, or keyboard inputs.
        *   The goal is to overwhelm the application's event handling logic, raycasting calculations, and rendering pipeline, leading to:
            *   Denial of Service (DoS) by making the application unresponsive or extremely slow.
            *   Client-side resource exhaustion, consuming excessive CPU, GPU, and memory.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the processing of interaction events. Limit the number of events processed per second or within a specific time window.
        *   **Debouncing/Throttling:** Use debouncing or throttling techniques to reduce the frequency of event processing, especially for events like mousemove.
        *   **Optimize Event Handling Logic:** Ensure that event handlers in `react-three-fiber` components are optimized for performance and avoid unnecessary computations.
        *   **Server-Side Validation (if applicable):** If interaction events are sent to a server, implement server-side validation and rate limiting as well.
    *   **Risk Assessment:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Moderate (DoS, Client-side Resource Exhaustion, Application Slowdown)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit R3F/Three.js API Misuse or Bugs -> Trigger Memory Leaks via R3F/Three.js Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_r3fthree_js_api_misuse_or_bugs_-_trigger_memory_leaks_via_r3fthree_js_usage.md)

*   **Description:** This path targets vulnerabilities arising from improper usage of the `react-three-fiber` and underlying Three.js APIs, specifically focusing on memory management issues that can lead to memory leaks. This is often a result of developer errors rather than direct attacker actions, but can be exploited to cause DoS.

*   **Critical Node: Cause Memory Leaks through Improper Object Disposal**
    *   **Attack Vector Details:**
        *   This is primarily an exploitation of developer errors in memory management.
        *   Developers using `react-three-fiber` might forget to properly dispose of Three.js objects (geometries, materials, textures, scenes, etc.) when they are no longer needed, especially when React components unmount or objects are removed from the scene.
        *   Failure to dispose of these objects leads to memory leaks, where memory allocated by WebGL is not released back to the browser or operating system.
        *   Over time, these memory leaks accumulate, eventually causing:
            *   Client-side Denial of Service (DoS) as the browser runs out of memory and potentially crashes.
            *   Degraded application performance as available memory decreases.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Memory Management Practices:** Educate developers on Three.js memory management best practices. Emphasize the importance of disposing of Three.js objects.
        *   **`useEffect` Cleanup Functions:**  Consistently use `useEffect` cleanup functions in React components to dispose of Three.js objects when components unmount or when objects are removed from the scene.
        *   **Object Disposal Utilities:** Create utility functions or hooks to simplify and standardize the disposal of Three.js objects.
        *   **Memory Profiling:** Regularly use browser memory profiling tools during development and testing to detect and fix memory leaks.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews to specifically look for potential memory leak issues in `react-three-fiber` components.
    *   **Risk Assessment:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium (due to common developer errors)
        *   Impact: Moderate (Client-side DoS, Degraded Performance)
        *   Effort: Very Low (relies on developer error, no direct attacker action needed to *cause* the leak, only to *exploit* its existence by prolonged usage)
        *   Skill Level: Low (exploits developer oversight, not attacker skill)
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard (memory leaks can be subtle and hard to detect in production without proactive monitoring and profiling)
