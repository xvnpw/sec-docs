# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a declarative and efficient way to create 3D graphics and animations in React applications.
  - Offer a high-performance rendering solution leveraging Three.js capabilities within the React ecosystem.
  - Simplify the development process for 3D web experiences using React components.
  - Foster a vibrant community and ecosystem around React-based 3D graphics.
- Business Risks:
  - Dependency risk: Vulnerabilities or instability in underlying libraries (Three.js, React) could impact react-three-fiber.
  - Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient rendering or integration could lead to poor user experience in applications using react-three-fiber.
  - Community dependency: Reliance on community contributions for maintenance and feature development introduces a risk of slowed progress or lack of support if community engagement declines.
  - Compatibility issues: Changes in React or Three.js APIs could break compatibility and require significant updates to react-three-fiber.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open source code repository on GitHub, allowing for public code review and scrutiny. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Dependency management using npm, leveraging npm's security scanning features for known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Implemented in: package.json, npm ecosystem.
  - security control: Community-driven development, benefiting from collective code review and issue reporting. Implemented in: GitHub community, issue tracking.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies (Three.js, React, and other npm packages) that are not immediately identified or patched.
  - accepted risk: Bugs or security flaws in the library code itself, which may be discovered and addressed over time through community reports and code reviews.
  - accepted risk: Supply chain risks associated with npm package distribution, although mitigated by npm's security measures.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify and address vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate static code analysis tools (SAST) into the development workflow to detect potential code-level security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security reviews or audits of the codebase, potentially involving external security experts, to identify and mitigate potential security weaknesses.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a front-end library. Authentication is typically handled by the backend services that the React application interacts with, not by the rendering library itself.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a front-end library. Authorization logic resides in the application using the library and its backend services.
  - Input Validation: While react-three-fiber itself doesn't directly handle user input in a traditional sense, applications using it might. Input validation should be implemented in the application layer where user data is processed and used to generate 3D scenes. This is the responsibility of the developers using react-three-fiber.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for react-three-fiber itself. However, applications built with it might require cryptography for secure communication or data handling. This would be implemented at the application level, not within the library.

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer writes code and pushes changes to the GitHub repository.
  - Pushing code to specific branches or creating release tags triggers the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
  - GitHub Actions initiates a build environment (container) to build the project.
  - Within the build environment:
    - The project is built using build tools (e.g., npm scripts, bundlers).
    - Automated tests are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Linters and static analysis tools are run to check for code style and potential issues.
  - If tests and linters pass, the build artifacts (npm package) are packaged.
  - The npm package is published to the npm Registry, making it available for public consumption.
- Build Security Controls:
  - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. Implemented in: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Automated build process using GitHub Actions, ensuring consistent and repeatable builds. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows.
  - security control: Automated testing as part of the build process to catch regressions and ensure code quality. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows, testing scripts.
  - security control: Code linting and static analysis to identify potential code quality and security issues early in the development cycle. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows, linting configurations.
  - security control: Secure storage of npm publishing credentials as GitHub Actions secrets, limiting access to authorized workflows. Implemented in: GitHub Secrets Management.
  - security control: Dependency scanning during the build process (can be added as a GitHub Action) to identify vulnerable dependencies. Recommended but not explicitly mentioned in the provided information.
  - security control: Code review process before merging code changes to main branches, adding a human layer of security review. Implemented in: GitHub Pull Request process.
