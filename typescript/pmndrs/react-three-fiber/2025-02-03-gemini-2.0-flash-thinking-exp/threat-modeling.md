# Threat Model Analysis for pmndrs/react-three-fiber

## Threat: [Client-Side CPU/GPU Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/client-side_cpugpu_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts or exploits complex 3D scenes or animations within the `react-three-fiber` application. This involves loading scenes with excessively high polygon counts, overly complex shaders, or triggering computationally intensive animations repeatedly. The attacker aims to overload the user's CPU and/or GPU, making the application unresponsive or crashing the browser.
**Impact:** Application becomes unusable for the user. Performance degradation, browser freezing, or crashes. Negative user experience, potential loss of data if the application is used for critical tasks.
**Affected Component:** `Canvas` component, `Scene` component, `Mesh` component, `useFrame` hook, shaders, materials, geometries. Essentially any component involved in rendering the 3D scene.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Performance Budgeting: Establish and enforce performance budgets for scene complexity.
* Level of Detail (LOD): Implement LOD techniques to reduce model complexity based on distance.
* Occlusion Culling: Implement occlusion culling to avoid rendering hidden objects.
* Frame Rate Limiting: Cap the frame rate to prevent excessive resource usage.
* Code Reviews: Review code for performance bottlenecks.
* User Input Validation and Rate Limiting: If users control scene complexity, validate inputs and limit actions.
* Progressive Loading: Load assets progressively to avoid blocking the main thread.

## Threat: [Memory Leaks and Resource Exhaustion](./threats/memory_leaks_and_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** Developers unintentionally or attackers intentionally introduce memory leaks within `react-three-fiber` components. This occurs through improper disposal of Three.js objects (geometries, materials, textures, scenes) when components unmount or update. Over time, the application consumes increasing amounts of memory, leading to browser crashes or instability.
**Impact:** Application instability, browser crashes, negative user experience. Potential data loss.
**Affected Component:** All components that manage Three.js objects, especially components using `useMemo`, `useEffect`, and object disposal logic. Custom loaders and asset management functions.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Proper Object Disposal: Ensure all Three.js objects are properly disposed of in `useEffect` cleanup functions.
* Memory Profiling: Regularly profile application memory usage to identify leaks.
* Object Pooling: Consider object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects.
* Code Reviews: Review code for object lifecycle management.
* Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` effectively: Optimize component re-renders and object creation.

## Threat: [Three.js Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/three_js_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The underlying Three.js library contains security vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of Three.js.
**Impact:**  Potentially wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability in Three.js. Could range from client-side DoS to more serious exploits if vulnerabilities allow for code execution.
**Affected Component:**  Indirectly affects all `react-three-fiber` components as they rely on Three.js.
**Risk Severity:** High (potential impact of underlying dependency vulnerabilities)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly Update Three.js: Keep Three.js updated to the latest stable version.
* Dependency Scanning: Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in Three.js.
* Stay Informed: Monitor security advisories for Three.js and `react-three-fiber`.
