### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines a combined list of vulnerabilities identified in the REST Client extension, consolidated from multiple reports and formatted for clarity.

#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Response Preview

This category encompasses two related XSS vulnerabilities present in how the REST Client extension previews HTTP responses, allowing execution of malicious JavaScript within the VSCode webview context.

##### 1a. XSS in response preview due to unsanitized URLs

- Description:
    The `addUrlLinks` function in `HttpResponseWebview.ts` converts URLs in the response body into clickable links without sanitizing them. By crafting a malicious HTTP response containing URLs with JavaScript code (e.g., `javascript:alert('XSS')` or `<img>` tags with `onerror` handlers), an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code when a user previews the response. This vulnerability arises because the extension directly embeds these unsanitized URLs into the `href` attribute of `<a>` tags in the webview.

- Impact:
    Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution within the VSCode webview. This can lead to stealing sensitive information (environment variables, file paths), session hijacking, or further malicious actions within the VSCode instance.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The `addUrlLinks` function directly inserts URLs into `<a>` tags without sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Input sanitization is needed in the `addUrlLinks` function. URLs should be sanitized before insertion into `href` attributes to neutralize malicious JavaScript code. Employ a sanitization library or VSCode's built-in mechanisms to encode or remove JavaScript-related URL schemes and attributes.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker control over HTTP response content.
    - User sends a request to a malicious or compromised endpoint.
    - User previews the response in the REST Client's webview.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/views/httpResponseWebview.ts`
    2. **Function:** `addUrlLinks(innerHtml: string)`
    3. **Vulnerable Code:**
       ```typescript
       private addUrlLinks(innerHtml: string) {
           return innerHtml.replace(this.urlRegex, (match: string): string => {
               const encodedEndCharacters = ["&lt;", "&gt;", "&quot;", "&apos;"];
               let urlEndPosition = match.length;

               encodedEndCharacters.forEach((char) => {
                   const index = match.indexOf(char);
                   if (index > -1 && index < urlEndPosition) {
                       urlEndPosition = index;
                   }
               });

               const url = match.substr(0, urlEndPosition);
               const extraCharacters = match.substr(urlEndPosition);

               return '<a href="' + url + '" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">' + url + '</a>' + extraCharacters;
           });
       }
       ```
    4. **Analysis:** The `addUrlLinks` function uses a regex to find URLs and creates `<a>` tags with unsanitized URLs in `href`, enabling XSS via malicious URLs.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create `test.http` in VSCode.
    2. Add request: `GET http://example.com/xss`
    3. Mock HTTP server responds to `/xss` with: `This is a malicious response with an XSS payload: <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS_VULNERABILITY_REST_CLIENT')>`
    4. Run mock server.
    5. Execute request in REST Client.
    6. Observe response preview.
    7. Verify if alert box "XSS_VULNERABILITY_REST_CLIENT" appears, confirming XSS.

##### 1b. HTML Injection via Raw HTML Response Preview

- Description:
    The "Preview HTML Response Body" command directly renders the raw HTTP response body in a webview without sanitization. If an attacker controls an HTTP server and responds with malicious HTML (e.g., `<script>` tags), triggering this command will execute the unsanitized payload within the extension host's security context.

- Impact:
    Malicious HTML/JavaScript runs in the extension host's security context, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data theft, hijacked user actions, or system compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    Controlled rendering flows use safe HTML templates, CSP, and syntax highlighting.

- Missing Mitigations:
    The "Preview HTML Response Body" command lacks sanitization or wrapping of the response body before raw HTML rendering.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker controls an HTTP server returning "text/html" responses with malicious code.
    - User sends a request and manually triggers "Preview HTML Response Body" command.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/views/httpResponseWebview.ts`
    2. **Function:** `previewResponseBody()`
    3. **Vulnerable Code:**
       ```typescript
       private previewResponseBody() {
           if (this.activeResponse && this.activePanel) {
               this.activePanel.webview.html = this.activeResponse.body;
           }
       }
       ```
    4. **Analysis:** The `previewResponseBody` method directly assigns the unsanitized response body to the webview's HTML.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a test HTTP server responding with "Content-Type: text/html" and payload: `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`.
    2. In VSCode, send a request to the test server.
    3. Trigger "Preview HTML Response Body" command via command palette.
    4. Confirm JavaScript execution (e.g., alert box), indicating unsanitized raw HTML rendering.

#### 2. OIDC Callback Redirect URL Injection

- Description:
    The `OidcClient` constructs a callback URI using potentially attacker-influenced settings like `callbackDomain` and `callbackPort` from request definitions (via system variables). If an attacker manipulates these variables, they can inject a malicious redirect URI, potentially intercepting the authorization code and gaining unauthorized access.

- Impact:
    Successful injection of a malicious redirect URI can lead to interception of the OIDC authorization code, enabling user impersonation and unauthorized resource access.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. Redirect URI construction lacks input validation for `callbackDomain` and `callbackPort` from system variables.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Input validation and sanitization for `callbackDomain` and `callbackPort` from system variables. Implement a strict allowlist for callback domains/ports or robust dynamic callback URI verification.

- Preconditions:
    - User uses OIDC authentication.
    - Attacker influences `callbackDomain` and `callbackPort` via crafted `.http` files or environment configurations.
    - OIDC provider doesn't strictly validate redirect URIs, or attacker bypasses validation.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/utils/auth/oidcClient.ts`
    2. **Function:** `get redirectUri()` and `getAccessToken()`
    3. **Vulnerable Code:**
       ```typescript
       get redirectUri() {
           return `${this.callbackDomain ? 'https' : 'http'}://${this.callbackDomain ?? 'localhost'}:${this.callbackPort}`;
       }
       ```
    4. **Analysis:** `redirectUri` is built using potentially attacker-controlled `callbackDomain` and `callbackPort` without validation.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create `test-oidc-redirect.http` in VSCode.
    2. Add request with malicious callback domain: `GET http://example.com Authorization: oidcAccessToken clientId:your-client-id issuer:your-issuer callbackDomain:malicious.example.com callbackPort:7777 ...`
    3. Run request.
    4. Observe browser redirect URL to `https://malicious.example.com:7777`.
    5. Set up listener on `malicious.example.com:7777`. Verify if authorization code is sent to malicious listener.

#### 3. Command Injection via Process Environment Variable Substitution

- Description:
    The `SystemVariableProvider` allows access to process environment variables via `$processEnv`. If resolved environment variable names or values contain shell-escaped sequences and are used in contexts executing shell commands (potential broader risk), it could lead to command injection. Even without direct command execution in this code, uncontrolled access can expose sensitive information.

- Impact:
    Potentially critical if environment variables are used in command execution contexts. Unauthorized access can leak sensitive information, contributing to other attacks.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. `SystemVariableProvider` retrieves and substitutes environment variables without sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Input validation for environment variable names. Contextual sanitization of values, especially if used in shell commands. Consider restricting access to an allowlist of safe environment variables.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker crafts `.http` request using `$processEnv`.
    - System or extension parts use substituted values in command execution contexts (potential broader risk).

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/utils/httpVariableProviders/systemVariableProvider.ts`
    2. **Function:** `registerProcessEnvVariable()`
    3. **Vulnerable Code:**
       ```typescript
       private registerProcessEnvVariable() {
           this.resolveFuncs.set(Constants.ProcessEnvVariableName, async name => {
               const groups = this.processEnvRegex.exec(name);
               if (groups !== null && groups.length === 3 ) {
                   const [, refToggle, environmentVarName] = groups;
                   let processEnvName = environmentVarName;
                   if (refToggle !== undefined) {
                       processEnvName = await this.resolveSettingsEnvironmentVariable(environmentVarName);
                   }
                   const envValue = process.env[processEnvName];
                   if (envValue !== undefined) {
                       return { value: envValue.toString() };
                   } else {
                       return { value: '' };
                   }
               }
               return { warning: ResolveWarningMessage.IncorrectProcessEnvVariableFormat };
           });
       }
       ```
    4. **Analysis:** Code retrieves environment variables using user-provided names via `$processEnv` without validation.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set env var `VULN_VAR="; touch /tmp/pwned ;"`.
    2. Create `test-processenv-injection.http` in VSCode.
    3. Add request: `GET http://example.com X-Custom-Header: {{processEnv VULN_VAR}}`
    4. Execute request, inspect headers via `webhook.site`.
    5. Check for `/tmp/pwned` creation or similar command execution effect, indicating injection.

#### 4. Potential XPath Injection in Request Variable Processing

- Description:
    `RequestVariableCacheValueProcessor.resolveXmlHttpBody` uses `xpath` library to process XML responses based on user-provided XPath queries in request variables. If an attacker controls the XPath query string, they can inject malicious XPath expressions, potentially leading to information disclosure.

- Impact:
    Successful XPath injection can lead to unauthorized extraction of sensitive information from XML responses.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. User-provided XPath queries are directly passed to `xpath.select` without sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Input sanitization and validation for XPath queries. Consider safer XML data extraction mechanisms or restrict XPath engine capabilities.

- Preconditions:
    - User uses request variable referencing XML response body with XPath query.
    - Attacker influences XPath query string via crafted `.http` file.
    - Target server returns XML response.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/utils/requestVariableCacheValueProcessor.ts`
    2. **Function:** `resolveXmlHttpBody(body: any, path: string)`
    3. **Vulnerable Code:**
       ```typescript
       private static resolveXmlHttpBody(body: any, path: string): ResolveResult {
           try {
               const doc = new DOMParser().parseFromString(body);
               const results = xpath.select(path, doc); // Vulnerable line
               // ...
           } catch {
               // ...
           }
       }
       ```
    4. **Analysis:** Unsanitized `path` from user input is directly used in `xpath.select`, enabling XPath injection.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create `test-xpath-injection.http` in VSCode.
    2. Add requests: `xmlRequest` (GET XML), `xpathInjection` (GET with injected XPath in header).
    3. Mock server responds to `/xml-response` with XML body containing sensitive data.
    4. Execute `xmlRequest`, then `xpathInjection`. Inspect `xpathInjection` headers via `webhook.site`.
    5. Check if `X-Injected-Header` contains data extracted by injected XPath, confirming injection.

#### 5. Potential JSONPath Injection in Request Variable Processing

- Description:
    `RequestVariableCacheValueProcessor.resolveJsonHttpBody` uses `jsonpath-plus` library for JSON response processing based on user-provided JSONPath queries in request variables. Attacker control over the JSONPath query string allows injection of malicious expressions, potentially leading to information disclosure.

- Impact:
    Successful JSONPath injection can lead to unauthorized extraction of sensitive information from JSON responses.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. User-provided JSONPath queries are directly passed to `JSONPath` without sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Input sanitization and validation for JSONPath queries. Consider safer JSON data extraction mechanisms or restrict JSONPath engine capabilities.

- Preconditions:
    - User uses request variable referencing JSON response body with JSONPath query.
    - Attacker influences JSONPath query string via crafted `.http` file.
    - Target server returns JSON response.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/utils/requestVariableCacheValueProcessor.ts`
    2. **Function:** `resolveJsonHttpBody(body: any, path: string)`
    3. **Vulnerable Code:**
       ```typescript
       private static resolveJsonHttpBody(body: any, path: string): ResolveResult {
           try {
               const result = JSONPath({ path, json: body }); // Vulnerable line
               // ...
           } catch {
               // ...
           }
       }
       ```
    4. **Analysis:** Unsanitized `path` from user input is directly used in `JSONPath`, enabling JSONPath injection.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create `test-jsonpath-injection.http` in VSCode.
    2. Add requests: `jsonRequest` (GET JSON), `jsonpathInjection` (GET with injected JSONPath in header).
    3. Mock server responds to `/json-response` with JSON body containing sensitive data.
    4. Execute `jsonRequest`, then `jsonpathInjection`. Inspect `jsonpathInjection` headers via `webhook.site`.
    5. Check if `X-Injected-Header` contains data extracted by injected JSONPath, confirming injection.

#### 6. Command Injection via Unsafe YAML Deserialization in Swagger Import

- Description:
    The extension imports Swagger/OpenAPI definitions via the "Import Swagger" command, using `yaml.load(data)` from `js-yaml` without safe schema or methods. Importing a malicious YAML file with unsafe YAML types (e.g., `!!js/function`) can trigger code execution.

- Impact:
    Unsafe deserialization of a malicious Swagger file can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the extension host, potentially compromising the system.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    A try-catch block is used, but it only rethrows errors without safe-loading strategies.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Switch to safe parse methods (e.g., `yaml.safeLoad()`) or use a safe schema. Implement input validation/sanitization of Swagger YAML files before deserialization.

- Preconditions:
    - User selects "Import Swagger" command and chooses a malicious Swagger YAML file.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/controllers/swaggerController.ts`
    2. **Function:** `parseOpenApiYaml(data: string)`
    3. **Vulnerable Code:**
       ```typescript
       public parseOpenApiYaml(data: string): string | undefined {
           try {
               const openApiYaml = yaml.load(data); // Vulnerable line
               return this.generateRestClientOutput(openApiYaml);
           } catch (error) {
               throw error;
           }
       }
       ```
    4. **Analysis:** `yaml.load()` is used without secure options, processing unsafe YAML constructs.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Craft malicious Swagger YAML file with unsafe tag (e.g., `!!js/function "return process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('calc')"`).
    2. Save file locally.
    3. Use "Import Swagger" command in VSCode to load the file.
    4. Verify payload execution (e.g., calculator launch), confirming unsafe deserialization.

#### 7. Arbitrary File Read via File Inclusion in HTTP Request Body

- Description:
    For HTTP requests with file inclusion using "@" syntax in the body, the extension reads file contents via `resolveRequestBodyPath`. This function joins user-provided relative paths with a base directory without normalization or traversal checks. An attacker can entice a user to load a crafted request referencing arbitrary files (e.g., "@../../etc/passwd"), leading to unintended inclusion of sensitive file contents in the outgoing request.

- Impact:
    Sensitive local files may be disclosed through HTTP requests, potentially leading to data exfiltration or further compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No sanitization or directory traversal checks are applied to file paths.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Input validation and normalization of file paths to enforce allowed directories or reject traversal sequences (e.g., "../").

- Preconditions:
    - User triggers HTTP request with "@" syntax in body (e.g., cURL-formatted HTTP file).
    - Requester supplies file reference with directory traversal (e.g., "@../../etc/passwd").

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Files:** `/code/src/utils/curlRequestParser.ts`, `/code/src/utils/httpRequestParser.ts`, `/code/src/utils/requestParserUtil.ts`
    2. **Functions:** Parsing request body, `resolveRequestBodyPath`
    3. **Vulnerable Code:** Calls to `resolveRequestBodyPath` without traversal checks.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create HTTP request file with body starting with "@" and relative traversal path (e.g., "@../../etc/passwd").
    2. Open file in VSCode, execute "Send Request".
    3. Monitor generated HTTP request or extension logs.
    4. Verify if contents of targeted file (e.g., "/etc/passwd") are read and in the request.

#### 8. Insecure TLS Certificate Validation in HTTP Client

- Description:
    The extension's HTTP client explicitly disables TLS certificate validation by setting `rejectUnauthorized: false` in HTTPS options. An attacker controlling network traffic (MITM attack) can present crafted certificates and intercept/modify HTTPS communication.

- Impact:
    Without certificate validation, MITM attackers can intercept and manipulate sensitive data (credentials, tokens, responses), leading to data exfiltration, malicious payload injection, or other security compromises.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. TLS certificate validation is intentionally disabled.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Enable strict TLS certificate validation by setting `rejectUnauthorized: true` (or make configurable). Add settings for users to override in development/testing.

- Preconditions:
    - Extension makes HTTPS requests.
    - Attacker has network control (e.g., public WiFi) and can serve malicious/self-signed certificates.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/utils/httpClient.ts`
    2. **Function:** `prepareOptions`
    3. **Vulnerable Code:**
       ```typescript
       const options: OptionsOfBufferResponseBody = {
           // …
           https: {
               rejectUnauthorized: false // Vulnerable line
           }
       };
       ```
    4. **Analysis:** Hardcoded `rejectUnauthorized: false` disables certificate validation.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up HTTPS proxy with self-signed certificate.
    2. Configure environment to route extension HTTPS requests through proxy.
    3. On proxy, intercept and modify HTTPS responses.
    4. Send HTTPS request using extension.
    5. Verify extension accepts self-signed certificate and processes modified response, confirming disabled TLS validation.
