- **Vulnerability Name:** HTML Injection via Raw HTML Response Preview  
  **Description:**  
  When a user triggers the “Preview HTML Response Body” command (bound to the command `rest-client.preview-html-response-body`), the extension directly assigns the HTTP response’s raw body to the webview’s HTML. An attacker who controls an HTTP server can respond with malicious HTML (e.g. a `<script>` tag) so that if the user chooses to view the response in HTML mode, the unsanitized payload is rendered.  
  **Impact:**  
  Malicious HTML/JavaScript runs in the extension host’s security context. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the extension host, theft of sensitive data, hijacking of user actions, or further compromise of the host system.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - In the controlled rendering flow (via the usual `render()` method) responses are wrapped in a safe HTML template with a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and treated with syntax–highlighting.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - The command “Preview HTML Response Body” does not sanitize or wrap the response body when rendering raw HTML.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - An attacker controls an HTTP server returning “text/html” responses containing malicious code.  
  - A user sends a request to that server and then manually triggers the “Preview HTML Response Body” command.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/views/httpResponseWebview.ts`, the method  
    ```ts
    private previewResponseBody() {
      if (this.activeResponse && this.activePanel) {
          this.activePanel.webview.html = this.activeResponse.body;
      }
    }
    ```  
    assigns the unsanitized HTTP response body directly to the webview’s HTML.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Set up a test HTTP server that, upon request, returns a “Content-Type: text/html” header and a payload such as `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`.  
  2. In VSCode with the REST Client extension installed, send a request to the test server.  
  3. After receiving the response, manually trigger the “Preview HTML Response Body” command via the command palette.  
  4. Confirm that the injected JavaScript executes (for example, an alert box appears), showing that the raw HTML is rendered unsanitized.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsafe YAML Deserialization in Swagger Import  
  **Description:**  
  The extension supports importing Swagger/OpenAPI definitions via the “Import Swagger” command. In `/code/src/controllers/swaggerController.ts`, the method `parseOpenApiYaml(data: string)` calls `yaml.load(data)` (from the js‑yaml library) without specifying a safe schema or using a secure parse method. If an attacker crafts a YAML file that uses unsafe YAML types (for example, `!!js/function`), importing it may trigger code execution.  
  **Impact:**  
  Should a user import a malicious Swagger file, the unsafe deserialization may allow arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the extension host, leading to further compromise of the system.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - A try–catch block is used around YAML loading; however, it merely rethrows errors without employing any safe–loading strategy.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Switching to a safe parse method (such as `yaml.safeLoad()`) or specifying a safe schema.  
  - Input validation or sanitization of user–supplied Swagger YAML files before deserialization.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The user selects the “Import Swagger” command (bound to `rest-client.import-swagger`) and chooses a malicious Swagger YAML file.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/controllers/swaggerController.ts`, the method  
    ```ts
    public parseOpenApiYaml(data: string): string | undefined {
      try {
          const openApiYaml = yaml.load(data);
          return this.generateRestClientOutput(openApiYaml);
      } catch (error) {
          throw error;
      }
    }
    ```  
    uses `yaml.load()` without secure options, causing it to process unsafe YAML constructs.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Craft a malicious Swagger YAML file that includes an unsafe YAML tag (e.g. `!!js/function "return process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('calc')"` on Windows).  
  2. Save the file locally.  
  3. In VSCode, use the “Import Swagger” command to load the file.  
  4. Verify that the payload executes (e.g. a command launches or a calculator opens), indicating that unsafe deserialization occurred.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via File Inclusion in HTTP Request Body  
  **Description:**  
  For HTTP requests that support file inclusion using an “@” syntax in the request body (such as in cURL–formatted requests), the extension interprets a body beginning with “@” as a file path and reads its contents via a helper function (i.e. `resolveRequestBodyPath`). This function simply joins the user–provided relative path with a base directory without normalizing or validating against directory–traversal sequences. An attacker may entice a user to load or send a crafted HTTP request that references an arbitrary file (e.g. “@../../etc/passwd”), leading the extension to unintentionally include sensitive file contents in the outgoing request.  
  **Impact:**  
  Sensitive local files (e.g. credentials or configuration files) may be disclosed through the HTTP request, potentially resulting in data exfiltration or further compromise.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No sanitization or directory–traversal checks are applied when file paths are processed.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Input validation and normalization of file paths to enforce allowed directories or reject traversal sequences (e.g. “../”).  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The user triggers an HTTP request that uses the “@” syntax in its body (for example, through a cURL–formatted HTTP file).  
  - The requester (or an attacker through phishing/social engineering) supplies a file reference that employs directory traversal (e.g. “@../../etc/passwd”).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/utils/curlRequestParser.ts` and `/code/src/utils/httpRequestParser.ts`, when the request body is detected to start with “@”, the code calls `resolveRequestBodyPath` (defined in `/code/src/utils/requestParserUtil.ts`) to resolve the absolute file path without removing relative traversal segments.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Create an HTTP request file whose body begins with an “@” followed by a relative path that traverses directories (for instance, “@../../etc/passwd” on a Unix–like system).  
  2. Open the HTTP request file in VSCode with the REST Client extension installed.  
  3. Execute the “Send Request” command so that the file inclusion directive is processed.  
  4. Monitor the generated HTTP request (or the extension’s logs) to verify whether the contents of the targeted file (e.g. “/etc/passwd”) were read and incorporated into the outgoing request.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure TLS Certificate Validation in HTTP Client  
  **Description:**  
  In order to make HTTP requests, the extension uses a customized HTTP client that _explicitly disables_ TLS certificate validation. In the method that prepares request options (in `/code/src/utils/httpClient.ts`), the HTTPS configuration is set with  
  ```ts
  https: {
      rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
  ```  
  This instructs the underlying HTTP library to accept any server certificate—including self–signed or malicious ones—without validation. An attacker controlling network traffic (for example, via a man–in–the–middle attack on an open or compromised WiFi network) could present a crafted certificate and intercept or modify HTTPS communication.  
  **Impact:**  
  Without proper certificate validation, a man–in–the–middle (MITM) attacker can intercept and manipulate sensitive data (such as authentication credentials, tokens, or response content). This could lead to data exfiltration, injection of malicious payloads, or other compromise of the user’s security.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - There is no mitigation in effect. The HTTPS options are hardcoded with `rejectUnauthorized: false`, meaning validation is intentionally disabled.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Enable strict TLS certificate validation by setting `rejectUnauthorized` to `true` (or making this behavior configurable).  
  - Optionally, add settings that allow experienced users to override this behavior only in development or testing environments.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The extension makes HTTPS requests (which it does by default for servers reached over SSL/TLS).  
  - An attacker has network control (e.g. in a public WiFi environment) and can serve malicious/self–signed certificates.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/src/utils/httpClient.ts`, the function `prepareOptions` creates an options object for HTTPS requests. The following snippet is used without conditional checks:  
    ```ts
    const options: OptionsOfBufferResponseBody = {
      // … other options …
      https: {
          rejectUnauthorized: false
      }
    };
    ```  
    This hardcoded value causes the client to trust any certificate.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Set up a controlled HTTPS proxy that uses a self–signed certificate.  
  2. Configure the environment (or force traffic via network routing) so that HTTPS requests from the extension pass through the proxy.  
  3. On the proxy, intercept and modify HTTPS responses (for example, change the response body or headers).  
  4. Send an HTTPS request using the extension.  
  5. Verify that the extension accepts the self–signed certificate and processes the modified response, thereby confirming that TLS certificate validation is disabled.
