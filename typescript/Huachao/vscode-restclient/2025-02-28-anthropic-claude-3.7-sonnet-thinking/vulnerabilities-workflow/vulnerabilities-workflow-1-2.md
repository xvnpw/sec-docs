# Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Swagger YAML File

  - **Description:**  
    The Swagger import feature lets users import a Swagger/OpenAPI definition from a file. In the implementation (in the file `swaggerUtils.ts`), the extension reads the entire content of the file and directly passes it to the function:
    ```js
    const openApiYaml = yaml.load(data);
    ```  
    The `yaml.load` function (from the [js‑yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) library) does not enforce a safe schema. This means that if a malicious actor supplies a manipulated Swagger (or OpenAPI) YAML file containing custom YAML tags—such as `!!js/function`—the parser may deserialize and instantiate the payload as an executable function. In a scenario where the victim opens a repository (provided by the attacker) and then triggers the import command, the unsafe parsing leads to arbitrary code execution within the context of the VS Code extension.

    **Step‑by‑step trigger:**
    1. The attacker creates a specially crafted Swagger/OpenAPI YAML file that embeds malicious payload(s) using custom tags (for example, `!!js/function`).
    2. The attacker distributes a repository containing this malicious YAML file.
    3. The victim, while exploring the repository with the VS Code REST Client extension installed, invokes the "Import Swagger" command (registered as `rest-client.import-swagger`).
    4. The file‑open dialog is presented, and the victim selects the attacker‑controlled file.
    5. The extension reads this file and calls `yaml.load(data)` without any safe loading measures.
    6. The malicious YAML payload is deserialized and executed, allowing arbitrary commands to be run on the victim's system.

  - **Impact:**  
    Successful exploitation results in remote code execution (RCE) within the VS Code process running the extension. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, read or modify local files, and compromise the overall security of the user's system.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    There are no mitigations in place for this issue. The code directly calls:
    ```js
    const openApiYaml = yaml.load(data);
    ```
    without applying a safe loading function or schema restrictions.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Replace the direct call to `yaml.load(data)` with a safe loading version, such as [`yaml.safeLoad`](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml#safeload), so that custom tags which may trigger code execution are not processed.
    - Validate or sanitize the Swagger file content before parsing.
    - Enforce a strict, restricted schema to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary objects.
    - Provide a user warning regarding the risks of importing YAML files from untrusted sources.

  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The victim must manually trigger the Swagger import functionality (via the "Import Swagger" command).
    - The attacker must supply a repository containing a malicious Swagger/OpenAPI YAML file.
    - The victim must select and import the malicious file when prompted by the file‑open dialog.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    In `swaggerUtils.ts`, the relevant function (similar to the following example) is implemented:
    ```js
    parseOpenApiYaml(data: string): string | undefined {
        try {
            const openApiYaml = yaml.load(data);
            return this.generateRestClientOutput(openApiYaml);
        } catch (error) {
            throw error;
        }
    }
    ```
    The vulnerability arises from the call to `yaml.load(data)` without using a safe variant. The [js‑yaml documentation](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) notes that using `load()` on untrusted input may lead to code execution because it supports arbitrary object construction. Since this function is invoked when the user imports a Swagger file, any malicious payload in the YAML file is deserialized and executed.

  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Setup:**  
       - Prepare a malicious Swagger file (e.g., `malicious-swagger.yaml`) that includes a payload using dangerous YAML tags such as:
         ```yaml
         someKey: !!js/function >
           function () { require('fs').writeFileSync('/tmp/pwned.txt', 'compromised'); }
         ```
    2. **Deployment:**  
       - Place the `malicious-swagger.yaml` file in a test repository that the extension user might open.
    3. **Trigger Import:**  
       - In VS Code (with the REST Client extension installed), run the "Import Swagger" command (`rest-client.import-swagger`).
    4. **File Selection:**  
       - When the file‑open dialog appears, select `malicious-swagger.yaml`.
    5. **Observation:**  
       - Verify whether the malicious code executes (for example, by checking if the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` is created or by looking for other defined malicious actions).
    6. **Conclusion:**  
       - If the malicious code is executed, this confirms that the Swagger import feature is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.

**Summary of Additional Findings:**

After a thorough review of the new project files (including utilities for request parsing, variable processing, authentication, and file system interactions), **no new vulnerabilities** that meet the criteria for remote code execution, command injection, or code injection were identified. The rest of the code—although handling untrusted file contents and external data—either uses safe parsing methods (e.g., JSON.parse) or standard processing routines that do not lead to dangerous dynamic code execution. 

Thus, the only high‑risk vulnerability in the system remains the unsafe handling of Swagger YAML files, which must be addressed to prevent potential remote code execution attacks.

*By implementing proper safe-loading and validation measures for YAML files, the extension can mitigate this critical vulnerability and better protect users from code execution risks arising from manipulated repository files.*
