* Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Response Preview

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP response with a body containing JavaScript code.
    2. The attacker sends this malicious response to a user using the REST Client extension, for example by controlling a web server or through a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
    3. The user sends a request using the REST Client to the attacker's controlled server or through a compromised network.
    4. The REST Client extension receives the malicious response and renders it in a webview panel.
    5. If the Content-Type of the response is `text/html` or if the response body contains HTML-like structures even with other content types (e.g. `application/json` with HTML in string values), the webview executes the embedded JavaScript code, leading to XSS.

* Impact:
    - In the context of a VSCode extension, XSS can lead to serious vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially:
        - Steal sensitive information from the user's VSCode workspace, such as environment variables, file content, or API keys if they are displayed in the response preview or accessible via the VSCode API.
        - Perform actions on behalf of the user within VSCode, such as modifying files, installing extensions, or sending requests to other services.
        - Redirect the user to malicious websites or display phishing pages within the VSCode environment.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The extension uses `sanitize-html` library in `src/views/codeSnippetWebview.ts` and `src/views/httpResponseWebview.ts`.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) is set in the webview HTML to restrict script sources and other potentially unsafe content.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - While `sanitize-html` is used, its effectiveness depends on the configuration and the complexity of the XSS payload. It may not be sufficient to prevent all types of XSS, especially in complex scenarios or if bypasses are found in the sanitization library.
    - The current CSP policy, while present, might not be strict enough to completely eliminate XSS risks. For example, `unsafe-inline` is allowed in `style-src`.
    - The extension automatically renders responses in a webview which inherently introduces security risks if the response content is not strictly controlled.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP response to the user's REST Client extension. This could be achieved by:
        - Compromising a web server that the user is requesting data from.
        - Performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to intercept and modify responses.
        - Tricking the user into sending a request to an attacker-controlled endpoint.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - In `src/views/httpResponseWebview.ts`, the `getHtmlForWebview` function is responsible for generating the HTML content of the response preview.
    - If the `Content-Type` indicates an image, it directly embeds the base64 encoded image data:
    ```typescript
    if (MimeUtility.isBrowserSupportedImageFormat(contentType) && !HttpResponseWebview.isHeadRequest(response)) {
        innerHtml = `<img src="data:${contentType};base64,${base64(response.bodyBuffer)}">`;
    } else { ... }
    ```
    - For other content types, it highlights the response body using `highlight.js` and wraps it in `<pre><code>`:
    ```typescript
    const code = this.highlightResponse(response);
    width = (code.split(/\r\n|\r|\n/).length + 1).toString().length;
    innerHtml = `<pre><code>${this.addLineNums(code)}</code></pre>`;
    ```
    - The `previewResponseBody` command in `src/views/httpResponseWebview.ts` directly sets the webview HTML to `response.body` if the `Content-Type` is `text/html`:
    ```typescript
    private previewResponseBody() {
        if (this.activeResponse && this.activePanel) {
            this.activePanel.webview.html = this.activeResponse.body; // Vulnerable line
        }
    }
    ```
    - The `getHtmlForWebview` function sets CSP:
    ```typescript
    const csp = this.getCsp(nonce);
    return `
        <head>
            ...
            ${csp}
            ...
        </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            ${this.settings.disableAddingHrefLinkForLargeResponse && response.bodySizeInBytes > this.settings.largeResponseBodySizeLimitInMB * 1024 * 1024
                ? innerHtml
                : this.addUrlLinks(innerHtml)}
            ...
        </div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="${panel.webview.asWebviewUri(this.scriptFilePath)}" nonce="${nonce}" charset="UTF-8"></script>
    </body>`;
    ```
    - The CSP in `getCsp` function is:
    ```typescript
    private getCsp(nonce: string): string {
        return `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; img-src 'self' http: https: data: vscode-resource:; script-src 'nonce-${nonce}'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' http: https: data: vscode-resource:;">`;
    }
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a simple HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or Node.js `http` module).
    2. On the server, configure an endpoint (e.g., `/xss`) to return a response with `Content-Type: text/html` and the following body:
    ```html
    <h1>XSS Test</h1>
    <script>
        // Attempt to access VSCode API (e.g., show an information message)
        const vscode = acquireVsCodeApi();
        vscode.postMessage({ command: 'xss', content: 'XSS Vulnerability' });
    </script>
    ```
    3. In VSCode, open a new HTTP file.
    4. Create a GET request to your server's `/xss` endpoint:
    ```http
    GET http://localhost:<your_server_port>/xss
    ```
    5. Send the request (Ctrl+Alt+R or Cmd+Alt+R).
    6. Observe if the JavaScript code in the response body is executed in the response preview panel. Check if an information message (or any other VSCode API action) is triggered, indicating successful XSS.
    7. Alternatively, modify the malicious HTML to attempt to exfiltrate data (e.g., send data to an attacker-controlled server via `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`).

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement stricter sanitization of HTML responses, even if Content-Type is not `text/html`, as response bodies with other content types might still contain HTML-like structures with embedded scripts.
    - Enforce a stricter CSP policy that removes `unsafe-inline` from `style-src` and further restricts `img-src` and other directives if possible.
    - Consider rendering responses in a more secure context, possibly by using a more isolated webview or by rendering responses as plain text by default and offering an "HTML Preview" option that performs strict sanitization.
    - For the `previewResponseBody` command, ensure that even when previewing HTML bodies, sanitization is applied before setting the webview HTML.
