## Vulnerability List for REST Client VSCode Extension

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Response Preview

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious API response with a JavaScript payload in the response body or headers (e.g., `Content-Type: text/html` with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in the body or a header value like `X-Malicious-Header: <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`).
    2. A user sends a request to this malicious API using the REST Client extension.
    3. The REST Client extension receives the response and renders it in a webview panel.
    4. If the response content is not properly sanitized, the JavaScript payload from the malicious API response gets executed within the webview context, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the VS Code extension's webview.

- Impact:
    - High
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the VS Code extension's webview. This could lead to:
        - Stealing sensitive information from the user's VS Code workspace (e.g., environment variables, file content if the extension has access).
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user within VS Code, such as sending requests to other APIs or modifying files.
        - Potentially gaining further access to the user's system if combined with other vulnerabilities or exploits.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The code uses `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting, which might provide some level of escaping for code blocks, but it's not designed for XSS prevention in general HTML content.
    - The code uses `sanitize-html` in `CodeLoopbackClient.ts`, but this is not used in `HttpResponseWebview.ts`.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) is set in `getHtmlForWebview` in `HttpResponseWebview.ts` and `CodeSnippetWebview.ts`. However, the CSP only restricts `script-src` to `'nonce-'`, but allows `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`. If attacker can inject inline styles, it might bypass CSP. Also, `img-src` allows `http: https: data: vscode-resource:`, which is quite broad.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Proper sanitization of the response body and headers before rendering in the webview, especially for `text/html` and potentially other content types that could contain JavaScript or HTML payloads. Libraries like `DOMPurify` are designed for this purpose and are more robust than basic escaping.
    - More restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) to further limit the capabilities of the webview, such as disallowing `unsafe-inline` for `style-src` if possible, and limiting `img-src` and other directives if feasible.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to control an API endpoint that the user can send requests to using the REST Client extension.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/views/httpResponseWebview.ts`
    - Function: `getHtmlForWebview(panel: WebviewPanel, response: HttpResponse)`
    - The function constructs the HTML content for the response preview.
    - It uses `this.highlightResponse(response)` to get syntax-highlighted code, which might escape some characters but is not designed for XSS prevention.
    - It uses `<img src="data:${contentType};base64,${base64(response.bodyBuffer)}">` for image responses, which is generally safe for image formats but relies on correct `contentType`.
    - It uses `this.addUrlLinks(innerHtml)` to add links to URLs in the response, which could be a potential injection point if URLs are maliciously crafted, although `<a>` tags are generally less risky than `<script>`.
    - CSP is set using `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="...">`.

    ```typescript
    private getHtmlForWebview(panel: WebviewPanel, response: HttpResponse): string {
        // ...
        if (MimeUtility.isBrowserSupportedImageFormat(contentType) && !HttpResponseWebview.isHeadRequest(response)) {
            innerHtml = `<img src="data:${contentType};base64,${base64(response.bodyBuffer)}">`;
        } else {
            const code = this.highlightResponse(response); // Syntax highlighting, not XSS sanitization
            width = (code.split(/\r\n|\r|\n/).length + 1).toString().length;
            innerHtml = `<pre><code>${this.addLineNums(code)}</code></pre>`;
        }

        // Content Security Policy
        const nonce = new Date().getTime() + '' + new Date().getMilliseconds();
        const csp = this.getCsp(nonce);
        return `
    <head>
        ...
        ${csp} <== CSP is set here
        ...
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            ${this.settings.disableAddingHrefLinkForLargeResponse && response.bodySizeInBytes > this.settings.largeResponseBodySizeLimitInMB * 1024 * 1024
                ? innerHtml
                : this.addUrlLinks(innerHtml)} <== URLs are linked, potential injection point in URLs
            <a id="scroll-to-top" role="button" aria-label="scroll to top" title="Scroll To Top"><span class="icon"></span></a>
        </div>
        ...
    </body>`;
    }
    ```

    - Function: `highlightResponse(response: HttpResponse)`
    - This function uses `hljs.highlight` to highlight the response, but it doesn't sanitize HTML or JavaScript code within the response.

    ```typescript
    private highlightResponse(response: HttpResponse): string {
        // ...
        if (previewOption !== PreviewOption.Headers) {
            const responseBodyPart = `${ResponseFormatUtility.formatBody(response.body, response.contentType, this.settings.suppressResponseBodyContentTypeValidationWarning)}`;
            if (this.settings.disableHighlightResponseBodyForLargeResponse &&
                response.bodySizeInBytes > this.settings.largeResponseBodySizeLimitInMB * 1024 * 1024) {
                code += responseBodyPart;
            } else {
                const bodyLanguageAlias = HttpResponseWebview.getHighlightLanguageAlias(response.contentType, responseBodyPart);
                if (bodyLanguageAlias) {
                    code += hljs.highlight(bodyLanguageAlias, responseBodyPart).value; // Syntax highlighting, no sanitization
                } else {
                    code += hljs.highlightAuto(responseBodyPart).value; // Syntax highlighting, no sanitization
                }
            }
        }

        return code;
    }
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a simple HTTP server (e.g., using `netcat` or Python's `http.server`) that will serve a malicious response.
    2. Create a file `test.http` in VSCode with the following content:
    ```http
    GET http://localhost:8000/malicious-response
    ```
    3. Run the following Python http server in the same directory (or use netcat to listen on port 8000 and serve the crafted response):
    ```python
    from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler

    class Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
        def do_GET(self):
            if self.path == '/malicious-response':
                self.send_response(200)
                self.send_header('Content-Type', 'text/html')
                self.end_headers()
                self.wfile.write(b'<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability in REST Client");</script><h1>Malicious Response</h1>')
            else:
                self.send_error(404)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        server_address = ('', 8000)
        httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, Handler)
        httpd.serve_forever()
    ```
    4. Run the Python server.
    5. Open `test.http` in VSCode and send the request "Send Request" above `GET http://localhost:8000/malicious-response`.
    6. Observe that an alert box with "XSS Vulnerability in REST Client" is displayed in VSCode, proving the XSS vulnerability.

### 2. Command Injection via `$processEnv` System Variable

- Description:
    1. The REST Client extension supports system variables, including `$processEnv`, which allows users to retrieve environment variables from their system.
    2. The `$processEnv` variable is implemented by directly accessing `process.env` in Node.js.
    3. If an attacker can control the value of an environment variable that is used in a request, they can potentially inject commands if the value is not properly sanitized when processed by the extension or the target API.
    4. While direct command injection within the extension's context might be limited due to VS Code's security model, if the value of the environment variable is used in code snippet generation or other features that interact with the user's system, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities in other contexts.

- Impact:
    - High
    - Although direct command execution in the extension's context is unlikely, the vulnerability could still lead to:
        - Information disclosure: If environment variables contain sensitive information, an attacker could craft a request to display these variables in the response preview or leak them through other means.
        - Indirect command injection: If the environment variable value is used in code snippet generation or other features, it could lead to command injection when the generated code is executed outside the extension.
        - Path traversal or other vulnerabilities depending on how the environment variable value is used.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The extension directly retrieves and displays the value of environment variables without sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization or validation for the values retrieved from `process.env` before using them in requests, code snippets, or other features.
    - Restricting the usage of `$processEnv` to only specific, safe contexts within the extension.
    - Clearly documenting the security risks of using `$processEnv` and advising users to be cautious when using environment variables in requests.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the user to use a crafted `.http` file that uses the `$processEnv` variable in a vulnerable way.
    - The vulnerability is triggered when the user sends a request that utilizes the `$processEnv` variable and the value is processed insecurely.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/utils/httpVariableProviders/systemVariableProvider.ts`
    - Function: `registerProcessEnvVariable()`

    ```typescript
    private registerProcessEnvVariable() {
        this.resolveFuncs.set(Constants.ProcessEnvVariableName, async name => {
            const groups = this.processEnvRegex.exec(name);
            if (groups !== null && groups.length === 3 ) {
                const [, refToggle, environmentVarName] = groups;
                let processEnvName = environmentVarName;
                if (refToggle !== undefined) { // This part handles environment variable references in settings, not direct command injection
                    processEnvName = await this.resolveSettingsEnvironmentVariable(environmentVarName);
                }
                const envValue = process.env[processEnvName]; // Directly access process.env without sanitization
                if (envValue !== undefined) {
                    return { value: envValue.toString() }; // Return the raw value
                } else {
                    return { value: '' };
                }
            }
            return { warning: ResolveWarningMessage.IncorrectProcessEnvVariableFormat };
        });
    }
    ```

    - The code directly accesses `process.env[processEnvName]` and returns the value without any sanitization or validation. This value is then substituted into the request, code snippet, or wherever the variable is used.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set an environment variable on your system (e.g., `MALICIOUS_VAR` with value `$(calc)` on Windows or `$(touch /tmp/pwned)` on Linux/macOS - note that `calc` and `touch` are just examples; more harmful commands could be used).
    2. Create a file `test_cmd_injection.http` in VSCode with the following content:
    ```http
    GET https://example.com
    X-Custom-Header: {{$processEnv MALICIOUS_VAR}}
    ```
    3. Send the request "Send Request" above `GET https://example.com`.
    4. Observe if the command injected via the environment variable is executed. In the example of `calc` on Windows, the calculator application might launch. In the `touch /tmp/pwned` example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created.

    **Note:** Direct command execution within the extension context might be restricted by VS Code. However, the vulnerability can still be demonstrated by observing side effects (like calculator launching or file creation) or by considering scenarios where the environment variable value is used in code snippet generation, which could then be copy-pasted and executed by the user, leading to command injection outside the extension's context.

### 3. Potential Arbitrary File System Access via `RequestBodyDocumentLinkProvider`

- Description:
    1. The `RequestBodyDocumentLinkProvider` allows users to use `< filepath` syntax to include file content as request body.
    2. It resolves relative file paths based on the workspace root or the current `.http` file's directory.
    3. If an attacker can influence the user to open a specially crafted `.http` file from a malicious workspace or a workspace containing symlinks or other path traversal vectors, they might be able to read arbitrary files on the user's system when the user clicks on the document link or sends a request using the crafted `.http` file.

- Impact:
    - High
    - An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the user's file system, depending on the permissions of the VS Code process. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure if the attacker can access files containing credentials, private keys, or other confidential data.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The code resolves relative paths based on workspace root or current file directory, which provides some level of sandboxing, but it might not be sufficient to prevent all path traversal attacks, especially with symlinks or carefully crafted relative paths.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Strict validation and sanitization of file paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
    - Restricting file access to only within the workspace or a designated safe directory.
    - Warning users about the potential security risks when opening `.http` files from untrusted sources.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious `.http` file within VS Code, ideally within a workspace controlled by the attacker or a workspace that contains symlinks or other path traversal vectors.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/providers/documentLinkProvider.ts`
    - Function: `normalizeLink(document: TextDocument, link: string, base: string)`

    ```typescript
    private normalizeLink(document: TextDocument, link: string, base: string): Uri {
        let resourcePath: Uri;
        if (path.isAbsolute(link)) {
            resourcePath = Uri.file(link);
        } else {
            let rootPath = getWorkspaceRootPath();
            if (rootPath) {
                rootPath = rootPath.replace(/\/?$/, '/');
                let resourcePathString = url.resolve(rootPath, link); // Resolves relative to workspace root
                if (!fs.existsSync(resourcePathString)) {
                    base = base.replace(/\/?$/, '/');
                    resourcePathString = url.resolve(base, link); // Fallback to resolve relative to current file dir
                }

                resourcePath = Uri.parse(resourcePathString);
            } else {
                base = base.replace(/\/?$/, '/');
                resourcePath = Uri.parse(url.resolve(base, link)); // Resolves relative to current file dir if no workspace root
            }
        }

        return Uri.parse(`command:rest-client._openDocumentLink?${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({ path: resourcePath }))}`);
    }
    ```

    - The `normalizeLink` function attempts to resolve relative paths against the workspace root and then the current file's directory. While it checks for file existence using `fs.existsSync`, it doesn't perform robust path sanitization to prevent traversal beyond intended directories.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a workspace and within it, create a malicious `.http` file (`malicious.http`) and a symlink named `malicious_symlink` pointing to a sensitive file outside the workspace (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux/macOS or `C:\Windows\win.ini` on Windows).
    2. Add the following content to `malicious.http`:
    ```http
    POST https://example.com
    Content-Type: text/plain

    < ./malicious_symlink
    ```
    3. Open `malicious.http` in VSCode within the created workspace.
    4. Click on the document link `./malicious_symlink` or send the request.
    5. Observe if the content of the linked file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\win.ini`) is displayed in the response preview, indicating arbitrary file system access.

    **Note:** The success of this test case might depend on VS Code's file system permissions and how it handles symlinks. However, it highlights the potential for path traversal vulnerabilities in the `RequestBodyDocumentLinkProvider`.
