### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Custom Icon Paths
* Description:
    1. An attacker can modify the VS Code settings for the Material Icon Theme, specifically the `material-icon-theme.files.associations` or `material-icon-theme.folders.associations` settings.
    2. Within these settings, the attacker can define a custom icon association that points to an SVG file path outside of the intended `extensions` directory. This can be achieved by using relative path traversal sequences like `../../`.
    3. When VS Code attempts to load and display the icons based on these user settings, it may traverse the file system to the attacker-specified path.
    4. If the attacker crafts a path that leads outside the intended directory (e.g., to a user's home directory or system files), the VS Code extension may attempt to load and potentially process files from these unintended locations.
* Impact:
    - **High Severity**: By exploiting path traversal, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files within the user's file system that the VS Code process has access to. While the extension itself might not directly expose the content of these files, the ability to read them via the extension represents a significant security risk. This is because VS Code extensions operate with the same permissions as the VS Code editor itself, which in turn runs with the user's permissions.
    - The attacker might be able to gather sensitive information by reading configuration files, source code, or other data outside the intended scope of the extension's functionality.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The documentation mentions a restriction: "the directory in which the custom icons are located must be within the `extensions` directory of the `.vscode` folder in the user directory." This is a documentation-level mitigation, not a code-level one. It relies on the user understanding and adhering to this restriction, which is not a reliable security control.
    - Source code analysis in `/code/src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts` and `/code/src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts` shows that `resolvePath` function uses `path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths)` which is intended to resolve paths relative to the extension's `dist` folder. However, this resolution happens *after* the user-provided path is already used in `getCustomIconPaths` to filter paths starting with `./` or `../`. This filtering suggests an attempt to handle relative paths, but it doesn't prevent traversal if a carefully crafted path is provided. There's no explicit sanitization or validation to prevent going outside the intended base directory.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Path Sanitization and Validation**: The extension is missing robust path sanitization and validation for custom icon paths. It should implement checks to ensure that resolved paths always remain within the intended `extensions` directory or a designated safe base path.
    - **Absolute Path Prevention**: The extension should prevent the usage of absolute paths in custom icon configurations. Only relative paths within a defined scope should be allowed.
    - **Path Traversal Sequence Blocking**: Implement checks to actively block and reject paths containing traversal sequences like `../` that could lead outside the allowed directories.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify the VS Code User Settings JSON, which is typically achievable if the attacker has compromised the user's environment or can trick the user into importing malicious settings. However, for an external attacker, it's more realistic to assume they can influence a user to open a workspace with malicious settings or use a configuration profile that includes such settings.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts`**
    ```typescript
    import { dirname } from 'node:path';
    import { resolvePath } from './resolvePath';

    export const getCustomIconPaths = (
      filesAssociations: Record<string, string> = {}
    ) => {
      return Object.values(filesAssociations)
        .filter((fileName) => fileName.match(/^[.\/]+/)) // <- custom dirs have a relative path to the dist folder
        .map((fileName) => dirname(resolvePath(fileName)));
    };
    ```
    This code snippet retrieves custom icon paths from file associations. The `filter` function checks if the `fileName` starts with `./` or `/`, which is intended to identify relative paths. However, it doesn't prevent path traversal using sequences like `../../`. The `map` function then uses `resolvePath` and `dirname`.

    2. **File: `/code/src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts`**
    ```typescript
    import { join } from 'node:path';

    /**
     * Resolves a sequence of path segments into an absolute path.
     *
     * @param paths - A list of path segments to be joined and resolved relative to the module's root directory.
     * @returns The resolved absolute path as a string.
     */
    export const resolvePath = (...paths: string[]): string => {
      return join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths);
    };
    ```
    The `resolvePath` function uses `path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths)` which is designed to resolve paths relative to the `dist` directory of the extension. While it aims to keep paths within the extension's scope, it doesn't validate or sanitize user inputs against path traversal attacks. The vulnerability arises because the initial path (potentially containing `../../`) from user settings is passed to these functions without prior validation, allowing the `join` function to resolve paths outside the intended directory.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Open VS Code.
    2. Open User Settings (JSON) by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and typing "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)".
    3. Add the following configuration to your User Settings JSON:
    ```json
    "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
        "test.txt": "../../../../test.svg"
    }
    ```
    **Note:** Ensure that you have a file named `test.svg` in a directory that is 4 levels up from the VS Code extensions directory (e.g., your user home directory). For testing purposes, this `test.svg` can be a simple SVG file. If you don't have such a file, you can create a simple one. For a safer test and to avoid reading potentially sensitive files, you can target a known, non-sensitive file outside the extension directory.
    4. Create a file named `test.txt` in any project folder opened in VS Code.
    5. Observe if VS Code attempts to load an icon. If VS Code tries to load an icon (even if it fails because `test.svg` doesn't exist or is not a valid SVG at the traversed path), it indicates a path traversal attempt.
    6. To confirm file reading, you can place a valid SVG file at the traversed location (`../../../../test.svg`) and check if VS Code loads and displays this icon for `test.txt` files. If it does, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.
    7. **Expected Result**: The extension should **not** load the custom icon from the path `../../../../test.svg`. Ideally, it should either reject the configuration with such paths or sanitize the path to prevent traversal outside of the allowed `extensions` directory. If the icon is loaded, the vulnerability is confirmed.
