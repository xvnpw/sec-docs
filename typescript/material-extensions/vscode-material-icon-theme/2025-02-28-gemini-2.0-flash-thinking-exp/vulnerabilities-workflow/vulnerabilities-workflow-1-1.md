### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Custom Icon Paths

- Description:
An external attacker can trigger a path traversal vulnerability by crafting a malicious workspace configuration that specifies a custom icon path pointing outside the intended extensions directory. This can be achieved by manipulating the `material-icon-theme.files.associations` or `material-icon-theme.folders.associations` settings in VS Code's settings.json. By using relative paths like `../../`, an attacker can potentially access and load arbitrary SVG files from the user's file system as icons within VS Code.

Steps to trigger:
1. Open VS Code.
2. Open User Settings (JSON) or Workspace Settings (JSON).
3. Add or modify the `material-icon-theme.files.associations` or `material-icon-theme.folders.associations` setting.
4. Set the value of an association to a path that traverses outside the allowed extensions directory, for example: `"material-icon-theme.files.associations": { "*.txt": "../../../../../sensitive-icon" }` or `"material-icon-theme.folders.associations": { "myfolder": "../../../../../sensitive-folder-icon" }`. Assuming `sensitive-icon.svg` or `folder-sensitive-folder-icon.svg` exists at the root level of the user's home directory.
5. Open a workspace or folder containing a file or folder that matches the created association (e.g., a `.txt` file or a folder named `myfolder`).
6. Observe if VS Code loads the icon from the attacker-controlled path.

- Impact:
An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the user's file system if they can control the content of SVG files and if VS Code extension loads and renders them. While direct arbitrary file reading is not confirmed in this code, path traversal itself is a security risk and can be a stepping stone to more severe vulnerabilities. In a real-world scenario, if the extension or VS Code has further vulnerabilities that can be chained, this path traversal could be part of a more complex attack. For example, if VS Code or the extension improperly handles SVG content, loading a malicious SVG could potentially lead to further exploits like cross-site scripting (XSS) if VS Code was rendering the SVG content in a webview (though not directly applicable to icon themes, but principle stands). Even without immediate arbitrary file read, control over displayed icons can be used for social engineering or subtle information gathering.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None. The code does not seem to validate or sanitize the custom icon paths provided by the user in the settings.

- Missing Mitigations:
Input validation and sanitization for custom icon paths are missing. The extension should:
    - Validate that the custom icon paths are within the allowed extension directories.
    - Sanitize paths to prevent traversal outside allowed directories.
    - Consider using VS Code API's path handling functions for security.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to install and activate the Material Icon Theme extension.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the user to open a workspace or folder and modify VS Code settings (User or Workspace settings). This can be done via social engineering, or if the attacker can somehow modify the user's workspace settings (less likely for external attacker).

- Source Code Analysis:
1. **`src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   import { dirname } from 'node:path';
   import { resolvePath } from './resolvePath';

   export const getCustomIconPaths = (
     filesAssociations: Record<string, string> = {}
   ) => {
     return Object.values(filesAssociations)
       .filter((fileName) => fileName.match(/^[.\/]+/)) // <- custom dirs have a relative path to the dist folder
       .map((fileName) => dirname(resolvePath(fileName)));
   };
   ```
   This code snippet in `getCustomIconPaths` function identifies potential custom icon paths by checking if the filename starts with `./` or `/`. It uses `resolvePath(fileName)` and `dirname()` to derive the directory path. However, `resolvePath` itself doesn't prevent path traversal; it resolves relative to the `dist` folder of the extension.

2. **`src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   import { join } from 'node:path';

   /**
    * Resolves a sequence of path segments into an absolute path.
    *
    * @param paths - A list of path segments to be joined and resolved relative to the module's root directory.
    * @returns The resolved absolute path as a string.
    */
   export const resolvePath = (...paths: string[]): string => {
     return join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths);
   };
   ```
   `resolvePath` uses `path.join` which, while handling path segments, does not inherently prevent path traversal if relative segments like `..` are provided as input. It simply constructs a path.

3. **`src/core/generator/fileGenerator.ts` and `src/core/generator/folderGenerator.ts`**:
    These files use `iconPath: `${iconFolderPath}${iconName}${appendix}${fileConfigHash}${ext}`` to construct icon paths in the manifest. `iconFolderPath` is defined as `'./../icons/'`.  When custom icon paths from user settings are incorporated, they are used in conjunction with `resolvePath` as seen in `getCustomIconPaths`. The extension then attempts to load these paths without further validation, leading to the vulnerability.

- Security Test Case:
1. **Setup Test Workspace:** Create a new folder for testing. Inside this folder, create a subfolder named `.vscode`. Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file. Also, create a text file (e.g., `test.txt`) in the root of the test folder.
2. **Modify Workspace Settings:** In the `settings.json` file, add the following configuration to exploit the path traversal vulnerability:
   ```json
   {
       "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
           "*.txt": "../../../../../tmp/test-icon"
       }
   }
   ```
   **Note:** For testing purposes, create a dummy SVG file named `test-icon.svg` (or any name matching your association) in the `/tmp/` directory of your system (or any location outside the expected extension directory). If `/tmp/test-icon.svg` does not exist, the test will still demonstrate path traversal attempt, though the icon will not load, proving the vulnerability.
3. **Open Workspace in VS Code:** Open the test folder in VS Code. Ensure the Material Icon Theme is activated.
4. **Verify Vulnerability:** Observe the icon associated with the `test.txt` file in the VS Code explorer.
   - **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** If the vulnerability exists, VS Code will attempt to load and display the icon from the path `../../../../../tmp/test-icon.svg` (resolved relative to the extension's `dist` folder). If `test-icon.svg` exists in `/tmp/`, it will be displayed as the icon for `test.txt`. If it doesn't exist, VS Code will likely show a default icon or an error, but you will have confirmed that the path traversal attempt is made.
   - **Expected Result (Mitigated):** If mitigated, the extension should either:
     - Not load any icon for `test.txt` (if invalid path is rejected).
     - Load a default icon, indicating the invalid path was ignored or sanitized.
     - Log an error, indicating path validation failure and preventing icon loading from the invalid path.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can use workspace settings to attempt to load arbitrary files as icons, confirming the path traversal vulnerability.
