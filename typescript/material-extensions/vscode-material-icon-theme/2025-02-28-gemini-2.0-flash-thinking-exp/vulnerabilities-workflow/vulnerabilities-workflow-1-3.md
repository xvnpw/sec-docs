### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Custom Icon Associations
- Description:
    1. The Material Icon Theme extension allows users to define custom file and folder icons by specifying paths to SVG files through the `material-icon-theme.files.associations` and `material-icon-theme.folders.associations` settings in VS Code's settings.json.
    2.  A user can configure these settings to associate specific file extensions or folder names with custom SVG icons.
    3.  When configuring these associations, the extension interprets relative paths provided in the settings as relative to the extension's `dist` folder.
    4.  However, the extension fails to adequately validate and restrict the resolved paths of these custom SVG icons to ensure they remain within a safe or intended directory, such as the `.vscode/extensions` directory where user extensions are typically stored.
    5.  A malicious user or attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious file association within the settings.json, using path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`) to point to arbitrary files on the user's file system.
    6.  When VS Code attempts to display an icon for a file or folder matching the malicious association, the extension will attempt to read the SVG file from the attacker-specified path.
    7.  Due to the lack of proper path validation, the extension could be tricked into reading arbitrary files outside of the intended scope, potentially exposing sensitive information to the attacker if they can somehow access the content read by the extension.
- Impact:
    - High - Arbitrary File Read: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the user's system that the VS Code process has access to. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including source code, configuration files, user data, or any other files accessible to the VS Code process.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Documentation suggests placing custom icons within `.vscode/extensions` directory, but this is not a technical mitigation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust path validation to restrict custom icon paths to a specific allowed directory (e.g., within the extension's directory or a designated safe user configuration directory under `.vscode/extensions`).
    - Sanitize and normalize user-provided paths to prevent path traversal attempts.
    - Before loading any custom SVG icon, verify that the resolved absolute path is within the allowed directory. If the path falls outside the permitted boundaries, the extension should refuse to load the icon and log an error.
- Preconditions:
    - The Material Icon Theme extension must be installed and activated.
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence a user to add a malicious custom file or folder association to their VS Code settings. This could be achieved through social engineering, by providing a malicious workspace configuration, or by other means of manipulating the user's settings.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. `File: /code/src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts`
    ```typescript
    import { dirname } from 'node:path';
    import { resolvePath } from './resolvePath';

    export const getCustomIconPaths = (
      filesAssociations: Record<string, string> = {}
    ) => {
      return Object.values(filesAssociations)
        .filter((fileName) => fileName.match(/^[.\/]+/)) // <- custom dirs have a relative path to the dist folder
        .map((fileName) => dirname(resolvePath(fileName)));
    };
    ```
    - The `getCustomIconPaths` function, responsible for processing custom icon paths, only filters for relative paths (starting with `./` or `../`) and resolves them relative to the extension's `dist` folder using `resolvePath`.
    - There is no code in this function, or elsewhere in the provided project files, that validates whether the resolved paths remain within the intended `.vscode/extensions` directory or any other restricted safe location.
    - The absence of path validation allows for path traversal vulnerabilities, as relative paths can be crafted to point outside the intended directory.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Install and activate the Material Icon Theme in VS Code.
        - Create a sensitive file (e.g., `sensitive.txt`) in your user's home directory (or any location outside of the `.vscode/extensions` directory, but accessible by VS Code process).
        - Create a workspace and open it in VS Code.
    2. **Configuration**:
        - Open VS Code settings (JSON) for the workspace or user settings.
        - Add the following malicious file association:
        ```json
        "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
            "malicious.file": "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../################################################################################"
        }
        ```
        Replace `"malicious.file"` with a file extension you can easily create and `"../../../../..."` with enough `../` to traverse out of the extension's expected directory and reach a known location like your home directory.
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability**:
        - Create a file named `test.malicious.file` in the workspace root.
        - Open the Explorer view in VS Code.
    4. **Observe**:
        - Observe if VS Code attempts to load an icon for `test.malicious.file`. While you might not visually see the content of `sensitive.txt` directly displayed, monitor for any errors or unusual behavior from the extension that might indicate it attempted to access the file.
        - To confirm arbitrary file read, you could modify the test to point to an image file outside the allowed directory and see if VS Code attempts to load and display it as an icon. Network monitoring could also be used to observe if the extension attempts to access the file system at the specified path.
    5. **Expected Result**:
        - Ideally, the extension should either:
            - Refuse to load the custom icon due to path traversal detection and log an error.
            - Or, if vulnerable, attempt to load and process the file `sensitive.txt`.

This test case demonstrates the potential for path traversal. A more robust test would involve setting up a controlled environment to precisely monitor file system access attempts by the extension when such malicious configurations are applied.
