### Vulnerability: Path Traversal in Custom Icon Paths

- **Description:**
    The Material Icon Theme extension for VS Code is vulnerable to a path traversal issue. This vulnerability arises from the way the extension handles custom icon paths specified by users in VS Code settings. Specifically, through the `material-icon-theme.files.associations` or `material-icon-theme.folders.associations` settings, users can define custom icons for specific file extensions or folder names.  An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious workspace or user configuration that includes a custom icon path pointing outside the intended extensions directory. This is achieved by using relative path traversal sequences like `../` within the icon path definition. When VS Code attempts to load and display icons based on these user settings, the extension resolves these paths without proper validation, potentially traversing the file system to attacker-specified locations.  This can lead to the extension attempting to load and process files, including SVG icons, from locations outside the expected extension directories, potentially accessing sensitive files on the user's system.

    Steps to trigger:
    1. Open VS Code.
    2. Open User Settings (JSON) or Workspace Settings (JSON).
    3. Add or modify the `material-icon-theme.files.associations` or `material-icon-theme.folders.associations` setting.
    4. Set the value of an association to a path that traverses outside the allowed extensions directory, for example:
        - For files: `"material-icon-theme.files.associations": { "*.txt": "../../../../../sensitive-icon" }`
        - For folders: `"material-icon-theme.folders.associations": { "myfolder": "../../../../../sensitive-folder-icon" }`
        Assuming `sensitive-icon.svg` or `folder-sensitive-folder-icon.svg` exists at a higher level directory in the user's file system (e.g., root of the user's home directory or `/tmp/`).
    5. Open a workspace or folder containing a file or folder that matches the created association (e.g., a `.txt` file or a folder named `myfolder`).
    6. Observe if VS Code attempts to load the icon from the attacker-controlled path. This might manifest as an attempt to load the icon or an error if the file is not a valid SVG or doesn't exist.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this path traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files from the user's file system. The VS Code process, and by extension, its extensions, operate with the user's permissions. By controlling the paths from which the Material Icon Theme attempts to load icons, an attacker can potentially force the extension to read files that the VS Code process has access to.  While direct arbitrary file reading to display file content within the extension is not the primary impact, the ability to read files via the extension represents a high security risk. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, user data, or any other files accessible to the VS Code process.  Even without immediate arbitrary file read confirmation, the path traversal itself is a significant security flaw and could be a stepping stone for more complex attacks if chained with other vulnerabilities in VS Code or the extension. Control over displayed icons could also be used for social engineering or subtle information gathering.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    Currently, there are no effective code-level mitigations implemented within the Material Icon Theme extension to prevent this path traversal vulnerability. Documentation mentions a recommendation to place custom icons within the `.vscode/extensions` directory, but this is merely a guideline and not enforced by the extension's code.  Source code analysis reveals that while the `resolvePath` function is intended to resolve paths relative to the extension's `dist` folder, it does not sanitize or validate user-provided paths to prevent traversal outside intended boundaries. The filtering in `getCustomIconPaths` for paths starting with `./` or `/` is insufficient to prevent path traversal using sequences like `../../`. Therefore, the extension relies on user adherence to security best practices, which is not a reliable mitigation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    To effectively mitigate this path traversal vulnerability, the following mitigations are missing and should be implemented:
    - **Robust Path Sanitization and Validation:** Implement thorough input validation and sanitization for custom icon paths provided in user settings. The extension must ensure that resolved paths always remain within a designated safe base directory, such as the extension's own directory within `.vscode/extensions` or a specific user configuration directory.
    - **Path Traversal Sequence Blocking:** Actively detect and block path traversal sequences like `../` in user-provided paths. Reject or sanitize paths containing these sequences to prevent attempts to navigate outside allowed directories.
    - **Absolute Path Prevention:** Disallow the use of absolute paths in custom icon configurations. Only relative paths within a defined and secure scope should be permitted.
    - **Path Normalization and Canonicalization:** Normalize and canonicalize paths to resolve symbolic links and redundant separators, making path validation more robust and consistent.
    - **VS Code API Path Handling:** Consider utilizing VS Code's built-in API for path handling and resource management, if available, as these APIs may offer built-in security features and validation mechanisms.
    - **Directory Restriction Enforcement:** Before attempting to load any custom SVG icon, programmatically verify that the resolved absolute path is strictly within the allowed directory. If the path falls outside of these boundaries, the extension should refuse to load the icon and log a security error or warning.

- **Preconditions:**
    To exploit this vulnerability, the following preconditions must be met:
    - **Material Icon Theme Installation:** The user must have the Material Icon Theme extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - **Settings Modification Capability:** An attacker needs a way to influence or modify the user's VS Code settings, specifically either User Settings or Workspace Settings JSON files. This could be achieved through:
        - **Social Engineering:** Tricking the user into manually adding a malicious configuration to their settings.
        - **Malicious Workspace Configuration:** Providing a workspace with pre-configured malicious settings that the user opens.
        - **Compromised Environment:** If the attacker has already compromised the user's system, they might directly modify the settings files.
    - For an external attacker, influencing a user to open a workspace with malicious settings or to manually add a malicious configuration is the most likely attack vector.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import { dirname } from 'node:path';
        import { resolvePath } from './resolvePath';

        export const getCustomIconPaths = (
          filesAssociations: Record<string, string> = {}
        ) => {
          return Object.values(filesAssociations)
            .filter((fileName) => fileName.match(/^[.\/]+/)) // <- custom dirs have a relative path to the dist folder
            .map((fileName) => dirname(resolvePath(fileName)));
        };
        ```
        - This function `getCustomIconPaths` processes the `filesAssociations` or `foldersAssociations` from the settings. It attempts to identify custom paths by filtering filenames that start with `./` or `/`, intending to handle relative paths.
        - It then uses `resolvePath(fileName)` to resolve the path relative to the extension's `dist` folder and extracts the directory name using `dirname()`.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** The filtering logic is weak and doesn't prevent path traversal.  It only checks if the path *starts* with a relative path indicator, but does not prevent inclusion of `../` sequences within the path that can traverse upwards. There's no validation to ensure the resolved path stays within a safe directory.

    2. **`src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import { join } from 'node:path';

        /**
         * Resolves a sequence of path segments into an absolute path.
         *
         * @param paths - A list of path segments to be joined and resolved relative to the module's root directory.
         * @returns The resolved absolute path as a string.
         */
        export const resolvePath = (...paths: string[]): string => {
          return join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths);
        };
        ```
        - The `resolvePath` function uses `path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths)`.  `path.join` itself does not prevent path traversal; it simply resolves and joins path segments. If the input `paths` contains traversal sequences like `../../`, `path.join` will resolve them accordingly, potentially leading outside the intended directory.
        - **Vulnerability Point:** This function does not perform any sanitization or validation to restrict paths. It blindly joins the provided path segments, including user-controlled segments from settings, making it susceptible to path traversal attacks.

    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Test Environment:**
        - Install and activate the Material Icon Theme extension in VS Code.
        - Create a test workspace folder.
        - Inside the test workspace, create a subfolder named `.vscode` and within it, create a `settings.json` file.
        - Create a test file, e.g., `test.txt`, in the root of the test workspace.
        - For testing arbitrary file access, optionally create a dummy SVG file named `test-icon.svg` in your `/tmp/` directory (or another location outside the expected extension directory but accessible by VS Code). This is for demonstration; avoid using sensitive files for testing.

    2. **Configure Malicious Workspace Settings:**
        - Open the `settings.json` file within the `.vscode` folder.
        - Add the following configuration to exploit the path traversal vulnerability:
            ```json
            {
                "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
                    "*.txt": "../../../../../tmp/test-icon"
                }
            }
            ```
            Adjust the number of `../` segments as needed to traverse to a desired location outside the extension directory.

    3. **Open Workspace and Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open the test workspace folder in VS Code.
        - Ensure the Material Icon Theme is active.
        - Observe the icon associated with the `test.txt` file in the VS Code Explorer.

    4. **Verify Vulnerability:**
        - **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** VS Code will attempt to load an icon from the path `../../../../../tmp/test-icon.svg` (resolved relative to the extension's `dist` folder).
            - If `test-icon.svg` exists in `/tmp/`, it might be displayed as the icon for `test.txt`. This confirms successful path traversal and potential arbitrary file read (in this case, loading an SVG).
            - Even if `test-icon.svg` does not exist, observing network requests or file access attempts at the traversed path would still indicate the vulnerability is present. Look for errors related to loading the icon from the traversed path in the developer console (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools).

        - **Expected Result (Mitigated - if mitigations were in place):**
            - The extension should either:
                - Not load any icon for `test.txt` (indicating the invalid path was rejected).
                - Load a default or fallback icon, signifying the invalid path was ignored or sanitized.
                - Log an error message (e.g., in the VS Code developer console or extension logs) indicating a path validation failure and preventing icon loading from the invalid path.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can leverage workspace settings to attempt to load arbitrary files as icons, effectively confirming the path traversal vulnerability.
