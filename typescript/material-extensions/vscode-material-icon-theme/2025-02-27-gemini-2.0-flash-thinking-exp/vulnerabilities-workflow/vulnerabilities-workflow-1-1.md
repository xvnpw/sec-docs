### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Improper Path Validation in Custom SVG Icons leading to Local File Read (within `.vscode/extensions`)

- Description:
    1. The Material Icon Theme allows users to specify custom SVG icons for files and folders through configuration settings (`material-icon-theme.files.associations` and `material-icon-theme.folders.associations`).
    2. According to the documentation, the path to the custom SVG file is specified relative to the extension's `dist` folder.
    3. The documentation states that the custom icon directory must be within the `extensions` directory of the `.vscode` folder in the user directory.
    4. If the extension does not properly validate and sanitize the provided paths in the settings, an attacker might be able to use relative path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`, `..\/`) within the `.vscode/extensions` directory to access and load SVG files from locations they should not have access to.
    5. While the access is restricted within the `.vscode/extensions` directory, an attacker could potentially read sensitive files placed by other extensions within the same directory or exploit vulnerabilities in how VS Code handles SVG rendering if a malicious SVG is loaded.

- Impact:
    - Local File Read (within `.vscode/extensions`): An attacker could potentially read files within the `.vscode/extensions` directory by crafting a malicious path in the custom icon settings.
    - Information Disclosure: Sensitive information from other extensions or VS Code configuration within the `.vscode/extensions` directory could be disclosed if readable files are accessed.
    - Potential for further exploitation: If a malicious SVG is crafted and loaded, it could potentially lead to further vulnerabilities depending on VS Code's SVG rendering engine and any vulnerabilities present there.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the documentation, the only mentioned mitigation is a restriction that custom icons must be located within the `.vscode/extensions` directory. There is no mention of input validation or sanitization of the paths provided in the settings. It is unclear from the documentation if there is any active mitigation against path traversal.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension should strictly validate and sanitize the paths provided in the settings for custom SVG icons to prevent path traversal attempts. This should include:
        - Validating that the path is indeed within the allowed `.vscode/extensions` directory.
        - Preventing usage of path traversal sequences like `../` and `..\/`.
        - Using secure path handling functions to resolve and normalize paths.

- Preconditions:
    1. The attacker needs to be able to influence the user's VS Code settings. This can be achieved if the attacker can convince the user to:
        - Install a malicious VS Code extension that modifies the user settings to include malicious custom icon paths targeting Material Icon Theme settings.
        - Manually edit user settings (`settings.json`) to include malicious custom icon paths.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: /code/README.md** and **File: /code/CONTRIBUTING.md**:
        - These files describe the feature of custom SVG icons and mention the directory restriction: "However, the restriction applies that the directory in which the custom icons are located must be within the `extensions` directory of the `.vscode` folder in the user directory." and "This directory has to be somewhere inside of the `.vscode/extensions` folder."
        - There is no mention of input validation or security considerations in these files.
        - Example settings provided use relative paths like `"../../icons/sample"` and "../../../../icons/folder-sample", which if not properly validated, could be manipulated for path traversal.
    - **File: /code/src/core/generator/fileGenerator.ts** and **File: /code/src/core/generator/languageGenerator.ts**:
        - These files use the function `getCustomIcons` to process custom icon associations from the configuration.
        - The `getCustomIcons` function (and related `getCustomIconPaths` function, not directly in provided files but used in `iconSaturation.ts` and `iconOpacity.ts`) needs to be further analyzed to understand how it handles and validates the paths provided in user settings.
        - If `getCustomIconPaths` doesn't implement proper path validation and sanitization, it could be vulnerable to path traversal as described.
    - **File: /code/src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts**:
        - This file contains the `getCustomIconPaths` function which is responsible for processing custom icon paths from user settings.
        - The function `getCustomIconPaths` extracts icon paths from `filesAssociations` and filters paths that appear to be relative (starting with `./` or `../`).
        - It then uses `resolvePath(fileName)` to resolve these paths.
    - **File: /code/src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts**:
        - This file contains the `resolvePath` function, which is used by `getCustomIconPaths` to resolve paths.
        - The `resolvePath` function uses `join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths)` to resolve paths relative to the directory of the `resolvePath.ts` module itself (which is within the extension's source code directory, likely under `src/core/helpers` after compilation).
        - Crucially, `resolvePath` does **not** resolve paths relative to the extension's `dist` folder or the `.vscode/extensions` directory as might be intended or documented. It resolves paths relative to the extension's source code location.
        - This incorrect path resolution, combined with the lack of sanitization in `getCustomIconPaths`, allows path traversal within the `.vscode/extensions` directory when a user provides a malicious relative path in the custom icon settings. The comment `// <- custom dirs have a relative path to the dist folder` in `getCustomIconPaths` is misleading and does not reflect the actual path resolution logic.
    - **File: /code/src/core/generator/iconSaturation.ts** and **File: /code/src/core/generator/iconOpacity.ts**:
        - These files demonstrate the usage of `getCustomIconPaths` in `setIconSaturation` and `setIconOpacity` functions.
        - Both `setIconSaturation` and `setIconOpacity` functions retrieve custom icon paths using `getCustomIconPaths(filesAssociations)`.
        - They then iterate through these paths and use `readdir(iconPath)` to read the contents of the directories specified by the potentially user-controlled paths.
        - Subsequently, they call `processSVGFileForSaturation` and `processSVGFile` respectively, which read SVG files using `readFile(svgFilePath, 'utf-8')` based on the paths derived from user settings.
        - This confirms that the extension reads files and directories based on user-provided paths without proper validation, making it vulnerable to path traversal within the `.vscode/extensions` directory.
    - **File: /code/src/core/tests/icons/cloning.test.ts**, **File: /code/src/core/tests/icons/data/icons.ts**:
        - These files are related to icon cloning and color manipulation, and do not directly address path handling or validation. They provide context on how icons are processed (SVG parsing and manipulation), but don't reveal any information about custom icon path handling.
    - **File: /code/src/core/helpers/object.test.ts**, **File: /code/src/core/tests/mocks/vscode.ts**, **File: /code/src/core/tests/mocks/index.ts**, **File: /code/src/core/i18n/translate.ts**, **File: /code/src/core/i18n/translations/...ts**, **File: /code/src/core/models/...ts**, **File: /code/src/core/logging/logger.ts**:
        - These files cover testing utilities, i18n functionalities, data models, and logging. They are not directly related to the custom icon path handling and validation logic.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Install the Material Icon Theme extension in VS Code.
    2. Open VS Code settings (JSON) and add the following configuration to `settings.json` to associate a file extension with a custom icon path using path traversal:

```json
"material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
    "test.txt": "../../test.svg"
}
```

    3. Create a folder named `test_extension` inside the `.vscode/extensions` directory in your user home directory (if it doesn't exist already).
    4. Inside the `test_extension` folder, create another folder named `icons`.
    5. Inside the `icons` folder, place a file named `test.svg`. This is a dummy SVG icon file.
    6. In the same `test_extension` folder (alongside `icons`), create a file named `sensitive.txt` with some sensitive content (e.g., "This is a sensitive file.").
    7. Now, create a file named `test.txt` in any workspace folder opened in VS Code.
    8. Observe if the icon for `test.txt` is loaded, and if the extension attempts to read the file at the path `../../test.svg` relative to the extension's `dist` folder.
    9. To verify if local file read is possible, try to modify the path in `settings.json` to point to the `sensitive.txt` file created earlier:

```json
"material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
    "test.txt": "../../sensitive.txt"
}
```

    10. Create or open `test.txt` again and check if VS Code attempts to load `sensitive.txt` as an icon. While it might not render as a valid icon, observe for any errors or behavior indicating file access.
    11. If the extension successfully loads the `test.svg` icon using the relative path and attempts to access `sensitive.txt`, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.
