## High-Risk Vulnerabilities in VSCode Extension

- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Custom SVG Icon Associations
  - **Description:**
    An attacker who is able to influence the extension’s configuration—for example, by supplying a malicious settings file or compromising an update—may define custom icon associations with file paths that include directory‑traversal segments (e.g. `"../../../../etc/passwd"`). The extension delegates path construction to helper routines. In `/code/src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts` the function simply concatenates `__dirname` with user‑supplied segments via `path.join()` without sanitization, and similar logic is used via functions such as `getCustomIconPaths` in `/code/src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts`.
    Furthermore, the same unsanitized input is later passed into manifest generation (as seen in `/code/src/extension/tools/changeDetection.ts` when resolving the manifest’s absolute path) and other file‑processing routines (for example in `/code/src/core/generator/shared/svg.ts`). In every case the extension does not verify that the constructed paths remain within safe directories.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker may force the extension to read from or write to arbitrary files on the host filesystem. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive files or—when combined with other weaknesses—arbitrary file write that might eventually result in system compromise.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - User guides instruct that custom icon associations be placed only in approved directories.
    - Basic path construction is performed using Node’s `path.join()`, which on its own does not remove directory‑traversal sequences.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No runtime sanitization or normalization is applied to all configuration‑supplied path segments.
    - There is no whitelist or bounds check to ensure that computed paths remain within the designated safe folders.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to inject or supply a configuration (e.g. via a malicious settings file or compromised update) that specifies icon associations with specially crafted file paths.
    - The user must load or accept the supplied configuration.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts`, the function joins directory segments directly:
      - It uses `path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths)` without filtering out `../` sequences.
    - In `/code/src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts`, user‑provided file associations are accepted (after a weak regex filter) and then passed without further sanitization.
    - In `/code/src/core/generator/shared/svg.ts` and in `/code/src/extension/tools/changeDetection.ts`, these unsanitized paths are used to determine locations for writing SVG manifest files, thereby propagating the risk.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prepare a configuration file (or update an existing settings file) that defines a custom SVG icon association with a malicious path such as `"../../../../etc/passwd"`.
    2. Load this configuration in the extension (for example, by triggering an update or configuration change that invokes the icon manifest generation).
    3. Monitor the resolved file paths (via logs or debug output) to determine whether the paths escape the intended safe directory.
    4. Verify on the host filesystem that the extension is not restricting file accesses to the permitted folder.

- **Vulnerability Name:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in SVG Parsing
  - **Description:**
    The extension reads and parses SVG files (used for default icons and when processing custom clones) by sending their contents to the `svgson` parser as observed in `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloning.ts` and `/code/src/core/generator/shared/svg.ts`. If an attacker supplies an SVG file containing a malicious DOCTYPE or external entity declarations, and if the underlying parser resolves external entities by default, then external (or local) resources may be loaded during parsing.
  - **Impact:**
    - **Confidentiality:** Sensitive local files or external resources may be disclosed if external entities are resolved during parsing.
    - **Integrity:** Malformed or malicious SVG content could disrupt the icon generation process or yield error messages that expose internal details.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension assumes that any supplied (including custom) SVG files are “clean” and come from trusted sources.
    - No pre‑parsing sanitization (e.g. removal of DOCTYPE declarations) is performed before handing the SVG to `svgson`.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no explicit configuration setting to disable resolution of external entities in `svgson` or a pre‑processing step to remove such XML constructs.
    - Input validation on SVG files to strip dangerous XML markup is absent.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply an SVG file that includes a DOCTYPE with external entity declarations (for example, via a compromised asset update or by influencing custom icon files).
    - The extension must process this malicious SVG file during its icon generation or clone processing routines.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloning.ts`, the function `cloneIcon` reads an SVG file and passes its content directly to the `parse()` function from the `svgson` library.
    - No sanitization of the SVG content is performed prior to parsing, which means that an SVG containing malicious XML can trigger external entity resolution.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious SVG file that contains a DOCTYPE with an external entity declaration (for example, referencing a sensitive file like `/etc/shadow`).
    2. Configure the extension (or supply a custom icon) to use this malicious SVG file.
    3. Trigger the icon generation routine (for instance, by invoking the clone generation command).
    4. Observe logs or error messages to detect if the external entity is resolved or if unexpected content is fetched, thus confirming the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Write through Insecure Custom Clone Configurations
  - **Description:**
    The extension permits users to define “custom clones” (variants of a base icon) through clone configurations. In routines such as those in `/code/src/core/generator/clones/clonesGenerator.ts`, `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloneData.ts`, and `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloning.ts`, the user‑provided clone name (typically supplied via the `name` field) is incorporated into file paths via simple string concatenation and `path.join()` without adequate sanitization. If an attacker supplies a clone name containing directory‑traversal sequences (for example, `"../../evil"`), the resolved path may escape the intended clones folder and lead to overwriting or creating files in arbitrary locations.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker may cause the extension to write files outside the designated icon directory. This arbitrary file write can result in unintended file overwrites or, when chained with other vulnerabilities, pave the way for remote code execution or system compromise.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The documentation instructs users to follow safe practices when configuring clone names.
    - There is no code‐based filtering or sanitization applied in functions such as those in `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloneData.ts` or `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloning.ts`.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The clone name (and related fields) are not validated at runtime to strip dangerous characters (such as `"../"`) before being used in file path construction.
    - There is no check after path construction to ensure the resulting path lies within an approved directory.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to inject a malicious clone configuration (for instance, via a modified settings file or a compromised update).
    - The end user must load this configuration so that the clone‐generation routines are triggered.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloneData.ts`, helper functions (e.g. `getIconName`) construct the clone name by concatenating the user‑provided value with fixed strings—without sanitizing against directory‑traversal characters.
    - The unsanitized clone name is then handed off to functions that use Node’s `path.join()`, which only normalizes the path but does not remove dangerous segments.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled test environment, create a custom clone configuration (via a settings file) that specifies a clone name like `"../../evil"`.
    2. Load this configuration into the extension and trigger the clone‐generation process (for example, by executing the relevant clone command).
    3. Inspect the filesystem to determine if a file has been written outside the intended clones folder (e.g., checking for file paths containing `"../../evil"`).
    4. Confirm that the content generated corresponds to the clone process’s output.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prototype Pollution via Recursive Object Merge Function
  - **Description:**
    The extension relies on a shared helper function `merge` (found in `/code/src/core/helpers/object.ts`) to recursively combine configuration objects—for example, when applying default configuration via `padWithDefaultConfig` (in `/code/src/core/generator/config/defaultConfig.ts`) and during manifest generation in `/code/src/extension/tools/changeDetection.ts` and `/code/src/extension/shared/config.ts`. The `merge` function iterates over all keys in the objects and assigns values to the accumulator without filtering out dangerous keys such as `__proto__` or `constructor`. This unsanitized merging process means that an attacker who can supply a configuration object containing these “magic” keys may pollute the prototype of global objects.
  - **Impact:**
    Prototype pollution can allow an attacker to tamper with global object properties. This can lead to bypassing internal security checks, altering key functionality within the extension, and—in extreme cases—enabling arbitrary code execution, revealing sensitive data, or further compromising the system.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The merge function in `/code/src/core/helpers/object.ts` processes all keys provided by `Object.keys()` and makes no attempt to filter or reject reserved keys.
    - The extension presumes that configuration files (and other inputs) are well‑formed and come from trusted sources.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no filtering or sanitization to remove or reject dangerous keys (for example, `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"`) before merging configuration objects.
    - A safer merge routine should explicitly check and disallow modifications to an object’s prototype.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply or inject a configuration object (for example, via a malicious settings file or a compromised update) that includes dangerous keys like `"__proto__"`.
    - The extension must later merge this configuration with its defaults using the vulnerable merge function.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/src/core/helpers/object.ts`, the `merge` function iterates over each key of every object and assigns the value directly to the accumulator without checking if the key is reserved.
    - This function is invoked in multiple parts of the codebase—including in `/code/src/core/generator/config/defaultConfig.ts`, `/code/src/extension/shared/config.ts`, and `/code/src/extension/tools/changeDetection.ts`—so that any pollution will have pervasive effects throughout the runtime.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prepare a malicious configuration file containing an entry such as:
       ```json
       {
         "__proto__": {
           "polluted": "yes"
         }
       }
       ```
    2. Load this configuration into the extension (for example, by updating user settings that are later merged with the default configuration).
    3. After the merge occurs (e.g. via an in‑console evaluation), inspect a plain object by running `({}).polluted`.
    4. If the output is `"yes"`, it confirms that the prototype has been polluted via the merge function.
    5. Remove the dangerous key from the configuration and verify that no pollution occurs.
