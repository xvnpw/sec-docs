### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Directory Traversal in Custom Icon Paths

- Description:
  1. An attacker can modify the user settings for the Material Icon Theme to include a malicious custom icon association in `material-icon-theme.files.associations` or `material-icon-theme.folders.associations`.
  2. In the user settings, the attacker provides a file association with an icon path that uses directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to point outside the intended `extensions` directory within the `.vscode` folder.
  3. The documentation suggests that custom icons should be within the `extensions` directory, but this is not enforced by the code.
  4. When VS Code attempts to display an icon based on this association, the extension uses the provided path to load the SVG icon.
  5. Due to insufficient validation and lack of sanitization of user-provided paths, the extension might traverse the directory structure outside the intended scope and attempt to read arbitrary files from the user's file system, depending on VS Code's file access permissions in extensions.
  6. If VS Code extension process has enough permissions, this could lead to information disclosure if the attacker crafts a path to a sensitive file like `/etc/passwd` (on Linux/macOS) or sensitive configuration files (e.g., `win.ini` on Windows).

- Impact:
  Information Disclosure. An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the user's system if the VS Code extension process has sufficient file system permissions. This could expose sensitive information like configuration files, credentials, source code, user documents, or other user data, depending on the attacker's path and the system's file permissions.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  None. The code only checks if the path starts with `./` or `../` to identify custom paths but doesn't validate if the path stays within the intended `extensions` directory. The documentation mentions a restriction, but it's not enforced by code.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Path validation: Implement robust path validation to ensure that custom icon paths are strictly limited to a specific directory within the extension's context (e.g., within the `extensions` directory of the `.vscode` folder). Use path canonicalization to resolve symbolic links and prevent traversal attempts.
  - Input sanitization: Sanitize user-provided paths to remove or neutralize directory traversal sequences like `../` and `..\/`.
  - Sandboxing or isolation: Ensure the extension operates with minimal file system permissions to limit the impact of potential directory traversal vulnerabilities. VS Code extension security policies should be reviewed and applied.

- Preconditions:
  1. The user must have the Material Icon Theme extension installed in VS Code.
  2. The attacker needs to be able to influence the user to add a malicious configuration to their VS Code `settings.json` file. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising a workspace configuration that the user loads.

- Source Code Analysis:
  1. File: `/code/src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts`
     ```typescript
     import { dirname } from 'node:path';
     import { resolvePath } from './resolvePath';

     export const getCustomIconPaths = (
       filesAssociations: Record<string, string> = {}
     ) => {
       return Object.values(filesAssociations)
         .filter((fileName) => fileName.match(/^[.\/]+/)) // <- custom dirs have a relative path to the dist folder
         .map((fileName) => dirname(resolvePath(fileName)));
     };
     ```
     - The `getCustomIconPaths` function extracts custom icon paths from `filesAssociations` (and similarly from `foldersAssociations`, although not explicitly shown in this code snippet, the logic applies to both).
     - It uses a regex `fileName.match(/^[.\/]+/)` to filter paths that start with `./` or `../`, considering them as relative paths intended for custom icons.
     - It then uses `dirname(resolvePath(fileName))` to resolve the path relative to the extension's `dist` folder.
     - **Vulnerability:** The validation is insufficient. It only checks if the path *starts* with `.` or `/` but does not prevent directory traversal beyond the intended directory. It does not enforce that the resolved path stays within the allowed `.vscode/extensions` directory.

  2. File: `/code/src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts`
     ```typescript
     import { join } from 'node:path';

     /**
      * Resolves a sequence of path segments into an absolute path.
      *
      * @param paths - A list of path segments to be joined and resolved relative to the module's root directory.
      * @returns The resolved absolute path as a string.
      */
     export const resolvePath = (...paths: string[]): string => {
       return join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths);
     };
     ```
     - This function uses `path.join` which, while designed for path manipulation, doesn't inherently prevent path traversal vulnerabilities if user input is not validated.
     - The `resolvePath` function simply joins the paths with `__dirname`, `..`, `..`, and the user-provided path without any sanitization or validation.
     - **Vulnerability:** The lack of validation before using `path.join` allows for path traversal if a malicious path like `../../../sensitive/file.svg` is provided as part of `paths`.

  3. File: `/code/src/core/generator/shared/svg.ts`
     ```typescript
     import { join } from 'node:path';
     import { resolvePath } from '../../helpers/resolvePath';
     import { writeToFile } from '../../helpers/writeFile';
     import { logger } from '../../logging/logger';
     import { iconFolderPath } from '../constants';
     import { updateSVGOpacity } from '../iconOpacity';
     import { adjustSVGSaturation } from '../iconSaturation';

     export const writeSVGFiles = async (
       iconName: string,
       svg: string,
       opacity: number,
       saturation: number
     ) => {
       // Update the opacity and saturation of the SVG
       const updatedOpacity = updateSVGOpacity(svg, opacity);
       const updatedSaturation = adjustSVGSaturation(updatedOpacity, saturation);

       const iconsPath = resolvePath(iconFolderPath);
       const iconsFolderPath = join(iconsPath, `${iconName}.svg`);
       try {
         await writeToFile(iconsFolderPath, updatedSaturation);
       } catch (error) {
         logger.error(error);
       }
     };
     ```
     - This file shows how `resolvePath` is used in the context of writing SVG files. While this specific usage is for internal extension paths (`iconFolderPath`), it highlights the reliance on `resolvePath`. When custom icon paths are used via `filesAssociations` or `foldersAssociations`, the same vulnerable `resolvePath` function is called with user-provided paths without any validation, confirming that user-provided paths are directly used in file system operations, leading to the path traversal vulnerability.

     #### Custom SVG icons

     It's possible to add custom icons by adding a path to an SVG file which is located relative to the extension's dist folder. However, the restriction applies that the directory in which the custom icons are located must be within the `extensions` directory of the `.vscode` folder in the user directory.

     ...

     ```json
     "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
         "fileName.ts": "../../icons/sample"
     }
     ```
     - The documentation incorrectly suggests a restriction on the custom icon path location, stating it must be within the `extensions` directory. However, this restriction is not enforced by the code, creating a false sense of security for users and developers relying on the documentation.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Open VS Code with the Material Icon Theme extension activated.
  2. Open the User Settings (JSON) in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` and type "Open Settings (JSON)").
  3. Add the following configuration to your `settings.json` to create a malicious file association (replace `/path/to/icon` with `..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/etc/passwd` for Linux/macOS or similar sensitive file for Windows like `..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/`..`/Windows/win.ini` or use a very long traversal string like `..`/`..`/`...` repeated many times):
     ```json
     "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
         "test_file_traversal.txt": "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"
     }
     ```
     Alternatively, test folder associations as well:
     ```json
     "material-icon-theme.folders.associations": {
         "test_folder_traversal": "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"
     }
     ```
  4. For file association test, create a new file named `test_file_traversal.txt` in your workspace. For folder association test, create a new folder named `test_folder_traversal` in your workspace and open it in VS Code explorer.
  5. Observe if VS Code attempts to load an icon. In a vulnerable scenario, the extension might try to read the `/etc/passwd` file (or `win.ini` on Windows) when rendering the icon for `test_file_traversal.txt` or the folder `test_folder_traversal`.
  6. **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** If the extension is vulnerable, and if VS Code extension process has sufficient permissions, no error might be immediately visible in VS Code UI, but in an actual attack scenario, the extension would have attempted to read the contents of `/etc/passwd` or `win.ini`. You might observe errors in the extension's logs if logging is enabled, or by monitoring file system access.
  7. **Expected Result (Mitigated):** If the vulnerability is mitigated, the extension should either:
     - Refuse to load the custom icon and potentially log an error due to invalid path.
     - Successfully load a default icon without attempting directory traversal.
     - Throw an error and prevent the extension from activating or functioning correctly if secure path handling is enforced strictly during extension initialization.
