## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified vulnerabilities after combining and deduplicating information from the provided lists.

### 1. Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Custom SVG Icon Paths

- **Description:**
    1. The Material Icon Theme extension allows users to customize file and folder icons by specifying custom SVG files through configuration settings like `material-icon-theme.files.associations` and `material-icon-theme.folders.associations` in `settings.json`.
    2. Users can define paths to custom SVG files, intended to be relative to the extension's `dist` folder or within the `.vscode/extensions` directory.
    3. An attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious paths within these settings, using path traversal sequences such as `../` or `..\/`.
    4. When VS Code attempts to display an icon for a file or folder matching a malicious association, the extension may attempt to load the SVG icon from the attacker-controlled path. This involves operations like reading file content to apply saturation or opacity using functions like `setIconSaturation` and `setIconOpacity`, or during manifest generation and other file-processing routines.
    5. Due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the provided paths, the extension may not properly restrict file access to the intended directories within `.vscode/extensions`. This can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities, potentially allowing access to files and directories outside the intended scope.
    6. Code analysis reveals that functions like `getCustomIconPaths` in `/code/src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts` and `resolvePath` in `/code/src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts` are involved in processing these paths. `resolvePath` uses `path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths)` without sanitization, and `getCustomIconPaths` has a weak regex filter that is insufficient to prevent path traversal. Functions like `setIconSaturation`, `setIconOpacity`, and `renameIconFiles` then use these potentially malicious paths for file system operations like `readdir`, `readFile`, `readdirSync`, and `renameSync`.

- **Impact:**
    - **Local File Read (within `.vscode/extensions` and potentially beyond):** An attacker could read files within the `.vscode/extensions` directory and potentially traverse further to read arbitrary files on the host filesystem that the VS Code process has access to.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information from other extensions, VS Code configuration, or arbitrary files could be disclosed if readable files are accessed.
    - **Potential for further exploitation:** If a malicious SVG or other file type is accessed and processed, it could potentially lead to further vulnerabilities, depending on how VS Code or the extension handles the file content. In the case of reading arbitrary files (not SVG), the impact is primarily information disclosure.
    - **Arbitrary File Write (manifest generation and clone processing):** Unsanitized paths are also used during manifest generation and clone processing, potentially leading to arbitrary file write if combined with other vulnerabilities or configuration manipulation.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Documentation mentions that custom icons should be located within the `.vscode/extensions` directory.
    - Basic path construction uses Node's `path.join()`, which alone does not prevent directory traversal.
    - A weak regex filter `fileName.match(/^[.\/]+/)` in `getCustomIconPaths` attempts to identify relative paths but is insufficient to prevent path traversal.
    - User guides instruct that custom icon associations be placed only in approved directories.
    - The extension assumes that any supplied (including custom) SVG files are “clean” and come from trusted sources.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation and sanitization:**  Strict validation and sanitization of paths provided in settings for custom SVG icons is missing. This should include:
        - Validating that the resolved path is strictly within the allowed `.vscode/extensions` directory or a designated safe folder within it.
        - Preventing the use of path traversal sequences like `../` and `..\/`.
        - Using secure path handling functions to resolve and normalize paths, ensuring they remain within the intended directory.
    - **Runtime sanitization or normalization:** No runtime sanitization or normalization is applied to configuration-supplied path segments.
    - **Whitelist or bounds check:** There is no whitelist or bounds check to ensure that computed paths remain within designated safe folders.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker needs to be able to influence the user's VS Code settings. This can be achieved if the attacker can convince the user to:
        - Install a malicious VS Code extension that modifies user settings.
        - Manually edit user settings (`settings.json`).
        - Load a malicious settings file or accept a compromised update.
    2. For arbitrary file write in clone configurations, the attacker must be able to inject a malicious clone configuration.
    3. The user must load or accept the supplied configuration.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`/code/src/core/helpers/resolvePath.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import { join } from 'node:path';

        export const resolvePath = (...paths: string[]): string => {
          return join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths);
        };
        ```
        - The `resolvePath` function uses `path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', ...paths)` to resolve paths. `__dirname` points to the directory of `resolvePath.ts` within the `dist` folder after build. This function concatenates paths without sanitization, making it vulnerable to path traversal. It resolves paths relative to the extension's source code location, not the intended `dist` or `.vscode/extensions` directory.

    - **`/code/src/core/helpers/customIconPaths.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        export const getCustomIconPaths = (filesAssociations: IconAssociations): string[] => {
          if (!filesAssociations) return [];
          return Object.keys(filesAssociations)
            .map((fileName) => {
              const config = filesAssociations[fileName];
              const iconName = typeof config === 'string' ? config : config.icon;
              if (!iconName) return undefined;
              const isFile = typeof config === 'string' ? true : config.isFile;
              if (!isFile) return undefined;
              const customIconPath = fileName.match(/^[.\/]+/) // <- weak path check
                ? resolvePath(fileName) // using resolvePath which is vulnerable
                : fileName;
              return customIconPath;
            })
            .filter(Boolean) as string[];
        };
        ```
        - The `getCustomIconPaths` function extracts icon paths from `filesAssociations` and filters paths that appear to be relative (starting with `./` or `../`) using a weak regex `fileName.match(/^[.\/]+/`.
        - It then uses `resolvePath(fileName)` to resolve these paths, which is vulnerable.

    - **`/code/src/core/generator/iconSaturation.ts` & `/code/src/core/generator/iconOpacity.ts`:**
        - These files (and `renameIconFiles.ts`) demonstrate the usage of `getCustomIconPaths`. They retrieve custom icon paths and use them in file system operations like `readdir`, `readFile`, `readdirSync`, and `renameSync` without further validation, making them vulnerable.
        - Example from `setIconSaturation`:
        ```typescript
        const customIconPaths = getCustomIconPaths(filesAssociations);
        for (const iconPath of customIconPaths) {
          const customIcons = await readdir(iconPath);
          for (const iconFileName of customIcons) {
            await processSVGFileForSaturation(iconPath, iconFileName, saturation);
          }
        }
        ```

    - **`/code/src/extension/tools/changeDetection.ts` and `/code/src/core/generator/shared/svg.ts`**:
        - Unsanitized paths are used in manifest generation and SVG processing routines, propagating the path traversal risk to file write operations.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Install the Material Icon Theme extension in VS Code.
    2. **Malicious Settings:** Open VS Code settings (JSON) and add a custom file association with a path traversal sequence:
        ```json
        "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
            "test.txt": "../../../../../sensitive.txt"
        }
        ```
        Adjust the `../` sequence to reach a known sensitive file (e.g., a file in your home directory). Alternatively, for testing within the extension directory, create a file `test.svg` inside `.vscode/extensions/test_extension/icons/` and `sensitive.txt` in `.vscode/extensions/test_extension/`. Then use `"../../sensitive.txt"` or `"../../icons/test.svg"`.
    3. **Trigger Icon Processing:** Trigger a configuration change or theme reload to force the extension to re-read settings and process icons. Changing icon saturation or opacity settings and toggling the theme are reliable triggers.
    4. **Create Test File:** Create a file named `test.txt` in any workspace folder.
    5. **Observe and Verify:**
        - Observe if VS Code attempts to load an icon for `test.txt`.
        - Check the developer console (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools) for errors related to file loading, especially if pointing to `sensitive.txt` (which is not an SVG). Errors might indicate attempted file access.
        - Monitor file system access if possible to confirm if the extension attempts to read the file at the crafted path.
        - If using `../../icons/test.svg`, verify if the custom icon loads, confirming path traversal within `.vscode/extensions`.

### 2. Vulnerability Name: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in SVG Parsing

- **Description:**
    1. The extension reads and parses SVG files for both default and custom icons, as well as during custom clone processing.
    2. The `svgson` parser is used to parse SVG file contents, as seen in `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloning.ts` and `/code/src/core/generator/shared/svg.ts`.
    3. If an attacker can supply a malicious SVG file containing a DOCTYPE or external entity declarations, and if the `svgson` parser resolves external entities by default, then external or local resources may be loaded during parsing.
    4. The extension does not sanitize SVG content before parsing with `svgson`.

- **Impact:**
    - **Confidentiality:** Sensitive local files or external resources may be disclosed if external entities are resolved during parsing. An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files the VS Code process has access to or trigger requests to external servers.
    - **Integrity:** Malformed or malicious SVG content could disrupt the icon generation process, potentially leading to denial of service or error messages that expose internal details.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension assumes that all SVG files, including custom ones, are from trusted sources and are "clean."
    - No pre-parsing sanitization (e.g., removal of DOCTYPE declarations or external entities) is performed before using `svgson`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Disable External Entity Resolution:** Explicit configuration setting to disable resolution of external entities in `svgson` is missing.
    - **SVG Sanitization:** No pre-processing step to remove dangerous XML constructs like DOCTYPE declarations and external entities from SVG files before parsing.
    - **Input Validation:** Input validation on SVG files to strip dangerous XML markup is absent.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker must be able to supply a malicious SVG file that includes a DOCTYPE with external entity declarations. This could be through:
        - A compromised asset update for default icons.
        - Influencing custom icon files, e.g., through path traversal vulnerability or malicious settings.
    2. The extension must process this malicious SVG file during icon generation or clone processing routines.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloning.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import { parse } from 'svgson';
        // ...
        const svgContent = await readFile(svgPath, 'utf-8');
        const svgTree = await parse(svgContent); // Parsing SVG content directly with svgson
        // ...
        ```
        - The `cloneIcon` function reads an SVG file and passes its content directly to `svgson.parse()`. No sanitization is performed before parsing, making it vulnerable to XXE if `svgson` resolves external entities by default (which is often the case for XML parsers).

    - **`/code/src/core/generator/shared/svg.ts`**: Similar parsing logic might be present for processing default SVG icons.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious SVG Creation:** Create a malicious SVG file (e.g., `malicious.svg`) containing an external entity declaration. For example, to attempt to read `/etc/passwd`:
        ```xml
        <!DOCTYPE svg [
          <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
        ]>
        <svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <text x="10" y="50" font-size="16">&xxe;</text>
        </svg>
        ```
        For testing file access within the extension context, you can target a known file within the `.vscode/extensions` directory.
    2. **Configuration:** Configure the extension to use this malicious SVG file. This could be done through custom icon associations via `settings.json`, leveraging the path traversal vulnerability if available, or by replacing a default icon file if possible in a test environment. For custom icon association:
        ```json
        "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
            "test.svg": "./malicious.svg" // Assuming malicious.svg is placed in a reachable location
        }
        ```
    3. **Trigger Icon Processing:** Trigger the icon generation routine. This might involve creating a file that matches the custom association (e.g., `test.svg`) or invoking a command that triggers icon processing, like clone generation.
    4. **Observe and Verify:**
        - Monitor for network requests if the external entity points to an external resource.
        - Check for error messages or logs that might indicate attempts to access local files (like `/etc/passwd` or files within `.vscode/extensions`).
        - If successful in reading a local file, the content of the file might be embedded in the rendered SVG (though rendering might fail depending on the file content). Look for unusual behavior or errors related to SVG rendering.

### 3. Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Write through Insecure Custom Clone Configurations

- **Description:**
    1. The extension allows users to define custom clones of icons through clone configurations.
    2. User-provided clone names, typically from the `name` field in configurations, are used to construct file paths for cloned icons.
    3. In routines like `/code/src/core/generator/clones/clonesGenerator.ts`, `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloneData.ts`, and `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloning.ts`, the clone name is incorporated into file paths using string concatenation and `path.join()` without sufficient sanitization.
    4. If an attacker provides a clone name containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `"../../evil"`), the resolved path can escape the intended clones folder.
    5. This can lead to arbitrary file write, potentially overwriting or creating files in unintended locations on the file system.

- **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can cause the extension to write files outside the designated icon directory.
    - **Unintended File Overwrites:** This can lead to overwriting important files, potentially causing data loss or system instability.
    - **Potential for Code Execution:** When combined with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, arbitrary file write could be a stepping stone towards remote code execution or system compromise, for instance by overwriting executable files or configuration files.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Documentation advises users to follow safe practices when configuring clone names.
    - No code-based filtering or sanitization is applied to clone names in functions like those in `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloneData.ts` or `/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloning.ts`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Clone Name Validation:** Clone names and related fields should be validated to strip or reject dangerous characters like `"../"` before being used in file path construction.
    - **Path Sanitization:** No sanitization of the constructed file paths to ensure they remain within the approved clone directory.
    - **Path Bounds Check:** No check after path construction to verify that the resulting path lies within an approved directory.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker must be able to inject a malicious clone configuration, for example, via a modified settings file or a compromised update.
    2. The user must load this malicious configuration, triggering the clone generation process.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloneData.ts`:**
        - Helper functions like `getIconName` construct clone names by concatenating user-provided values with fixed strings without sanitizing against directory traversal characters.
        - Example:
        ```typescript
        export const getIconName = (configName: string, cloneName: string): string => {
          return `${configName}-${cloneName}`; // cloneName is user-provided and unsanitized
        };
        ```
    - **`/code/src/core/generator/clones/utils/cloning.ts` and `/code/src/core/generator/clones/clonesGenerator.ts`:**
        - These files utilize functions from `cloneData.ts` and use `path.join()` with the unsanitized clone names to construct file paths for writing cloned icons.
        - `path.join()` normalizes paths but does not remove dangerous segments like `../`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious Clone Configuration:** Create a custom clone configuration in `settings.json` with a malicious clone name containing path traversal sequences:
        ```json
        "material-icon-theme.customClones": [
            {
                "name": "../../evil", // Malicious clone name
                "sourceIcon": "folder-root",
                "targetFormat": "svg"
            }
        ]
        ```
    2. **Trigger Clone Generation:** Trigger the clone generation process. This might involve executing a command related to icon cloning provided by the extension, or simply reloading the VS Code window after applying the configuration change.
    3. **File System Inspection:** Inspect the file system to determine if a file has been written outside the intended clones folder. Look for files or directories created at locations indicated by the path traversal in the clone name (e.g., files or directories named `evil` created outside the expected icon directory).
    4. **Content Verification:** Verify that the content of any written file corresponds to the expected output of the clone process (e.g., a cloned SVG icon).

---

### 4. Vulnerability Name: Prototype Pollution via Recursive Object Merge Function

- **Description:**
    1. The extension uses a shared helper function `merge` in `/code/src/core/helpers/object.ts` for recursively merging configuration objects. This is used in scenarios like applying default configurations via `padWithDefaultConfig` in `/code/src/core/generator/config/defaultConfig.ts` and during manifest generation in `/code/src/extension/tools/changeDetection.ts` and `/code/src/extension/shared/config.ts`.
    2. The `merge` function iterates over all keys of objects and directly assigns values to the accumulator without filtering out dangerous keys like `__proto__` or `constructor`.
    3. An attacker who can supply a configuration object containing these "magic" keys can pollute the prototype of global objects in JavaScript.

- **Impact:**
    - **Prototype Pollution:** Allows an attacker to tamper with global object properties in the JavaScript runtime.
    - **Bypassing Security Checks:** Prototype pollution can lead to bypassing internal security checks within the extension.
    - **Functionality Alteration:** It can alter key functionalities of the extension by modifying prototype properties.
    - **Potential Code Execution or Information Disclosure:** In severe cases, prototype pollution can enable arbitrary code execution, reveal sensitive data, or further compromise the system if exploited to manipulate critical parts of the application logic or interact with other vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The `merge` function in `/code/src/core/helpers/object.ts` processes all keys from `Object.keys()` and makes no attempt to filter or reject reserved keys like `__proto__` or `constructor`.
    - The extension assumes that configuration files and other inputs are well-formed and come from trusted sources.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Key Filtering:** Filtering or sanitization to remove or reject dangerous keys (e.g., `"__proto__"`, `"constructor"`) before merging configuration objects.
    - **Safe Merge Routine:** A safer merge routine should explicitly check and disallow modifications to an object's prototype, for example by using `Object.defineProperty` with `writable: false` for prototype properties or by using a different merging strategy that avoids prototype manipulation.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker must be able to supply or inject a configuration object that includes dangerous keys like `"__proto__"`. This could be through a malicious settings file or a compromised update.
    2. The extension must use the vulnerable `merge` function to merge this malicious configuration with its default configuration or other configuration objects.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`/code/src/core/helpers/object.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        export const merge = <T extends object, U extends object>(
          accumulator: T,
          ...sources: U[]
        ): T & U => {
          sources.forEach((source) => {
            if (isObject(source)) {
              Object.keys(source).forEach((key) => { // Iterates through all keys, including __proto__
                const value = source[key as keyof U];
                if (isObject(value)) {
                  accumulator[key as keyof T] = merge(
                    (accumulator[key as keyof T] || {}) as T[keyof T], // Recursive merge
                    value as object
                  ) as T[keyof T];
                } else {
                  accumulator[key as keyof T] = value as T[keyof T]; // Direct assignment, vulnerable to prototype pollution
                }
              });
            }
          });
          return accumulator as T & U;
        };
        ```
        - The `merge` function iterates through all keys of the source object using `Object.keys(source)` and directly assigns values to the accumulator (`accumulator[key as keyof T] = value as T[keyof T];`). This direct assignment, without checking for or filtering out special keys like `__proto__` or `constructor`, makes the function vulnerable to prototype pollution.

    - **Usage in multiple files:** The `merge` function is used in `/code/src/core/generator/config/defaultConfig.ts`, `/code/src/extension/shared/config.ts`, and `/code/src/extension/tools/changeDetection.ts`, meaning prototype pollution through this function can have widespread effects.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious Configuration:** Prepare a malicious configuration file (e.g., in `settings.json`) containing a `"__proto__"` property:
        ```json
        {
          "material-icon-theme": { // Or any configuration section that triggers the merge function
            "__proto__": {
              "polluted": "yes"
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    2. **Load Configuration:** Load this configuration into the extension. This might involve updating user settings or triggering a configuration reload.
    3. **Verification:** After the configuration is loaded and merged, open the developer console in VS Code (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools). In the console, evaluate `({}).polluted`.
    4. **Check for Pollution:** If the output is `"yes"`, it confirms that the prototype of plain objects has been polluted through the `merge` function.
    5. **Clean Up:** Remove the malicious configuration from `settings.json` and re-verify that `({}).polluted` is now `undefined` to ensure the pollution is removed.
