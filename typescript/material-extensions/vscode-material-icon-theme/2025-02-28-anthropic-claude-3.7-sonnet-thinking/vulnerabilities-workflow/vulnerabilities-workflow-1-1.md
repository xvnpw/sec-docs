# Updated Vulnerabilities in Material Icon Theme Extension

After reviewing the provided vulnerability against the specified criteria, I've determined that the submitted vulnerability doesn't clearly meet the requirements for inclusion in the list.

## Why the vulnerability was excluded:

The "Path Traversal in Custom Icon Paths Resolution" vulnerability is a valid high-severity issue that allows reading and potentially modifying files outside the extension's directory. However, it doesn't clearly qualify as:

- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Command Injection
- Code Injection

While the vulnerability allows controlling WHERE files are read from and written to, the file writing operation appears limited to SVG processing (adjusting saturation or opacity) rather than allowing arbitrary content injection. The description doesn't clearly demonstrate how an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to inject and execute arbitrary code.

A path traversal vulnerability that allows unauthorized file access is serious, but based on the provided description and code analysis, there's no clear path to arbitrary code execution which would be required to classify it as one of the specified vulnerability types.

If you have additional information about how this vulnerability could be exploited to achieve code execution, command injection, or code injection, please provide those details for reconsideration.
