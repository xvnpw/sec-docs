## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Insecure Storage of License Activation Response

**Description:**

1. The `activateKey` function in `src/extension.ts` initiates a license activation process by sending a POST request to `intelephense.com/activate` with the user's license key and a machine ID.
2. The server at `intelephense.com` responds to this request.
3. The extension's `activateKey` function receives the server's response and, without any validation of the response content, proceeds to save the entire response body directly into a file.
4. This file is stored in the global storage path of the VSCode extension, and the filename is predictably generated based on the license key provided by the user.
5. An attacker who can compromise the communication channel between the extension and `intelephense.com` (e.g., through a Man-in-the-Middle attack or DNS poisoning) or compromise the server itself, could manipulate the server's response.
6. By crafting a malicious response, the attacker could inject arbitrary content into the response body.
7. This malicious content would then be saved by the `activateKey` function to a file within the user's global storage path at a predictable location.
8. Although the saved content is not directly executed as code by the extension, the ability to write arbitrary content to a file in a known location on the user's system, especially within the global storage path of a VSCode extension, can be a security risk. It could potentially be leveraged for further exploitation if the storage path is not properly protected or if the saved content is later mishandled by the extension or other processes.

**Impact:**

- Local File Write Vulnerability: An attacker can potentially write arbitrary content to a file on the user's file system within the VSCode extension's global storage path.
- Potential for Further Exploitation: If the global storage path is not adequately protected, or if the content written is mishandled later, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone for more severe attacks. For example, if the extension or another process naively reads and processes this file content, it could lead to further vulnerabilities such as code injection or data corruption.
- Arbitrary File Write: A successful MITM attack allows an attacker to write arbitrary content to a file on the user's file system within the VSCode extension's global storage directory. While direct code execution might not be immediately possible, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone to more severe attacks, such as data corruption, configuration manipulation, or exploitation of other vulnerabilities that might arise from processing the written file.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently implemented mitigations:**

- HTTPS is used for communication, which provides encryption and integrity during transit, but does not validate the content of the response itself.
- None in the provided code. The extension saves the server response without any validation of its content.

**Missing mitigations:**

- Response Validation: Implement validation of the response received from the license activation server. At a minimum, verify the response status code and consider validating the response body against an expected schema or format to ensure it is legitimate license data and not malicious content.
    - Verifying a digital signature of the response to ensure it originates from the legitimate server and has not been tampered with.
    - Parsing the response as JSON and validating its structure and expected fields to prevent unexpected content from being written.
    - Implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in case of invalid or unexpected responses.
- Secure Storage Path Permissions: Ensure that the global storage path and the license key file are created with restrictive permissions to prevent unauthorized access from other processes or users on the same machine.
- Encryption of Sensitive Data: Consider encrypting the license information before saving it to disk to protect against unauthorized access even if the storage path is compromised.

**Preconditions:**

- The user must attempt to activate an Intelephense license key within VSCode.
- The user must attempt to activate a premium licence by entering a licence key into the extension.
- An attacker must be in a position to intercept or control the network communication between the VSCode extension and `intelephense.com` during the license activation process, or compromise the server `intelephense.com`.
- An attacker must be positioned to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network connection between the user's machine and `intelephense.com` during the licence activation process.

**Source code analysis:**

```typescript
function activateKey(context: ExtensionContext, licenceKey: string): Promise<void> {

    let postData = querystring.stringify({
        machineId: createHash('sha256').update(os.homedir(), 'utf8').digest('hex'),
        licenceKey: licenceKey
    });

    let options: https.RequestOptions = {
        hostname: 'intelephense.com',
        port: 443,
        path: '/activate',
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
            'Content-Length': postData.length
        }
    };

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let responseBody: string = '';

        let req = https.request(options, res => {

            res.on('data', chunk => {
                responseBody += chunk.toString(); // [INSECURE]: Accumulates response body without validation
            });

            res.on('end', () => {
                if (res.statusCode === 200) {
                    let filepath = path.join(context.globalStoragePath, 'intelephense_licence_key_' + licenceKey);
                    fs.writeFile(filepath, responseBody).then(resolve, reject); // [INSECURE]: Writes raw response body to file
                } else {
                    reject(new Error('Failed to activate key'));
                }
            });

            res.on('error', reject);
        });

        req.write(postData);
        req.on('error', reject);
        req.end();
    });

}
```

The code within the `activateKey` function in `src/extension.ts` is vulnerable because it directly saves the `responseBody` from the HTTPS request to a file without any sanitization or validation. The line `responseBody += chunk.toString();` accumulates the response chunks, and `fs.writeFile(filepath, responseBody)` writes this unsanitized content to a file. There is no check on the content of `responseBody` to ensure it's safe or of the expected format before it is written to the file system. The code directly takes the `responseBody` string from the HTTPS response and writes it to a file using `fs.writeFile` without any validation of its content or format. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the file if they can intercept and manipulate the server's response.

**Security test case:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - You need to be able to intercept HTTPS requests made by VSCode extension or set up a mock server that can act as `intelephense.com`. For interception, tools like `mitmproxy` can be used. For a mock server, you can set up a simple HTTP server that listens on port 443 and responds to POST requests to `/activate`.
    - Set up a proxy tool (like Burp Suite or mitmproxy) configured to intercept HTTPS traffic and specifically target requests to `intelephense.com`.
2. **Setup Mock Server/Interception:**
    - Configure your system to route requests to `intelephense.com` to your mock server (e.g., by modifying `/etc/hosts` or using a proxy). If using `mitmproxy`, configure VSCode to use the proxy.
    - Prepare your mock server to listen for POST requests to `/activate`.
    - Configure your system or VSCode to route network traffic through this proxy.
3. **Craft Malicious Response:**
    - Configure the mock server to respond to the license activation request with a crafted malicious payload. For example, the response body could be a simple text file containing potentially harmful content, or a larger file to test file writing behavior. For simplicity, let's use a text string as malicious content: `"Malicious content injected by attacker"`.
    - In the proxy, instead of forwarding the request to `intelephense.com`, modify the response from the server. Craft a malicious response body. For example, if the expected response is JSON, replace it with a simple text file containing malicious commands or arbitrary data, or a crafted JSON that could exploit a parsing vulnerability if the extension attempts to parse it later (though in this case, it's directly written as string).
4. **Trigger License Activation in VSCode:**
    - Open VSCode with the Intelephense extension activated.
    - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    - Execute the command `Intelephense: Enter licence key`.
    - Enter any license key (e.g., "TESTKEY123456789" or "1234567890ABCDE") and press Enter.
    - This action triggers the `activateKey` function, which will send a request to `intelephense.com/activate`.
    - The extension will initiate an HTTPS POST request to `intelephense.com/activate`. Intercept this request in your proxy.
5. **Observe File Creation and Content:**
    - After attempting to activate the license, check the VSCode global storage path for the Intelephense extension. The global storage path location varies by OS but is typically under the user's home directory (e.g., `~/.vscode-intelephense/globalStorage` on Linux/macOS or `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage` on Windows).
    - Look for a file named `intelephense_licence_key_TESTKEY123456789` (or with the license key you entered).
    - Open this file and verify its content. You should find that the content of the file is exactly the malicious content you configured your mock server to return (e.g., `"Malicious content injected by attacker"`).
    - In the proxy, send the modified (malicious) response back to VSCode through the proxy.
    - Observe the execution of the VSCode extension. Check the global storage path for the Intelephense extension (you can usually find this path in VSCode by going to Help -> Developer Tools -> Application -> Storage -> extensions-storage).
    - Verify that a new file (named something like `intelephense_licence_key_<licenceKey>`) has been created in the global storage path and that its content matches the malicious content you injected in the proxy response.
6. **Verification:**
    - If the file exists in the global storage path and contains the malicious content you provided through the mock server, the vulnerability is confirmed. This demonstrates that the extension is saving the raw, unvalidated server response to a file, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary content to the user's file system under specific conditions.
    - If the file contains the malicious content, the arbitrary file write vulnerability is confirmed.

### 2. Exposed Debug Endpoint in Debug Mode

**Description:**

If the extension is inadvertently launched in debug mode (i.e. when the environment variable `process.env.mode` is set to `"debug"`), the language client is created with debug options that include the Node.js inspector flag `--inspect=6039`. In such a case, a listening debug port (6039) is opened. An external attacker with network access to the host could potentially connect to that debug port—if it is not properly restricted to local interfaces—and interact with the Node.js inspector. This could allow the attacker to read internal state or, in the worst case, execute arbitrary code in the context of the extension.

**Impact:**

An attacker capable of reaching the debug port may leverage the exposed Node.js inspector to:
- Inspect and modify in-memory variables or execution flow.
- Inject debug commands that lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Gain further access to the internal workings of the extension which runs with the user’s privileges.
In a worst-case scenario, this vulnerability could enable remote code execution on the victim’s machine.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently implemented mitigations:**

- By default, the extension runs in “production mode”, so the debug-related code path is not taken unless `process.env.mode` is explicitly set to `"debug"`.
- The Node.js inspector when invoked via `--inspect=6039` normally binds to localhost by default.

**Missing mitigations:**

- There is no explicit check to ensure that debug mode is disabled in production.
- The code does not enforce that the inspector always binds to a safe interface (e.g. localhost only) or require authentication when in debug mode.
- The default debug options are always applied when `process.env.mode` equals `"debug"`, even if the user’s network configuration might (accidentally or maliciously) expose port 6039 to external connections.
- Ensure that debug mode is restricted strictly to internal development environments.
- Add an explicit check that prevents the extension from using `--inspect` options in production (for example, by verifying that the extension is not running in a publicly accessible environment).
- Configure the debug server options so that the inspector binds only to the localhost interface (for example, using `--inspect=127.0.0.1:6039`).
- Optionally, require a secure authentication mechanism when launching the inspector.

**Preconditions:**

- The environment variable `process.env.mode` must be set to `"debug"`.
- The language client is then created with a debug configuration that includes the `--inspect=6039` flag.
- The host machine’s debug port is not restricted by firewall or binding settings, allowing an external attacker on the same network (or via misconfiguration) to access port 6039.

**Source Code Analysis:**

1. In the `createClient` function (in `src/extension.ts`), the code checks whether the extension is in debug mode by testing:
   ```ts
   if (process.env.mode === 'debug') {
       serverModule = context.asAbsolutePath(path.join('node_modules', 'intelephense', 'out', 'server.js'));
   } else {
       serverModule = context.asAbsolutePath(path.join('node_modules', 'intelephense', 'lib', 'intelephense.js'));
   }
   ```
2. Immediately following that, the debug options are defined:
   ```ts
   let debugOptions = {
       execArgv: ["--nolazy", "--inspect=6039", "--trace-warnings", "--preserve-symlinks"],
       detached: true
   };
   ```
3. These options are then passed (when in debug mode) as part of the `serverOptions.debug` configuration. The use of `--inspect=6039` enables the Node.js inspector to listen on port 6039.
4. There is no further logic to limit access (for example, verifying that the debug server binds only to localhost) nor any runtime check to disable this mode in production deployments.

**Security test case:**

1. **Preparation:**
    - In your local development environment, set the environment variable `process.env.mode` to `"debug"` before launching VS Code (or the extension host).
    - Ensure your network configuration does not block port 6039 locally.
2. **Steps to Reproduce:**
    - a. Launch the extension so that the debug mode code path is activated.
    - b. Confirm (by checking logs or the status bar) that the language client has started with debug options.
    - c. From a separate machine on the same network (or using a tool like nmap/telnet on the host), attempt to connect to port 6039.
    - d. Try to interact with the Node.js inspector protocol (for example, using a debugger client that supports Node.js) to read internal state or inject commands.
3. **Expected Outcome if Vulnerable:**
    - The attacker’s client successfully connects to the debug port and is able to issue debug commands.
    - The extension’s process reveals internal state or unexpectedly executes commands provided by the remote debugger client.
4. **Validation:**
    - If the connection is successful and you can observe inspector traffic (for example, by listing variables or pausing execution), then the vulnerability is reproducible.
