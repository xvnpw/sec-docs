### Combined Vulnerability List

#### 1. Insecure Storage of License Key Activation File

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Storage of License Key Activation File
- **Description:**
    1. User activates the Intelephense extension by entering a license key through the "Enter licence key" command.
    2. The extension sends the license key to `intelephense.com/activate` via an HTTPS POST request for validation.
    3. Upon successful validation (HTTP status 200), the server response (`responseBody`) is written to a file.
    4. The file is stored in the user's global storage path for VS Code, with a predictable filename: `intelephense_licence_key_<licenceKey>`.
    5. An attacker who gains read access to the user's file system can locate and read this file to potentially extract and reuse the license key.
- **Impact:**
    - License key theft: Attackers can steal valid license keys.
    - Unauthorised use of premium features: Stolen license keys can be used to activate premium features of Intelephense without purchasing a license, leading to revenue loss for the developers.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - HTTPS is used for communication with `intelephense.com/activate`, protecting the license key during transmission.
    - The license key is stored in the VS Code global storage path, which is generally user-specific and not publicly accessible by default.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Secure storage mechanisms: Instead of directly writing the response to a file, use more secure OS-level storage options if available, such as the operating system's credential storage or keychain.
    - Encryption: Encrypt the content of the license key file before writing it to storage.
    - Filename obfuscation: Make the filename less predictable to prevent easy discovery. For example, use a hash of the license key or a randomly generated string as part of the filename.
    - Access control: Implement stricter file system permissions to restrict read access to the license key file to only the Intelephense extension process.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have activated a license key for the Intelephense extension.
    - An attacker must gain read access to the user's file system where VS Code stores global extension data. This could be achieved through various methods, including malware, phishing, or exploiting other vulnerabilities in the user's system.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/extension.ts
    function activateKey(context: ExtensionContext, licenceKey: string): Promise<void> {
        // ...
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            let responseBody: string = '';
            let req = https.request(options, res => {
                res.on('data', chunk => {
                    responseBody += chunk.toString();
                });
                res.on('end', () => {
                    if (res.statusCode === 200) {
                        let filepath = path.join(context.globalStoragePath, 'intelephense_licence_key_' + licenceKey); // Vulnerable filename construction
                        fs.writeFile(filepath, responseBody).then(resolve, reject); // Insecure file write
                    } else {
                        reject(new Error('Failed to activate key'));
                    }
                });
                res.on('error', reject);
            });
            req.write(postData);
            req.on('error', reject);
            req.end();
        });
    }
    ```
    - The `activateKey` function in `src/extension.ts` constructs the file path using `path.join(context.globalStoragePath, 'intelephense_licence_key_' + licenceKey)`. This creates a predictable filename based on the license key.
    - `fs.writeFile(filepath, responseBody)` then writes the server's response directly to this file without any encryption or access control measures.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Install the Intelephense extension in VS Code.
    2. Enter and activate a valid Intelephense license key.
    3. Determine the global storage path for VS Code extensions on your operating system. This path varies depending on the OS and VS Code version. For example, on Linux, it might be under `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage` or `~/.vscode/extensions`.
    4. Navigate to the Intelephense extension's directory within the global storage path. The directory name will be similar to `bmewburn.intelephense-<version>`.
    5. Look for a file named `intelephense_licence_key_<your_licence_key>`.
    6. Open the file and examine its contents. If the file contains easily extractable license key information or validation tokens that can be reused, the vulnerability is confirmed.

#### 2. Insecure Debug Mode Debugger Exposure

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Debug Mode Debugger Exposure
- **Description:**
  When the extension is launched in debug mode (i.e., when the environment variable `process.env.mode` is set to `"debug"`), the language server is started with debugger options that include `--inspect=6039`. In this configuration the Node.js inspector is enabled on port 6039. An external attacker who is able to access this port (for example, via a misconfigured network or firewall) could attach a debugger to the language server process. By doing so, the attacker might inspect internal state, execute debugger commands (such as evaluating expressions or even changing variable values), and ultimately execute arbitrary code in the context of the extension process.
- **Impact:**
  An attacker gaining remote debugger access can (a) inspect sensitive internal data, (b) change the behavior of the language server, and (c) potentially execute arbitrary code. This could compromise the security and integrity of the development environment and, in some cases, the underlying host system.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - In production mode (i.e. when `process.env.mode` is not set to `"debug"`), this debugging configuration is not used.
  - The code distinguishes between debug and production deployments by choosing different server module paths.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The debugger options do not explicitly bind the Node.js inspector to a safe interface (e.g. localhost only).
  - No additional safeguards prevent the debug port from being accessible by unauthorized remote entities when debug mode is enabled.
  - There is no runtime check to ensure that debug mode is never inadvertently enabled in a production deployment.
- **Preconditions:**
  - The extension must be launched with `process.env.mode` set to `"debug"`.
  - The debugger port (6039) must be accessible externally (for example, due to network or firewall misconfiguration).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the `createClient()` function of `src/extension.ts`, the code block
    ```ts
      if (process.env.mode === 'debug') {
          serverModule = context.asAbsolutePath(path.join('node_modules', 'intelephense', 'out', 'server.js'));
      } else {
          serverModule = context.asAbsolutePath(path.join('node_modules', 'intelephense', 'lib', 'intelephense.js'));
      }
    ```
    means that when in debug mode the extension loads the server from a different path.
  - The debug options are defined as follows:
    ```ts
      let debugOptions = {
          execArgv: ["--nolazy", "--inspect=6039", "--trace-warnings", "--preserve-symlinks"],
          detached: true
      };
    ```
    These options launch the Node.js inspector on port 6039. There is no further restriction (such as binding only to localhost) in this code.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a controlled test environment, set the environment variable `process.env.mode` to `"debug"` before launching the extension.
  2. Start the extension (for example, in a Visual Studio Code instance configured for extension development).
  3. Verify (by checking logs or using process monitors) that the child process running the language server is launched with debugger options that include `--inspect=6039`.
  4. From another machine (or a separate tool on the same machine), attempt to attach a debugger client to port 6039.
  5. If the debugger client successfully attaches and is able to execute commands (for example, pausing execution and evaluating internal variables), then the vulnerability is confirmed.
  6. Remediation would include forcing the debugger (in debug mode) to bind only to a restricted interface (such as `127.0.0.1`), and ideally ensuring that debug mode is never enabled in production deployments.

#### 3. Home Directory Hash Disclosure

- **Vulnerability Name:** Home Directory Hash Disclosure
- **Description:**
    1. The Intelephense extension calculates a SHA256 hash of the user's home directory path.
    2. This hash, along with the licence key, is sent in a POST request to `intelephense.com/activate` during licence key activation.
    3. An attacker monitoring network traffic or intercepting the HTTPS request could potentially obtain this hash.
- **Impact:**
    - **Privacy Violation:** Disclosure of a hash derived from the user's home directory, which could be considered personal and sensitive information.
    - **Potential Information Leakage:** While the hash itself is not the full home directory path, it might reveal information about the user's operating system and username if predictable patterns exist in home directory paths. This information could be used in social engineering or targeted attacks.
    - **Future Attack Vector:** If combined with other vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the Intelephense activation process or backend systems, this hash could potentially be used as part of a more complex attack.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - HTTPS is used for communication, encrypting the transmission of the hash and licence key in transit.
    - The home directory is hashed using SHA256, making it computationally infeasible to reverse directly to the original path.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Eliminate Home Directory Hash Transmission:** The most effective mitigation is to avoid transmitting any hash derived from the user's home directory. The licence activation process should be redesigned to not require this information.
    - **Anonymize Machine Identification:** If machine identification is necessary for licence management, use a less sensitive and more anonymized method than hashing the home directory. Consider using a randomly generated, unique identifier stored locally.
    - **Transparency and User Consent:**  Clearly document the data collected during licence activation, including the machine identifier, in the extension's privacy policy and obtain explicit user consent before transmitting any potentially sensitive information.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must attempt to activate a licence key within the Intelephense extension.
    - An attacker must be in a position to monitor the network traffic between the user's machine and `intelephense.com` or intercept the HTTPS request.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/src/extension.ts`
    - **Function:** `activateKey(context: ExtensionContext, licenceKey: string)`

    ```typescript
    function activateKey(context: ExtensionContext, licenceKey: string): Promise<void> {

        let postData = querystring.stringify({
            machineId: createHash('sha256').update(os.homedir(), 'utf8').digest('hex'), // Vulnerable line: Hashing and using homedir
            licenceKey: licenceKey
        });

        let options: https.RequestOptions = {
            hostname: 'intelephense.com',
            port: 443,
            path: '/activate',
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
                'Content-Length': postData.length
            }
        };

        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // ... (HTTPS request logic) ...
        });
    }
    ```
    - **Explanation:**
        1. The `activateKey` function is responsible for activating the Intelephense licence.
        2. Inside this function, `createHash('sha256').update(os.homedir(), 'utf8').digest('hex')` calculates a SHA256 hash of the user's home directory path obtained using `os.homedir()`.
        3. This hash is assigned to the `machineId` parameter in the `postData` object.
        4. The `postData`, including the `machineId` and `licenceKey`, is then sent as the body of a POST request to `intelephense.com/activate` over HTTPS.
        5. An attacker intercepting this request could extract the `machineId`, which is the SHA256 hash of the user's home directory.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Set up a network traffic monitoring tool (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump) on the attacker's machine to capture network traffic.
    2. **Action:** As a user, open Visual Studio Code with the Intelephense extension installed.
    3. **Action:** Attempt to activate an Intelephense licence by executing the "Intelephense: Enter licence key" command and entering a valid or invalid licence key.
    4. **Action:** Observe the network traffic captured by the monitoring tool.
    5. **Verification:** Look for an HTTPS POST request to `intelephense.com/activate`.
    6. **Verification:** Inspect the body of the POST request. It should contain a parameter named `machineId` which holds a 64-character hexadecimal string. This string is the SHA256 hash of the user's home directory.
