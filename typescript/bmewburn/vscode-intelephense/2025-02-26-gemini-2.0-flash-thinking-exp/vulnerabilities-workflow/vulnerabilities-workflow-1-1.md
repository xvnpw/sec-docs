### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure Storage of License Activation Response
* Description:
    1. The `activateKey` function in `src/extension.ts` initiates a license activation process by sending a POST request to `intelephense.com/activate` with the user's license key and a machine ID.
    2. The server at `intelephense.com` responds to this request.
    3. The extension's `activateKey` function receives the server's response and, without any validation of the response content, proceeds to save the entire response body directly into a file.
    4. This file is stored in the global storage path of the VSCode extension, and the filename is predictably generated based on the license key provided by the user.
    5. An attacker who can compromise the communication channel between the extension and `intelephense.com` (e.g., through a Man-in-the-Middle attack or DNS poisoning) or compromise the server itself, could manipulate the server's response.
    6. By crafting a malicious response, the attacker could inject arbitrary content into the response body.
    7. This malicious content would then be saved by the `activateKey` function to a file within the user's global storage path at a predictable location.
    8. Although the saved content is not directly executed as code by the extension, the ability to write arbitrary content to a file in a known location on the user's system, especially within the global storage path of a VSCode extension, can be a security risk. It could potentially be leveraged for further exploitation if the storage path is not properly protected or if the saved content is later mishandled by the extension or other processes.
* Impact:
    - Local File Write Vulnerability: An attacker can potentially write arbitrary content to a file on the user's file system within the VSCode extension's global storage path.
    - Potential for Further Exploitation: If the global storage path is not adequately protected, or if the content written is mishandled later, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone for more severe attacks. For example, if the extension or another process naively reads and processes this file content, it could lead to further vulnerabilities such as code injection or data corruption.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The extension saves the server response without any validation of its content.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Response Validation: Implement validation of the response received from the license activation server. At a minimum, verify the response status code and consider validating the response body against an expected schema or format to ensure it is legitimate license data and not malicious content.
    - Secure Storage Path Permissions: Ensure that the global storage path and the license key file are created with restrictive permissions to prevent unauthorized access from other processes or users on the same machine.
    - Encryption of Sensitive Data: Consider encrypting the license information before saving it to disk to protect against unauthorized access even if the storage path is compromised.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must attempt to activate an Intelephense license key within VSCode.
    - An attacker must be in a position to intercept or control the network communication between the VSCode extension and `intelephense.com` during the license activation process, or compromise the server `intelephense.com`.
* Source code analysis:
    ```typescript
    function activateKey(context: ExtensionContext, licenceKey: string): Promise<void> {

        let postData = querystring.stringify({
            machineId: createHash('sha256').update(os.homedir(), 'utf8').digest('hex'),
            licenceKey: licenceKey
        });

        let options: https.RequestOptions = {
            hostname: 'intelephense.com',
            port: 443,
            path: '/activate',
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
                'Content-Length': postData.length
            }
        };

        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            let responseBody: string = '';

            let req = https.request(options, res => {

                res.on('data', chunk => {
                    responseBody += chunk.toString(); // [INSECURE]: Accumulates response body without validation
                });

                res.on('end', () => {
                    if (res.statusCode === 200) {
                        let filepath = path.join(context.globalStoragePath, 'intelephense_licence_key_' + licenceKey);
                        fs.writeFile(filepath, responseBody).then(resolve, reject); // [INSECURE]: Writes raw response body to file
                    } else {
                        reject(new Error('Failed to activate key'));
                    }
                });

                res.on('error', reject);
            });

            req.write(postData);
            req.on('error', reject);
            req.end();
        });

    }
    ```
    The code within the `activateKey` function in `src/extension.ts` is vulnerable because it directly saves the `responseBody` from the HTTPS request to a file without any sanitization or validation. The line `responseBody += chunk.toString();` accumulates the response chunks, and `fs.writeFile(filepath, responseBody)` writes this unsanitized content to a file. There is no check on the content of `responseBody` to ensure it's safe or of the expected format before it is written to the file system.
* Security test case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - You need to be able to intercept HTTPS requests made by VSCode extension or set up a mock server that can act as `intelephense.com`. For interception, tools like `mitmproxy` can be used. For a mock server, you can set up a simple HTTP server that listens on port 443 and responds to POST requests to `/activate`.
    2. **Setup Mock Server/Interception:**
        - Configure your system to route requests to `intelephense.com` to your mock server (e.g., by modifying `/etc/hosts` or using a proxy). If using `mitmproxy`, configure VSCode to use the proxy.
        - Prepare your mock server to listen for POST requests to `/activate`.
    3. **Craft Malicious Response:**
        - Configure the mock server to respond to the license activation request with a crafted malicious payload. For example, the response body could be a simple text file containing potentially harmful content, or a larger file to test file writing behavior. For simplicity, let's use a text string as malicious content: `"Malicious content injected by attacker"`.
    4. **Trigger License Activation in VSCode:**
        - Open VSCode with the Intelephense extension activated.
        - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
        - Execute the command `Intelephense: Enter licence key`.
        - Enter any license key (e.g., "TESTKEY123456789") and press Enter.
        - This action triggers the `activateKey` function, which will send a request to `intelephense.com/activate`.
    5. **Observe File Creation and Content:**
        - After attempting to activate the license, check the VSCode global storage path for the Intelephense extension. The global storage path location varies by OS but is typically under the user's home directory (e.g., `~/.vscode-intelephense/globalStorage` on Linux/macOS or `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage` on Windows).
        - Look for a file named `intelephense_licence_key_TESTKEY123456789` (or with the license key you entered).
        - Open this file and verify its content. You should find that the content of the file is exactly the malicious content you configured your mock server to return (e.g., `"Malicious content injected by attacker"`).
    6. **Verification:**
        - If the file exists in the global storage path and contains the malicious content you provided through the mock server, the vulnerability is confirmed. This demonstrates that the extension is saving the raw, unvalidated server response to a file, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary content to the user's file system under specific conditions.
