- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Debug Mode Debugger Exposure
  **Description:**
  When the extension is launched in debug mode (i.e., when the environment variable `process.env.mode` is set to `"debug"`), the language server is started with debugger options that include `--inspect=6039`. In this configuration the Node.js inspector is enabled on port 6039. An external attacker who is able to access this port (for example, via a misconfigured network or firewall) could attach a debugger to the language server process. By doing so, the attacker might inspect internal state, execute debugger commands (such as evaluating expressions or even changing variable values), and ultimately execute arbitrary code in the context of the extension process.
  **Step-by-Step How to Trigger:**
  1. Ensure the extension is started in debug mode by setting `process.env.mode` to `"debug"`.
  2. Confirm that the Node.js debug options (including `--inspect=6039`) are applied when launching the language server (as visible in the `createClient()` function in `src/extension.ts`).
  3. From another machine on the same network, use a Node debugger client (for example, Chrome DevTools or VS Code’s “Attach to Node” debugger) to connect to the debug port (6039).
  4. Once connected, execute debugger commands such as evaluating arbitrary JavaScript, setting breakpoints, or modifying process variables.
  **Impact:**
  An attacker gaining remote debugger access can (a) inspect sensitive internal data, (b) change the behavior of the language server, and (c) potentially execute arbitrary code. This could compromise the security and integrity of the development environment and, in some cases, the underlying host system.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - In production mode (i.e. when `process.env.mode` is not set to `"debug"`), this debugging configuration is not used.
  - The code distinguishes between debug and production deployments by choosing different server module paths.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The debugger options do not explicitly bind the Node.js inspector to a safe interface (e.g. localhost only).
  - No additional safeguards prevent the debug port from being accessible by unauthorized remote entities when debug mode is enabled.
  - There is no runtime check to ensure that debug mode is never inadvertently enabled in a production deployment.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The extension must be launched with `process.env.mode` set to `"debug"`.
  - The debugger port (6039) must be accessible externally (for example, due to network or firewall misconfiguration).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the `createClient()` function of `src/extension.ts`, the code block
    ```ts
      if (process.env.mode === 'debug') {
          serverModule = context.asAbsolutePath(path.join('node_modules', 'intelephense', 'out', 'server.js'));
      } else {
          serverModule = context.asAbsolutePath(path.join('node_modules', 'intelephense', 'lib', 'intelephense.js'));
      }
    ```
    means that when in debug mode the extension loads the server from a different path.
  - The debug options are defined as follows:
    ```ts
      let debugOptions = {
          execArgv: ["--nolazy", "--inspect=6039", "--trace-warnings", "--preserve-symlinks"],
          detached: true
      };
    ```
    These options launch the Node.js inspector on port 6039. There is no further restriction (such as binding only to localhost) in this code.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a controlled test environment, set the environment variable `process.env.mode` to `"debug"` before launching the extension.
  2. Start the extension (for example, in a Visual Studio Code instance configured for extension development).
  3. Verify (by checking logs or using process monitors) that the child process running the language server is launched with debugger options that include `--inspect=6039`.
  4. From another machine (or a separate tool on the same machine), attempt to attach a debugger client to port 6039.
  5. If the debugger client successfully attaches and is able to execute commands (for example, pausing execution and evaluating internal variables), then the vulnerability is confirmed.
  6. Remediation would include forcing the debugger (in debug mode) to bind only to a restricted interface (such as `127.0.0.1`), and ideally ensuring that debug mode is never enabled in production deployments.
