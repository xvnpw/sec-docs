- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposed Debug Endpoint in Debug Mode

- **Description:**
  If the extension is inadvertently launched in debug mode (i.e. when the environment variable `process.env.mode` is set to `"debug"`), the language client is created with debug options that include the Node.js inspector flag `--inspect=6039`. In such a case, a listening debug port (6039) is opened. An external attacker with network access to the host could potentially connect to that debug port—if it is not properly restricted to local interfaces—and interact with the Node.js inspector. This could allow the attacker to read internal state or, in the worst case, execute arbitrary code in the context of the extension.

- **Impact:**
  An attacker capable of reaching the debug port may leverage the exposed Node.js inspector to:
  • Inspect and modify in-memory variables or execution flow.
  • Inject debug commands that lead to arbitrary code execution.
  • Gain further access to the internal workings of the extension which runs with the user’s privileges.
  In a worst-case scenario, this vulnerability could enable remote code execution on the victim’s machine.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • By default, the extension runs in “production mode”, so the debug-related code path is not taken unless `process.env.mode` is explicitly set to `"debug"`.
  • The Node.js inspector when invoked via `--inspect=6039` normally binds to localhost by default.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  • There is no explicit check to ensure that debug mode is disabled in production.
  • The code does not enforce that the inspector always binds to a safe interface (e.g. localhost only) or require authentication when in debug mode.
  • The default debug options are always applied when `process.env.mode` equals `"debug"`, even if the user’s network configuration might (accidentally or maliciously) expose port 6039 to external connections.

- **Preconditions:**
  • The environment variable `process.env.mode` must be set to `"debug"`.
  • The language client is then created with a debug configuration that includes the `--inspect=6039` flag.
  • The host machine’s debug port is not restricted by firewall or binding settings, allowing an external attacker on the same network (or via misconfiguration) to access port 6039.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  1. In the `createClient` function (in `src/extension.ts`), the code checks whether the extension is in debug mode by testing:
     ```ts
     if (process.env.mode === 'debug') {
         serverModule = context.asAbsolutePath(path.join('node_modules', 'intelephense', 'out', 'server.js'));
     } else {
         serverModule = context.asAbsolutePath(path.join('node_modules', 'intelephense', 'lib', 'intelephense.js'));
     }
     ```
  2. Immediately following that, the debug options are defined:
     ```ts
     let debugOptions = {
         execArgv: ["--nolazy", "--inspect=6039", "--trace-warnings", "--preserve-symlinks"],
         detached: true
     };
     ```
  3. These options are then passed (when in debug mode) as part of the `serverOptions.debug` configuration. The use of `--inspect=6039` enables the Node.js inspector to listen on port 6039.
  4. There is no further logic to limit access (for example, verifying that the debug server binds only to localhost) nor any runtime check to disable this mode in production deployments.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Preparation:**
     • In your local development environment, set the environment variable `process.env.mode` to `"debug"` before launching VS Code (or the extension host).
     • Ensure your network configuration does not block port 6039 locally.
  2. **Steps to Reproduce:**
     a. Launch the extension so that the debug mode code path is activated.
     b. Confirm (by checking logs or the status bar) that the language client has started with debug options.
     c. From a separate machine on the same network (or using a tool like nmap/telnet on the host), attempt to connect to port 6039.
     d. Try to interact with the Node.js inspector protocol (for example, using a debugger client that supports Node.js) to read internal state or inject commands.
  3. **Expected Outcome if Vulnerable:**
     • The attacker’s client successfully connects to the debug port and is able to issue debug commands.
     • The extension’s process reveals internal state or unexpectedly executes commands provided by the remote debugger client.
  4. **Validation:**
     • If the connection is successful and you can observe inspector traffic (for example, by listing variables or pausing execution), then the vulnerability is reproducible.

- **Remediation Recommendations:**
• Ensure that debug mode is restricted strictly to internal development environments.
• Add an explicit check that prevents the extension from using `--inspect` options in production (for example, by verifying that the extension is not running in a publicly accessible environment).
• Configure the debug server options so that the inspector binds only to the localhost interface (for example, using `--inspect=127.0.0.1:6039`).
• Optionally, require a secure authentication mechanism when launching the inspector.
