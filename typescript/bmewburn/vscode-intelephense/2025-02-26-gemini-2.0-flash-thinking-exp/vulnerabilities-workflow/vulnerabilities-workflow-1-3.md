### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Insecure Licence Key Activation Response Handling

- Description:
    1. The VSCode extension sends a licence key and machine ID to `intelephense.com/activate` via an HTTPS POST request when a user attempts to activate a premium licence.
    2. The server responds with data that is intended to be a licence confirmation.
    3. The extension receives the HTTP response and, upon verifying a 200 OK status code, directly writes the entire response body to a file within the user's global storage path without any validation or sanitization of the response content.
    4. An attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could intercept the HTTPS communication and replace the legitimate server response with malicious content.
    5. The extension would then blindly write this attacker-controlled content to a file in the global storage path.

- Impact:
    Arbitrary File Write. A successful MITM attack allows an attacker to write arbitrary content to a file on the user's file system within the VSCode extension's global storage directory. While direct code execution might not be immediately possible, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone to more severe attacks, such as data corruption, configuration manipulation, or exploitation of other vulnerabilities that might arise from processing the written file.

- Vulnerability rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - HTTPS is used for communication, which provides encryption and integrity during transit, but does not validate the content of the response itself.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Response Validation: The extension must validate the integrity and expected format of the response from the licence server before writing it to the file system. This could include:
        - Verifying a digital signature of the response to ensure it originates from the legitimate server and has not been tampered with.
        - Parsing the response as JSON and validating its structure and expected fields to prevent unexpected content from being written.
        - Implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in case of invalid or unexpected responses.

- Preconditions:
    1. The user must attempt to activate a premium licence by entering a licence key into the extension.
    2. An attacker must be positioned to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network connection between the user's machine and `intelephense.com` during the licence activation process.

- Source code analysis:
    ```typescript
    function activateKey(context: ExtensionContext, licenceKey: string): Promise<void> {

        // ... request options and postData setup ...

        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            let responseBody: string = '';
            let req = https.request(options, res => {
                res.on('data', chunk => {
                    responseBody += chunk.toString(); // [HIGHLIGHT] Response body is accumulated as string
                });

                res.on('end', () => {
                    if (res.statusCode === 200) {
                        let filepath = path.join(context.globalStoragePath, 'intelephense_licence_key_' + licenceKey);
                        fs.writeFile(filepath, responseBody).then(resolve, reject); // [VULNERABILITY] responseBody is written directly to file without validation
                    } else {
                        reject(new Error('Failed to activate key'));
                    }
                });

                res.on('error', reject);
            });

            req.write(postData);
            req.on('error', reject);
            req.end();
        });
    }
    ```
    The code directly takes the `responseBody` string from the HTTPS response and writes it to a file using `fs.writeFile` without any validation of its content or format. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the file if they can intercept and manipulate the server's response.

- Security test case:
    1. Set up a proxy tool (like Burp Suite or mitmproxy) configured to intercept HTTPS traffic and specifically target requests to `intelephense.com`.
    2. Configure your system or VSCode to route network traffic through this proxy.
    3. In VSCode, open the command palette and execute the "Intelephense: Enter licence key" command.
    4. Enter a validly formatted licence key (e.g., "1234567890ABCDE").
    5. The extension will initiate an HTTPS POST request to `intelephense.com/activate`. Intercept this request in your proxy.
    6. In the proxy, instead of forwarding the request to `intelephense.com`, modify the response from the server. Craft a malicious response body. For example, if the expected response is JSON, replace it with a simple text file containing malicious commands or arbitrary data, or a crafted JSON that could exploit a parsing vulnerability if the extension attempts to parse it later (though in this case, it's directly written as string).
    7. Send the modified (malicious) response back to VSCode through the proxy.
    8. Observe the execution of the VSCode extension. Check the global storage path for the Intelephense extension (you can usually find this path in VSCode by going to Help -> Developer Tools -> Application -> Storage -> extensions-storage).
    9. Verify that a new file (named something like `intelephense_licence_key_<licenceKey>`) has been created in the global storage path and that its content matches the malicious content you injected in the proxy response.
    10. If the file contains the malicious content, the arbitrary file write vulnerability is confirmed.
