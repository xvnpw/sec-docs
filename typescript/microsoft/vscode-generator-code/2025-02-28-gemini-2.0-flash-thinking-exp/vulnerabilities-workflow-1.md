## Combined Vulnerability List

The following vulnerability has been identified in the project. This vulnerability allows for code execution within the VS Code environment when a generated extension project is opened due to template injection in README files.

### Vulnerability: Template Injection in README files

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious extension name or description containing template injection payloads.
    2. The attacker uses the `yo code` generator with the crafted name or description.
    3. The generator uses the provided name and description to populate templates, including README.md files.
    4. Due to insufficient sanitization, the template injection payloads are processed by the template engine (EJS).
    5. When a user opens the generated extension project, VS Code renders the README.md, executing the injected JavaScript code within the VS Code environment.

- **Impact:**
    - Code execution within the VS Code environment when the generated extension project is opened.
    - Potential for arbitrary file system access, exfiltration of sensitive information, or further exploitation depending on the attacker's payload and VS Code's security context.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None. The templates directly use user-provided input without sanitization.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization of extension name and description in the generator code before using them in templates.
    - Context-aware output encoding within templates to prevent JavaScript execution.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to influence the extension name or description provided to the `yo code` generator. This can be achieved if the generator is used in an automated or semi-automated process where input can be manipulated. Or if a user is tricked into using a malicious name or description.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - File: `/code/generators/app/prompts.js`
        - Functions `askForExtensionDisplayName` and `askForExtensionDescription` directly take user input for extension display name and description without any sanitization.
    - File: `/code/generators/app/generate-command-js.js`, `/code/generators/app/generate-command-ts.js`, `/code/generators/app/generate-command-web.js`, `/code/generators/app/generate-colortheme.js`, `/code/generators/app/generate-extensionpack.js`, `/code/generators/app/generate-keymap.js`, `/code/generators/app/generate-language.js`, `/code/generators/app/generate-localization.js`, `/code/generators/app/generate-notebook-renderer.js`, `/code/generators/app/generate-snippets.js`
        - These files call `prompts.askForExtensionDisplayName` and `prompts.askForExtensionDescription` to get user input.
    - File: `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-command-js/README.md`, `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-command-ts/README.md`, `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-command-web/README.md`, `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-colortheme/README.md`, `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-extensionpack/README.md`, `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-keymap/README.md`, `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-language/README.md`, `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-localization/README.md`, `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-notebook-renderer/README.md`, `/code/generators/app/templates/ext-snippets/README.md`
        - These `README.md` template files use `<%= name %>` and `<%= displayName %>` to include the extension name and display name directly into the markdown content.
        - EJS template engine will execute JavaScript code within `<% ... %>` and output escaped HTML with `<%- ... %>` and unescaped HTML with `<%= ... %>`. In this case, `<%= ... %>` is used which can lead to XSS if `name` or `displayName` contains malicious JavaScript.

    ```
    // Example in template file: /code/generators/app/templates/ext-command-js/README.md
    # <%= name %> README

    This is the README for your extension "<%= name %>".
    ```

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (Malicious Name) --> Generator (No Sanitization) --> README.md Template (<%= name %>) --> Generated README.md (Malicious JS) --> VS Code (Renders README, Executes JS) --> Vulnerability Triggered
    ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. Open a terminal and install the generator: `npm install -g yo generator-code`
    2. Create a new directory: `mkdir vulnerable-extension && cd vulnerable-extension`
    3. Run the generator with a malicious extension name:
       `yo code "Malicious Extension <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>" -t=ts -q`
    4. Open VS Code and open the `vulnerable-extension` folder: `code vulnerable-extension`
    5. Observe that an alert box with 'XSS' is displayed when VS Code renders the `README.md` file.

    Alternatively, a more harmful payload could be used to demonstrate file system access:

    ```bash
    yo code "Malicious Extension <script>require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/pwned');</script>" -t=ts -q
    ```

    After opening the generated project in VS Code, check if the `/tmp/pwned` file has been created. This would indicate code execution and potential file system access.
