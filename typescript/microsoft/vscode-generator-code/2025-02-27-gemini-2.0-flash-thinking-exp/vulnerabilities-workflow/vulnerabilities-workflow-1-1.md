## Vulnerability List for Yo Code - Extension and Customization Generator

### 1. Template Injection in Extension Name and Description

- Description:
    1. An attacker initiates the extension generation process by running the `yo code` command.
    2. When prompted "What's the name of your extension?", the attacker provides a malicious payload, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('Vulnerable!')>`.
    3. The attacker continues to answer the subsequent prompts to complete the extension generation.
    4. The generator uses the provided malicious name (and potentially description) and injects it into template files, such as `README.md` and `package.json`, using EJS templating with `<%= ... %>` which does not perform HTML escaping.
    5. When a victim opens the generated extension folder in VS Code and previews the `README.md` file, or if the extension manifest (`package.json`) is processed by VS Code in a vulnerable manner, the injected HTML or JavaScript code gets executed within the VS Code environment.

- Impact:
    - High. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the VS Code application when a user opens or previews files of a generated extension. This could lead to information disclosure, further exploitation of VS Code vulnerabilities, or other malicious actions within the user's VS Code environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The project does not sanitize user inputs for extension display name and description before using them in templates.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Implement proper input sanitization for user-provided `extensionDisplayName` and `extensionDescription` in `generators/app/prompts.js`. This should include escaping HTML special characters to prevent HTML injection.
    - Context-aware output encoding: Modify the templates to use context-aware output encoding. For HTML templates (like README.md), use HTML escaping for user-provided values. If EJS is used, consider using `<%- ... %>` for HTML escaping or implement a custom escaping function.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to run the `yo code` generator.
    - A victim must open the generated extension project in VS Code and preview a file containing the injected payload, such as `README.md`.

- Source code analysis:
    1. `generators/app/prompts.js`:
        - Functions `askForExtensionDisplayName` and `askForExtensionDescription` gather user input using `generator.prompt`.
        - The input values are stored directly into the `extensionConfig` object without any sanitization or escaping.
        ```javascript
        export function askForExtensionDisplayName(generator, extensionConfig) {
            // ...
            return generator.prompt({
                type: 'input',
                name: 'displayName',
                message: 'What\'s the name of your extension?',
                default: nameFromFolder
            }).then(displayNameAnswer => {
                extensionConfig.displayName = displayNameAnswer.displayName; // Unsanitized input
            });
        }

        export function askForExtensionDescription(generator, extensionConfig) {
            // ...
            return generator.prompt({
                type: 'input',
                name: 'description',
                message: 'What\'s the description of your extension?',
                default: ''
            }).then(descriptionAnswer => {
                extensionConfig.description = descriptionAnswer.description; // Unsanitized input
            });
        }
        ```
    2. `generators/app/generate-command-ts.js` (and similar generator files):
        - The `writing` function uses `generator.fs.copyTpl` to copy template files and apply templating.
        - The `extensionConfig` object, containing the unsanitized user inputs, is passed directly to `copyTpl`.
        ```javascript
        writing: (generator, extensionConfig) => {
            // ...
            generator.fs.copyTpl(generator.templatePath('README.md'), generator.destinationPath('README.md'), extensionConfig); // extensionConfig with unsanitized input is used in templating
            generator.fs.copyTpl(generator.templatePath('package.json'), generator.destinationPath('package.json'), extensionConfig); // extensionConfig with unsanitized input is used in templating
            // ...
        }
        ```
    3. Template files (e.g., `generators/app/templates/ext-language/README.md`):
        - Templates like `README.md` use `<%= name %>` and `<%= description %>` to output the extension name and description.
        - The `<%= ... %>` syntax in EJS performs unescaped output, meaning any HTML or JavaScript code in `extensionConfig.displayName` or `extensionConfig.description` will be rendered as code, not as plain text.

        ```markdown
        # <%= name %> README  <%# Unescaped output of extensionConfig.displayName %>

        This is the README for your extension "<%= name %>". <%# Unescaped output of extensionConfig.displayName %> After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.
        ```

- Security test case:
    1. Install the generator globally: `npm install -g generator-code`
    2. Run the generator: `yo code`
    3. At the prompt "What's the name of your extension?", enter the payload: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('Vulnerable to Template Injection!')">`
    4. Complete the remaining prompts with default values.
    5. Navigate to the newly generated extension folder.
    6. Open VS Code and open the generated extension folder.
    7. Open the `README.md` file.
    8. Open the preview of the `README.md` file (using "Open Preview" or "Open to the Side Preview" command).
    9. Observe if an alert dialog with the message "Vulnerable to Template Injection!" appears. If the alert appears, the template injection vulnerability is confirmed.
