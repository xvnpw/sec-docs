# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/typescript

## Threat: [Revealing Source Code via Exposed Source Maps](./threats/revealing_source_code_via_exposed_source_maps.md)

*   **Threat:** Revealing Source Code via Exposed Source Maps
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to publicly available source map files (.map) generated by the TypeScript compiler. These files, a direct output of the TypeScript compilation process, allow the attacker to reconstruct the original TypeScript source code. This enables them to understand the application's logic, identify security vulnerabilities, and potentially extract sensitive information or API keys embedded within the code.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Complete exposure of the application's source code, making it significantly easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities. Potential leakage of sensitive information like API keys or business logic.
    *   **Affected Component:** TypeScript Compiler (specifically the `sourcemap` generation feature).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucially**, ensure that the `sourcemap` compiler option is disabled for production builds.
        *   Implement strict build pipeline configurations to prevent the generation or deployment of source map files to production environments.
        *   If source maps are absolutely necessary for debugging production issues, store them securely on internal systems with restricted access, and never deploy them publicly.

## Threat: [Exploiting Compiler Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Compiler Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a security vulnerability within the TypeScript compiler itself (the code hosted on the provided GitHub repository). This could involve crafting specific TypeScript code that, when processed by a vulnerable compiler version, leads to arbitrary code execution during the compilation process, allows for the injection of malicious code into the output, or compromises the build environment.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Compromise of the build environment, potentially leading to the injection of malicious code into the final application artifacts. This can result in a supply chain attack where users unknowingly download and run compromised software.
    *   **Affected Component:** TypeScript Compiler (the core compilation logic and potentially specific modules within the compiler).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the TypeScript compiler updated to the latest stable version. Regularly monitor the official TypeScript repository and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement security best practices for the build environment, such as using isolated and hardened build servers.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on the TypeScript compiler codebase itself (if feasible) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Verify the integrity of the TypeScript compiler binary used in the build process.
