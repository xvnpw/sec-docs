# Attack Surface Analysis for microsoft/typescript

## Attack Surface: [Dependency on Malicious `@types` Packages](./attack_surfaces/dependency_on_malicious__@types__packages.md)

*   **Description:**  The project relies on type definition packages (`@types/*`) from the npm registry. If a malicious actor compromises or uploads a malicious `@types` package, it can introduce vulnerabilities into the project.
    *   **How TypeScript Contributes:** TypeScript projects heavily rely on these type definitions for static typing. A compromised package can inject malicious code that executes during installation or influence the compilation process.
    *   **Example:** A malicious `@types/react` package could contain code that exfiltrates environment variables during the `npm install` or `yarn install` phase.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical. Could lead to code execution during build or runtime, data exfiltration, or supply chain compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the publishers and maintainers of `@types` dependencies.
        *   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Consider using a dependency vulnerability scanning service.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Use a private npm registry or a repository manager to control the dependencies.
        *   Regularly update dependencies, but review changes carefully.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler) Binary](./attack_surfaces/compromised__tsc___typescript_compiler__binary.md)

*   **Description:** The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) is a crucial tool in the development process. If the downloaded or used `tsc` binary is compromised, it could inject malicious code into the compiled JavaScript output.
    *   **How TypeScript Contributes:**  TypeScript code *must* be compiled by `tsc` to produce runnable JavaScript. A compromised compiler has direct control over the final output.
    *   **Example:** A compromised `tsc` binary could inject code into every compiled JavaScript file that sends application data to an external server.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the application's functionality and security.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify the integrity of the `tsc` binary using checksums or signatures provided by the official TypeScript team.
        *   Download `tsc` from trusted sources (e.g., official npm registry).
        *   Use a locked-down build environment to minimize the risk of tampering.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for the build process.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Source Code via Source Maps](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_source_code_via_source_maps.md)

*   **Description:** TypeScript can generate source maps, which map the compiled JavaScript back to the original TypeScript source code. If these source maps are unintentionally deployed to production, they expose the application's source code.
    *   **How TypeScript Contributes:** TypeScript's compilation process is the source of these source maps.
    *   **Example:** Attackers can download the source maps from a production website and analyze the TypeScript code to find vulnerabilities, API keys, or sensitive logic.
    *   **Impact:** High. Reveals internal logic, potential vulnerabilities, and secrets, making exploitation easier.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure source maps are **never** deployed to production environments.
        *   Configure build processes to exclude source map generation for production builds.
        *   Verify the deployment process to prevent accidental inclusion of source map files.
        *   Implement security headers like `X-SourceMap` to prevent browsers from automatically fetching source maps.
