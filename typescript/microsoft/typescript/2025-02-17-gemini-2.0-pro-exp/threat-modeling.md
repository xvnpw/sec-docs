# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/typescript

## Threat: [any Type Bypass Leading to Type Confusion (and Potential Code Injection)](./threats/any_type_bypass_leading_to_type_confusion__and_potential_code_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides unexpected input to a function or variable typed as `any`.  The code then attempts to use this value as if it were a different type.  If the `any` typed value is later used in a context where it's treated as executable code (e.g., `eval`, `Function` constructor), and the attacker can control the input, they might be able to inject malicious code. This is a *direct* exploitation of TypeScript's `any` type.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Runtime Errors:** Application crashes or throws exceptions.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Leading to data corruption or incorrect results.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Unhandled runtime errors can make the application unresponsive.
    *   **Potential Code Injection (Rare, but possible):** If the attacker controls input to an `any` type that is later executed, they could inject malicious code.
*   **TypeScript Component Affected:**
    *   Functions, variables, or class properties declared with the `any` type.
    *   Code that interacts with external data without proper type validation *before* assigning to an `any` type.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for code injection and DoS if misused with external data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize `any`:** Use the `no-explicit-any` linting rule.
    *   **Prefer `unknown`:** Use `unknown` and force explicit type narrowing.
    *   **Type Guards:** Implement type guards (`typeof`, `instanceof`, custom functions) for runtime type checking.
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data *before* it's assigned to an `any` or `unknown` type.

## Threat: [Incorrect Type Assertion (Casting) Leading to Logic Errors and Potential Security Bypass](./threats/incorrect_type_assertion__casting__leading_to_logic_errors_and_potential_security_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input that, when incorrectly cast to a different type, causes the application to behave in an unintended way. This bypasses TypeScript's compile-time checks. If the incorrectly cast value is used in a security check (e.g., authorization logic), it might bypass the intended security controls. This is a *direct* misuse of TypeScript's type assertion feature.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Runtime Errors:** Accessing non-existent properties leads to `undefined` values.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Application logic breaks down.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Runtime errors can crash the application.
    *   **Security Bypass (Potentially):** If the incorrectly cast value is used in a security check, it might bypass security controls.
*   **TypeScript Component Affected:**
    *   Code that uses type assertions (`value as Type` or `<Type>value`).
    *   Functions that receive data from external sources and cast it without sufficient validation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (especially if used in security-sensitive contexts).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prefer Type Guards:** Use type guards instead of type assertions.
    *   **Runtime Validation:** Add runtime checks *even after* a type assertion.
    *   **Defensive Programming:** Handle cases where the asserted type might be incorrect.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate input *before* any type assertions.

## Threat: [Malicious TypeScript Compiler or Plugin](./threats/malicious_typescript_compiler_or_plugin.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the build process by replacing the official TypeScript compiler with a malicious version or by installing a malicious plugin.  This malicious component injects malicious code into the compiled JavaScript output *during the compilation process*. This is a *direct* attack on the TypeScript tooling.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** The injected code runs in the target environment (browser or server), giving the attacker complete control.
*   **TypeScript Component Affected:**
    *   The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).
    *   Any installed TypeScript compiler plugins.
    *   The entire build process that uses TypeScript.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Official Source:** Use the official TypeScript compiler from Microsoft.
    *   **Integrity Verification:** Verify the integrity of the compiler and plugins (checksums, digital signatures).
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Carefully vet any third-party plugins.
    *   **Secure Build Environment:** Use a secure and isolated build environment.
    *   **Code Signing:** Sign the compiled JavaScript code (though this is post-compilation, it helps detect tampering).
