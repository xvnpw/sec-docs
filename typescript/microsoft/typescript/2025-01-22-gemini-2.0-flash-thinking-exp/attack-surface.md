# Attack Surface Analysis for microsoft/typescript

## Attack Surface: [TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/typescript_compiler___tsc___vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities within the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) can allow for malicious code injection during the compilation process, leading to compromised JavaScript output and potential supply chain attacks.
*   **TypeScript Contribution:** `tsc` is the core engine that transforms TypeScript code into executable JavaScript. Any vulnerability in its parsing, type checking, or code generation directly impacts the security of all applications built with it.
*   **Example:** A maliciously crafted TypeScript file exploits a code execution vulnerability in `tsc`'s type checking engine. When compiled with a vulnerable `tsc` version, it injects arbitrary JavaScript code into the output, which could be used to backdoor applications or steal developer credentials during the build process.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution during build, supply chain compromise, potential for widespread application backdooring, leakage of sensitive build environment data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   **Immediately Update `tsc`:**  Prioritize updating to the latest stable version of the TypeScript compiler as soon as security patches are released.
        *   **Security Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and announcements related to TypeScript and the `tsc` compiler from official sources and reputable security organizations.
        *   **Isolated Build Environments:**  Utilize containerized or virtualized build environments to limit the potential damage if the compiler is compromised. This can prevent malicious code from spreading beyond the build system.
        *   **Compiler Integrity Checks (Advanced):** For highly sensitive environments, consider implementing mechanisms to verify the integrity of the `tsc` binary itself before use, although this is complex and less common.

## Attack Surface: [Type Definition (`.d.ts`) Poisoning - Leading to Critical Type Confusion](./attack_surfaces/type_definition____d_ts___poisoning_-_leading_to_critical_type_confusion.md)

*   **Description:**  Compromised or maliciously crafted type definition files (`.d.ts`), especially for widely used libraries, can lead to critical type confusion vulnerabilities. This can trick the TypeScript compiler into allowing unsafe code that results in severe runtime vulnerabilities in the generated JavaScript.
*   **TypeScript Contribution:** TypeScript's type system relies entirely on `.d.ts` files for understanding external JavaScript libraries. If these definitions are poisoned to misrepresent the actual behavior of the library, TypeScript's safety guarantees are undermined, potentially introducing critical flaws.
*   **Example:** A compromised `@types/react` package contains a `.d.ts` file that incorrectly defines the props of a core React component, allowing developers to pass incorrect data types without TypeScript flagging errors. This leads to a critical type confusion vulnerability in the React application, such as a prototype pollution vulnerability or a bypass of input validation, exploitable for Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical**.  Introduction of severe runtime vulnerabilities (e.g., prototype pollution, RCE), bypass of security mechanisms, data corruption, application instability, supply chain compromise. The severity escalates to critical when type confusion directly leads to exploitable security flaws like RCE.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   **Extreme Caution with `@types/*` Dependencies:** Exercise extreme caution when adding or updating `@types/*` dependencies, especially for critical libraries. Verify the publisher and source if possible.
        *   **Security Audits of `@types/*` Updates:**  Thoroughly review changes in `.d.ts` files during dependency updates, looking for suspicious or unexpected modifications, especially in type definitions for security-sensitive APIs.
        *   **Dependency Pinning and Lock Files:** Use lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent versions of `@types/*` packages and prevent unexpected updates that might introduce poisoned definitions.
        *   **Community Scrutiny and Reputation:** Favor `@types/*` packages from reputable sources with strong community backing and active maintenance. Be wary of less popular or unmaintained packages.
        *   **Runtime Type Checking (Defense in Depth):**  While TypeScript aims to prevent type errors at compile time, consider adding runtime type checks for critical data inputs and operations in the generated JavaScript as a defense-in-depth measure, especially when dealing with external libraries where type definitions might be compromised.

## Attack Surface: [`tsconfig.json` Misconfiguration Leading to Critical Information Exposure](./attack_surfaces/_tsconfig_json__misconfiguration_leading_to_critical_information_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical misconfigurations in the `tsconfig.json` file, particularly regarding source map generation and output directory settings, can lead to severe information exposure vulnerabilities, revealing sensitive source code and potentially secrets embedded within.
*   **TypeScript Contribution:** `tsconfig.json` directly controls crucial aspects of the TypeScript compilation process, including output generation and debugging aids like source maps. Incorrect settings can unintentionally expose sensitive development-time information in production environments.
*   **Example:** `tsconfig.json` is misconfigured to generate source maps (`"sourceMap": true`) and output them to the publicly accessible web server root (`"outDir": "./public"`). Attackers can access these source maps to reconstruct the entire TypeScript source code, including sensitive business logic, API keys, and internal algorithms, facilitating further attacks or intellectual property theft.
*   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical**.  Exposure of complete application source code, including sensitive business logic, algorithms, API keys, and internal documentation. This can enable attackers to identify vulnerabilities more easily, bypass security measures, and potentially gain deeper access to systems or data.  In cases of exposed secrets, the impact becomes critical.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   **Strict `tsconfig.json` Review and Hardening:**  Thoroughly review and harden `tsconfig.json` configurations before deploying to production. Pay special attention to source map settings and output directories.
        *   **Disable Source Maps in Production:**  Ensure source map generation is explicitly disabled (`"sourceMap": false`) for production builds. If source maps are needed for error monitoring, store them securely and restrict access.
        *   **Secure Output Directories:**  Carefully configure the `"outDir"` and ensure that compiled JavaScript files and any generated artifacts are placed in secure locations, inaccessible to unauthorized users or public access in production environments.
        *   **Automated `tsconfig.json` Auditing:**  Integrate automated checks into the build pipeline to audit `tsconfig.json` for insecure configurations and enforce secure settings.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Output:** Apply the principle of least privilege to the output directory and ensure only necessary services or users have access to the compiled JavaScript and related files in production.
