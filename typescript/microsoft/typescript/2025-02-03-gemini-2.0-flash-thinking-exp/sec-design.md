# BUSINESS POSTURE

The TypeScript project aims to enhance JavaScript development by providing a statically typed superset of JavaScript. It is designed to improve code quality, developer productivity, and maintainability of large JavaScript projects. TypeScript enables developers to catch errors early in the development cycle, improve code readability, and facilitate better collaboration.

Business Priorities:
- Enhance developer productivity and efficiency in JavaScript development.
- Improve the quality and maintainability of JavaScript codebases.
- Ensure seamless interoperability with existing JavaScript ecosystems and libraries.
- Promote wider adoption of TypeScript within the JavaScript development community.
- Maintain and evolve the TypeScript language and compiler to meet the changing needs of developers.

Business Risks:
- Adoption risk: If developers do not widely adopt TypeScript, the project may fail to achieve its goals.
- Security vulnerabilities in the TypeScript compiler or language service could negatively impact projects using TypeScript.
- Compatibility issues with existing JavaScript libraries or runtimes could hinder adoption and create friction for developers.
- Performance overhead introduced by the TypeScript compiler or runtime type checking could be a concern for some applications.
- Community fragmentation if the TypeScript project diverges significantly from JavaScript standards or community expectations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository access control and vulnerability scanning. (Implemented: GitHub repository settings)
- security control: Open source project with public code review process, allowing community scrutiny for potential security issues. (Implemented: GitHub pull requests and issue tracking)
- security control: Usage of standard build tools and package management (npm) which have their own security considerations and best practices. (Implemented: package.json, build scripts)
- security control: Regular updates and maintenance of the TypeScript compiler and related tools, addressing reported security vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub releases, issue tracking)
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential for supply chain vulnerabilities through dependencies in build and development tools.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the TypeScript compiler code.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the TypeScript compiler and related infrastructure.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process for security issues reported by the community.
- security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to manage and monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Enforce code signing for published npm packages to ensure integrity and authenticity.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the TypeScript language or compiler itself. Authentication is relevant for access to the GitHub repository and related infrastructure, which is managed by GitHub and Microsoft.
- Authorization: Access to the TypeScript GitHub repository and related resources should be based on the principle of least privilege. Contribution and commit access should be carefully managed.
- Input Validation: The TypeScript compiler must perform robust input validation to prevent malicious code injection or denial-of-service attacks through crafted TypeScript code or compiler options. This is critical to ensure the compiler itself is secure and doesn't introduce vulnerabilities into compiled JavaScript code.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for the TypeScript language or compiler itself. However, if TypeScript or related tools handle sensitive data (e.g., during build processes or in future features), appropriate cryptographic measures should be implemented. For now, focus on secure communication channels (HTTPS) for distribution and updates.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Developer"
        DevMachine[Developer Machine]
    end
    subgraph "GitHub"
        GitHubRepo[GitHub Repository]
        GitHubActions[GitHub Actions CI]
    end
    subgraph "npm Registry"
        npmRegistry[npm Registry]
    end

    DevMachine -- "Code Commit" --> GitHubRepo
    GitHubRepo -- "Webhook" --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions --> GitHubRepo
    GitHubActions -- "Build & Test" --> BuildArtifacts[Build Artifacts]
    GitHubActions -- "npm publish" --> npmRegistry
    BuildArtifacts --> npmRegistry
```

Build Process:

1. Developer commits code changes to the GitHub Repository.
2. GitHub triggers a webhook to GitHub Actions upon code changes (e.g., push, pull request merge).
3. GitHub Actions CI pipeline is initiated.
4. GitHub Actions checks out the code from the GitHub Repository.
5. GitHub Actions performs build steps:
    - Install dependencies.
    - Compile TypeScript code.
    - Run unit tests and integration tests.
    - Perform static analysis and linting.
    - Potentially run SAST scanners.
6. If all checks pass, GitHub Actions builds release artifacts (npm packages).
7. GitHub Actions authenticates to npm registry using securely stored credentials.
8. GitHub Actions publishes the build artifacts (TypeScript packages) to the npm registry.

Build Security Controls:
- security control: Secure GitHub repository with access control and branch protection. (Implemented: GitHub repository settings)
- security control: Use of GitHub Actions for automated and reproducible builds. (Implemented: GitHub Actions workflows)
- security control: Secrets management in GitHub Actions to securely store npm publishing credentials. (Implemented: GitHub Actions secrets)
- security control: Automated testing (unit tests, integration tests) to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. (Implemented: Test suites in the repository, executed in CI)
- security control: Static analysis and linting tools to identify potential code quality and security issues. (Implemented: Linters and static analyzers in the build pipeline)
- security control: (Recommended) Integrate SAST tools into the build pipeline to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: (Recommended) Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities during the build process.
- security control: (Recommended) Code signing of npm packages before publishing to ensure integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing a reliable and secure TypeScript compiler and language service to the developer community.
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the TypeScript npm packages.
- Ensuring the ongoing development and evolution of the TypeScript language.

Data to Protect:
- TypeScript source code: Intellectual property, vulnerabilities in source code could lead to compiler vulnerabilities. Sensitivity: High.
- Build artifacts (npm packages): Integrity and authenticity are crucial to prevent supply chain attacks. Sensitivity: High.
- Website content and documentation: Publicly available, but integrity and availability are important for user trust. Sensitivity: Medium.
- Developer credentials and secrets used in the build and publishing process: Confidentiality is critical to prevent unauthorized package publishing or access to internal systems. Sensitivity: High.

Data Sensitivity:
- TypeScript source code: Highly sensitive (Intellectual Property, potential vulnerabilities).
- Build artifacts (npm packages): Highly sensitive (Integrity, supply chain security).
- Website content: Medium sensitivity (Public information, brand reputation).
- Developer credentials/secrets: Highly sensitive (Confidentiality, access control).
