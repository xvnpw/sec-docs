# Threat Model Analysis for microsoft/typescript

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in TypeScript Compiler or Build Tools](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_typescript_compiler_or_build_tools.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) or other build tools (npm, yarn, bundlers, linters). By compromising these tools, an attacker could inject malicious code into the build process. This could lead to supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in the application during compilation, or denial of service by crashing the build process. For example, a vulnerability in `tsc` could be exploited to inject malicious JavaScript code into the compiled output.
**Impact:** Supply chain compromise, malicious code injection, denial of service, code tampering.
**TypeScript Component Affected:** TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`), Build Process, Tooling Ecosystem
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the TypeScript compiler and build tools up-to-date with security patches.
*   Regularly audit dependencies of the build process using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
*   Use trusted and reputable sources for build tools and dependencies.
*   Implement build process integrity checks (e.g., checksum verification, signed artifacts).
*   Use containerization and isolated build environments to limit the impact of compromised tools.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in TypeScript Libraries and Type Definitions](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_typescript_libraries_and_type_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in JavaScript libraries or, less likely but still possible, in TypeScript type definition files (`.d.ts`) used as dependencies.  Compromised JavaScript libraries can directly introduce vulnerabilities. While less direct, malicious type definitions could potentially mislead developers or introduce subtle type-related issues that could be exploited. For example, a vulnerability in a popular JavaScript library used in the TypeScript project could be exploited by an attacker.
**Impact:**  Vulnerability introduction through dependencies, potential for malicious code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
**TypeScript Component Affected:** Dependency Management, npm Packages, Type Definition Files (`.d.ts`)
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly audit and update dependencies, including JavaScript libraries and type definitions.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
*   Prefer reputable and well-maintained libraries and type definition sources.
*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the development pipeline.
*   Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN-hosted dependencies.

## Threat: [Over-reliance on TypeScript for Input Validation and Sanitization](./threats/over-reliance_on_typescript_for_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit the lack of runtime input validation and sanitization if developers mistakenly believe TypeScript types are sufficient. Since TypeScript types are erased at runtime, they do not provide runtime input validation. If developers skip runtime validation and sanitization, assuming TypeScript types are enough, attackers can inject malicious data. For example, if a form field is typed as a validated string in TypeScript, but the JavaScript code doesn't actually validate the input at runtime, an attacker can submit malicious input that bypasses the intended validation, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities.
**Impact:** Injection attacks (XSS, SQL Injection if backend is also affected indirectly), data corruption, unexpected application behavior.
**TypeScript Component Affected:** Type System, Input Handling, Runtime JavaScript Code
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always perform runtime input validation and sanitization in JavaScript.
*   Use validation libraries and techniques appropriate for JavaScript runtime environments.
*   Educate developers that TypeScript types are not a substitute for runtime security measures.
*   Integrate input validation libraries and practices into the development workflow.
