### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Prototype Pollution in Command URI Deserialization
- Description:
    1. The `CommandUri.decodeCommandArgument` function in `/code/src/extension/vscode/commandUri.ts` deserializes command arguments received in command URIs.
    2. This function uses `JSON.parse` followed by a custom `deserialize` function to process the URI query component.
    3. If the `deserialize` function is vulnerable to prototype pollution (e.g., due to improper handling of `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`), an attacker can craft a malicious command URI.
    4. By including a crafted JSON payload in the command URI's query component, an attacker can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` or other prototypes during the deserialization process.
    5. This prototype pollution can lead to various impacts, depending on how the polluted properties are used within the VSCode extension or VSCode itself.
- Impact:
    - Prototype pollution can lead to unexpected behavior in the VSCode extension or even VSCode itself.
    - Depending on the polluted property and how it's used, this could potentially lead to:
        - Information disclosure
        - Code execution under certain conditions (if polluted properties are used in sensitive contexts)
        - Denial of service (if polluted properties cause crashes or infinite loops)
        - Privilege escalation (in some scenarios, though less likely in this context)
    - The severity depends on the specific impact of the polluted prototype. Given the potential for code execution or other significant impacts, a high rank is justified until proven otherwise.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses `JSON.parse` and `deserialize` on the command argument string without sanitization against prototype pollution attacks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation of the command argument string to prevent prototype pollution payloads (e.g., filtering out `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` properties).
    - Use of safer deserialization methods that are not susceptible to prototype pollution, or hardening the `deserialize` function to prevent prototype pollution.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the command URI that is processed by the VSCode extension.
    - This could be achieved if the extension:
        - Handles command URIs from external sources (e.g., webviews, markdown links, other extensions).
        - Registers a command that accepts and processes command URIs.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/extension/vscode/commandUri.ts`
    ```typescript
    static decodeCommandArgument(commandArgumentString: string) {
        return commandArgumentString ? deserialize(JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(commandArgumentString))) as CommandArgumentValue : undefined;
    }
    ```
    - The `decodeCommandArgument` function takes a `commandArgumentString` as input, which is expected to be the query part of a command URI.
    - It first decodes the URI component using `decodeURIComponent`.
    - Then, it parses the decoded string as JSON using `JSON.parse`.
    - Finally, it deserializes the parsed JSON object using the `deserialize` function.
    - If the `deserialize` function does not prevent prototype pollution, and if the JSON payload contains properties like `__proto__`, the prototype of `Object.prototype` or other objects could be polluted.

    2. Visualization:
    ```
    External Input (Command URI) --> commandUri.ts (CommandUri.parse) --> commandUri.ts (CommandUri.decodeCommandArgument) --> decodeURIComponent --> JSON.parse --> deserialize --> Prototype Pollution
    ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Assume a simplified scenario where you can directly call `CommandUri.decodeCommandArgument` with a crafted string. In a real VSCode extension, you would need to trigger the command URI parsing mechanism of the extension, which is extension-specific. For this test case, we will focus on directly testing the `decodeCommandArgument` function.
    2. **Craft Malicious Payload:** Create a malicious JSON payload that attempts to pollute the prototype of `Object` using `__proto__`. For example: `commandArg='{"__proto__":{"polluted":"true"}}'`.
    3. **Encode Payload:** Encode the payload as a URI component: `encodedCommandArg=encodeURIComponent(commandArg)`. This results in `"%7B%22__proto__%22%3A%7B%22polluted%22%3A%22true%22%7D%7D"`.
    4. **Construct Malicious Command URI Query:** Create a command URI query string with the encoded payload: `commandUriQuery="?" + encodedCommandArg`. This results in `"?%7B%22__proto__%22%3A%7B%22polluted%22%3A%7B%22polluted%22%3A%22true%22%7D%7D"`.
    5. **Call `decodeCommandArgument`:**  In a test environment (e.g., Node.js environment where you can load the `commandUri.ts` file), call `CommandUri.decodeCommandArgument(commandUriQuery.substring(1))`. Note: `substring(1)` is used to remove the leading '?' to pass only the query string to the function.
    6. **Verify Prototype Pollution:** After calling `decodeCommandArgument`, check if the `Object.prototype` has been polluted. You can do this by checking if the property `polluted` exists on a newly created object: `console.log(({}).polluted)`.
    7. **Expected Outcome:** If the `deserialize` function is vulnerable to prototype pollution, step 6 should output `"true"`. If it outputs `undefined`, then the prototype pollution was not successful in this test.

    **Test Case Step-by-step (Conceptual):**

    1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
    2. Create a test file (e.g., `test-prototype-pollution.js`) with the following content:
    ```javascript
    const { CommandUri } = require('./out/extension/vscode/commandUri'); // Adjust path if needed

    const maliciousPayload = '{"__proto__":{"polluted":"true"}}';
    const encodedPayload = encodeURIComponent(maliciousPayload);
    const commandUriQuery = "?" + encodedPayload;

    CommandUri.decodeCommandArgument(commandUriQuery.substring(1));

    console.log(({}).polluted); // Check if prototype is polluted
    ```
    3. Run the test file using Node.js: `node test-prototype-pollution.js`
    4. **Observe the output:** If the output is `true`, it indicates that the `deserialize` function, when used in `CommandUri.decodeCommandArgument`, is vulnerable to prototype pollution via `__proto__`. If the output is `undefined`, the vulnerability is not confirmed by this test, or the prototype pollution is not exploitable in this way.

    **Note:** This test case focuses on demonstrating potential prototype pollution. A real-world exploit would depend on how this prototype pollution can be leveraged within the VSCode extension or VSCode environment to achieve a security impact. Further investigation of the `deserialize` function and its usage is needed to fully assess the vulnerability and its exploitability.
