Based on your instructions, let's review the provided vulnerability list and filter it.

**Vulnerability 1: Markdown Injection in Container Tooltips**

* **Is it caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES?** No. This is a vulnerability in the extension itself due to insufficient input sanitization.
* **Is it only missing documentation to mitigate?** No. It required a code fix.
* **Is it a denial of service vulnerability?** No. It's a code injection vulnerability.
* **Is it valid and not already mitigated?** No, it is already mitigated in version 1.25.2.
* **Does it have a vulnerability rank at least: high?** Yes, the vulnerability rank is High.

According to your instructions to "Include only vulnerabilities that: - are valid and not already mitigated.", and since "Markdown Injection in Container Tooltips" is **already mitigated**, it should be **excluded** from the updated list.

As this is the only vulnerability provided in the initial list, and it's being excluded based on your criteria, the resulting list will be empty.
