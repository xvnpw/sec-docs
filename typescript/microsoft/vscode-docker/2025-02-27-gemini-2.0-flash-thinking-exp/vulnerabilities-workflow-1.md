### Combined Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Potential Command Injection in .NET SDK Task Execution

- Description: The `.NET SDK Task Provider` uses `dotnet` and `docker run` commands constructed programmatically. While arguments are quoted using `Shell.getShellOrDefault().quote()`, a vulnerability might exist if the image name, which is derived from user workspace folder name, is not properly sanitized before being used in `getNetSdkBuildCommand` and `getNetSdkRunCommand`. If a workspace folder name contains malicious characters, these could potentially lead to command injection despite the quoting.
- Impact: An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands into the `dotnet` or `docker run` commands executed by the extension, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host system or within the container. This could allow for container escape, data breach, or system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: The code uses `Shell.getShellOrDefault().quote()` to quote arguments passed to shell commands in `getNetSdkBuildCommand` and `getNetSdkRunCommand`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Sanitize the image name derived from the workspace folder name to ensure it does not contain characters that could bypass quoting or introduce command injection vulnerabilities.
    - Implement input validation for workspace folder names to restrict potentially dangerous characters.
    - Conduct thorough security testing, specifically focused on workspace folder names containing special characters and command injection attempts in .NET SDK tasks.
- Preconditions:
    - A user must open a workspace folder with a name containing malicious characters.
    - The user must execute a `.NET SDK` task (e.g., debug or run) in this workspace.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/tasks/netSdk/netSdkTaskUtils.ts`
    - Functions: `getNetSdkBuildCommand`, `getNetSdkRunCommand`

    ```typescript
    export async function getNetSdkBuildCommand(isProjectWebApp: boolean, imageName: string): Promise<string> {
        // ...
        const args = composeArgs(
            withArg('dotnet', 'publish'),
            withNamedArg('--os', await normalizeOsToRidOs()),
            withNamedArg('--arch', await normalizeArchitectureToRidArchitecture()),
            withArg(publishFlag),
            withNamedArg('--configuration', configuration),
            withNamedArg('-p:ContainerImageTag', NetSdkDefaultImageTag, { assignValue: true })
        )();

        const quotedArgs = Shell.getShellOrDefault().quote(args);
        return quotedArgs.join(' ');
    }

    export async function getNetSdkRunCommand(isProjectWebApp: boolean, imageName: string): Promise<string> {
        const client = await ext.runtimeManager.getClient();

        const options: RunContainerCommandOptions = {
            detached: true,
            publishAllPorts: true,
            name: getDefaultContainerName(imageName, NetSdkDefaultImageTag), // imageName is used here
            environmentVariables: {},
            removeOnExit: true,
            imageRef: getImageNameWithTag(imageName, NetSdkDefaultImageTag), // imageName is used here
            labels: defaultVsCodeLabels,
            mounts: await getRemoteDebuggerMount(),
            entrypoint: await getDockerOSType() === 'windows' ? 'cmd.exe' : '/bin/sh'
        };

        const command = await client.runContainer(options);
        const quotedArgs = Shell.getShellOrDefault().quote(command.args);
        const commandLine = [client.commandName, ...quotedArgs].join(' ');
        return commandLine;
    }
    ```

    - File: `/code/src/tasks/TaskHelper.ts`
    - Function: `getDefaultImageName`

    ```typescript
    export function getDefaultImageName(appName: string, suffix?: string): string {
        const imageName = getValidImageName(appName); // appName comes from workspace folder name
        return suffix ? getImageNameWithTag(imageName, suffix) : imageName;
    }
    ```

    - The `imageName` in `getNetSdkRunCommand` options and `getNetSdkBuildCommand` is derived from `getDefaultImageName(context.folder.name, ...)` where `context.folder.name` is user-controlled workspace folder name.
    - While `getValidImageName` sanitizes the name for valid image name characters, it might not be sufficient to prevent command injection if malicious characters are crafted to exploit quoting mechanisms in shell execution.
    - Even with quoting, there might be edge cases where specially crafted folder names could lead to command injection.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new workspace folder with a malicious name, for example:  `pwned-folder-\`\`-$(touch /tmp/pwned)-``
    2. Open this workspace folder in VSCode.
    3. Create a new .NET Core project within this workspace folder.
    4. Attempt to debug or run the .NET Core project using the `.NET SDK Task Provider` (e.g., by running the `docker-run: debug` task).
    5. Observe if the command `touch /tmp/pwned` is executed on the host system.
    6. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it indicates a successful command injection vulnerability.
    7. To verify mitigation, implement input sanitization for workspace folder names and re-run the test to confirm the vulnerability is resolved and `/tmp/pwned` is not created.

#### 2. Container Path Traversal in `ContainerFilesProvider`

- Description:
    An attacker could potentially perform path traversal attacks when accessing files within Docker containers using the `docker://` URI scheme. By crafting a malicious URI with path traversal sequences (like `..`), an attacker might be able to access files and directories outside the intended container file system scope. This vulnerability can be triggered by any VS Code feature that utilizes the `docker://` file system provider, such as opening files in editor, file explorer in container view, or downloading container files.

- Impact:
    An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from within the container, potentially including application code, configuration files, or data. In some scenarios, depending on the application and container setup, read access might be leveraged to escalate to further attacks.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    The code uses `path.posix.join` and `path.win32.join` for path manipulation within containers, which should prevent simple path traversal in the join operation itself. However, the vulnerability might arise if the Docker engine or the `vscode-container-client` library does not properly sanitize or validate the paths provided to the Docker API when handling file system operations.

    Mitigation in: `/code/src/runtimes/files/ContainerFilesProvider.ts` and `/code/src/runtimes/files/DockerUri.ts` using `path.posix.join` and `path.win32.join`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    The project is missing explicit input validation and sanitization of the path component in the `docker://` URI within the `ContainerFilesProvider`.  There's no clear code that prevents path traversal attempts before passing the path to the Docker engine API calls. Input validation should be implemented to reject or sanitize paths containing `..` or other path traversal sequences. Deeper validation might also be needed in `vscode-container-client` to ensure backend API is safe.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft and use a `docker://` URI. This can be achieved by triggering any VS Code feature that uses the Docker extension's file system provider. For example, using "File: Open File" command and typing `docker://<container-id>/path/to/file`.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Entry Point:** The vulnerability exists in `/code/src/runtimes/files/ContainerFilesProvider.ts`, specifically in the `readFile` and `readDirectory` methods. These methods use `DockerUri.parse(uri)` to extract container ID and path from the provided URI.
    2. **Path Extraction:**  `DockerUri.parse` in `/code/src/runtimes/files/DockerUri.ts` simply extracts the path component of the URI without any sanitization.
    ```typescript
    public static parse(uri: vscode.Uri): DockerUri {
        const containerId = uri.authority;
        const path = uri.path; // Path is extracted directly
        const query = queryFromURLSearchParams(new URLSearchParams(uri.query));

        return DockerUri.create(containerId, path, query);
    }
    ```
    3. **Path Usage in API Calls:** The extracted path is directly used in API calls to the Docker engine (e.g., `client.readFile`, `client.listFiles`).
    ```typescript
    public async readFile(uri: vscode.Uri): Promise<Uint8Array> {
        const dockerUri = DockerUri.parse(uri);
        const containerOS = dockerUri.options?.containerOS || await getDockerOSType();

        // ...
        const generator = ext.streamWithDefaults(
            client => client.readFile({ // Extracted path is used here
                container: dockerUri.containerId,
                path: containerOS === 'windows' ? dockerUri.windowsPath : dockerUri.path, // dockerUri.path is used without sanitization
                operatingSystem: containerOS,
            }),
        );
        // ...
    }

    public async readDirectory(uri: vscode.Uri): Promise<[string, vscode.FileType][]> {
        const dockerUri = DockerUri.parse(uri);
        const containerOS = dockerUri.options?.containerOS || await getDockerOSType();

        const items: ListFilesItem[] = await ext.runWithDefaults(client =>
            client.listFiles({ // Extracted path is used here
                container: dockerUri.containerId,
                path: containerOS === 'windows' ? dockerUri.windowsPath : dockerUri.path, // dockerUri.path is used without sanitization
                operatingSystem: containerOS,
            }),
        );
        // ...
    }
    ```
    4. **Visualization:**

    ```
    Attacker crafted URI --> DockerUri.parse() --> Extracts Path (Unsanitized) --> ContainerFilesProvider.readFile/readDirectory --> Docker Engine API (Path used directly) --> Potential Path Traversal
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Run a Docker container (e.g., `docker run -d --name test-container alpine sleep infinity`).
    2. In VS Code, use the "File: Open File" command (Ctrl+O or Cmd+O).
    3. In the "File name" input box, enter the following URI, replacing `<container-id>` with the actual container ID of the running container from step 1: `docker://<container-id>/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
    4. If the vulnerability exists, VS Code will attempt to open the `/etc/passwd` file from the container in the editor, demonstrating path traversal.
    5. Verify that the opened file in VS Code editor contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file from within the container. This confirms the path traversal vulnerability.
