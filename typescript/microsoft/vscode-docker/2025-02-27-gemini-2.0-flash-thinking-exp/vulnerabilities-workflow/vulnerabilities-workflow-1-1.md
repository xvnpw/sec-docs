### Vulnerability List for VSCode Docker Extension

#### 1. Potential Command Injection in .NET SDK Task Execution

- Description: The `.NET SDK Task Provider` uses `dotnet` and `docker run` commands constructed programmatically. While arguments are quoted using `Shell.getShellOrDefault().quote()`, a vulnerability might exist if the image name, which is derived from user workspace folder name, is not properly sanitized before being used in `getNetSdkBuildCommand` and `getNetSdkRunCommand`. If a workspace folder name contains malicious characters, these could potentially lead to command injection despite the quoting.
- Impact: An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands into the `dotnet` or `docker run` commands executed by the extension, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host system or within the container. This could allow for container escape, data breach, or system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: The code uses `Shell.getShellOrDefault().quote()` to quote arguments passed to shell commands in `getNetSdkBuildCommand` and `getNetSdkRunCommand`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Sanitize the image name derived from the workspace folder name to ensure it does not contain characters that could bypass quoting or introduce command injection vulnerabilities.
    - Implement input validation for workspace folder names to restrict potentially dangerous characters.
    - Conduct thorough security testing, specifically focused on workspace folder names containing special characters and command injection attempts in .NET SDK tasks.
- Preconditions:
    - A user must open a workspace folder with a name containing malicious characters.
    - The user must execute a `.NET SDK` task (e.g., debug or run) in this workspace.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/tasks/netSdk/netSdkTaskUtils.ts`
    - Functions: `getNetSdkBuildCommand`, `getNetSdkRunCommand`

    ```typescript
    export async function getNetSdkBuildCommand(isProjectWebApp: boolean, imageName: string): Promise<string> {
        // ...
        const args = composeArgs(
            withArg('dotnet', 'publish'),
            withNamedArg('--os', await normalizeOsToRidOs()),
            withNamedArg('--arch', await normalizeArchitectureToRidArchitecture()),
            withArg(publishFlag),
            withNamedArg('--configuration', configuration),
            withNamedArg('-p:ContainerImageTag', NetSdkDefaultImageTag, { assignValue: true })
        )();

        const quotedArgs = Shell.getShellOrDefault().quote(args);
        return quotedArgs.join(' ');
    }

    export async function getNetSdkRunCommand(isProjectWebApp: boolean, imageName: string): Promise<string> {
        const client = await ext.runtimeManager.getClient();

        const options: RunContainerCommandOptions = {
            detached: true,
            publishAllPorts: true,
            name: getDefaultContainerName(imageName, NetSdkDefaultImageTag), // imageName is used here
            environmentVariables: {},
            removeOnExit: true,
            imageRef: getImageNameWithTag(imageName, NetSdkDefaultImageTag), // imageName is used here
            labels: defaultVsCodeLabels,
            mounts: await getRemoteDebuggerMount(),
            entrypoint: await getDockerOSType() === 'windows' ? 'cmd.exe' : '/bin/sh'
        };

        const command = await client.runContainer(options);
        const quotedArgs = Shell.getShellOrDefault().quote(command.args);
        const commandLine = [client.commandName, ...quotedArgs].join(' ');
        return commandLine;
    }
    ```

    - File: `/code/src/tasks/TaskHelper.ts`
    - Function: `getDefaultImageName`

    ```typescript
    export function getDefaultImageName(appName: string, suffix?: string): string {
        const imageName = getValidImageName(appName); // appName comes from workspace folder name
        return suffix ? getImageNameWithTag(imageName, suffix) : imageName;
    }
    ```

    - The `imageName` in `getNetSdkRunCommand` options and `getNetSdkBuildCommand` is derived from `getDefaultImageName(context.folder.name, ...)` where `context.folder.name` is user-controlled workspace folder name.
    - While `getValidImageName` sanitizes the name for valid image name characters, it might not be sufficient to prevent command injection if malicious characters are crafted to exploit quoting mechanisms in shell execution.
    - Even with quoting, there might be edge cases where specially crafted folder names could lead to command injection.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new workspace folder with a malicious name, for example:  `pwned-folder-\`\`-$(touch /tmp/pwned)-``
    2. Open this workspace folder in VSCode.
    3. Create a new .NET Core project within this workspace folder.
    4. Attempt to debug or run the .NET Core project using the `.NET SDK Task Provider` (e.g., by running the `docker-run: debug` task).
    5. Observe if the command `touch /tmp/pwned` is executed on the host system.
    6. If the file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it indicates a successful command injection vulnerability.
    7. To verify mitigation, implement input sanitization for workspace folder names and re-run the test to confirm the vulnerability is resolved and `/tmp/pwned` is not created.

    **Result**:  Based on the code review, the potential vulnerability exists due to the usage of workspace folder name to derive image names in `.NET SDK` tasks. Even with quoting, further investigation and testing are needed to ensure complete mitigation against command injection. This vulnerability is ranked high due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Conclusion**: A potential high-rank vulnerability related to command injection in .NET SDK task execution has been identified due to unsanitized workspace folder names being used in command construction. Further investigation and implementation of sanitization and input validation are recommended to mitigate this vulnerability.
