# Docker Extension Security Vulnerabilities

## 1. Command Injection via Certificate Paths in .NET Debugging

- **Description**: The extension processes certificate paths from project files without proper sanitization when launching debugging sessions for .NET applications. An attacker can craft a malicious project file with certificate paths containing command injection payloads.
  
- **Impact**: Remote code execution on the victim's machine. An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the VSCode process.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None identified in the codebase.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Input validation and sanitization for certificate paths before they're used in command construction.

- **Preconditions**: Victim must open a malicious repository containing crafted project files and attempt to debug a .NET application with the Docker extension.

- **Source Code Analysis**: In the debugging process for .NET applications, the extension reads certificate paths from project files and passes them to command construction without proper sanitization. When a user opens a malicious repository and starts debugging, the extension reads the certificate path from the project file, constructs a command with this path, and executes it. Since the certificate path is not sanitized, if it contains shell metacharacters like `; rm -rf /` or `$(malicious command)`, these will be executed by the shell when the command is run.

- **Security Test Case**: 
  1. Create a malicious repository with a .NET project file
  2. Edit the project file to include a certificate path with command injection payload like `cert.pfx;calc.exe`
  3. Push the repository to a public Git hosting service
  4. Send the repository link to the victim
  5. When the victim opens the repository and attempts to debug the .NET application with Docker extension, the malicious command will execute on their machine

## 2. Remote Code Execution via Malicious Server Ready Action Pattern

- **Description**: The server ready action feature allows specifying regex patterns to detect when a server is ready by monitoring logs. An attacker can craft a pattern that uses regex capture groups to extract and execute dangerous content from the logs.

- **Impact**: Remote code execution. When logs containing crafted content are processed, the regex pattern can extract and execute malicious commands.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None identified in the codebase.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Sanitization or validation of regex patterns used in server ready actions.

- **Preconditions**: Victim must open a malicious repository with a crafted debug configuration that includes a malicious server ready action pattern.

- **Source Code Analysis**: The serverReadyAction functionality in the extension allows for specifying patterns to detect when a server is ready. These patterns are processed as regex and can include capture groups. The extension extracts content matched by these capture groups and can use it in command execution contexts. An attacker can craft a pattern that specifically captures and executes malicious content from logs, leading to arbitrary code execution.

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Create a malicious repository with a launch.json file containing a crafted debug configuration
  2. Include a serverReadyAction with a pattern designed to capture and execute code, such as one that triggers command execution via regex backreferences
  3. Push the repository to a public Git hosting service
  4. Send the repository link to the victim
  5. When the victim opens the repository and starts a debug session, the malicious pattern will process logs and potentially execute injected commands

## 3. Command Injection via Container File Path Manipulation

- **Description**: When accessing files in containers, the extension constructs commands using file paths without adequate sanitization. An attacker can create container files with names containing command injection payloads.

- **Impact**: Remote code execution on the victim's machine through the injection of malicious commands.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None identified in the codebase.

- **Missing Mitigations**: Proper escaping and sanitization of file paths before using them in command construction.

- **Preconditions**: Victim must open a malicious repository containing a Docker configuration that references containers with specially crafted file paths.

- **Source Code Analysis**: The extension uses file paths from containers to construct commands that are executed on the host system. These file paths are not properly sanitized before being included in command strings. An attacker can create files with names containing command injection payloads (e.g., "; rm -rf / #") inside a container. When the victim interacts with these files through the extension, the malicious commands embedded in the filename will be executed.

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. Create a malicious Docker image that contains files with names designed for command injection
  2. Create a repository with Docker configurations that reference this malicious image
  3. Include files in the container with names like `file;calc.exe;.txt`
  4. Push the repository to a public Git hosting service
  5. Send the repository link to the victim
  6. When the victim opens the repository and interacts with the container files through the extension, the malicious commands will execute on their system
