- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in CppBuildTaskProvider
- Description:
The CppBuildTaskProvider uses `child_process.exec` to execute build tasks. The command string is constructed using user-provided settings like `compilerPath` and `compilerArgs` from `c_cpp_properties.json`, and potentially from custom configuration providers. If a malicious user or a compromised configuration provider can inject malicious commands into these settings, it could lead to arbitrary command execution on the machine running VSCode when a build task is triggered.

Step-by-step trigger:
1. An attacker compromises a user's workspace or tricks them into opening a workspace with a malicious `c_cpp_properties.json` or a malicious custom configuration provider is installed.
2. The malicious configuration injects shell commands into `compilerPath` or `compilerArgs`. For example, in `c_cpp_properties.json`, a user could modify `compilerPath` to: `"$(echo 'Malicious command executed') & <path to legitimate compiler>"`.
3. The user triggers a build task, either manually or via VSCode's auto-build features.
4. The `CustomBuildTaskTerminal` in `cppBuildTaskProvider.ts` executes the command string using `child_process.exec`.
5. Due to insufficient sanitization, the injected malicious command is executed alongside the intended build command.
- Impact:
Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, or further system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
The project attempts to quote the command using `util.buildShellCommandLine`. However, this quoting mechanism might not be sufficient to prevent all forms of command injection, especially in complex shell environments. The code also checks for trusted compiler paths, but this is for a different purpose (user notification) and doesn't directly mitigate command injection.
- Missing Mitigations:
- Input sanitization:  The `compilerPath` and `compilerArgs` from `c_cpp_properties.json` and custom configuration providers should be strictly validated and sanitized to prevent command injection.  Instead of just quoting the command, consider using `child_process.spawn` with properly separated command and arguments, avoiding the shell entirely.
- Allowlist for compiler paths: Implement a strict allowlist of allowed compiler paths or enforce that compiler paths must be from trusted directories.
- Sandboxing: Running build tasks in a sandboxed environment could limit the impact of command injection vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
- User opens a workspace containing a malicious `c_cpp_properties.json` or installs a compromised extension that acts as a custom configuration provider.
- User triggers a build task in VSCode.
- Source Code Analysis:
1. Vulnerable code path: `/code/Extension/src/LanguageServer/cppBuildTaskProvider.ts`
2. Function `CustomBuildTaskTerminal.doBuild()`: This function constructs the command string and executes it.
3. Command construction: `const activeCommand: string = util.buildShellCommandLine(resolvedCommand, this.command, this.args);`
    - `resolvedCommand` and `this.args` are derived from `this.configuration`, which is populated from `c_cpp_properties.json` and potentially custom configuration providers.
4. Command execution: `child = cp.exec(activeCommand, this.options);`
    - `child_process.exec` executes a command in a shell, which is vulnerable to command injection if `activeCommand` contains unsanitized user inputs.

```typescript
    private async doBuild(): Promise<any> {
        // ...
        const activeCommand: string = util.buildShellCommandLine(resolvedCommand, this.command, this.args); // [point of interest 1] Command string construction
        this.writeEmitter.fire(activeCommand + this.endOfLine);

        let child: cp.ChildProcess | undefined;
        try {
            child = cp.exec(activeCommand, this.options); // [point of interest 2] Command execution using child_process.exec
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }
```

- Security Test Case:
1. Create a workspace and add a `c_cpp_properties.json` file.
2. Modify the `compilerPath` in `c_cpp_properties.json` to include a malicious command, for example:
```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Malicious Config",
      "includePath": [],
      "defines": [],
      "compilerPath": "/bin/bash",
      "compilerArgs": [
        "-c",
        "touch /tmp/pwned && /usr/bin/g++"
      ],
      "cStandard": "c11",
      "cppStandard": "c++17",
      "intelliSenseMode": "linux-gcc-x64"
    }
  ],
  "version": 4
}
```
   (Note: Replace `/bin/bash` and `/usr/bin/g++` with paths appropriate for your testing environment if needed.  `/tmp/pwned` is a simple indicator that the command was executed on Linux-like systems. For Windows, you could use `type nul > C:\\pwned.txt & <path to legitimate compiler>`)
3. Open a C++ source file in the workspace.
4. Trigger a build task (e.g., using "Tasks: Run Task" and selecting the cppbuild task related to the malicious configuration).
5. Observe if the file `/tmp/pwned` (or `C:\\pwned.txt` on Windows) is created, indicating successful command injection. Also, check if the legitimate compiler part of the command still executes (build completes without errors if a valid compiler path is used at the end).

This test case demonstrates that an attacker can inject arbitrary commands through the `compilerPath` setting in `c_cpp_properties.json`, leading to command execution when a build task is run.
