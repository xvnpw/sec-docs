### Command Injection Vulnerability in Variable Expansion in Configuration Files

- Description:
    1. The C/C++ extension uses variable expansion to resolve paths and settings in configuration files such as `c_cpp_properties.json`, `tasks.json`, `launch.json`, and potentially others.
    2. The `${command:commandID}` syntax allows executing arbitrary VS Code commands within these configuration files.
    3. An attacker can craft a malicious workspace containing a crafted configuration file (e.g., `c_cpp_properties.json`, `tasks.json`, or `launch.json`) that includes a `${command:commandID}` payload. Alternatively, a malicious string containing this syntax could be placed in user input fields or passed through extension APIs that utilize string expansion.
    4. When a user opens this workspace with the C/C++ extension activated, or when the extension processes malicious user input, the extension will parse the configuration file or input and execute the embedded VS Code command during variable expansion. The `expandStringImpl` function in `/code/Extension/src/expand.ts` is responsible for this expansion.
    5. Specifically, the regular expression `\\$\\{command:(${varValueRegexp})\\}` in `expandStringImpl` matches the malicious command string.
    6. The code then executes the VS Code command specified in the string using `vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, options.vars.workspaceFolder)`.
    7. This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the VS Code environment, with the privileges of the VS Code process.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - Potential for data exfiltration (e.g., reading sensitive files).
    - Modification of files (e.g., overwriting important project files).
    - Privilege escalation (depending on the executed command and the privileges of the VS Code process).
    - Installation of malware or further exploitation of the user's system.

- Vulnerability Rank:
    - Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `expandStringImpl` function in `expand.ts` has an `ExpansionOptions` parameter with a `doNotSupportCommands?: boolean` option.
    - This option, if set to `true`, should prevent command execution.
    - However, it's not consistently used when processing configuration files like `tasks.json`, `c_cpp_properties.json`, and `launch.json`. The default value or common usage of `ExpansionOptions` often does not enable `doNotSupportCommands`.
    - There are no other input sanitization or command whitelisting mitigations implemented in the provided code.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Ensure that the `doNotSupportCommands` option in `ExpansionOptions` is always set to `true` when processing configuration files (e.g., `c_cpp_properties.json`, `tasks.json`, `launch.json`) and user inputs that could be influenced by users.** This is the most secure approach to completely prevent command injection via variable expansion.
    - **Implement input validation and sanitization for the `commandID` part of `${command:commandID}` even if `doNotSupportCommands` is enabled as a defense-in-depth measure.**  While disabling command execution is preferred, additional validation could further reduce risk if command execution is enabled in certain contexts. A whitelist of allowed commands could be considered, but is less secure than disabling command execution in user-controlled configurations.
    - **Consider implementing a user consent prompt.** Before executing any command through string expansion, especially when the command originates from an untrusted source (like workspace configuration files), prompt the user for explicit consent.
    - **Disable command execution by default and require explicit user configuration to enable it for specific scenarios if absolutely necessary.**

- Preconditions:
    - The user must open a workspace that contains a malicious `c_cpp_properties.json`, `tasks.json`, `launch.json`, or other configuration file where the attacker has injected the `${command:commandID}` payload.
    - Alternatively, the vulnerability can be triggered if the extension processes malicious user input containing the `${command:commandID}` syntax.
    - The C/C++ extension must be activated and processing the relevant configuration files or user inputs.

- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/Extension/src/expand.ts

    async function expandStringImpl(input: string, options: ExpansionOptions): Promise<[string, boolean]> {
        // ...
        const command_re: RegExp = RegExp(`\\$\\{command:(${varValueRegexp})\\}`, "g");
        while (match = command_re.exec(input)) {
            if (options.doNotSupportCommands) { // Mitigation exists, but is not consistently enforced
                void getOutputChannelLogger().showWarningMessage(localize('commands.not.supported', 'Commands are not supported for string: {0}.', input));
                break;
            }
            const full: string = match[0];
            const command: string = match[1];
            if (subs.has(full)) {
                continue; // Don't execute commands more than once per string
            }
            try {
                const command_ret: unknown = await vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, options.vars.workspaceFolder); // Vulnerable code: Executes VS Code command based on user input
                subs.set(full, `${command_ret}`);
            } catch (e: any) {
                void getOutputChannelLogger().showWarningMessage(localize('exception.executing.command', 'Exception while executing command {0} for string: {1} {2}.', command, input, e));
            }
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    The `expandStringImpl` function in `/code/Extension/src/expand.ts` is the core of the vulnerability. It parses input strings for the `${command:}` syntax using a regular expression and directly executes the extracted command using `vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, ...)`. The `options.doNotSupportCommands` flag is intended as a mitigation, but it's optional and not consistently applied in contexts where user-controlled configuration files are processed. If `options.doNotSupportCommands` is not set to `true`, any string processed by `expandStringImpl` containing `${command:commandID}` will lead to the execution of `commandID` as a VS Code command.

    ```typescript
    // File: /code/Extension/src/LanguageServer/cppBuildTaskProvider.ts

    class CustomBuildTaskTerminal implements Pseudoterminal {
        // ...
        private async doBuild(): Promise<any> {
            // Do build.
            let resolvedCommand: string | util.IQuotedString | undefined;
            if (util.isString(this.command)) {
                resolvedCommand = util.resolveVariables(this.command); // Variable expansion happens here for task command
            } else {
                resolvedCommand = {
                    value: util.resolveVariables(this.command.value), // and here for quoted command
                    quoting: this.command.quoting
                };
            }

            this.args.forEach((value, index) => {
                if (util.isString(value)) {
                    this.args[index] = util.resolveVariables(value); // and here for task args
                } else {
                    value.value = util.resolveVariables(value.value); // and here for quoted args
                }
            });
            if (this.options === undefined) {
                this.options = {};
            }
            if (this.options.cwd) {
                this.options.cwd = util.resolveVariables(this.options.cwd.toString()); // and here for task options.cwd
            } else {
                // ...
            }

            const activeCommand: string = util.buildShellCommandLine(resolvedCommand, this.command, this.args);
            // ...
            child = cp.exec(activeCommand, this.options); // Finally, the command is executed
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    The `CustomBuildTaskTerminal.doBuild` function demonstrates how `util.resolveVariables` (which internally calls `expandStringImpl`) is used in the context of task processing. Specifically, it's used to expand variables in `this.command`, `this.args`, and `this.options.cwd` from `tasks.json`. This shows a concrete example of how a malicious `tasks.json` can inject commands through variable expansion, leading to command injection when the C/C++ extension processes the task definition.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new folder named `cpp-command-injection-test`.
    2. Open VS Code and open the `cpp-command-injection-test` folder.
    3. Inside `cpp-command-injection-test`, create a folder named `.vscode`.
    4. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `c_cpp_properties.json` for testing via `c_cpp_properties.json`, or `tasks.json` for testing via `tasks.json`.

        **Test case A (using `c_cpp_properties.json`):**
        Add the following JSON content to `c_cpp_properties.json`:
        ```json
        {
            "configurations": [
                {
                    "name": "Test Configuration",
                    "compilerPath": "${command:workbench.action.files.saveAs?vulnerable.txt}",
                    "intelliSenseMode": "linux-gcc-x64"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        Open any C or C++ file in the workspace (or create a new one and save it). This action should trigger the C/C++ extension to activate and parse the `c_cpp_properties.json` file. Observe if a "Save As" dialog box appears prompting you to save `vulnerable.txt`, or if the file is created automatically.

        **Test case B (using `tasks.json`):**
        Add the following JSON content to `tasks.json`:
        ```json
        {
            "version": "2.0.0",
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "type": "cppbuild",
                    "label": "evilBuildTask",
                    "command": "evil${command:workbench.action.terminal.focus}",
                    "args": [],
                    "options": {
                        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
                    },
                    "problemMatcher": [
                        "$gcc"
                    ],
                    "group": {
                        "kind": "build",
                        "isDefault": true
                    },
                    "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        Trigger the build task. You can do this by running "Tasks: Run Build Task" from the command palette and selecting "evilBuildTask".  Observe if a new VS Code integrated terminal window is opened automatically.

    5. **Verification:**
        - For Test case A: If a "Save As" dialog or automatic file creation occurs, it confirms command injection via `c_cpp_properties.json`.
        - For Test case B: If a terminal window opens, it confirms command injection via `tasks.json`.
    6. To further verify and explore impact, replace `workbench.action.files.saveAs?vulnerable.txt` or `workbench.action.terminal.focus` with more harmful commands like commands to list directories, read file contents, or execute shell commands (if `vscode.commands.executeCommand` allows it or if chaining commands is possible). Remember to exercise caution when testing potentially harmful commands.
