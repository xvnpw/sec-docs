### Vulnerability List for C/C++ Extension

- Command Injection Vulnerability in Variable Expansion in Configuration Files

  - Description:
    1. The C/C++ extension uses variable expansion to resolve paths and settings in configuration files such as `c_cpp_properties.json`, `tasks.json`, and potentially others.
    2. The `${command:commandID}` syntax allows executing arbitrary VS Code commands within these configuration files.
    3. An attacker can craft a malicious workspace containing a crafted configuration file (e.g., `c_cpp_properties.json` or `tasks.json`) that includes a `${command:commandID}` payload.
    4. When a user opens this workspace with the C/C++ extension activated, the extension will parse the configuration file and execute the embedded VS Code command during variable expansion.
    5. This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the VS Code environment, with the privileges of the VS Code process.

  - Impact:
    - **Critical**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - Potential for data exfiltration, installation of malware, or further exploitation of the user's system.

  - Vulnerability Rank:
    - Critical

  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `expandStringImpl` function in `expand.ts` has an `ExpansionOptions` parameter with a `doNotSupportCommands?: boolean` option.
    - This option, if set to `true`, should prevent command execution.
    - However, it's not consistently used when processing configuration files like `tasks.json` and `c_cpp_properties.json`.

  - Missing Mitigations:
    - **Ensure that the `doNotSupportCommands` option in `ExpansionOptions` is always set to `true` when processing configuration files that could be influenced by users (e.g., `c_cpp_properties.json`, `tasks.json`, launch.json).**
    - **Implement input validation and sanitization for the `commandID` part of `${command:commandID}` to prevent execution of potentially harmful commands.**  A whitelist of allowed commands could be considered, but disabling command execution in user-controlled configurations is the most secure approach.

  - Preconditions:
    - The user must open a workspace that contains a malicious `c_cpp_properties.json`, `tasks.json`, or other configuration file where the attacker has injected the `${command:commandID}` payload.
    - The C/C++ extension must be activated in the opened workspace.

  - Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/Extension/src/expand.ts

    async function expandStringImpl(input: string, options: ExpansionOptions): Promise<[string, boolean]> {
        // ...
        const command_re: RegExp = RegExp(`\\$\\{command:(${varValueRegexp})\\}`, "g");
        while (match = command_re.exec(input)) {
            if (options.doNotSupportCommands) { // Mitigation exists, but needs to be enforced in relevant contexts
                void getOutputChannelLogger().showWarningMessage(localize('commands.not.supported', 'Commands are not supported for string: {0}.', input));
                break;
            }
            const full: string = match[0];
            const command: string = match[1];
            if (subs.has(full)) {
                continue; // Don't execute commands more than once per string
            }
            try {
                const command_ret: unknown = await vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, options.vars.workspaceFolder); // Vulnerable code: Executes VS Code command based on user input
                subs.set(full, `${command_ret}`);
            } catch (e: any) {
                void getOutputChannelLogger().showWarningMessage(localize('exception.executing.command', 'Exception while executing command {0} for string: {1} {2}.', command, input, e));
            }
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    The `expandStringImpl` function in `/code/Extension/src/expand.ts` directly calls `vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, ...)` with the `command` variable extracted from the user-provided configuration string. If the `options.doNotSupportCommands` is not enabled when processing user configurations, this will lead to command injection.

    ```typescript
    // File: /code/Extension/src/LanguageServer/cppBuildTaskProvider.ts

    class CustomBuildTaskTerminal implements Pseudoterminal {
        // ...
        private async doBuild(): Promise<any> {
            // Do build.
            let resolvedCommand: string | util.IQuotedString | undefined;
            if (util.isString(this.command)) {
                resolvedCommand = util.resolveVariables(this.command); // Variable expansion happens here for task command
            } else {
                resolvedCommand = {
                    value: util.resolveVariables(this.command.value), // and here for quoted command
                    quoting: this.command.quoting
                };
            }

            this.args.forEach((value, index) => {
                if (util.isString(value)) {
                    this.args[index] = util.resolveVariables(value); // and here for task args
                } else {
                    value.value = util.resolveVariables(value.value); // and here for quoted args
                }
            });
            if (this.options === undefined) {
                this.options = {};
            }
            if (this.options.cwd) {
                this.options.cwd = util.resolveVariables(this.options.cwd.toString()); // and here for task options.cwd
            } else {
                // ...
            }

            const activeCommand: string = util.buildShellCommandLine(resolvedCommand, this.command, this.args);
            // ...
            child = cp.exec(activeCommand, this.options); // Finally, the command is executed
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    In `/code/Extension/src/LanguageServer/cppBuildTaskProvider.ts`, the `CustomBuildTaskTerminal.doBuild` function uses `util.resolveVariables` to expand variables in `this.command`, `this.args`, and `this.options.cwd`. This `util.resolveVariables` function calls the vulnerable `expandStringImpl` function. If a malicious `tasks.json` is crafted with `${command:commandID}` in these fields, it will lead to command injection when the C/C++ extension processes the task.

  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new folder named `cpp-task-injection-test`.
    2. Inside `cpp-task-injection-test`, create a folder named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `tasks.json` with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "type": "cppbuild",
                "label": "evilBuildTask",
                "command": "evil${command:workbench.action.terminal.focus}",
                "args": [],
                "options": {
                    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
                },
                "problemMatcher": [
                    "$gcc"
                ],
                "group": {
                    "kind": "build",
                    "isDefault": true
                },
                "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    4. Open VS Code and open the `cpp-task-injection-test` folder.
    5. Wait for the C/C++ extension to activate.
    6. Trigger the build task. You can do this by running "Tasks: Run Build Task" from the command palette and selecting "evilBuildTask". Or, if it's set as default build task, just trigger a build (e.g., by trying to run or debug a C/C++ file).
    7. Observe if a new VS Code integrated terminal window is opened automatically.
    8. If a terminal window is opened, it confirms that the `workbench.action.terminal.focus` command embedded in `tasks.json` was executed, demonstrating the command injection vulnerability in tasks.json.
    9. To further verify, try other more harmful commands as described in the original security test case for `c_cpp_properties.json`.
