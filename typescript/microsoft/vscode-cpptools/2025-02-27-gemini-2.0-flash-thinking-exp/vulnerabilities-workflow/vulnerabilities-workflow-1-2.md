## Vulnerability List for C/C++ Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via String Expansion
    * Description:
        The `expandStringImpl` function in `/code/Extension/src/expand.ts` allows for the execution of arbitrary VS Code commands through string expansion. An attacker could craft a malicious string that, when expanded by the extension, executes unintended commands.
        Step-by-step trigger:
            1. An attacker crafts a malicious string containing the `${command:<command_id>}` syntax.
            2. This malicious string is placed in a configuration file (e.g., `c_cpp_properties.json`), user input field processed by the extension, or passed through an extension API that utilizes string expansion.
            3. The C/C++ extension parses the configuration or processes the input, invoking the `expandString` function.
            4. `expandStringImpl` is called during the expansion process.
            5. The regular expression `\\$\\{command:(${varValueRegexp})\\}` in `expandStringImpl` matches the malicious command string.
            6. The code then executes the VS Code command specified in the string using `vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, options.vars.workspaceFolder)`.
    * Impact:
        Arbitrary command execution within the VS Code environment. This could lead to:
            - Information disclosure (e.g., reading sensitive files).
            - Modification of files (e.g., overwriting important project files).
            - Privilege escalation (depending on the executed command and the privileges of the VS Code process).
            - Further exploitation of the system.
    * Vulnerability Rank: high
    * Currently Implemented Mitigations:
        No mitigations are currently implemented in the provided code. The `options.doNotSupportCommands` flag exists, but it is optional and defaults to `false`, effectively enabling command execution.
        No changes found in provided files to indicate any implemented mitigations.
    * Missing Mitigations:
        - Input Sanitization: Implement strict input sanitization and validation for strings that are processed by the `expandString` function, specifically when handling the `${command:}` syntax.
        - Command Whitelisting: Create a whitelist of allowed commands that can be executed through string expansion. Any command not on the whitelist should be rejected.
        - Disable Command Execution by Default: Disable command execution by default and require explicit user consent or configuration to enable it for specific scenarios.
        - User Consent Prompt: Before executing any command through string expansion, prompt the user for explicit consent, especially if the command originates from an untrusted source.
    * Preconditions:
        - The C/C++ extension must be active and processing configuration files or user inputs.
        - The extension must be configured in a way that string expansion is triggered on attacker-controlled data.
    * Source Code Analysis:
        ```typescript
        // File: /code/Extension/src/expand.ts
        async function expandStringImpl(input: string, options: ExpansionOptions): Promise<[string, boolean]> {
            ...
            const command_re: RegExp = RegExp(`\\$\\{command:(${varValueRegexp})\\}`, "g");
            while (match = command_re.exec(input)) {
                if (options.doNotSupportCommands) {
                    void getOutputChannelLogger().showWarningMessage(localize('commands.not.supported', 'Commands are not supported for string: {0}.', input));
                    break;
                }
                const full: string = match[0];
                const command: string = match[1];
                ...
                try {
                    const command_ret: unknown = await vscode.commands.executeCommand(command, options.vars.workspaceFolder);
                    subs.set(full, `${command_ret}`);
                } catch (e: any) {
                    void getOutputChannelLogger().showWarningMessage(localize('exception.executing.command', 'Exception while executing command {0} for string: {1} {2}.', command, input, e));
                }
            }
            ...
        }
        ```
        The `expandStringImpl` function parses strings for the `${command:}` syntax and directly executes the extracted command using `vscode.commands.executeCommand()`. This behavior is vulnerable to command injection because it allows execution of arbitrary VS Code commands if an attacker can control the input string.
    * Security Test Case:
        1. Create a new folder and open it in VS Code.
        2. Create a `.vscode` folder in the workspace root.
        3. Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a file named `c_cpp_properties.json`.
        4. Add the following JSON content to `c_cpp_properties.json`:
        ```json
        {
            "configurations": [
                {
                    "name": "Test Configuration",
                    "compilerPath": "${command:workbench.action.files.saveAs?vulnerable.txt}",
                    "intelliSenseMode": "linux-gcc-x64"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        5. Open any C or C++ file in the workspace (or create a new one and save it). This action should trigger the C/C++ extension to activate and parse the `c_cpp_properties.json` file.
        6. Observe the behavior. If the vulnerability is present, one of the following will occur:
            - A "Save As" dialog box will appear, prompting you to save a file named `vulnerable.txt`.
            - A file named `vulnerable.txt` will be automatically created in your workspace or default save location without user interaction.
        7. If either of these outcomes occurs, it confirms that the command injection vulnerability is present, as the `workbench.action.files.saveAs` command (or a variation of it) was executed through string expansion.
