Here is the combined list of vulnerabilities, formatted as markdown:

### Default SSH Password in Dockerfiles

This vulnerability exists due to the use of a default, well-known password in Dockerfiles intended for testing the Remote-SSH extension. Specifically, the Dockerfiles located at `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora/Dockerfile` and `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora+/Dockerfile` configure an SSH server within the Docker container and set the root user's password to "foobar". If containers built from these Dockerfiles are mistakenly deployed in non-testing environments or if test environments are unintentionally exposed to external networks, attackers can exploit this default password to gain unauthorized root access to the containers.

- **Description:**
    - The Dockerfiles (`/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora/Dockerfile` and `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora+/Dockerfile`) are designed for baseline testing of the Remote-SSH extension.
    - These Dockerfiles configure an SSH server and intentionally set a default password, "foobar", for the root user.
    - If a user deploys containers based on these Dockerfiles in environments accessible to external attackers, or if these test environments become unintentionally exposed, attackers can leverage this default password to gain unauthorized root access.
    - **Steps to trigger:**
        1. Build a Docker image using either `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora/Dockerfile` or `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora+/Dockerfile`.
        2. Run the Docker container, ensuring that the SSH port (5671 for `fedora/Dockerfile` or 5670 for `fedora+/Dockerfile`) is exposed and reachable from the attacker's network.
        3. The attacker attempts to connect to the exposed SSH port of the container using an SSH client.
        4. When prompted for the username, the attacker enters "root".
        5. When prompted for the password, the attacker enters the default password "foobar".
        6. If authentication is successful, the attacker obtains a root shell within the Docker container.

- **Impact:**
    - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability grants an attacker complete root-level control over the compromised Docker container. This high level of access can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - **Data Breaches:** Access to sensitive data that might be present within the container or accessible from it.
        - **System Compromise:** Full control over the container's operating system and file system.
        - **Malware Installation:** The ability to install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software within the container.
        - **Lateral Movement:** Potential to use the compromised container as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network if the container is not properly isolated.
        - **Modification of Test Environment:** Alteration of the test environment, which could lead to skewed test results or the introduction of malicious changes affecting development processes.
        - **Information Disclosure:** Leakage of configuration details, code, or other sensitive information stored or processed within the container.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None in the provided project files. The Dockerfiles in question are explicitly designed for internal testing purposes and are not intended for deployment in production or publicly accessible environments. The inherent risk arises from the potential misuse or unintended exposure of these test configurations.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Clear Documentation and Warnings:** It is crucial to add prominent comments directly within the Dockerfiles and include explicit warnings in any associated documentation. These warnings must clearly state that these configurations are exclusively for internal testing and must never be used in production or exposed environments. The documentation should highlight the critical security risk associated with using default passwords.
    - **Remove Default Password Configuration:** Eliminate the configuration that sets a default password in the Dockerfiles. For test environments requiring SSH access, consider alternative secure methods.
    - **Implement Key-Based Authentication:** Replace password-based authentication with SSH key-based authentication in the Dockerfiles. This is a more secure method for managing SSH access.
    - **Dynamically Generated Passwords for Tests:** For automated testing scenarios, explore the possibility of generating random, unique passwords or secrets during container startup. These dynamically generated credentials should be used for the duration of the test and then discarded, avoiding the risks of hardcoded defaults.
    - **Network Isolation for Test Environments:** Ensure that any test environments utilizing these Docker containers are deployed on isolated networks, preventing unintended external access and limiting the attack surface.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A Docker container must be running, built from either `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora/Dockerfile` or `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora+/Dockerfile`.
    - The SSH port of the container (5671 for `fedora/Dockerfile`, 5670 for `fedora+/Dockerfile`) must be exposed and network accessible to the attacker.
    - The attacker must be aware or able to guess that a container based on these vulnerable configurations is running and accessible, and be able to attempt SSH login.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora/Dockerfile`
        ```dockerfile
        FROM fedora:latest
        ...
        RUN echo "root:foobar" | chpasswd  <--- Vulnerable line: Sets default password
        ...
        EXPOSE 5671
        CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D", "-p", "5671"]
        ```
        - The line `RUN echo "root:foobar" | chpasswd` is the source of the vulnerability. This command directly pipes the string "root:foobar" to the `chpasswd` command.
        - `chpasswd` is a utility used to update a user's password in batch mode. In this case, it sets the password for the `root` user to "foobar".
        - This hardcoded, easily guessable password becomes the default root password for any container built from this Dockerfile.
        - The `EXPOSE 5671` directive makes port 5671 accessible, potentially to external networks depending on the Docker runtime environment and network configuration.
        - The `CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D", "-p", "5671"]` line starts the SSH daemon on port 5671 when the container runs, making the SSH service available for connections using the default password.

    - **File:** `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora+/Dockerfile`
        ```dockerfile
        FROM fedora:latest
        ...
        RUN echo "root:foobar" | chpasswd  <--- Vulnerable line: Sets default password
        ...
        EXPOSE 5670
        CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D", "-p", "5670"]
        ```
        - This Dockerfile has the same vulnerable line: `RUN echo "root:foobar" | chpasswd`, which sets the default root password to "foobar".
        - It exposes port 5670 and starts the SSH daemon on this port via `CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D", "-p", "5670"]`.
        - The vulnerability is identical in nature and impact to the one in `fedora/Dockerfile`, just on a different port (5670).

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Environment Setup:** Ensure Docker is installed and running on your test machine.
    2. **Build Docker Image:** Navigate to the `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora/` directory in your terminal and execute the command: `docker build -t test-ssh-default-pw .`
    3. **Run Docker Container:** Start a container from the newly built image, mapping port 5671 on the host to port 5671 in the container: `docker run -d -p 5671:5671 test-ssh-default-pw`
    4. **Attacker Access Simulation:** From a separate terminal or machine that can reach the Docker host, initiate an SSH connection to the Docker host's IP address on port 5671: `ssh root@<docker-host-ip> -p 5671` (Replace `<docker-host-ip>` with the actual IP address of the Docker host. If testing locally, you can use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`).
    5. **Password Input:** When prompted for the password, enter `foobar`.
    6. **Verification of Vulnerability:** If the SSH login is successful and you are presented with a shell prompt inside the Docker container, this confirms the vulnerability. You have successfully gained root access using the default password. Type `exit` to close the SSH connection.
    7. **Cleanup:** To ensure a clean environment after testing, stop and remove the Docker container: `docker stop <container-id>` (retrieve the container ID using `docker ps`) and then `docker rm <container-id>`. Finally, remove the Docker image: `docker rmi test-ssh-default-pw`.
