## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified vulnerabilities in the `@vscode/vsce` project.

### 1. XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious VSIX package containing an `extension.vsixmanifest` file with an XML External Entity (XXE) payload.
    2. The attacker publishes or attempts to package this malicious VSIX using `vsce`.
    3. `vsce` uses `xml2js.parseString` in `src/xml.ts` to parse the `extension.vsixmanifest` file.
    4. Because `xml2js` is used with default settings (likely without disabling external entities), the XXE payload is processed.
    5. This allows the attacker to potentially:
        - Read local files on the server where `vsce` is running.
        - Trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

- **Impact:** High
    - An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the system running `vsce`, such as configuration files, source code, or credentials if `vsce` is running in an automated CI/CD pipeline or a developer's machine with sensitive files accessible.
    - SSRF could be used to access internal services or external resources from the `vsce` server, potentially leading to further attacks.

- **Vulnerability rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:** None

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Configure `xml2js.parseString` with secure settings to disable external entities: `{ sax: { externalEntities: false } }`.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious VSIX package to `vsce`. This could happen if an attacker can publish a malicious extension to the marketplace (less likely) or if a developer uses `vsce package` on a maliciously crafted extension project or if a user is tricked into using `vsce` to publish or inspect a VSIX package from an untrusted source.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - In `/code/src/xml.ts`, the `parseXmlManifest` and `parseContentTypes` functions utilize `xml2js.parseString` without specifying any options. This default usage of `xml2js` is susceptible to XXE vulnerabilities.
    ```typescript
    import { promisify } from 'util';
    import { parseString } from 'xml2js';

    function createXMLParser<T>(): (raw: string) => Promise<T> {
        return promisify<string, T>(parseString); // Vulnerable: xml2js default settings are used
    }

    export const parseXmlManifest = createXMLParser<XMLManifest>();
    export const parseContentTypes = createXMLParser<ContentTypes>();
    ```
    - The `readVSIXPackage` function in `/code/src/zip.ts` calls the vulnerable `parseXmlManifest` function to process the `extension.vsixmanifest` file from a VSIX package.
    ```typescript
    export async function readVSIXPackage(packagePath: string): Promise<{ manifest: ManifestPackage; xmlManifest: XMLManifest }> {
        // ...
        return {
            manifest: manifestValidated,
            xmlManifest: await parseXmlManifest(rawXmlManifest.toString('utf8')), // Calls vulnerable parser
        };
    }
    ```
    - **Visualization:**
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Malicious VSIX Package] --> B(vsce process);
        B --> C{readVSIXPackage};
        C --> D{parseXmlManifest};
        D --> E[xml2js.parseString];
        E -- XXE Payload --> F[File System Access / Network Probe];
    ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. Create a file named `malicious.xml` with the following XXE payload:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE root [
      <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
    ]>
    <PackageManifest Version="2.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/vsx-schema/2011" xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/vsx-schema-design/2011">
        <Metadata>
            <Identity Language="en-US" Id="test" Version="0.0.1" Publisher="mocha"/>
            <DisplayName>Test Extension</DisplayName>
            <Description>&xxe;</Description> <Categories>Other</Categories>
        </Metadata>
        <Installation> <InstallationTarget Id="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Code"/> </Installation> <Dependencies/> <Assets/>
    </PackageManifest>
    ```
    2. Create a zip archive named `malicious.vsix` and place `malicious.xml` inside it, renaming `malicious.xml` to `extension.vsixmanifest` within the archive.
    3. Run the command `npx @vscode/vsce package --packagePath malicious.vsix`.
    4. If the `/etc/passwd` file content is included in the command output or an error related to file access is observed, it confirms the XXE vulnerability.
    5. To further confirm and potentially demonstrate SSRF, replace the entity declaration in `malicious.xml` with a URL to a controlled external server (e.g., using Burp Suite Collaborator) and observe if a request is made to that server when running the `vsce package` command.


### 2. Markdown Injection in README and Changelog Processing

- **Description:**
    1. The `vsce` tool processes README.md and CHANGELOG.md files to rewrite relative links and validate image sources.
    2. It is vulnerable to markdown injection. If an attacker can control the content of the README.md or CHANGELOG.md files (e.g., through a compromised repository or a malicious pull request), they can inject arbitrary markdown content, including HTML and Javascript, into the processed files.
    3. This injected content could then be rendered within the VS Code Marketplace page when the extension is published.

- **Impact:** Critical. Cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of the VS Code Marketplace page. This can lead to:
    - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the extension's marketplace page.
    - Potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive information if the marketplace page interacts with authenticated services.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The code performs some sanitization and validation on URLs in markdown files, specifically for images and SVGs. However, it does not prevent the injection of arbitrary HTML or Javascript code within markdown content itself.
    - Specifically, `ReadmeProcessor` and `ChangelogProcessor` in `/code/src/package.ts` process markdown files, but the sanitization is focused on image URLs and SVG usage, not on general markdown injection.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Implement robust markdown sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful HTML and Javascript code. Use a security-focused markdown parser and sanitizer library like DOMPurify or similar, configured to disallow inline scripts and dangerous HTML tags.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) should be configured on the VS Code Marketplace website to further mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities. However, this is a mitigation on the marketplace side, not within `vsce` itself.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker needs to be able to modify the `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` files that are packaged with the extension. This could be achieved by compromising the extension's repository or through a malicious pull request that is merged by the extension maintainer.
    - The extension needs to be published to the VS Code Marketplace using `vsce publish`.

- **Source code analysis:**
    - The vulnerability lies within the `MarkdownProcessor` class in `/code/src/package.ts`, specifically in the `processFile` method.

    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/package.ts
    class MarkdownProcessor extends BaseProcessor {
        // ...
        protected async processFile(file: IFile, filePath: string): Promise<IFile> {
            // ...
            let contents = await read(file);
            // ...
            const html = markdownit({ html: true }).render(contents); // Vulnerable line: html: true allows HTML injection
            const $ = cheerio.load(html);
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    - The `markdownit({ html: true })` configuration enables HTML parsing within markdown. While `cheerio` is used to parse the HTML, it's primarily used for validating image `src` attributes and disallowing SVG tags. It does not sanitize or prevent execution of embedded Javascript or arbitrary HTML that can be injected directly within the markdown content.

- **Security test case:**
    1. Create a test extension project with a `README.md` file.
    2. Modify the `README.md` file to include the following malicious markdown:
        ```markdown
        # Malicious README

        This is a test README with injected Javascript.

        <script>
            alert('XSS Vulnerability!');
        </script>
        ```
    3. Package the extension using `vsce package`.
        ```bash
        npx vsce package
        ```
    4. Publish the extension to a test marketplace (if possible) or inspect the generated VSIX package.
    5. If published, visit the extension's marketplace page and observe if the Javascript alert (`XSS Vulnerability!`) is executed. If inspecting the VSIX, extract the `extension/readme.md` and render it in a browser to confirm Javascript execution.


### 3. Path Traversal/Zip Slip in VSIX Package Extraction

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious VSIX package containing zip entries with filenames designed to cause path traversal when extracted. These filenames may include components like `../` to navigate out of the intended extraction directory.
    2. When `vsce` processes this VSIX package, specifically during operations that might involve temporary extraction (although not explicitly seen in the provided files, packaging and verification processes might involve temporary file handling), a vulnerable zip extraction process could write files to locations outside the intended directory.
    3. If the `yauzl` library or the code using it does not properly sanitize or validate zip entry paths, it could be vulnerable to path traversal or zip slip.
    4. This could allow an attacker to overwrite critical system files, inject malicious files into arbitrary locations, or bypass security measures.

- **Impact:** High to Critical. Path traversal vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary file write, potentially allowing for local privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution if critical system files or executable paths are overwritten. The impact depends on the context where `vsce` is used and the permissions of the user running the tool.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None explicitly detected in the provided code files regarding zip entry path validation during extraction. The code uses `yauzl` to read zip contents, but it's not clear if there's any path sanitization before or during the extraction (even though extraction is not explicitly performed in the provided code, potential for future use or in related processes exists).

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - During zip file processing, especially if extraction to the file system is performed, each zip entry path should be rigorously validated to ensure it does not contain path traversal sequences (like `../`) and stays within the intended extraction directory. Secure zip extraction practices should be implemented.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to provide a malicious VSIX package to `vsce` for processing. This could occur in scenarios where `vsce` is designed to unpack or process VSIX packages from potentially untrusted sources, or if a user is tricked into processing a malicious package.

- **Source code analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/zip.ts`
    2. The code uses `yauzl` library to read zip files. While `yauzl` itself is generally safe for basic zip reading, vulnerabilities can arise in how the application handles the extracted paths, especially if it were to write files to disk based on zip entry names.
    3. The provided code primarily reads zip contents into buffers in memory (`bufferStream` function) and uses filters based on entry names (`readZip`, `readVSIXPackage`). Explicit file extraction to disk is not immediately apparent in the provided snippets.
    4. However, if future implementations or related processes within `vsce` (not shown in these files) involve extracting files to disk based on zip entry paths obtained from `yauzl`, without proper validation of these paths, a zip slip vulnerability could be introduced.
    - **Visualization:**
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Malicious VSIX Package] --> B(vsce process);
        B --> C{readZip / Potential Extraction Logic};
        C --> D{yauzl processing};
        D -- Malicious Entry Path --> E[Path Traversal / Zip Slip];
        E --> F[Arbitrary File Write];
    ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. Create a malicious VSIX package containing a zip entry with a path traversal filename. For example, create a file named `../../../evil.txt` with some content, and zip it along with a valid `package.json` and `extension.vsixmanifest` into `malicious_zipslip.vsix`.
    2. Execute `vsce package --packagePath malicious_zipslip.vsix` or any command that might trigger zip processing and potential extraction (if such functionality exists or is added later).
    3. After execution, check if the file `evil.txt` has been written outside the expected working directory, for instance, in the root directory or other sensitive locations.
    4. **Expected Result:** If vulnerable, the `evil.txt` file will be written to an unexpected location due to path traversal. If mitigated, the process should either refuse to process the malicious package, sanitize the paths to prevent traversal, or extract files only within a safe, confined directory. If no file extraction is performed based on zip entry paths, this test case might not be directly applicable to the current code but highlights a potential risk for future development.
