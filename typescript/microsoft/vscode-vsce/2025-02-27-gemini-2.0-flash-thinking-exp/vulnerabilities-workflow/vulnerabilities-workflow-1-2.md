### Vulnerability 1: Markdown Link Injection via Crafted Relative Links in README.md

* Vulnerability Name: Markdown Link Injection
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Visual Studio Code extension with a `README.md` file containing a specially crafted relative link.
    2. This link is designed to bypass the link rewriting logic in `vsce` and inject a malicious URL.
    3. When `vsce` packages or publishes the extension, it processes the `README.md` file using `MarkdownProcessor`.
    4. Due to insufficient validation or sanitization in the link rewriting process, the malicious link is not correctly rewritten and remains in the packaged extension's `README.md`.
    5. When a user installs the extension and views the `README.md` within VS Code, clicking on the malicious link could redirect them to an external malicious website or execute arbitrary JavaScript code if a `javascript:` URL is injected.
* Impact:
    * High
    * Open Redirection: An attacker can redirect users to a phishing website or other malicious content by crafting a malicious URL in the extension's README.
    * Potential for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) if `javascript:` URLs are not properly sanitized, although VS Code's markdown preview should prevent script execution, open redirection is still a significant risk.
* Vulnerability Rank: high
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    * The code attempts to rewrite relative links to absolute URLs based on the repository information.
    * The code checks for HTTPS protocol for images and restricts SVG images to trusted sources, which provides some level of protection against malicious image links.
    * There is no explicit sanitization or validation of the rewritten URLs to prevent injection of malicious schemes like `javascript:`.
* Missing Mitigations:
    * Input sanitization and validation for URLs, especially rewritten URLs in markdown files.
    * Explicitly disallow or sanitize `javascript:` and other potentially harmful URL schemes in markdown links.
    * Content Security Policy (CSP) for markdown preview within VS Code (this is VS Code's responsibility, but `vsce` should not introduce vulnerabilities that can bypass CSP if VS Code has weaknesses).
* Preconditions:
    * An attacker needs to create a malicious VS Code extension and include a crafted `README.md` file.
    * The user needs to install the malicious extension and view its `README.md` file within VS Code and click on the malicious link.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/package.ts`
    2. **Class:** `MarkdownProcessor`
    3. **Method:** `processFile(file: IFile, filePath: string)`
    4. **Line:** `contents = contents.replace(markdownPathRegex, urlReplace);`
    5. **Vulnerability Point:** The `urlReplace` function in `MarkdownProcessor` rewrites relative links. The current implementation focuses on prepending base URLs but lacks explicit sanitization of the `link` variable before rewriting.
    6. **Visualization:**

    ```
    Markdown File --> MarkdownProcessor.processFile --> urlReplace (Link Rewriting without sanitization) --> Rewritten Markdown File
    ```

    7. **Code Snippet:**
    ```typescript
    const urlReplace = (_: string, isImage: string, title: string, link: string) => {
        if (/^mailto:/i.test(link)) {
            return `${isImage}[${title}](${link})`;
        }

        const isLinkRelative = !/^\w+:\/\//.test(link) && link[0] !== '#';
        // ... base url logic ...

        return `${isImage}[${title}](${urljoin(prefix, path.posix.normalize(link))})`;
    };
    ```
    8. **Explanation:** The `urlReplace` function does check for `mailto:` links and ignores them. However, it does not check for or sanitize other potentially dangerous URL schemes like `javascript:`. If an attacker crafts a relative link that, after path normalization, becomes `javascript:evil()`, the `urlReplace` function will blindly rewrite and include it in the final markdown without sanitization.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new folder for a malicious extension, e.g., `malicious-extension`.
    2. Inside `malicious-extension`, create a `package.json` file with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "malicious-extension",
      "publisher": "attacker",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "engines": {
        "vscode": "*"
      }
    }
    ```
    3. Inside `malicious-extension`, create a `README.md` file with the following content containing a crafted relative link:
    ```markdown
    # Malicious Extension

    [Malicious Link](relative/javascript:alert('XSS'))
    ```
    4. Open a terminal, navigate to the `malicious-extension` folder.
    5. Run `npx @vscode/vsce package` to package the extension. This will create a `malicious-extension-1.0.0.vsix` file.
    6. Install the created `malicious-extension-1.0.0.vsix` in VS Code by running "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." command and selecting the `.vsix` file.
    7. After installation, open the `README.md` file of the installed extension within VS Code.
    8. Click on the "Malicious Link".
    9. **Expected Result:** While VS Code might prevent direct script execution from `javascript:` URLs in the markdown preview, observe if the link in the rendered markdown is indeed `javascript:alert('XSS')` or similar. A successful test would show that `vsce` did not sanitize or prevent the malicious `javascript:` URL from being packaged in the extension. Even if XSS is not directly exploitable due to VS Code's preview security, an open redirect to a malicious external site would still be a valid finding. To test for open redirect, replace `javascript:alert('XSS')` with a link to a malicious website.
