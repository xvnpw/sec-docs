### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Markdown Content Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Markdown file.
    2. The attacker convinces a VS Code user to package or publish an extension that includes this malicious Markdown file (e.g., as README.md or CHANGELOG.md).
    3. When `vsce` processes this Markdown file during packaging or publishing, it uses `markdown-it` to render the Markdown content into HTML and `cheerio` to parse it.
    4. The malicious Markdown file contains embedded JavaScript within HTML tags (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`).
    5. Because HTML sanitization is insufficient or missing after Markdown rendering, the embedded JavaScript is not properly neutralized.
    6. When VS Code or other tools render the extension's metadata (e.g., display the README on the marketplace or extension details page), the injected JavaScript code executes, leading to XSS.

- Impact:
    - High. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of VS Code or the VS Code Marketplace.
    - This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions depending on where the XSS is triggered and the permissions available in that context.
    - For example, if triggered within VS Code, it could potentially access local files or execute commands via VS Code API if the extension is loaded in a vulnerable context. If triggered on the marketplace, it could lead to account compromise if marketplace scripts are vulnerable to XSS.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project rewrites relative links in Markdown files to absolute URLs based on the repository information to prevent broken links.
    - The project validates image URLs to ensure they use HTTPS and are from trusted sources, aiming to prevent some types of malicious image embedding.
    - However, there is no explicit HTML sanitization step after rendering Markdown to HTML using `markdown-it`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust HTML sanitization after Markdown rendering using a library like DOMPurify or similar, to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript embedded in HTML tags.
    - Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) for any web views or contexts rendering extension metadata to limit the capabilities of injected scripts, even if sanitization fails.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a Markdown file (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or any other processed markdown file) within an extension project.
    - A VS Code user must use `vsce package` or `vsce publish` on an extension project containing the malicious Markdown file.
    - The vulnerability is triggered when the processed Markdown content is rendered in a context where JavaScript execution is enabled (e.g., VS Code extension details page, VS Code Marketplace).

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/package.ts`
    - Classes: `ReadmeProcessor`, `ChangelogProcessor`
    - Steps:
        1. Both `ReadmeProcessor` and `ChangelogProcessor` extend `MarkdownProcessor`.
        2. `MarkdownProcessor.processFile` function reads the Markdown file content.
        3. It uses `markdownit({ html: true }).render(contents)` to render Markdown to HTML. `html: true` option enables HTML tag rendering, which is necessary for XSS to be possible.
        4. It uses `cheerio.load(html)` to parse the rendered HTML.
        5. It performs checks on `<img>` tags for `src` attribute, protocol and trusted SVG sources, but does not sanitize the entire HTML output for JavaScript execution vulnerabilities.
        6. The processed content (`contents`) is then stored in the `file` object and eventually used in the VSIX package.

    ```typescript
    // Code snippet from /code/src/package.ts - MarkdownProcessor.processFile
    async processFile(file: IFile, filePath: string): Promise<IFile> {
        ...
        let contents = await read(file);
        ...
        const html = markdownit({ html: true }).render(contents); // Markdown to HTML conversion, HTML enabled
        const $ = cheerio.load(html); // Load HTML with cheerio
        ...
        $('img').each((_, img) => { // Image tag checks, but no general HTML sanitization
            ... // Checks for image URLs
        });
        $('svg').each(() => { // SVG tag check
            throw new Error(`SVG tags are not allowed in ${this.name}.`);
        });
        return {
            path: file.path,
            contents: Buffer.from(contents, 'utf8'), // Unsanitized HTML content is kept
            originalPath: file.originalPath
        };
    }
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new folder for a test extension (e.g., `test-xss-extension`).
    2. Inside this folder, create a `package.json` file with basic extension information:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "test-xss",
        "publisher": "testpublisher",
        "version": "0.0.1",
        "engines": {
            "vscode": "*"
        }
    }
    ```
    3. Create a `README.md` file with the following malicious Markdown content:
    ```markdown
    # Test XSS Vulnerability

    This is a test README to demonstrate a potential XSS vulnerability.

    <img src="nonexistent-image.png" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')" />

    [Click here](javascript:alert('XSS via javascript link')) to trigger another XSS.

    <details><summary>Click to trigger XSS in details</summary><script>alert('XSS in details tag')</script></details>
    ```
    4. Open a terminal in the `test-xss-extension` folder.
    5. Run the command `npx vsce package` to package the extension.
    6. After packaging, examine the generated VSIX package (`test-xss-0.0.1.vsix`). While direct VSIX inspection might not trigger the XSS, the vulnerability will be present in the packaged metadata.
    7. To simulate marketplace rendering, extract the `extension/readme.md` from the VSIX package and open it in a web browser or a VS Code preview that executes JavaScript. Alternatively, publish this extension to a test marketplace instance if feasible and observe if XSS triggers when viewing the extension details.
    8. Observe if the JavaScript alerts (`alert('XSS Vulnerability')`, `alert('XSS via javascript link')`, `alert('XSS in details tag')`) are executed. If they are, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.
