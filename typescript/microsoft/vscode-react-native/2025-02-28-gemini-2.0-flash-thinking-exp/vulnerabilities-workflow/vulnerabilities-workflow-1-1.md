## Vulnerability List for React Native Tools VSCode Extension

### 1. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Gulp Tasks

- Description:
  The gulpfile.js and gulp_scripts files use `child_process.spawn` with `shell: true`. This can introduce command injection vulnerabilities if the arguments passed to these spawn functions are derived from user-controlled input. Although the analyzed code does not directly use user input in arguments, future modifications or integrations that incorporate user input into these commands could lead to command injection.

- Impact:
  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. If user input is ever incorporated into the arguments for `child_process.spawn` calls, a malicious attacker could craft input to inject and execute harmful commands.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None in the provided code specifically for command injection in gulp tasks. The code relies on controlled arguments within the gulp scripts.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization and validation for any user-controlled input that might be incorporated into gulp task arguments in the future.
  - Avoid using `shell: true` in `child_process.spawn` and use `child_process.spawn` with an array of arguments to prevent shell interpretation of special characters.

- Preconditions:
  - A developer modifies the gulp scripts to incorporate user-provided input into the arguments of `child_process.spawn` without proper sanitization.
  - An attacker can control this user input, e.g., through a malicious workspace configuration or a poisoned extension setting.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - **File: `/code/gulpfile.js`**:
    ```javascript
    const { series } = require("gulp");
    const getBuilder = require("./gulp_scripts/builder");
    const getTester = require("./gulp_scripts/tester");
    const getWatcher = require("./gulp_scripts/watcher");
    const getPacker = require("./gulp_scripts/packager");
    const getRelease = require("./gulp_scripts/release");
    const getTranslator = require("./gulp_scripts/translator");

    module.exports = {
        // ...
        release: getRelease.release,
        // ...
    };
    ```
  - **File: `/code/gulp_scripts/release.js`**:
    ```javascript
    const executeCommand = GulpExtras.executeCommand;

    function release(cb) {
        prepareLicenses();
        cb();
    }

    function prepareLicenses() {
        // ...
        return Promise.resolve()
            .then(() => {
                // ...
                return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                    // NOTE: vsce must see npm 3.X otherwise it will not correctly strip out dev dependencies.
                    executeCommand(
                        "vsce",
                        ["package"], // Arguments are hardcoded here
                        arg => {
                            if (arg) {
                                reject(arg);
                            }
                            resolve();
                        },
                        { cwd: appRoot },
                    );
                });
            })
        // ...
    }
    ```
  - **File: `/code/tools/gulp-extras.js`**:
    ```javascript
    function executeCommand(command, args, callback, opts) {
        const proc = child_process.spawn(command + (process.platform === "win32" ? ".cmd" : ""), args, Object.assign({}, opts, { shell: true })); // shell: true is used here
        // ...
    }

    module.exports = {
        // ...
        executeCommand
    }
    ```
  - The `executeCommand` function in `/code/tools/gulp-extras.js` uses `child_process.spawn` with `shell: true`.
  - The `release` task in `/code/gulp_scripts/release.js` calls `executeCommand` with hardcoded arguments `["package"]`.
  - Currently, arguments are controlled by the extension developers, but if these scripts are modified to accept external input (e.g., from VSCode settings or contribution configurations) without proper sanitization, a command injection vulnerability could be introduced.

- Security Test Case:
  1.  This vulnerability cannot be directly tested in its current state as it requires code modification to introduce user-controlled input into the gulp tasks.
  2.  To demonstrate the potential vulnerability, modify the `release` task in `/code/gulp_scripts/release.js` to accept an argument from a hypothetical VSCode setting:

      ```javascript
      // In /code/gulp_scripts/release.js, modify release function:
      const vscode = require('vscode'); // Add vscode import
      function release(cb) {
          prepareLicenses();
          const user_controlled_arg = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('react-native-tools').get('test_arg', ''); // Hypothetical setting

          const args = ["package", user_controlled_arg]; // Include user-controlled arg

          return Promise.resolve()
              .then(() => {
                  // ...
                  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                      // NOTE: vsce must see npm 3.X otherwise it will not correctly strip out dev dependencies.
                      executeCommand(
                          "vsce",
                          args, // Use modified args
                          arg => {
                              if (arg) {
                                  reject(arg);
                              }
                              resolve();
                          },
                          { cwd: appRoot },
                      );
                  });
              })
          // ...
      }
      ```

  3.  Set the VSCode setting `react-native-tools.test_arg` to a malicious command, for example: `"; touch injected.txt"`
  4.  Run the `release` gulp task.
  5.  Observe that a file named `injected.txt` is created in the project directory, indicating successful command injection.

- Vulnerability mitigated: No

- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation, avoiding `shell: true`.

- Preconditions: User needs to install and run the modified extension, and set a malicious setting.

### 2. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in macOS Defaults Helper

- Description:
  The `defaultsHelper.ts` uses `child_process.exec` to execute the `defaults` command in macOS. If the `plistFile` argument, which is partially derived from user-controlled `scheme` in launch configurations, is not properly sanitized, it could lead to command injection.

- Impact:
  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process by crafting a malicious scheme in the launch configuration.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The code currently passes arguments to `defaults` command without explicit sanitization.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization and validation for the `plistFile` argument in `defaultsHelper.ts`, especially when derived from user-controlled settings like `scheme` in launch configurations.
  - Consider using safer APIs or methods to interact with macOS user defaults that do not involve shell command execution.

- Preconditions:
  - The user must be running macOS.
  - An attacker needs to influence the `scheme` parameter in the launch configuration of the React Native Tools extension. This could potentially be achieved through malicious workspace configurations or extension settings if the extension were to incorporate such user inputs into launch configurations.
  - The target macOS application (whose defaults are being modified) must be at least launched once to create the plist file.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - **File: `/code/src/extension/macos/defaultsHelper.ts`**:
    ```javascript
    import { Node } from "../../common/node/node";
    import { ChildProcess } from "../../common/node/childProcess";

    export class DefaultsHelper {
        private readonly DEV_MENU_SETTINGS = "RCTDevMenu";
        private nodeChildProcess: ChildProcess;

        constructor() {
            this.nodeChildProcess = new Node.ChildProcess();
        }

        public async setPlistBooleanProperty(
            plistFile: string,
            property: string,
            value: boolean,
        ): Promise<void> {
            // Attempt to set the value, and if it fails due to the key not existing attempt to create the key
            await this.invokeDefaultsCommand(
                `write ${plistFile} ${this.DEV_MENU_SETTINGS} -dict-add ${property} -bool ${String(
                    value,
                )}`,
            );
        }

        private async invokeDefaultsCommand(command: string): Promise<string> {
            const res = await this.nodeChildProcess.exec(`defaults ${command}`);
            const outcome = await res.outcome;
            return outcome.toString().trim();
        }
    }
    ```
  - **File: `/code/src/extension/macos/macOSDebugModeManager.ts`**:
    ```javascript
    import { MacOSDebugModeManager } from "../../../src/extension/macos/macOSDebugModeManager";

    export class MacOSDebugModeManager extends ApplePlatformDebugModeManager {
        // ...
        public async setAppRemoteDebuggingSetting(
            enable: boolean,
            configuration?: string,
            productName?: string,
        ): Promise<void> {
            const plistFile = await this.findPListFileWithRetry(configuration, productName);
            return await this.defaultsHelper.setPlistBooleanProperty(
                plistFile,
                MacOSDebugModeManager.REMOTE_DEBUGGING_FLAG_NAME,
                enable,
            );
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
  - The `invokeDefaultsCommand` function in `/code/src/extension/macos/defaultsHelper.ts` uses `child_process.exec` to run the `defaults` command.
  - The `setPlistBooleanProperty` function constructs the command string using template literals, including the `plistFile` argument which is potentially influenced by user-controlled `scheme` from launch configurations via `plistBuddy.getBundleId` and `findPlistFile`.
  - If a malicious `scheme` is provided in the launch configuration, and if `plistBuddy.getBundleId` or `findPlistFile` does not properly sanitize or validate the scheme when constructing the `plistFile` path, it *might* be possible to inject commands.

- Security Test Case:
  1.  Modify `MacOSDebugModeManager.ts` to directly pass a user-controlled scheme from launch configuration into `setAppRemoteDebuggingSetting`.
  2.  Modify `setAppRemoteDebuggingSetting` to pass the `scheme` value directly to `defaultsHelper.setPlistBooleanProperty` as part of `plistFile` path construction.
  3.  Create a malicious launch configuration with a crafted `scheme` that includes command injection payload, e.g., in `productName` or `scheme` itself to influence the `plistFile` path.
  4.  Run the modified extension with the malicious launch configuration.
  5.  Observe if arbitrary commands are executed, for example, by checking for the creation of a file (like `injected.txt`) or other side effects.

      **Note:** This test case is complex and might require significant code modification to be directly testable. It is primarily to demonstrate the *potential* for command injection based on code analysis.

- Vulnerability mitigated: No

- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation for `plistFile` argument, consider safer alternatives to `child_process.exec`.

- Preconditions: User needs to be on macOS, install a modified extension, and use a maliciously crafted launch configuration.
