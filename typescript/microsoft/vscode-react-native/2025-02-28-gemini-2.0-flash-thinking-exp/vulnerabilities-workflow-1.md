## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities within the React Native Tools VSCode Extension. Each vulnerability is detailed with its description, potential impact, severity ranking, mitigation status, and steps for verification.

### 1. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `executeCommand` Utility Function

- Description:
  The `executeCommand` function, located in `/code/tools/gulp-extras.js`, uses `child_process.spawn` with the option `shell: true`. This practice introduces a command injection vulnerability because it allows the execution of arbitrary shell commands if the `command` or `args` parameters are derived from untrusted or unsanitized input. While the current codebase primarily uses hardcoded arguments, any future integration of user-controlled input into these parameters could be exploited by an attacker. Specifically, if a developer were to modify gulp tasks to accept user-provided input (e.g., through VSCode settings or workspace configurations) and pass this input to `executeCommand` without proper sanitization, it would create an exploitable vulnerability. An attacker could then craft malicious input containing shell metacharacters (like `;`, `&`, `|`, `$()`, etc.) to execute arbitrary commands on the developer's machine.

- Impact:
  Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
    - **Information Disclosure:** Access to sensitive files, environment variables, and credentials stored on the developer's machine.
    - **Data Modification:** Alteration or deletion of project files, application code, or system configurations.
    - **Malware Installation:** Installation of backdoors, ransomware, or other malicious software.
    - **Lateral Movement:** Potential to use the compromised developer machine as a stepping stone to access internal networks or other systems.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The `executeCommand` function itself lacks any input sanitization or validation. The current usages within the provided code primarily use hardcoded arguments, which reduces immediate risk but does not eliminate the underlying vulnerability.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement rigorous sanitization and validation of all inputs to the `command` and `args` parameters of the `executeCommand` function, especially if there is any possibility of user-controlled input being introduced in the future. This should include escaping shell metacharacters.
  - **Avoid `shell: true`:**  Refrain from using `shell: true` in `child_process.spawn` unless absolutely necessary. In cases where shell features are not required, use `child_process.spawn` without `shell: true` and pass command and arguments as separate array elements to avoid shell interpretation.
  - **Parameterization:** If dynamic command construction is necessary, use parameterized commands or libraries that provide safe command execution to prevent injection.
  - **Static Analysis and Linting:** Introduce static analysis tools or linting rules to automatically detect usages of `child_process.spawn` with `shell: true`, particularly in code paths that handle external or user-provided input.

- Preconditions:
  - A code modification must be introduced that allows user-controlled input to influence the `command` or `args` parameters passed to the `executeCommand` function. This could occur through new features that process user-provided file paths, arguments, or settings.
  - An attacker must be able to manipulate this user-controlled input.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - **File: `/code/tools/gulp-extras.js`**:
    ```javascript
    function executeCommand(command, args, callback, opts) {
        const proc = child_process.spawn(command + (process.platform === "win32" ? ".cmd" : ""), args, Object.assign({}, opts, { shell: true })); // shell: true is used here
        // ...
    }
    ```
  - The `executeCommand` function utilizes `child_process.spawn` with `shell: true`.
  - When `shell: true` is set, the first argument to `spawn` is executed within a shell (like `/bin/sh` or `cmd.exe`). This shell interprets metacharacters in the command string.
  - If the `command` variable or elements within the `args` array are constructed using unsanitized external input, an attacker can inject shell commands.
  - For example, if `command` is derived from user input and an attacker provides input like `"malicious; rm -rf /"`, the shell will execute both the intended command and the injected `rm -rf /` command.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Modify `release.js` (for example) to accept user input:**
     ```javascript
     // In /code/gulp_scripts/release.js, modify release function:
     const vscode = require('vscode');
     const executeCommand = require('../tools/gulp-extras').executeCommand;

     function release(cb) {
         prepareLicenses();
         const userInput = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('react-native-tools').get('commandInjectionTest', '');

         return Promise.resolve()
             .then(() => {
                 return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                     executeCommand(
                         userInput, // User input is directly passed as command
                         [],
                         arg => {
                             if (arg) {
                                 reject(arg);
                             }
                             resolve();
                         },
                         { cwd: appRoot },
                     );
                 });
             })
     }
     ```
  2. **Set malicious VSCode setting:**
     - Open VSCode settings (JSON settings).
     - Add/modify the setting `react-native-tools.commandInjectionTest` to: `"echo vulnerable > injected.txt; "`.
  3. **Run the `release` gulp task:**
     - Open a terminal in VSCode within the extension's project directory.
     - Execute the gulp task that uses `executeCommand` with the user input (e.g., `gulp release`).
  4. **Verify command injection:**
     - Check the project directory for a file named `injected.txt`. If this file exists and contains "vulnerable", it indicates that the injected command `echo vulnerable > injected.txt` was successfully executed, confirming the command injection vulnerability.

- Vulnerability mitigated: No

- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation, avoiding `shell: true`, parameterization, static analysis/linting.

- Preconditions: User needs to install and run the modified extension, and set a malicious setting to control the command executed by `executeCommand`.

### 2. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in macOS Defaults Helper

- Description:
  The `defaultsHelper.ts` component, specifically the `invokeDefaultsCommand` function, uses `child_process.exec` to execute the `defaults` command in macOS. This function constructs command strings using template literals, incorporating the `plistFile` argument which is indirectly derived from user-controlled input through the `scheme` parameter in launch configurations. If the `plistFile` path is not properly sanitized before being passed to `child_process.exec`, it can lead to command injection. An attacker could craft a malicious `scheme` within a launch configuration in an attempt to inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the `defaults` command via the shell.

- Impact:
  Successful command injection via the macOS `defaults` helper allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's macOS system with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can result in:
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Potential to gain elevated privileges on the macOS system depending on the injected commands.
    - **System Modification:** Altering system settings, user preferences, or application configurations beyond the intended scope of the extension.
    - **Data Theft:** Access to sensitive data stored within the user's macOS environment.
    - **Denial of Service:** Causing system instability or crashes through malicious commands.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None. The code directly constructs and executes the `defaults` command using `child_process.exec` without any input sanitization or validation of the `plistFile` argument or other components of the command string.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement strict sanitization and validation for the `plistFile` argument, especially where it is derived from user-controlled inputs like the `scheme` in launch configurations. Ensure that any potentially malicious characters or command injection payloads are escaped or removed.
  - **Safer API Alternatives:** Explore and utilize safer APIs or methods for interacting with macOS user defaults that do not involve executing shell commands. Consider using Objective-C or Swift APIs directly if feasible, or libraries that provide a safer abstraction layer.
  - **Avoid `child_process.exec` for Dynamic Commands:**  Minimize the use of `child_process.exec` for constructing and executing dynamic commands, especially when user input is involved. If shell command execution is necessary, ensure rigorous input sanitization and consider using `child_process.spawn` with arguments array instead of `shell: true`.

- Preconditions:
  - The user must be running macOS.
  - An attacker needs to influence the `scheme` parameter in the launch configuration. While direct user control over `scheme` might not be intended, vulnerabilities could arise if extension settings or workspace configurations are processed in a way that allows malicious injection into the launch configuration or the `plistFile` path construction.
  - The target macOS application (whose defaults are being modified) must have been launched at least once to ensure the plist file exists.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - **File: `/code/src/extension/macos/defaultsHelper.ts`**:
    ```javascript
    import { Node } from "../../common/node/node";
    import { ChildProcess } from "../../common/node/childProcess";

    export class DefaultsHelper {
        private readonly DEV_MENU_SETTINGS = "RCTDevMenu";
        private nodeChildProcess: ChildProcess;

        constructor() {
            this.nodeChildProcess = new Node.ChildProcess();
        }

        public async setPlistBooleanProperty(
            plistFile: string,
            property: string,
            value: boolean,
        ): Promise<void> {
            await this.invokeDefaultsCommand(
                `write ${plistFile} ${this.DEV_MENU_SETTINGS} -dict-add ${property} -bool ${String(value)}`,
            );
        }

        private async invokeDefaultsCommand(command: string): Promise<string> {
            const res = await this.nodeChildProcess.exec(`defaults ${command}`);
            const outcome = await res.outcome;
            return outcome.toString().trim();
        }
    }
    ```
  - The `invokeDefaultsCommand` function uses `child_process.exec` which executes a command in a shell environment.
  - The command string is constructed using template literals, including the `plistFile` variable.
  - If the `plistFile` variable, which is derived from launch configuration parameters (potentially influenced by user-provided `scheme`), is not sanitized, an attacker can inject commands by crafting a malicious `scheme`.
  - For example, if `plistFile` could be manipulated to include `"; touch /tmp/pwned"`, the `defaults` command would execute, followed by the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned`.

- Security Test Case:
  1. **Modify `macOSDebugModeManager.ts` to introduce user-controlled `scheme`:**
     ```javascript
     // In /code/src/extension/macos/macOSDebugModeManager.ts, modify setAppRemoteDebuggingSetting function:
     const vscode = require('vscode');
     // ...
     public async setAppRemoteDebuggingSetting(
         enable: boolean,
         configuration?: string,
         productName?: string,
     ): Promise<void> {
         const maliciousScheme = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('react-native-tools').get('schemeInjectionTest', ''); // Get user-controlled scheme
         const plistFile = `/Users/yourusername/Library/Preferences/${maliciousScheme}.plist`; // Malicious plistFile path construction - replace /Users/yourusername
         return await this.defaultsHelper.setPlistBooleanProperty(
             plistFile,
             MacOSDebugModeManager.REMOTE_DEBUGGING_FLAG_NAME,
             enable,
         );
     }
     ```
     **Note:** Replace `/Users/yourusername` with your actual macOS username for testing.
  2. **Set malicious VSCode setting:**
     - Open VSCode settings (JSON settings).
     - Add/modify the setting `react-native-tools.schemeInjectionTest` to: `"com.example.MyApp'; touch /tmp/pwned; '`;  (Replace `com.example.MyApp` with a valid bundle ID or placeholder).
  3. **Trigger `setAppRemoteDebuggingSetting` function:**
     - This function is likely called during debugging or extension activation. You may need to trigger a debug session or extension command that calls `setAppRemoteDebuggingSetting`.
  4. **Verify command injection:**
     - Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created. If it exists, the command injection is successful.

- Vulnerability mitigated: No

- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation, safer API alternatives, avoid `child_process.exec` for dynamic commands.

- Preconditions: User needs to be on macOS, install modified extension, use maliciously crafted VSCode setting to influence `scheme`, and target app needs to be launched once.

### 3. Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Gulp Scripts via Filename Parameter

- Description:
    Gulp scripts within the React Native Tools extension use file paths derived from processed files, specifically `${file.cwd}` (current working directory) and `${file.path}` (file path), in shell commands and logging. These paths are used without sufficient sanitization in functions like `gulp.dest()` in `builder.js` and `logError` in `gulp-extras.js`. If an attacker can control filenames or directory names within the workspace or project structure, they can inject malicious commands through these unsanitized paths. For example, by creating a directory or file with a name containing shell command injection payloads, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the developer's machine during the Gulp build process or when logs are processed.

- Impact:
    Successful command injection via filenames in Gulp scripts can have severe consequences:
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute any command on the developer's machine during local builds or extension development processes.
    - **Developer Machine Compromise:** Leading to data exfiltration, malware installation, or unauthorized access to developer resources.
    - **Supply Chain Risk:** If malicious code is injected into build outputs, it could potentially be propagated to users of the extension if the build artifacts are distributed.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses `${file.cwd}` and `${file.path}` in shell commands and logging without any sanitization or validation.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Filename Sanitization:** Implement robust sanitization for filenames and directory names used in shell commands and logging within Gulp scripts. Specifically, escape shell metacharacters in `${file.cwd}` and `${file.path}` before using them in functions like `gulp.dest()` and `logError`.
    - **Input Validation:** Implement validation to restrict or sanitize characters allowed in filenames and directory names processed by Gulp scripts.
    - **Secure Logging Practices:** Ensure that logging mechanisms also sanitize or escape output to prevent command injection vulnerabilities that might arise from processing log files or displaying logs in vulnerable interfaces.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be able to influence the workspace or project structure, for example, by contributing to a project or through methods that allow them to create files and directories with malicious names within the developer's workspace.
    - The developer must build the extension locally using Gulp tasks (e.g., `gulp build`, `gulp lint`).

- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File: `/code/gulp_scripts/builder.js`**:
      ```javascript
      return tsResult.js
          // ...
          .pipe(gulp.dest(file => file.cwd))
      ```
      - `gulp.dest(file => file.cwd)` uses the `file.cwd` property, which represents the current working directory of the processed file, directly as the destination path.
      - If a directory with a malicious name (e.g., `test_vuln; touch hacked`) is part of the workspace, `file.cwd` will contain this malicious name. When `gulp.dest` processes this path, it could be interpreted as a command if not properly handled.

    - **File: `/code/tools/gulp-extras.js`**:
      ```javascript
      function logError(pluginName, file, message) {
          const sourcePath = path.relative(__dirname, file.path).replace("../", "");
          log(`[${colors.cyan(pluginName)}] ${colors.red("error")} ${sourcePath}: ${message}`);
      }
      ```
      - The `logError` function uses `file.path` to construct a log message. Although logging itself might not directly execute commands, if the logging system or a tool processing these logs is vulnerable to command injection through path names, it could be exploited.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create malicious directory:**
       - In a temporary directory, create a directory named `test_vuln; touch hacked`.
    2. **Open VSCode workspace:**
       - Open VSCode and open the temporary directory created in step 1 as the workspace.
    3. **Navigate to `/code` directory:**
       - Within the VSCode workspace, navigate to the `/code` directory of the React Native Tools extension project.
    4. **Run `gulp build` command:**
       - Open a terminal in VSCode within the `/code` directory.
       - Execute the command `gulp build`.
    5. **Verify command injection:**
       - Check the workspace root (the temporary directory). If a file named `hacked` is created, it indicates successful command injection via the malicious directory name `test_vuln; touch hacked` being processed by `gulp.dest`.

    6. **Test `logError` vulnerability:**
       - Create a file with a malicious name within the `code/src/extension` directory, for example: `"test_vuln\`test\`";touch hacked; #.ts`.
       - Run `gulp lint` command from the terminal in `/code` directory.
       - Check the workspace root. If a file named `hacked` is created, it indicates potential command injection via the malicious filename processed during linting and potentially logged by `logError` (or similar logging mechanisms).

- Vulnerability mitigated: No

- Missing Mitigations: Filename sanitization, input validation, secure logging practices.

- Preconditions: Attacker needs to influence workspace/project structure with malicious filenames, developer needs to build the extension locally using Gulp.
