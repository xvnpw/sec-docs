## Vulnerability List:

Based on the provided project files and applying the specified filtering criteria for external attackers exploiting VSCode extensions, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank, introduced by this project and exploitable by an external attacker in the context of a VSCode extension, were found.

The project primarily consists of documentation, configuration files for development containers, and links to external resources. It leverages existing and well-established technologies like VS Code Dev Containers and Docker. The code within this project does not introduce any complex logic or custom code execution paths that could be vulnerable under the defined constraints.

The security considerations primarily fall under the security of external components which are out of scope for this project's vulnerability assessment based on the provided instructions.

Therefore, after filtering out irrelevant vulnerability types and focusing on high/critical rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers in a VSCode extension context, there are no identified vulnerabilities to report for this project.
