## Vulnerability List:

There are no identified vulnerabilities in the provided project files that meet the specified criteria.

**Reasoning:**

After analyzing the provided project files (`README.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/dependabot.yml`), it is determined that these files primarily contain documentation, project management guidelines, and configuration for dependency updates. They do not include any executable code or application logic that could be directly exploited by an external attacker to introduce high or critical vulnerabilities within the context of a VSCode extension.

The project's purpose is to demonstrate the use of development containers for Python development, rather than to provide a functional Python application. Therefore, the typical code-level vulnerabilities associated with application code are not present in these configuration and documentation files.

While development containers themselves and their configurations can introduce security considerations, the provided files do not introduce any new or specific high-rank vulnerabilities. Potential vulnerabilities related to insecure base images or malicious devcontainer.json configurations are outside the scope of "vulnerabilities introduced by project from PROJECT FILES" as defined in the prompt, as these are not introduced by the provided files themselves, but rather by external dependencies or user-defined configurations not included in these files.

Therefore, based on the provided files, there are no vulnerabilities to report that meet the criteria of being valid, high rank, and introduced by the project files themselves.
