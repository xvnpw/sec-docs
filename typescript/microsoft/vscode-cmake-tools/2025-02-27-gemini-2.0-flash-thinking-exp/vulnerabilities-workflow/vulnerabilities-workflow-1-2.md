- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `cmake.copyCompileCommands` setting and CMakePresets path settings

- Description:
    1. An attacker can configure the `cmake.copyCompileCommands` setting in `settings.json` or CMakePresets path settings (e.g., `binaryDir`, `installDir`, `toolchainFile`, `outputLogFile`, `outputJUnitFile`, `resourceSpecFile`) to a path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`).
    2. When CMake Tools performs operations that use these settings (e.g., configuring CMake project, copying compile commands, running tests), it expands the path.
    3. If `cmake.copyCompileCommands` is set, CMake Tools expands the path and copies the generated `compile_commands.json` to the path specified in the setting using `fs.copyFile` after creating parent directories with `fs.mkdir_p`. For CMakePresets path settings, expanded paths are used in various file system operations.
    4. Due to insufficient path sanitization in the `expandString` function and its callers, the extension might copy the file or perform operations in locations outside the intended workspace or build directory, potentially overwriting sensitive files or creating files in unexpected locations. This applies to both `cmake.copyCompileCommands` and CMakePresets path settings.

- Impact:
    - High: An attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the user's system depending on the user's file system permissions and the context in which VSCode is running. This could lead to local privilege escalation or data corruption.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the changelog entry "Ensure that we're sanitizing paths for `cmake.copyCompileCommands`. [#3874](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/3874)", it seems like there is an attempt to mitigate this vulnerability by sanitizing paths. However, based on the current code analysis of the provided files, there is no explicit path sanitization visible in the code related to handling `cmake.copyCompileCommands` or CMakePresets path settings before file system operations. The effectiveness of the sanitization attempt mentioned in the changelog cannot be determined from the provided files and requires further investigation in the complete codebase, especially within the `expandString` function (not provided in PROJECT FILES) and any functions that call it for path expansion in both `config.ts` and `preset.ts`. The provided files do not demonstrate any robust path sanitization implemented for these settings.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Robust path sanitization for both the `cmake.copyCompileCommands` setting and CMakePresets path settings to prevent directory traversal before `fs.mkdir_p` and `fs.copyFile` (and other file system operations) are called. This sanitization should be implemented within the `expandString` function or immediately before path-sensitive operations in functions like `refreshCompileDatabase` in `cmakeProject.ts` and path expansion logic in `preset.ts` for settings like `binaryDir`, `installDir`, `toolchainFile`, `outputLogFile`, `outputJUnitFile`, `resourceSpecFile`.
    - Security test case to verify the path sanitization for both `cmake.copyCompileCommands` and CMakePresets path settings and prevent regressions.

- Preconditions:
    - User has enabled `cmake.useCMakePresets` to `never` or `auto` and `CMakePresets.json` is not present, or using older CMake Tools version without CMakePresets.json for `cmake.copyCompileCommands` vulnerability. For CMakePresets path settings vulnerability, user must be using CMakePresets.
    - Attacker can influence the `cmake.copyCompileCommands` setting or CMakePresets path settings, either by directly modifying `settings.json` or CMakePresets files (if user has shared workspace settings or is tricked into importing malicious settings/presets) or via a malicious workspace configuration.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/src/config.ts`, `ExtensionConfigurationSettings` interface defines `copyCompileCommands: string | null;`, and preset files (`preset.ts`) define various path settings within `ConfigurePreset` and `TestPreset` interfaces, indicating that these settings are read from configuration or preset files.
    - In `/code/src/cmakeProject.ts`, the `refreshCompileDatabase` method is responsible for copying the `compile_commands.json` file based on `cmake.copyCompileCommands`.
    - In `preset.ts`, functions like `expandConfigurePresetVariables` and `expandTestPresetVariables` expand path settings such as `binaryDir`, `installDir`, `toolchainFile`, `outputLogFile`, `outputJUnitFile`, `resourceSpecFile` using `expandString` from `/code/src/expand.ts` (not provided).
    - In `refreshCompileDatabase` (`cmakeProject.ts`) and within preset expansion functions (`preset.ts`), the code retrieves path settings, uses `expandString` to expand them, and then utilizes functions like `fs.mkdir_p` and `fs.copyFile` (in `/code/src/pr.ts`) or other file system operations with these expanded paths.
    - Analyzing `/code/src/pr.ts`, `fs.mkdir_p` recursively creates directories, and `fs.copyFile` copies the file content. Neither of these functions in the provided code snippet perform path sanitization themselves against directory traversal sequences.
    - The `expandString` function in `/code/src/expand.ts` is not provided in the PROJECT FILES, so its implementation and path sanitization capabilities cannot be analyzed.
    - **Visualization**:
        ```
        settings.json/CMakePresets.json -> ConfigurationReader/PresetsParser (config.ts/presetController.ts/presetsParser.ts) -> CMakeProject.refreshCompileDatabase (cmakeProject.ts) / Preset expansion functions (preset.ts)
            -> expandString (expand.ts - not provided) -> fs.mkdir_p (pr.ts) -> fs.copyFile (pr.ts) / other file system operations -> File system write/operation
        ```
    - The code path shows that both `cmake.copyCompileCommands` and CMakePresets path settings, after expansion by `expandString`, are directly used in file system operations without explicit sanitization in the provided files, making them vulnerable to path traversal if the `expandString` function (not provided) doesn't include sanitization and no other sanitization is performed before calling `fs.mkdir_p`, `fs.copyFile` and other file system operation functions. Based on the provided files, the mitigation status is still unclear and requires further investigation of the `expandString` function and its usage in the codebase.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a CMake project with a simple `CMakeLists.txt`.
    2. Open the project in VSCode with CMake Tools extension enabled.
    3. **For `cmake.copyCompileCommands` vulnerability:**
        a. Modify the workspace `settings.json` to set `cmake.copyCompileCommands` to `../compile_commands_traversal.json`.
        b. Trigger CMake configuration (e.g., "CMake: Configure" command).
        c. After configuration completes, check if the `compile_commands_traversal.json` file is created in the directory above the workspace folder (i.e., path traversal is successful).
    4. **For CMakePresets path settings vulnerability (e.g., `binaryDir`):**
        a. Create `CMakePresets.json` and define a configure preset with `binaryDir` set to `../build_traversal`.
        b. Select this configure preset.
        c. Trigger CMake configuration (e.g., "CMake: Configure" command).
        d. After configuration completes, check if the build directory is created in the directory above the workspace folder (i.e., path traversal is successful).
    5. Expected result: Path sanitization should prevent writing `compile_commands_traversal.json` or creating build directory outside the intended workspace or build directory. The file/directory should not be created in the directory above the workspace folder. Instead, it should either fail to copy/create or be copied/created to a safe location within the workspace.
