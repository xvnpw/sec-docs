## Vulnerability List for VS Code ESLint extension

### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary code execution via ESLint configuration overrides (`eslint.nodePath` and `eslint.runtime`)

* Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a workspace configuration (`.code-workspace` file or workspace settings) that overrides ESLint settings, specifically targeting the `eslint.nodePath` or `eslint.runtime` settings. `eslint.nodePath` allows specifying a custom path to search for the ESLint library, while `eslint.runtime` allows specifying a custom Node.js runtime to execute ESLint.
    2. By manipulating these settings, the attacker can point the ESLint extension to execute a malicious Node.js runtime or load a malicious ESLint library from an attacker-controlled location. This malicious location can be a directory specified in `eslint.nodePath` or a custom runtime executable specified in `eslint.runtime`.
    3. When VS Code loads the workspace and the ESLint extension activates, it will use the attacker-specified Node.js runtime or attempt to load the ESLint library from the attacker-provided path.
    4. If the attacker-controlled path contains a malicious ESLint library (or a library masquerading as ESLint) or if the provided runtime is malicious, this code will be executed in the context of the VS Code extension process when ESLint is invoked.
    5. This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when the workspace is opened.

* Impact:
    - Critical: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, complete system compromise, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - User confirmation for `eslint.nodePath` and `eslint.runtime` settings when defined in workspace folder or workspace file. This mitigation was introduced in version 2.1.17 and is documented in `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. The confirmation mechanism is implemented in `client/src/settings.ts` and enforced in `client/src/client.ts`. This requires users to explicitly "Allow" execution when these settings are modified at the workspace level.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Restrict Allowed Paths:** Implement stricter validation and sanitization for `eslint.nodePath` and potentially `eslint.runtime` settings. Restrict the allowed values to only trusted locations or a predefined safe list of directories. Consider disallowing workspace-level overrides for these security-sensitive settings entirely.
    - **Integrity and Authenticity Checks:** Verify the integrity and authenticity of the loaded ESLint library to ensure it is the legitimate ESLint and not a malicious replacement. This could involve code signing verification or checksumming.
    - **Sandboxing:** Run ESLint in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities in ESLint or maliciously loaded libraries or runtimes. This would restrict the permissions and capabilities of the ESLint process, reducing the potential damage from arbitrary code execution.
    - **Input Validation:** Implement input validation and sanitization for the `eslint.nodePath` setting to ensure that the provided path is reasonable and does not point to suspicious locations.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to convince the victim to open a malicious workspace in VS Code. This could be achieved through social engineering tactics, such as sending a malicious `.code-workspace` file, tricking the user into cloning a repository containing malicious workspace settings, or any other method that leads the user to open a workspace under the attacker's control.
    - The vulnerability relies on the user clicking "Allow" in the confirmation dialog that appears when `eslint.nodePath` or `eslint.runtime` are modified at the workspace level. If the user clicks "Deny", the malicious settings are not applied, and the vulnerability is not triggered.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/settings.ts`**: This file manages extension settings, including handling migrations and implementing user confirmation prompts for `eslint.nodePath` and `eslint.runtime`. The `Migration` class and related code are responsible for these settings.
    2. **`client/src/client.ts`**:
        - The `createServerOptions` function constructs the `ServerOptions` object, which configures how the ESLint language server is started.
        - It retrieves the `eslint.runtime`, `eslint.execArgv`, and `eslint.nodeEnv` settings from the workspace configuration. Critically, it also retrieves `eslint.nodePath`.
        - The `runtime` and `options.execArgv` settings, along with `nodePath` influence how the Node.js runtime is spawned for the ESLint server. Specifically, `runtime` is directly used as the executable, and `nodePath` can influence module resolution.

    ```typescript
    // File: /code/client/src/client.ts
    function createServerOptions(extensionUri: Uri): ServerOptions {
        // ...
        const eslintConfig = Workspace.getConfiguration('eslint');
        const debug = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<boolean>('debug', false) ?? false, 'boolean', false);
        const runtime = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string | null>('runtime', null) ?? undefined, 'string', undefined); // <-- eslint.runtime setting
        const execArgv = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string[] | null>('execArgv', null) ?? undefined, 'string', undefined); // <-- eslint.execArgv setting
        const nodeEnv = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string | null>('nodeEnv', null) ?? undefined, 'string', undefined);
        const nodePath = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string | undefined>('nodePath', undefined) ?? null, 'string', undefined); // <-- eslint.nodePath setting

        // ...

        const result: ServerOptions = {
            run: { module: serverModule, transport: TransportKind.ipc, runtime, options: { execArgv, cwd: process.cwd(), env, execPath: runtime === undefined ? undefined : nodePath } }, // runtime, execArgv and nodePath (via execPath) used here
            debug: { module: serverModule, transport: TransportKind.ipc, runtime, options: { execArgv: execArgv !== undefined ? execArgv.concat(debugArgv) : debugArgv, cwd: process.cwd(), env, execPath: runtime === undefined ? undefined : nodePath } }
        };
        return result;
    }
    ```
    3. **`server/src/eslint.ts`**:
        - The `resolveSettings` function in the server-side code uses `settings.nodePath` to resolve the ESLint library path using `Files.resolve`. This function attempts to resolve the `eslint` module starting from the provided `settings.nodePath`.

    ```typescript
    // File: /code/server/src/eslint.ts
    private async resolveSettings(
        settings: ESLintSettings,
        workspaceFolders: WorkspaceFolder[] | undefined,
        moduleResolveWorkingDirectory: string,
        hasWorkspaceFolderCapability: boolean,
        trace: Trace
    ): Promise<ESLintSettings> {
        // ...
        let promise: Thenable<string>;
        if (settings.nodePath !== null && settings.nodePath.length > 0) {
            promise = Files.resolve('eslint', settings.nodePath, moduleResolveWorkingDirectory, trace).then<string, string>(undefined, () => {
                return Files.resolve('eslint', settings.resolvedGlobalPackageManagerPath, moduleResolveWorkingDirectory, trace);
            });
        } else {
            promise = Files.resolve('eslint', settings.resolvedGlobalPackageManagerPath, moduleResolveWorkingDirectory, trace);
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    4. **`client/src/node-utils.ts` and `server/src/files.ts` (inferred)**: The `Files.resolve` function (implementation details not provided, assumed to be within the extension or a utility library) is responsible for resolving module paths. It likely uses Node.js module resolution logic, which is influenced by `NODE_PATH` and the current working directory. In this context, `settings.nodePath` directly influences where `Files.resolve` searches for the `eslint` module, potentially leading to the loading of a malicious ESLint library if `settings.nodePath` points to an attacker-controlled directory.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Attacker Controlled Workspace Settings (.code-workspace or workspace settings)
    -> Overrides eslint.nodePath or eslint.runtime
    -> VSCode ESLint Extension (client/src/client.ts - createServerOptions)
    -> Spawns ESLint Server Process with attacker-controlled Node.js runtime or loads ESLint from attacker-controlled path
    -> Malicious code execution in ESLint Server process context
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Payload (using `eslint.runtime`):** Create a malicious Node.js script (e.g., `malicious_node.js`) that executes arbitrary code (e.g., creates a file in the user's temp directory).
    ```javascript
    // malicious_node.js
    const fs = require('fs');
    const os = require('os');
    fs.writeFileSync(os.tmpdir() + '/pwned_runtime.txt', 'VSCode ESLint Extension PWNED via runtime!');
    console.log('Malicious runtime code executed!');
    ```
    2. **Create Malicious Workspace:** Create a new folder and inside it create a `.code-workspace` file with the following content, replacing `/path/to/malicious_node.js` with the absolute path to the `malicious_node.js` file created in step 1.
    ```json
    {
        "folders": [
            {
                "path": "."
            }
        ],
        "settings": {
            "eslint.runtime": "/path/to/malicious_node.js"
        }
    }
    ```
    3. **Open Malicious Workspace in VS Code:** Open VS Code and then open the folder containing the malicious `.code-workspace` file.
    4. **Observe Confirmation Dialog:** VS Code will prompt a confirmation dialog asking the user to allow execution of the ESLint library with the custom `eslint.runtime` setting.
    5. **Click "Allow":** Click the "Allow" button in the confirmation dialog.
    6. **Verify Code Execution:** Check if the `pwned_runtime.txt` file has been created in the user's temporary directory. If the file exists, it confirms arbitrary code execution through the manipulated `eslint.runtime` setting.

This test case demonstrates that by manipulating workspace settings and convincing a user to allow execution, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution through the VSCode ESLint extension by controlling the runtime environment. The user confirmation dialog acts as a mitigation, but it relies on user awareness and cautious decision-making regarding the security implications of allowing custom runtime or library paths.
