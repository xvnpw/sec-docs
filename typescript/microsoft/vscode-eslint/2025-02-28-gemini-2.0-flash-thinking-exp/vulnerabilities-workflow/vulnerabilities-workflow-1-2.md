### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary code execution via ESLint configuration overrides

* Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a workspace configuration (`.code-workspace` file or workspace settings) that overrides ESLint settings, specifically targeting the `eslint.nodePath` or `eslint.runtime` settings.
    2. By manipulating these settings, the attacker can point the ESLint extension to execute a malicious Node.js runtime or ESLint library from an attacker-controlled location.
    3. When VS Code loads the workspace and the ESLint extension activates, it will use the attacker-specified Node.js runtime or ESLint library.
    4. If the attacker-controlled path contains malicious code (either in the runtime or the ESLint library itself), this code will be executed in the context of the VS Code extension process when ESLint is invoked.
    5. This allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when the workspace is opened.

* Impact:
    - Critical: Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - User confirmation for `eslint.nodePath` and `eslint.runtime` settings when defined in workspace folder or workspace file (introduced in version 2.1.17, see `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`). This confirmation is implemented in `client/src/settings.ts` and enforced in `client/src/client.ts`.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - While user confirmation is implemented, it relies on the user understanding the security implications. A more robust mitigation would be to restrict the allowed values for `eslint.nodePath` and `eslint.runtime` to only trusted locations or to disallow workspace-level overrides for these settings entirely.
    - Sandboxing the ESLint execution environment to limit the impact of malicious code execution could be considered, but is complex to implement.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to open a malicious workspace in VS Code. This could be achieved through social engineering, e.g., sending a malicious `.code-workspace` file or tricking the user into cloning a repository containing malicious workspace settings.
    - The vulnerability relies on the user clicking "Allow" when prompted to confirm the execution of the ESLint library with the modified `eslint.nodePath` or `eslint.runtime`.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/settings.ts`**: This file contains the `Migration` class and related code for handling settings, including migration of older settings and user confirmation for `eslint.nodePath` and `eslint.runtime`.
    2. **`client/src/client.ts`**:
        - `createServerOptions` function constructs the `ServerOptions` for the Language Client.
        - It retrieves `runtime`, `execArgv`, and `nodeEnv` settings from the workspace configuration.
        - It uses these settings to configure the Node.js runtime for the ESLint server.
        - The `runtime` and `options.execArgv` are directly passed to the `run` and `debug` properties of `ServerOptions`.

    ```typescript
    // File: /code/client/src/client.ts
    function createServerOptions(extensionUri: Uri): ServerOptions {
        // ...
        const eslintConfig = Workspace.getConfiguration('eslint');
        const debug = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<boolean>('debug', false) ?? false, 'boolean', false);
        const runtime = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string | null>('runtime', null) ?? undefined, 'string', undefined); // <-- eslint.runtime setting
        const execArgv = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string[] | null>('execArgv', null) ?? undefined, 'string', undefined); // <-- eslint.execArgv setting
        const nodeEnv = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string | null>('nodeEnv', null) ?? undefined, 'string', undefined);

        // ...

        const result: ServerOptions = {
            run: { module: serverModule, transport: TransportKind.ipc, runtime, options: { execArgv, cwd: process.cwd(), env } }, // runtime and execArgv used here
            debug: { module: serverModule, transport: TransportKind.ipc, runtime, options: { execArgv: execArgv !== undefined ? execArgv.concat(debugArgv) : debugArgv, cwd: process.cwd(), env } }
        };
        return result;
    }
    ```

    3. **`README.md`**: Mentions user confirmation for `eslint.nodePath` and `eslint.runtime` and links to CVE-2021-27081 fix, indicating awareness of library execution security risks.

    ### Version 2.1.17

    To follow VS Code's model to confirm workspace local settings that impact code execution the two settings `eslint.runtime` and `eslint.nodePath` now need user confirmation if defined locally in a workspace folder or a workspace file. Users using these settings in those local scopes will see a notification reminding them of the confirmation need.

    This release also addresses the vulnerability described in [CVE-2021-27081](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27081).
    ```

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    Attacker Controlled Workspace Settings (.code-workspace or workspace settings)
    -> Overrides eslint.nodePath or eslint.runtime
    -> VSCode ESLint Extension (client/src/client.ts - createServerOptions)
    -> Spawns ESLint Server Process with attacker-controlled Node.js runtime or ESLint library
    -> Malicious code execution in ESLint Server process context
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Payload:** Create a malicious Node.js script (e.g., `malicious_node.js`) that executes arbitrary code (e.g., creates a file in the user's temp directory).
    ```javascript
    // malicious_node.js
    const fs = require('fs');
    fs.writeFileSync(os.tmpdir() + '/pwned.txt', 'VSCode ESLint Extension PWNED!');
    console.log('Malicious code executed!');
    ```
    2. **Create Malicious Workspace:** Create a new folder and inside it create a `.code-workspace` file with the following content, replacing `/path/to/malicious_node.js` with the absolute path to the `malicious_node.js` file created in step 1.
    ```json
    {
        "folders": [
            {
                "path": "."
            }
        ],
        "settings": {
            "eslint.runtime": "/path/to/malicious_node.js"
        }
    }
    ```
    3. **Open Malicious Workspace in VS Code:** Open VS Code and then open the folder containing the malicious `.code-workspace` file.
    4. **Observe Confirmation Dialog:** VS Code will prompt a confirmation dialog asking the user to allow execution of the ESLint library with the custom `eslint.runtime` setting.
    5. **Click "Allow":** Click the "Allow" button in the confirmation dialog.
    6. **Verify Code Execution:** Check if the `pwned.txt` file has been created in the user's temporary directory. If the file exists, it confirms arbitrary code execution.

This test case demonstrates that by manipulating workspace settings and convincing a user to allow execution, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution through the VSCode ESLint extension. The user confirmation dialog acts as a mitigation, but relies on user awareness and caution.
