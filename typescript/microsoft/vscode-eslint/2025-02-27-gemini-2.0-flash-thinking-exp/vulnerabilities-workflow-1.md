## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Arbitrary Code Execution Through `eslint.nodePath` Setting (Insecure ESLint Library Loading via `eslint.nodePath` Bypass)

- Description:
    This vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution within the VS Code extension host process by leveraging the `eslint.nodePath` setting. The attack unfolds as follows:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace configuration, either by creating a `.code-workspace` file or modifying workspace settings, that sets the `eslint.nodePath` setting. This setting is designed to allow users to specify a custom path to the ESLint library. The malicious path can point to a directory controlled by the attacker.
    2. A victim user opens this workspace in VS Code with the ESLint extension installed and activated.
    3. The VS Code ESLint extension, upon activation in a workspace with this malicious `eslint.nodePath` setting, detects the custom path.
    4. The extension prompts the user for confirmation to use the ESLint library from the attacker-controlled path. This is presented as a confirmation dialog asking to "Allow or Deny execution of the ESLint library at '[malicious path]'".
    5. If the user approves this request by clicking "Allow" or "Allow Everywhere", the extension attempts to load and execute the ESLint library from the path specified in `eslint.nodePath`.
    6. The attacker can place a malicious ESLint library (e.g., by creating a fake `eslint` package with a malicious `index.js` in the malicious path) that contains arbitrary code. Alternatively, the attacker could point `eslint.nodePath` to a malicious Node.js executable itself.
    7. Upon loading, the malicious ESLint library's or Node.js executable's code will be executed within the context of the VS Code extension process when the extension tries to validate a file. This happens because the extension uses `require()` or similar mechanisms to load and execute JavaScript code from the specified path.

- Impact:
    - **Critical**: This vulnerability has a critical impact, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences, including:
        - **Data Theft**: Stealing sensitive information such as workspace files, environment variables, credentials, and other secrets accessible to the VS Code process.
        - **Malware Installation**: Installing malware, backdoors, or other malicious software on the user's system.
        - **Workspace Manipulation**: Modifying workspace files, settings, or project configurations.
        - **Lateral Movement**: Potentially gaining further access to the user's system and network.
        - **Complete System Compromise**: In the worst case, gaining complete control over the user's VS Code instance and potentially the entire development environment and system.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **User Confirmation Dialog**: Implemented since version 2.1.17, the extension presents a confirmation dialog to users when a workspace or workspace folder defines `eslint.nodePath` or `eslint.runtime`. This dialog prompts users to explicitly "Allow" or "Deny" the execution of the ESLint library from the custom path. This mitigation is implemented in `client/src/client.ts` and documented in `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. The dialog is also mentioned in `README.md` version 2.1.10.
    - **Workspace Trust Model**:  Since version 2.1.22, the extension adapts to VS Code's workspace trust model. This adds a layer of security by requiring users to explicitly trust workspaces before extensions are fully enabled. However, if a user trusts a workspace and subsequently approves the custom `nodePath` in the confirmation dialog, this mitigation is bypassed.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The extension lacks robust validation and sanitization of the `eslint.nodePath` setting. It should implement checks to ensure the path is reasonable and safe. Suspicious paths, such as those pointing to temporary directories, user-writable directories outside the workspace, or paths containing shell injection characters, should be blocked.
    - **Sandboxing or Isolation**: The ESLint execution is not sandboxed or isolated from the main VS Code extension process. Executing external code directly within the extension's process is inherently risky. A more secure approach would be to execute ESLint in a separate, isolated process with limited permissions, minimizing the impact of potential vulnerabilities in the loaded library.
    - **Clearer Warning Messages**: The confirmation dialog, while a mitigation, could be improved to more clearly and prominently warn users about the potential security risks of approving custom `nodePath` settings, especially when opening workspaces from untrusted sources. The message should explicitly mention the risk of arbitrary code execution and advise caution when allowing custom paths from unknown or untrusted sources.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Explore the feasibility of using Content Security Policy (CSP) mechanisms, even within the limited capabilities available to VS Code extensions, to further restrict the actions of loaded libraries and reduce the potential attack surface.
    - **Heuristics and Reputation Checks**: Investigate the possibility of incorporating heuristics to detect suspicious `nodePath` settings or performing reputation checks on the resolved ESLint library path. This could involve analyzing the path for known malicious patterns or checking against lists of known malicious paths or packages. However, this approach could be complex and might introduce false positives.

- Preconditions:
    1. **VS Code ESLint Extension Installed**: The victim user must have the VS Code ESLint extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    2. **Malicious Workspace Configuration**: The attacker needs to provide or convince the user to use a workspace configuration (either a `.code-workspace` file or workspace settings) that includes a malicious `eslint.nodePath` setting. This could be achieved by:
        - Tricking the user into opening a workspace or folder controlled by the attacker (e.g., through a malicious repository, shared project, or social engineering).
        - Socially engineering the user into manually modifying workspace settings to include the malicious `eslint.nodePath`.
    3. **User Approval**: The user must approve the execution of the ESLint library from the custom `nodePath` when prompted by the VS Code ESLint extension's confirmation dialog. This requires the user to click "Allow" or "Allow Everywhere" in the dialog, potentially due to habituation, lack of understanding of the risks, or social engineering.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/client.ts` - `createServerOptions` function:**
        ```typescript
        function createServerOptions(extensionUri: Uri): ServerOptions {
            const serverModule = Uri.joinPath(extensionUri, 'server', 'out', 'eslintServer.js').fsPath;
            const eslintConfig = Workspace.getConfiguration('eslint');
            const debug = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<boolean>('debug', false) ?? false, 'boolean', false);
            const runtime = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string | null>('runtime', null) ?? undefined, 'string', undefined); // <-- runtime from settings
            const execArgv = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string[] | null>('execArgv', null) ?? undefined, 'string', undefined); // <-- execArgv from settings
            const nodeEnv = sanitize(eslintConfig.get<string | null>('nodeEnv', null) ?? undefined, 'string', undefined);

            // ...
            const result: ServerOptions = {
                run: { module: serverModule, transport: TransportKind.ipc, runtime, options: { execArgv, cwd: process.cwd(), env } }, // runtime and execArgv are used here
                debug: { module: serverModule, transport: TransportKind.ipc, runtime, options: { execArgv: execArgv !== undefined ? execArgv.concat(debugArgv) : debugArgv, cwd: process.cwd(), env } }
            };
            return result;
        }
        ```
        This code snippet from `client/src/client.ts` demonstrates how the `runtime` setting, configurable via `eslint.runtime` and indirectly by influencing ESLint library resolution through `eslint.nodePath`, is used to configure the `ServerOptions` for the LanguageClient. This `runtime` setting can be manipulated to use a malicious Node.js executable if `eslint.nodePath` is controlled by an attacker.

    2. **`server/src/eslint.ts` - `resolveSettings` function:**
        ```typescript
        export async function resolveSettings(document: TextDocument): Promise<TextDocumentSettings> {
            // ...
            let nodePath: string | undefined;
            if (settings.nodePath !== null) {
                nodePath = settings.nodePath; // <-- nodePath setting is read
                if (!path.isAbsolute(nodePath) && workspaceFolderPath !== undefined) {
                    nodePath = path.join(workspaceFolderPath, nodePath);
                }
            }
            // ...
            let promise: Promise<string>;
            const eslintPath = settings.experimental?.useFlatConfig ? 'eslint/use-at-your-own-risk' : 'eslint'; // <-- eslint path
            if (nodePath !== undefined) {
                promise = Files.resolve(eslintPath, nodePath, nodePath, trace).then<string, string>(undefined, () => { // <-- Files.resolve using nodePath
                    return Files.resolve(eslintPath, settings.resolvedGlobalPackageManagerPath, moduleResolveWorkingDirectory, trace);
                });
            } else {
                promise = Files.resolve(eslintPath, settings.resolvedGlobalPackageManagerPath, moduleResolveWorkingDirectory, trace); // <-- Files.resolve without nodePath, relying on default resolution
            }
            // ...
            return promise.then(async (libraryPath) => { // libraryPath is the resolved path to eslint library
                let library = path2Library.get(libraryPath);
                if (library === undefined) {
                    library = loadNodeModule(libraryPath); // <-- loadNodeModule loads the library from the resolved path
                    // ...
                    settings.library = library; // <-- loaded library is used
                    path2Library.set(libraryPath, library);
                } else {
                    settings.library = library;
                }
                // ...
                return settings;
            }, () => { // ... error handling
                return settings;
            });
        }
        ```
        The `resolveSettings` function in `server/src/eslint.ts` clearly demonstrates how `eslint.nodePath` is used to resolve the ESLint library path. The code reads the `eslint.nodePath` setting and uses the `Files.resolve` function to locate the ESLint library. Critically, `loadNodeModule` is then called to load the library from the resolved path using `require()`. If `nodePath` points to a malicious location and the user approves the execution, this mechanism allows for loading and execution of arbitrary code.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Workspace & ESLint Library:**
        - Create a new empty directory, which will serve as the workspace root.
        - Inside this directory, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
        - Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json`.
        - In the workspace root, create a subdirectory named `malicious_eslint_path`.
        - Inside `malicious_eslint_path`, create a file named `index.js` with the following malicious ESLint library code:
            ```javascript
            console.error("Malicious ESLint library loaded!");
            // Simulate ESLint API (minimal for extension to load without immediate error)
            module.exports = {
                ESLint: class ESLint {
                    async lintText(code, options) {
                        console.error("Malicious lintText executed!");
                        // Simulate some ESLint report to avoid extension errors
                        return [{ messages: [], errorCount: 0, warningCount: 0, filePath: options.filePath }];
                    }
                    async isPathIgnored(filePath) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    getRulesMetaForResults() {
                        return {};
                    }
                    calculateConfigForFile() {
                        return {};
                    }
                }
            };
            ```
        - In the `malicious_eslint_path` directory, create a `package.json` file:
            ```json
            {
              "name": "eslint",
              "version": "8.0.0"
            }
            ```
        - Alternatively, to test malicious Node.js execution directly (as described in the second vulnerability list), create `malicious-node.js` in the workspace root:
          ```javascript
          #!/usr/bin/env node
          console.log("Malicious Node.js Executable is running!");
          require('fs').writeFileSync('pwned.txt', 'You have been PWNED by malicious nodePath!');
          ```
          and make it executable (`chmod +x malicious-node.js`).

    2. **Configure Malicious `eslint.nodePath`:**
        - Open the `.vscode/settings.json` and add the following setting to point to the malicious ESLint library:
            ```json
            {
                "eslint.nodePath": "./malicious_eslint_path"
            }
            ```
        - Or, to test malicious Node.js execution, set:
            ```json
            {
                "eslint.nodePath": "./malicious-node.js"
            }
            ```
        - For the Node.js executable test, you can also create `malicious.code-workspace` in the workspace root with:
          ```json
          {
              "folders": [
                  {
                      "path": "."
                  }
              ],
              "settings": {
                  "eslint.nodePath": "./malicious-node.js"
              }
          }
          ```

    3. **Open Workspace and Trigger ESLint Validation:**
        - Open VS Code and open the workspace directory. Or, if using `.code-workspace`, open the `.code-workspace` file.
        - Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `test.js`) in the workspace root.
        - Ensure the ESLint extension is activated.
        - Open the `test.js` file to trigger ESLint validation.

    4. **Observe Confirmation Dialog and Approve Execution:**
        - Observe the VS Code ESLint extension status bar item. It should indicate ESLint initialization.
        - A confirmation dialog should appear, asking to "Allow or Deny execution of the ESLint library at '[malicious path]'".
        - Click **"Allow Everywhere"** (or "Allow") to simulate an unwary user approving the execution.

    5. **Verify Code Execution:**
        - **For Malicious ESLint Library Test:** Open the "Output" panel in VS Code and select "ESLint" in the dropdown. Observe the output. You should see messages like "Malicious ESLint library loaded!" and "Malicious lintText executed!", confirming the malicious code from `malicious_eslint_path/index.js` was executed.
        - **For Malicious Node.js Executable Test:** Check if the file `pwned.txt` has been created in the `malicious-workspace` directory, indicating code execution from `malicious-node.js`.  Also, observe the "ESLint" output panel for "Malicious Node.js Executable is running!" message if the script logs to stdout/stderr.

This security test case demonstrates that by controlling the `eslint.nodePath` setting and tricking the user into approving its execution, an attacker can successfully achieve arbitrary code execution within the VS Code ESLint extension's context, highlighting the vulnerability despite the presence of a user confirmation dialog.
