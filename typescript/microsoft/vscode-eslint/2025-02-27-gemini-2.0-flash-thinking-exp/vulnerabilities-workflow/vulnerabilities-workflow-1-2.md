### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary code execution through `eslint.nodePath` setting

- Description:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious workspace configuration file (`.code-workspace` or within workspace settings) that sets the `eslint.nodePath` setting to point to a malicious Node.js executable or a directory containing malicious Node.js executables.
    2. A victim user opens this workspace in VS Code with the ESLint extension installed.
    3. VS Code detects the workspace settings and applies the `eslint.nodePath` setting.
    4. When the ESLint extension attempts to load the ESLint library, it uses the Node.js executable specified in the malicious `eslint.nodePath`.
    5. If the malicious Node.js executable is crafted to execute arbitrary code, it will be executed with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    6. The user is prompted with a confirmation dialog to allow execution of the ESLint library from the specified `nodePath`. If the user approves, the malicious Node.js executable runs.

- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This could lead to data theft, installation of malware, or complete system compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - User confirmation dialog: VS Code prompts the user to confirm the execution of the ESLint library when a custom `eslint.nodePath` is detected in workspace settings. This dialog is implemented in `client/src/client.ts` and mentioned in `README.md` (version 2.1.17 and 2.1.10).

- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension does not validate or sanitize the `eslint.nodePath` setting to ensure it points to a legitimate Node.js executable.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: The ESLint execution is not sandboxed or isolated, allowing it to potentially access system resources and execute arbitrary code.
    - Clearer warning messages: The confirmation dialog could be improved to more clearly warn users about the potential security risks of approving custom `nodePath` settings, especially when opening workspaces from untrusted sources.

- Preconditions:
    - Victim user must have the VSCode ESLint extension installed.
    - Attacker must be able to provide a malicious workspace configuration file (e.g., through a public repository or by social engineering).
    - Victim user must open the malicious workspace in VS Code.
    - Victim user must approve the execution of the ESLint library when prompted by the confirmation dialog.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`client/src/client.ts`**: This file handles the client-side logic of the ESLint extension, including settings resolution and library loading.
    2. **`ESLintClient.create` function**: This function initializes the LanguageClient and sets up client options.
    3. **`createServerOptions` function**: This function constructs the `ServerOptions` for the LanguageClient, which includes the `runtime` and `options` properties. The `runtime` property can be influenced by the `eslint.runtime` setting, and `eslint.nodePath` is used to resolve the ESLint library path.
    4. **`Files.resolve` function**: This function (in `client/src/node-utils.ts` or a similar utility module) is used to resolve the ESLint library path, taking into account `eslint.nodePath`.
    5. **User Confirmation Dialog**: The extension displays a confirmation dialog when `eslint.nodePath` is set, as described in `README.md` and implemented in `client/src/client.ts`. This dialog is intended to mitigate the risk, but relies on user awareness and caution.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Workspace:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-workspace`.
        - Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `malicious-node.js` with the following content:
          ```javascript
          #!/usr/bin/env node
          console.log("Malicious Node.js Executable is running!");
          // Example of malicious action: writing a file to disk
          require('fs').writeFileSync('pwned.txt', 'You have been PWNED by malicious nodePath!');
          ```
        - Make `malicious-node.js` executable (e.g., `chmod +x malicious-node.js`).
        - Create a file named `malicious.code-workspace` inside `malicious-workspace` with the following content:
          ```json
          {
              "folders": [
                  {
                      "path": "."
                  }
              ],
              "settings": {
                  "eslint.nodePath": "./malicious-node.js"
              }
          }
          ```
        - Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `test.js`) inside `malicious-workspace`.
    2. **Victim Opens Malicious Workspace:**
        - Instruct a victim user to open the `malicious.code-workspace` file in VS Code with the ESLint extension enabled.
    3. **Trigger ESLint Validation:**
        - Open the `test.js` file in VS Code to trigger ESLint validation.
    4. **Observe Confirmation Dialog:**
        - VS Code should display a confirmation dialog asking the user to allow execution of the ESLint library from the specified `nodePath` (`./malicious-node.js`).
    5. **Approve Execution (Simulate Unwary User):**
        - Click "Allow" or "Allow Everywhere" in the confirmation dialog.
    6. **Verify Arbitrary Code Execution:**
        - Check if the file `pwned.txt` has been created in the `malicious-workspace` directory.
        - Observe the "Malicious Node.js Executable is running!" message in the ESLint output channel (if the malicious script logs to stdout/stderr and the extension captures it).

This test case demonstrates how a malicious `eslint.nodePath` can lead to code execution if a user approves the confirmation, highlighting the vulnerability despite the existing mitigation.
