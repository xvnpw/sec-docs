## Combined Vulnerability List

### Insecure Deserialization in Custom Evaluator (Potential)
* Description: Version 0.10.0 of the AI Toolkit introduces "Custom Evaluator" feature, as mentioned in `/code/WHATS_NEW.md`, which allows users to define custom evaluation logic using Python code or LLM prompts. If the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature deserializes untrusted data (e.g., from a file or network) without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to insecure deserialization attacks. An attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized by the extension, could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
* Impact: Critical. Remote Code Execution. Successful exploitation could allow a complete compromise of the user's machine.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None mentioned in the provided documentation.
* Missing Mitigations: Secure deserialization practices should be implemented for the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature. Input validation and sanitization of any data being deserialized. Consider using safer alternatives to pickle or similar deserialization libraries if they are used. If possible, isolate the execution environment of custom evaluators.
* Preconditions:
    * AI Toolkit VS Code extension version 0.10.0 or later is installed and activated.
    * The user uses the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature.
    * The attacker can provide malicious Python code or data that is processed by the custom evaluator feature, potentially through a crafted project, dataset, or prompt configuration.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided files do not contain the source code for the "Custom evaluator" feature.
    * If the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature uses Python's `pickle` or similar libraries to deserialize data from files or external sources without proper security measures, it could be vulnerable to insecure deserialization.
    * An attacker could create a malicious Python object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
    * Visualization (Conceptual):
    ```
    Attacker -> Malicious Python Code/Data (e.g., crafted evaluator definition or dataset) -> AI Toolkit "Custom Evaluator" Feature -> Insecure Deserialization (e.g., via pickle.load) -> Arbitrary Code Execution on User's Machine -> Attacker Control
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Install and activate AI Toolkit VS Code extension version 0.10.0 or later.
    2. Create a project that utilizes the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature.
    3. Craft a malicious Python script for the custom evaluator that contains code to be executed upon deserialization. This often involves using the `__reduce__` method or similar techniques in Python to inject code during deserialization.
    4. Configure the AI Toolkit to use this malicious Python script as a custom evaluator.
    5. Trigger the evaluation process within the AI Toolkit.
    6. Monitor for arbitrary code execution. For example, the malicious script could attempt to create a file, open a network connection, or execute a system command to confirm code execution.
    7. If the malicious code executes successfully during the evaluation process, the insecure deserialization vulnerability is confirmed.

### Local REST API Path Traversal
* Description: The AI Toolkit exposes a local REST API on port 5272, as documented in `/code/archive/README.md`. This API might be vulnerable to path traversal if it improperly handles user-provided file paths when processing requests, potentially allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directories on the user's machine. An attacker could craft a malicious request to the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with a payload that includes a path traversal sequence (e.g., `../`) in a filename or path parameter, if such parameters are used by the API to access local files.
* Impact: High. An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the user's local file system that the VS Code extension process has access to. This could include configuration files, source code, or personal documents.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None mentioned in the provided documentation.
* Missing Mitigations: Input validation and sanitization for all file path parameters used by the local REST API. Implementation of proper access controls to restrict file access to only necessary resources.
* Preconditions:
    * The AI Toolkit VS Code extension is installed and activated.
    * The local REST API server is running (it's unclear from the documentation if it runs by default or needs to be explicitly started, assuming it runs when the extension is active or when a model is loaded in playground).
    * Attacker has network access to the user's machine on port 5272 (in practice, this is localhost, so attacker needs to run code on the user's machine, which is a weaker precondition for a VS Code extension context).
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided files do not contain the source code of the REST API.
    * Based on the documentation, the API uses the OpenAI chat completions format.
    * If the API implementation uses user-provided input to construct file paths without proper validation, it could be vulnerable to path traversal.
    * For example, if the API were to load model files or datasets based on parameters in the request body, and these parameters are not sanitized, a path traversal vulnerability could occur.
    * Visualization (Conceptual):
    ```
    Attacker -> HTTP Request (with path traversal in payload) -> REST API Handler -> File System Access (vulnerable if path not sanitized) -> Sensitive File Read -> Attacker
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Install and activate the AI Toolkit extension in VS Code.
    2. Start the local REST API server if it's not automatically started when the extension is active (check extension documentation or behavior).
    3. Use `curl` or Postman to send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:5272/v1/chat/completions`.
    4. Craft a JSON request body that attempts to exploit a potential path traversal vulnerability. For example, if a `model` parameter is used to load model files, try using a path like `"../sensitive_file"` as the model name.
    5. Example malicious request body:
    ```json
    {
        "model": "../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "test"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    6. Send the request: `curl -vX POST http://127.0.0.1:5272/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @malicious_request.json`
    7. Analyze the response. If the API returns the content of `/etc/passwd` (or any other sensitive file based on OS and access rights), or an error message indicating file access outside of the expected directory, then the vulnerability is confirmed. Note: the exact file path to test will depend on the OS and where the extension is expected to access files. For Windows, try paths like `C:\Windows\win.ini`.

### Playground Attachment Arbitrary File Read
* Description: The Playground feature of the AI Toolkit allows users to attach files when interacting with multi-modal models, as described in `/code/doc/playground.md`. If the extension processes these attachments without proper validation of the file path provided by the user when selecting the attachment, an attacker could potentially use path traversal techniques to select and upload files from outside the intended workspace directory. While the user initiates the file selection, the extension's handling of the selected path might be vulnerable if it doesn't enforce workspace boundaries for attachment operations.
* Impact: High. An attacker could, by carefully crafting a playground interaction, potentially exfiltrate local files from the user's system by attaching them to a model interaction and then somehow retrieving the attached content (the retrieval mechanism needs further investigation in the actual implementation, but the file read itself is the core vulnerability here).
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None mentioned in the provided documentation.
* Missing Mitigations: Workspace boundary enforcement when handling file attachments in the Playground. Validation and sanitization of file paths to prevent path traversal during file selection and attachment processing.
* Preconditions:
    * The AI Toolkit VS Code extension is installed and activated.
    * A multi-modal model with attachment support is loaded in the Playground.
    * The attacker has access to the VS Code instance and can interact with the Playground.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided files do not contain the source code for the Playground attachment feature.
    * If the file attachment functionality relies on VS Code's file dialog for user selection, but then directly uses the provided file path without checking if it's within the allowed workspace or intended directories, it could be vulnerable.
    * The vulnerability lies in the assumption that user-selected files are always safe and within allowed boundaries, without explicit checks by the extension.
    * Visualization (Conceptual):
    ```
    Attacker (via Playground UI) -> Select File Attachment (with potential path traversal in file path) -> Extension File Attachment Handler -> File System Read (vulnerable if path not validated) -> File Content potentially exfiltrated -> Attacker
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Install and activate the AI Toolkit extension in VS Code.
    2. Load a multi-modal model in the Playground that supports attachments.
    3. In the Playground chat interface, attempt to attach a file using path traversal to navigate outside the current workspace. For example, try to attach a file by manually typing or pasting a path like `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` into the file selection dialog, or by starting in the workspace and navigating upwards using ".." if allowed by the file selector.
    4. If the extension allows selecting files outside of the workspace, and proceeds to attach and process the file, this is the first step of the vulnerability.
    5. After attaching the file (if successful in step 4), interact with the model in a way that would trigger the extension to process the attachment. Observe if there is any indication that the file content is being processed or sent to the model (network traffic analysis or extension logs might be needed if direct output is not visible).
    6. Further investigation is needed to determine how the attached file content can be retrieved by the attacker. This might involve intercepting API calls, analyzing extension behavior, or other reverse engineering techniques depending on the actual implementation. The initial vulnerability is the ability to attach and potentially process files from arbitrary locations due to lack of path validation.

### Remote Inference Endpoint Injection
* Description:
    1. The AI Toolkit for VS Code allows users to add and configure remote inference endpoints for AI models, as documented in `/code/doc/playground.md` and `/code/doc/models.md`.
    2. Users can manually add a remote model by providing a model name, endpoint URL, and optional authentication headers.
    3. If the extension does not properly validate or sanitize the provided endpoint URL, a malicious actor could inject a URL pointing to an attacker-controlled server.
    4. When a user selects and uses this maliciously configured "remote model" in the Playground or through the API, the extension will send API requests to the attacker's server instead of the intended legitimate AI service.
    5. This can be achieved by convincing a user to copy-paste a malicious URL or by social engineering to directly modify the VSCode settings file (`settings.json`) where remote inference endpoints are stored as described in `/code/doc/playground.md`.
* Impact:
    - **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can intercept all user prompts sent to the "remote model", potentially capturing sensitive information intended for the AI model.
    - **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** The attacker can observe and log both user prompts and AI model responses.
    - **Malicious Response Injection:** The attacker's server can return manipulated or entirely fabricated AI responses to the user. This can lead to misinformation, code injection if the model is used for code generation, or other forms of supply chain attacks if the manipulated responses are used in further development processes.
    - **Credential Harvesting (if authentication header is also vulnerable):** If the authentication header setting is also vulnerable to injection, an attacker could potentially redirect authentication requests to a fake service and attempt to harvest API keys or other credentials if the user unknowingly provides them.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided documentation. The documentation focuses on how to add remote models but lacks any mention of security considerations or input validation for endpoint URLs.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation and sanitization for the remote inference endpoint URL. This should include verifying the URL scheme (e.g., `https://` preferred, `http://` should be strongly discouraged and warned against), hostname, and path. Blacklisting or whitelisting of allowed hosts could be considered, although whitelisting might be too restrictive for user-provided endpoints.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy for the VS Code extension to restrict the origins to which the extension can make network requests. This would act as a defense-in-depth measure.
    - **User Warnings:** Display clear warnings to the user when adding or editing remote inference endpoints, emphasizing the security risks of using untrusted or unknown endpoints.
    - **Secure Settings Storage:** Ensure that the settings file (`settings.json`) where remote endpoints are stored is protected against unauthorized modifications, although this is more of a general VS Code security concern.
* Preconditions:
    * The user must have the AI Toolkit for VS Code extension installed and be using the remote inference feature.
    * The user must manually add or edit a remote inference endpoint in the extension settings, and be tricked into entering a malicious URL.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. Examine the source code responsible for:
        - Reading remote inference endpoint configurations from VS Code settings (likely `settings.json`).
        - Parsing the endpoint URL and authentication header from the settings.
        - Constructing and sending HTTP requests to the configured endpoint when a remote model is used in the Playground or API calls.
    2. Verify if there is any input validation or sanitization applied to the endpoint URL before it is used in network requests.
    3. Check if the extension uses any mechanisms to prevent arbitrary network requests, such as Content Security Policy.
    4. Look for code patterns that directly use user-provided strings as URLs without validation, which is a common source of injection vulnerabilities.
    5. Visualize the data flow from settings to network request execution to understand the exact path of the endpoint URL and identify potential injection points.
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Attacker Server:** As an attacker, set up a simple HTTP server using Python's `http.server` or `netcat` on a publicly accessible IP address or use a service like `ngrok` to expose a local server. Configure the server to log all incoming requests and return a simple JSON response (e.g., `{"choices": [{"message": {"content": "Malicious Response"}}]} `) mimicking a chat completion response.
    2. **Prepare Malicious URL:** Obtain the URL of your attacker server (e.g., `http://attacker-server-ip:port/v1/chat/completions`).
    3. **Victim Configuration:** As a victim user:
        - Open VS Code with the AI Toolkit extension installed.
        - Open VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings).
        - Search for "AI Toolkit Remote Inference Endpoints" or navigate to the AI Toolkit extension settings.
        - Click "Add Item" to add a new remote inference endpoint.
        - Enter a "Model Name" (e.g., "MaliciousModel").
        - In the "Endpoint URL" field, paste the malicious URL obtained in step 2 (e.g., `http://attacker-server-ip:port/v1/chat/completions`).
        - Leave "Authentication Header" empty or provide a dummy value.
        - Save the settings.
    4. **Exploit in Playground:**
        - Open the AI Toolkit Playground.
        - In the "Model" dropdown, select the newly added "MaliciousModel".
        - Enter a prompt in the chat input (e.g., "Hello").
        - Send the prompt.
    5. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check the logs of your attacker-controlled HTTP server. Verify that the server received an HTTP POST request to `/v1/chat/completions` containing the user's prompt.
        - Observe the response in the AI Toolkit Playground. It should display "Malicious Response" (or the custom response you configured on the attacker server).
    6. **Impact Confirmation:** This test confirms that the extension is sending requests to the attacker-specified endpoint, demonstrating the Remote Inference Endpoint Injection vulnerability. An attacker can now intercept prompts and inject malicious responses.

### Remote Model Endpoint SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
* Description: The AI Toolkit allows users to add remote models by specifying an OpenAI compatible chat completion endpoint URL, as described in `/code/doc/playground.md` and `/code/archive/playground-remote-inference.md`. If the extension does not properly validate and sanitize the provided URL, or if it makes server-side requests based on this user-provided URL without sufficient protection, it could be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). An attacker could provide a malicious URL that, when processed by the extension, causes the extension's backend to make requests to internal or external resources that the attacker would not normally be able to access.
* Impact: High. An attacker could potentially use the extension as a proxy to scan internal networks, access internal services, or exfiltrate sensitive information from internal resources if the extension backend is running in an environment with access to such resources.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None mentioned in the provided documentation.
* Missing Mitigations: Strict validation and sanitization of user-provided remote model endpoint URLs. Implement a denylist of disallowed URLs (e.g., private IP ranges, localhost, etc.). Consider using a dedicated HTTP client library with SSRF protection features. If possible, restrict the network access of the extension's backend process.
* Preconditions:
    * AI Toolkit VS Code extension version 0.4.0 or later is installed and activated.
    * The user uses the "Add model for remote inference" feature and provides a URL.
    * The extension's backend process makes HTTP requests based on the provided URL.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided files do not contain the source code for remote model integration.
    * If the extension directly uses the user-provided URL to make HTTP requests without validation, it could be vulnerable to SSRF.
    * An attacker could provide URLs pointing to internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, or other sensitive resources.
    * Visualization (Conceptual):
    ```
    Attacker (via VS Code UI) -> Provide Malicious Remote Model URL -> AI Toolkit Backend -> HTTP Request to Malicious URL (potentially internal resource) -> SSRF -> Attacker gains access or information
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Install and activate AI Toolkit VS Code extension version 0.4.0 or later.
    2. Use the "Add model for remote inference" feature.
    3. In the endpoint URL field, provide a URL that points to a resource that should not be accessible from the extension's backend if SSRF protection is in place. Examples:
        * `http://localhost:<some_internal_service_port>` (to test access to local services on the user's machine, though less relevant for extension context)
        * `http://169.254.169.254/metadata` (AWS/Azure/GCP metadata endpoint - if the VS Code or extension backend runs in a cloud environment, this is a more relevant test)
        * A URL to an internal network resource if the test environment simulates an internal network.
    4. Add the remote model with the malicious URL.
    5. Attempt to use the remote model in the Playground.
    6. Observe the behavior. If the extension successfully connects to and retrieves data from the provided URL (especially if it's an internal or restricted resource), it indicates a potential SSRF vulnerability. Network traffic analysis may be needed to confirm the requests made by the extension. For example, if you use `http://169.254.169.254/metadata`, and the extension returns metadata information, SSRF is confirmed. If it's `http://localhost:<port_of_internal_service>`, and you get a response from that service, SSRF is also confirmed.

### Unauthenticated Local REST API Access
* Description:
    1. The AI Toolkit VSCode extension starts a local REST API web server on port 5272.
    2. This API is intended to allow local applications to interact with AI models managed by the extension.
    3. The API endpoint `/v1/chat/completions` is used for chat completion requests, as documented in the README.
    4. An attacker on the same machine can send POST requests to this API endpoint without any authentication.
    5. The API processes these requests and interacts with the AI models as configured in the extension.
* Impact:
    - An attacker with local access to the user's machine can bypass the VSCode extension's UI and directly interact with the AI models.
    - This unauthorized access allows the attacker to generate text, potentially using models downloaded or configured within the AI Toolkit.
    - The attacker could exfiltrate model outputs or use the models for unintended or malicious purposes within the local environment.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The documentation mentions a placeholder `api_key="x"` but states it is "not used", indicating no effective authentication is implemented for the local REST API.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for the local REST API.
    - Restrict API access to only accept requests from localhost (127.0.0.1) to prevent network exposure.
    - Consider using API keys or tokens for authentication to verify legitimate requests.
* Preconditions:
    * AI Toolkit VSCode extension is installed and active.
    * A model is loaded in the AI Toolkit or the playground feature is in use, which implicitly starts the local REST API.
    * The attacker has local access to the machine where the VSCode extension is running.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on documentation (`/code/archive/README.md`), the extension starts a REST API server on port 5272.
    - The documentation explicitly shows how to use `curl` to send requests to `/v1/chat/completions` without any authentication headers (except for `Content-Type`).
    - The Python example code in `/code/archive/README.md` to use the OpenAI client library sets `api_key="x"` but comments `# required for the API but not used`, confirming that API key authentication is not enforced.
    - The lack of any mention of authentication in the documentation and the example curl command strongly suggests that the local REST API is indeed unauthenticated.
    - Without access to the source code, it's inferred that the API endpoint handler in the extension's backend does not perform authentication checks before processing requests.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Install the "AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code" extension in VSCode.
    2. Open VSCode and load any AI model using the AI Toolkit extension (e.g., through the Model Catalog or by loading into Playground). This action should start the local REST API server.
    3. Open a terminal or command prompt on the same machine where VSCode is running.
    4. Execute the following `curl` command to send a chat completion request to the local API without any authentication:
        ```bash
        curl -vX POST http://127.0.0.1:5272/v1/chat/completions \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
            "model": "Phi-3-mini-4k-directml-int4-awq-block-128-onnx",
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "What is the capital of France?"
                }
            ],
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "max_tokens": 50
        }'
        ```
        **Note:** Replace `"Phi-3-mini-4k-directml-int4-awq-block-128-onnx"` with the name of a model that is actually loaded in your AI Toolkit if needed.
    5. Observe the output from the `curl` command.
    6. Expected Result: If the API is vulnerable, the `curl` command will successfully return a response from the AI model (e.g., "Paris"). This indicates that the unauthenticated request was processed successfully by the local REST API.
    7. If the API requires authentication, the `curl` command should return an error indicating unauthorized access (e.g., HTTP 401 or 403 status code).
