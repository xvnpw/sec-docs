### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Remote Inference Endpoint Injection
  - Description:
    1. The AI Toolkit for VS Code allows users to add and configure remote inference endpoints for AI models, as documented in `/code/doc/playground.md` and `/code/doc/models.md`.
    2. Users can manually add a remote model by providing a model name, endpoint URL, and optional authentication headers.
    3. If the extension does not properly validate or sanitize the provided endpoint URL, a malicious actor could inject a URL pointing to an attacker-controlled server.
    4. When a user selects and uses this maliciously configured "remote model" in the Playground or through the API, the extension will send API requests to the attacker's server instead of the intended legitimate AI service.
    5. This can be achieved by convincing a user to copy-paste a malicious URL or by social engineering to directly modify the VSCode settings file (`settings.json`) where remote inference endpoints are stored as described in `/code/doc/playground.md`.
  - Impact:
    - **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can intercept all user prompts sent to the "remote model", potentially capturing sensitive information intended for the AI model.
    - **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** The attacker can observe and log both user prompts and AI model responses.
    - **Malicious Response Injection:** The attacker's server can return manipulated or entirely fabricated AI responses to the user. This can lead to misinformation, code injection if the model is used for code generation, or other forms of supply chain attacks if the manipulated responses are used in further development processes.
    - **Credential Harvesting (if authentication header is also vulnerable):** If the authentication header setting is also vulnerable to injection, an attacker could potentially redirect authentication requests to a fake service and attempt to harvest API keys or other credentials if the user unknowingly provides them.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided documentation. The documentation focuses on how to add remote models but lacks any mention of security considerations or input validation for endpoint URLs.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation and sanitization for the remote inference endpoint URL. This should include verifying the URL scheme (e.g., `https://` preferred, `http://` should be strongly discouraged and warned against), hostname, and path. Blacklisting or whitelisting of allowed hosts could be considered, although whitelisting might be too restrictive for user-provided endpoints.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy for the VS Code extension to restrict the origins to which the extension can make network requests. This would act as a defense-in-depth measure.
    - **User Warnings:** Display clear warnings to the user when adding or editing remote inference endpoints, emphasizing the security risks of using untrusted or unknown endpoints.
    - **Secure Settings Storage:** Ensure that the settings file (`settings.json`) where remote endpoints are stored is protected against unauthorized modifications, although this is more of a general VS Code security concern.
  - Preconditions:
    - The user must have the AI Toolkit for VS Code extension installed and be using the remote inference feature.
    - The user must manually add or edit a remote inference endpoint in the extension settings, and be tricked into entering a malicious URL.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. Examine the source code responsible for:
        - Reading remote inference endpoint configurations from VS Code settings (likely `settings.json`).
        - Parsing the endpoint URL and authentication header from the settings.
        - Constructing and sending HTTP requests to the configured endpoint when a remote model is used in the Playground or API calls.
    2. Verify if there is any input validation or sanitization applied to the endpoint URL before it is used in network requests.
    3. Check if the extension uses any mechanisms to prevent arbitrary network requests, such as Content Security Policy.
    4. Look for code patterns that directly use user-provided strings as URLs without validation, which is a common source of injection vulnerabilities.
    5. Visualize the data flow from settings to network request execution to understand the exact path of the endpoint URL and identify potential injection points.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Attacker Server:** As an attacker, set up a simple HTTP server using Python's `http.server` or `netcat` on a publicly accessible IP address or use a service like `ngrok` to expose a local server. Configure the server to log all incoming requests and return a simple JSON response (e.g., `{"choices": [{"message": {"content": "Malicious Response"}}]} `) mimicking a chat completion response.
    2. **Prepare Malicious URL:** Obtain the URL of your attacker server (e.g., `http://attacker-server-ip:port/v1/chat/completions`).
    3. **Victim Configuration:** As a victim user:
        - Open VS Code with the AI Toolkit extension installed.
        - Open VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings).
        - Search for "AI Toolkit Remote Inference Endpoints" or navigate to the AI Toolkit extension settings.
        - Click "Add Item" to add a new remote inference endpoint.
        - Enter a "Model Name" (e.g., "MaliciousModel").
        - In the "Endpoint URL" field, paste the malicious URL obtained in step 2 (e.g., `http://attacker-server-ip:port/v1/chat/completions`).
        - Leave "Authentication Header" empty or provide a dummy value.
        - Save the settings.
    4. **Exploit in Playground:**
        - Open the AI Toolkit Playground.
        - In the "Model" dropdown, select the newly added "MaliciousModel".
        - Enter a prompt in the chat input (e.g., "Hello").
        - Send the prompt.
    5. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check the logs of your attacker-controlled HTTP server. Verify that the server received an HTTP POST request to `/v1/chat/completions` containing the user's prompt.
        - Observe the response in the AI Toolkit Playground. It should display "Malicious Response" (or the custom response you configured on the attacker server).
    6. **Impact Confirmation:** This test confirms that the extension is sending requests to the attacker-specified endpoint, demonstrating the Remote Inference Endpoint Injection vulnerability. An attacker can now intercept prompts and inject malicious responses.
