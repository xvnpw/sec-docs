### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Local REST API Path Traversal
* Description: The AI Toolkit exposes a local REST API on port 5272, as documented in `/code/archive/README.md`. This API might be vulnerable to path traversal if it improperly handles user-provided file paths when processing requests, potentially allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directories on the user's machine. An attacker could craft a malicious request to the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with a payload that includes a path traversal sequence (e.g., `../`) in a filename or path parameter, if such parameters are used by the API to access local files.
* Impact: High. An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the user's local file system that the VS Code extension process has access to. This could include configuration files, source code, or personal documents.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None mentioned in the provided documentation.
* Missing Mitigations: Input validation and sanitization for all file path parameters used by the local REST API. Implementation of proper access controls to restrict file access to only necessary resources.
* Preconditions:
    * The AI Toolkit VS Code extension is installed and activated.
    * The local REST API server is running (it's unclear from the documentation if it runs by default or needs to be explicitly started, assuming it runs when the extension is active or when a model is loaded in playground).
    * Attacker has network access to the user's machine on port 5272 (in practice, this is localhost, so attacker needs to run code on the user's machine, which is a weaker precondition for a VS Code extension context).
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided files do not contain the source code of the REST API.
    * Based on the documentation, the API uses the OpenAI chat completions format.
    * If the API implementation uses user-provided input to construct file paths without proper validation, it could be vulnerable to path traversal.
    * For example, if the API were to load model files or datasets based on parameters in the request body, and these parameters are not sanitized, a path traversal vulnerability could occur.
    * Visualization (Conceptual):
    ```
    Attacker -> HTTP Request (with path traversal in payload) -> REST API Handler -> File System Access (vulnerable if path not sanitized) -> Sensitive File Read -> Attacker
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Install and activate the AI Toolkit extension in VS Code.
    2. Start the local REST API server if it's not automatically started when the extension is active (check extension documentation or behavior).
    3. Use `curl` or Postman to send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:5272/v1/chat/completions`.
    4. Craft a JSON request body that attempts to exploit a potential path traversal vulnerability. For example, if a `model` parameter is used to load model files, try using a path like `"../sensitive_file"` as the model name.
    5. Example malicious request body:
    ```json
    {
        "model": "../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "test"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    6. Send the request: `curl -vX POST http://127.0.0.1:5272/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @malicious_request.json`
    7. Analyze the response. If the API returns the content of `/etc/passwd` (or any other sensitive file based on OS and access rights), or an error message indicating file access outside of the expected directory, then the vulnerability is confirmed. Note: the exact file path to test will depend on the OS and where the extension is expected to access files. For Windows, try paths like `C:\Windows\win.ini`.

* Vulnerability Name: Playground Attachment Arbitrary File Read
* Description: The Playground feature of the AI Toolkit allows users to attach files when interacting with multi-modal models, as described in `/code/doc/playground.md`. If the extension processes these attachments without proper validation of the file path provided by the user when selecting the attachment, an attacker could potentially use path traversal techniques to select and upload files from outside the intended workspace directory. While the user initiates the file selection, the extension's handling of the selected path might be vulnerable if it doesn't enforce workspace boundaries for attachment operations.
* Impact: High. An attacker could, by carefully crafting a playground interaction, potentially exfiltrate local files from the user's system by attaching them to a model interaction and then somehow retrieving the attached content (the retrieval mechanism needs further investigation in the actual implementation, but the file read itself is the core vulnerability here).
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None mentioned in the provided documentation.
* Missing Mitigations: Workspace boundary enforcement when handling file attachments in the Playground. Validation and sanitization of file paths to prevent path traversal during file selection and attachment processing.
* Preconditions:
    * The AI Toolkit VS Code extension is installed and activated.
    * A multi-modal model with attachment support is loaded in the Playground.
    * The attacker has access to the VS Code instance and can interact with the Playground.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided files do not contain the source code for the Playground attachment feature.
    * If the file attachment functionality relies on VS Code's file dialog for user selection, but then directly uses the provided file path without checking if it's within the allowed workspace or intended directories, it could be vulnerable.
    * The vulnerability lies in the assumption that user-selected files are always safe and within allowed boundaries, without explicit checks by the extension.
    * Visualization (Conceptual):
    ```
    Attacker (via Playground UI) -> Select File Attachment (with potential path traversal in file path) -> Extension File Attachment Handler -> File System Read (vulnerable if path not validated) -> File Content potentially exfiltrated -> Attacker
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Install and activate the AI Toolkit extension in VS Code.
    2. Load a multi-modal model in the Playground that supports attachments.
    3. In the Playground chat interface, attempt to attach a file using path traversal to navigate outside the current workspace. For example, try to attach a file by manually typing or pasting a path like `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` into the file selection dialog, or by starting in the workspace and navigating upwards using ".." if allowed by the file selector.
    4. If the extension allows selecting files outside of the workspace, and proceeds to attach and process the file, this is the first step of the vulnerability.
    5. After attaching the file (if successful in step 4), interact with the model in a way that would trigger the extension to process the attachment. Observe if there is any indication that the file content is being processed or sent to the model (network traffic analysis or extension logs might be needed if direct output is not visible).
    6. Further investigation is needed to determine how the attached file content can be retrieved by the attacker. This might involve intercepting API calls, analyzing extension behavior, or other reverse engineering techniques depending on the actual implementation. The initial vulnerability is the ability to attach and potentially process files from arbitrary locations due to lack of path validation.

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure Deserialization in Custom Evaluator (Potential)
* Description: Version 0.10.0 of the AI Toolkit introduces "Custom Evaluator" feature, as mentioned in `/code/WHATS_NEW.md`, which allows users to define custom evaluation logic using Python code or LLM prompts. If the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature deserializes untrusted data (e.g., from a file or network) without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to insecure deserialization attacks. An attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized by the extension, could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
* Impact: Critical. Remote Code Execution. Successful exploitation could allow a complete compromise of the user's machine.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None mentioned in the provided documentation.
* Missing Mitigations: Secure deserialization practices should be implemented for the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature. Input validation and sanitization of any data being deserialized. Consider using safer alternatives to pickle or similar deserialization libraries if they are used. If possible, isolate the execution environment of custom evaluators.
* Preconditions:
    * AI Toolkit VS Code extension version 0.10.0 or later is installed and activated.
    * The user uses the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature.
    * The attacker can provide malicious Python code or data that is processed by the custom evaluator feature, potentially through a crafted project, dataset, or prompt configuration.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided files do not contain the source code for the "Custom evaluator" feature.
    * If the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature uses Python's `pickle` or similar libraries to deserialize data from files or external sources without proper security measures, it could be vulnerable to insecure deserialization.
    * An attacker could create a malicious Python object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
    * Visualization (Conceptual):
    ```
    Attacker -> Malicious Python Code/Data (e.g., crafted evaluator definition or dataset) -> AI Toolkit "Custom Evaluator" Feature -> Insecure Deserialization (e.g., via pickle.load) -> Arbitrary Code Execution on User's Machine -> Attacker Control
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Install and activate AI Toolkit VS Code extension version 0.10.0 or later.
    2. Create a project that utilizes the "Custom evaluator from Python codes" feature.
    3. Craft a malicious Python script for the custom evaluator that contains code to be executed upon deserialization. This often involves using the `__reduce__` method or similar techniques in Python to inject code during deserialization.
    4. Configure the AI Toolkit to use this malicious Python script as a custom evaluator.
    5. Trigger the evaluation process within the AI Toolkit.
    6. Monitor for arbitrary code execution. For example, the malicious script could attempt to create a file, open a network connection, or execute a system command to confirm code execution.
    7. If the malicious code executes successfully during the evaluation process, the insecure deserialization vulnerability is confirmed.

* Vulnerability Name: Remote Model Endpoint SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
* Description: The AI Toolkit allows users to add remote models by specifying an OpenAI compatible chat completion endpoint URL, as described in `/code/doc/playground.md` and `/code/archive/playground-remote-inference.md`. If the extension does not properly validate and sanitize the provided URL, or if it makes server-side requests based on this user-provided URL without sufficient protection, it could be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). An attacker could provide a malicious URL that, when processed by the extension, causes the extension's backend to make requests to internal or external resources that the attacker would not normally be able to access.
* Impact: High. An attacker could potentially use the extension as a proxy to scan internal networks, access internal services, or exfiltrate sensitive information from internal resources if the extension backend is running in an environment with access to such resources.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations: None mentioned in the provided documentation.
* Missing Mitigations: Strict validation and sanitization of user-provided remote model endpoint URLs. Implement a denylist of disallowed URLs (e.g., private IP ranges, localhost, etc.). Consider using a dedicated HTTP client library with SSRF protection features. If possible, restrict the network access of the extension's backend process.
* Preconditions:
    * AI Toolkit VS Code extension version 0.4.0 or later is installed and activated.
    * The user uses the "Add model for remote inference" feature and provides a URL.
    * The extension's backend process makes HTTP requests based on the provided URL.
* Source Code Analysis:
    * The provided files do not contain the source code for remote model integration.
    * If the extension directly uses the user-provided URL to make HTTP requests without validation, it could be vulnerable to SSRF.
    * An attacker could provide URLs pointing to internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, or other sensitive resources.
    * Visualization (Conceptual):
    ```
    Attacker (via VS Code UI) -> Provide Malicious Remote Model URL -> AI Toolkit Backend -> HTTP Request to Malicious URL (potentially internal resource) -> SSRF -> Attacker gains access or information
    ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. Install and activate AI Toolkit VS Code extension version 0.4.0 or later.
    2. Use the "Add model for remote inference" feature.
    3. In the endpoint URL field, provide a URL that points to a resource that should not be accessible from the extension's backend if SSRF protection is in place. Examples:
        * `http://localhost:<some_internal_service_port>` (to test access to local services on the user's machine, though less relevant for extension context)
        * `http://169.254.169.254/metadata` (AWS/Azure/GCP metadata endpoint - if the VS Code or extension backend runs in a cloud environment, this is a more relevant test)
        * A URL to an internal network resource if the test environment simulates an internal network.
    4. Add the remote model with the malicious URL.
    5. Attempt to use the remote model in the Playground.
    6. Observe the behavior. If the extension successfully connects to and retrieves data from the provided URL (especially if it's an internal or restricted resource), it indicates a potential SSRF vulnerability. Network traffic analysis may be needed to confirm the requests made by the extension. For example, if you use `http://169.254.169.254/metadata`, and the extension returns metadata information, SSRF is confirmed. If it's `http://localhost:<port_of_internal_service>`, and you get a response from that service, SSRF is also confirmed.
