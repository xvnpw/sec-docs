### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Unauthenticated Local REST API Access
- Description:
    1. The AI Toolkit VSCode extension starts a local REST API web server on port 5272.
    2. This API is intended to allow local applications to interact with AI models managed by the extension.
    3. The API endpoint `/v1/chat/completions` is used for chat completion requests, as documented in the README.
    4. An attacker on the same machine can send POST requests to this API endpoint without any authentication.
    5. The API processes these requests and interacts with the AI models as configured in the extension.
- Impact:
    - An attacker with local access to the user's machine can bypass the VSCode extension's UI and directly interact with the AI models.
    - This unauthorized access allows the attacker to generate text, potentially using models downloaded or configured within the AI Toolkit.
    - The attacker could exfiltrate model outputs or use the models for unintended or malicious purposes within the local environment.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The documentation mentions a placeholder `api_key="x"` but states it is "not used", indicating no effective authentication is implemented for the local REST API.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for the local REST API.
    - Restrict API access to only accept requests from localhost (127.0.0.1) to prevent network exposure.
    - Consider using API keys or tokens for authentication to verify legitimate requests.
- Preconditions:
    - AI Toolkit VSCode extension is installed and active.
    - A model is loaded in the AI Toolkit or the playground feature is in use, which implicitly starts the local REST API.
    - The attacker has local access to the machine where the VSCode extension is running.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on documentation (`/code/archive/README.md`), the extension starts a REST API server on port 5272.
    - The documentation explicitly shows how to use `curl` to send requests to `/v1/chat/completions` without any authentication headers (except for `Content-Type`).
    - The Python example code in `/code/archive/README.md` to use the OpenAI client library sets `api_key="x"` but comments `# required for the API but not used`, confirming that API key authentication is not enforced.
    - The lack of any mention of authentication in the documentation and the example curl command strongly suggests that the local REST API is indeed unauthenticated.
    - Without access to the source code, it's inferred that the API endpoint handler in the extension's backend does not perform authentication checks before processing requests.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Install the "AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code" extension in VSCode.
    2. Open VSCode and load any AI model using the AI Toolkit extension (e.g., through the Model Catalog or by loading into Playground). This action should start the local REST API server.
    3. Open a terminal or command prompt on the same machine where VSCode is running.
    4. Execute the following `curl` command to send a chat completion request to the local API without any authentication:
        ```bash
        curl -vX POST http://127.0.0.1:5272/v1/chat/completions \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
            "model": "Phi-3-mini-4k-directml-int4-awq-block-128-onnx",
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "What is the capital of France?"
                }
            ],
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "max_tokens": 50
        }'
        ```
        **Note:** Replace `"Phi-3-mini-4k-directml-int4-awq-block-128-onnx"` with the name of a model that is actually loaded in your AI Toolkit if needed.
    5. Observe the output from the `curl` command.
    6. Expected Result: If the API is vulnerable, the `curl` command will successfully return a response from the AI model (e.g., "Paris"). This indicates that the unauthenticated request was processed successfully by the local REST API.
    7. If the API requires authentication, the `curl` command should return an error indicating unauthorized access (e.g., HTTP 401 or 403 status code).
