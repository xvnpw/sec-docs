## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Issue Label Rendering (CVE-2023-36867)
  - Description:
    1. An attacker could craft a malicious issue label containing JavaScript code.
    2. When this label is rendered in the VS Code extension, the JavaScript code could be executed due to improper sanitization of label content.
    3. This vulnerability can be triggered by an external attacker by creating a malicious label in a public GitHub repository or a repository where the attacker has the ability to create labels and then somehow trick a victim to view this label within the VS Code extension.
  - Impact:
    - High: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the VS Code extension. This could potentially lead to:
      - Stealing user credentials or tokens managed by the extension.
      - Accessing local files or system information accessible to the extension.
      - Performing actions on behalf of the user through the extension's authenticated session.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - In version 0.66.2, the project implemented a fix by using `supportHtml: true` for markdown rendering of issue labels. This is mentioned in `CHANGELOG.md`: "Use `supportHtml` for markdown that just cares about coloring spans for showing issue labels. [CVE-2023-36867](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36867)".
    - This suggests that previously `supportHtml: false` might not have been used when rendering issue labels, leading to the vulnerability. By setting `supportHtml: true` and ensuring proper escaping of user-provided label content when constructing the markdown string, the vulnerability should be mitigated.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - It's crucial to verify that all instances of issue label rendering in the code now correctly use `supportHtml: true` and properly escape user-provided label content to prevent HTML injection. Further source code analysis is needed to confirm complete mitigation.
  - Preconditions:
    - The victim must use the VS Code extension "vscode-pull-request-github".
    - The victim must view an issue or pull request within the extension where a malicious label is present.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on the provided PROJECT FILES, there is no direct code related to rendering issue labels within webviews. The files mainly focus on backend logic, data structures, and utilities.
    - To confirm the mitigation, it's necessary to examine the codebase beyond these provided files, specifically looking for the code responsible for rendering issue labels in the extension's UI components, especially webviews.
    - We need to search for code sections that process issue labels and use `vscode.MarkdownString` to render them.
    - Verify if the fix in version 0.66.2, which involves using `supportHtml: true`, is applied to all relevant label rendering locations.
    - Confirm that user-provided label content is properly escaped before being used in `vscode.MarkdownString` constructor, even with `supportHtml: true`.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a public GitHub repository.
    2. In the repository, create an issue with a label.
    3. Edit the label and set its name to contain malicious JavaScript code, for example: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')">`.
    4. Open the repository in VS Code and use the "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" extension (version >= 0.66.2).
    5. Navigate to the "Issues" view and locate the issue with the malicious label.
    6. Inspect the rendered issue label in the VS Code extension.
    7. Verify if the JavaScript code from the label is executed (e.g., an alert box appears).
    8. If the JavaScript code is executed, the vulnerability might still be present or not fully mitigated. If the code is rendered as text, the vulnerability is likely mitigated. If the code is rendered as an image tag but without executing JavaScript (no alert), then `supportHtml: true` is likely enabled, but escaping might be missing or insufficient. In this last case, further investigation of the escaping mechanism is needed.
