### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential XSS vulnerability in issue label rendering (CVE-2023-36867)
- Description: The extension might be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to improper handling of HTML in issue labels. If issue labels are rendered using `supportMarkdown` without proper sanitization, a malicious attacker could inject JavaScript code within a label. When a user views this label in the VS Code extension, the injected script could be executed, potentially compromising the user's VS Code environment or data.
- Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the VS Code extension. This could lead to stealing user credentials, accessing local files, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Mitigated in version 0.66.2 by using `supportHtml` for rendering issue labels. This change aims to sanitize HTML content within labels, preventing the execution of malicious scripts.
- Missing Mitigations: While `supportHtml` is used, it's crucial to verify the thoroughness of the HTML sanitization. Further code review is recommended to ensure that all instances of issue label rendering and potentially untrusted markdown content within the extension (especially in webviews and UI components) are correctly using `supportHtml` and that the sanitization is robust enough to prevent all XSS vectors. It should also be verified if older versions before 0.66.2 are still vulnerable.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must be viewing issues or pull requests in the VS Code extension where issue labels are rendered.
    - A threat actor must be able to create or modify an issue or pull request label to include malicious HTML content.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File:** `/code/CHANGELOG.md`
    - **Content:** The changelog entry for version 0.66.2 indicates a fix for CVE-2023-36867 by switching to `supportHtml`.
    - To confirm mitigation, codebase should be checked to verify all instances of issue label rendering are using `supportHtml: true` and that the underlying sanitization library (if any) is properly configured and up-to-date.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a GitHub repository and enable issues.
    2. As an attacker, create a new issue label with a malicious name containing HTML or JavaScript code, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    3. Apply this malicious label to a test issue in the repository.
    4. As a victim, use a VS Code extension version prior to 0.66.2 and connect to the GitHub repository. Navigate to the "Issues" view and locate the issue with the malicious label. Observe if the XSS is present.
    5. As a victim, update the VS Code extension to version 0.66.2 or later and repeat step 4. Observe if the malicious JavaScript code is executed. If the alert dialog does not appear and the label is rendered without executing the script, it suggests mitigation in newer versions.

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Temporary File Storage for Media Files
- Description: The extension is potentially vulnerable to path traversal when creating temporary storage for media files during pull request review. The `asTempStorageURI` function in `/code/src/common/uri.ts` takes a file path from the URI query parameters and uses it to construct a temporary file path without sufficient sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious URI with a path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`) to write media files to arbitrary locations within the user's global storage, potentially overwriting or creating files outside the intended temporary directory.
- Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations within the user's global storage when a user attempts to view a media file in a pull request diff. This could lead to:
    - Overwriting existing files in the user's global storage, potentially causing data loss or corruption.
    - Creating new files in unexpected locations, which, in combination with other vulnerabilities, could be used for further attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No explicit mitigations are evident in the provided code snippet for `asTempStorageURI` or `TemporaryState.write` to prevent path traversal. The usage of `pathUtils.join` and `vscode.Uri.joinPath` might offer some implicit protection but is not guaranteed to be sufficient against directory traversal attacks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust sanitization of the `path` parameter from `uri.query` in `asTempStorageURI` to remove or neutralize directory traversal sequences before path manipulation.
    - **Path Validation:** After constructing the temporary file path, validate that the resulting path remains within the intended temporary storage directory. Implement a check to ensure the temporary file path is a subdirectory of the designated temporary storage root.
    - Consider using secure temporary file handling libraries that inherently prevent path traversal issues.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must be viewing a pull request diff in VS Code using the extension.
    - The pull request diff must include a media file (image or video) change.
    - A threat actor must be able to craft or modify a pull request URI to include a malicious `path` query parameter with directory traversal sequences.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **File:** `/code/src/common/uri.ts`
    - **Function:** `asTempStorageURI`
    - **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
      ```typescript
      export async function asTempStorageURI(uri: vscode.Uri, repository: Repository): Promise<vscode.Uri | undefined> {
          try {
              const { commit, baseCommit, headCommit, isBase, path }: { commit: string, baseCommit: string, headCommit: string, isBase: string, path: string } = JSON.parse(uri.query);
              // ...
              const absolutePath = pathUtils.join(repository.rootUri.fsPath, path).replace(/\\/g, '/');
              // ...
              return TemporaryState.write(pathUtils.dirname(path), pathUtils.basename(path), contents);
          } catch (err) {
              return;
          }
      }
      ```
    - **Vulnerability Flow:**
        1. `asTempStorageURI` extracts the `path` from the URI query.
        2. `pathUtils.join` combines `repository.rootUri.fsPath` and the attacker-controlled `path`, potentially resolving traversal sequences.
        3. `TemporaryState.write` uses parts of the potentially manipulated `path` to write a file, which could lead to writing outside the intended temporary directory if `path` contained traversal sequences.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a GitHub repository and add an image file.
    2. As an attacker, create a malicious pull request review URI for the image file, crafting the `path` query parameter to include directory traversal sequences, for example: `../../../malicious.png`.
    3. Send this malicious URI to a victim user and induce them to open it in VS Code.
    4. As a victim, open the malicious URI in VS Code, triggering the extension to call `asTempStorageURI`.
    5. After opening the URI and allowing the extension to process it, check the file system under the user's global storage.
    6. Verify if a file named `malicious.png` (or similar based on the crafted path) is created in an unexpected location, outside the intended temporary storage, indicating successful path traversal. For example, check for file creation at `context.globalStorageUri/temp/../../../malicious.png` or even higher directory levels.
