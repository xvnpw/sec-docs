## Merged Vulnerability List

### Potential Command Injection in URI Handler
- Description: The VSCode extension registers a URI handler (`uriHandler` in `/code/src/extension.ts`) to handle custom URIs, specifically for the `github-pullrequests` scheme. If the URI handler does not properly sanitize or validate the input parameters, an attacker might be able to craft a malicious URI that could lead to command injection or other unintended actions within the VSCode environment. This vulnerability could be triggered by an external attacker if they can convince a user to click on a specially crafted link.
- Impact: If successfully exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the user's VSCode environment, potentially leading to information disclosure, modification of files, or further compromise of the user's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: There are no explicit mitigations implemented in the provided code to prevent command injection in the URI handler. The code needs to be reviewed to ensure proper sanitization and validation of URI parameters within `uriHandler` and related functions in `/code/src/common/uri.ts`.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation for URI parameters in `uriHandler` and related URI parsing functions. Security review of URI handling logic to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions: User needs to click on a malicious link crafted by the attacker.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/extension.ts`
    ```typescript
    context.subscriptions.push(vscode.window.registerUriHandler(uriHandler));
    ```
  - File: `/code/src/common/uri.ts`
    The code in `uri.ts` defines various URI schemes and functions to parse and create URIs. A detailed review of these functions, especially `fromPRUri`, `fromReviewUri`, `fromFileChangeNodeUri`, `fromIssueUri`, `toPRUri`, `toReviewUri`, `toResourceUri`, and `toNewIssueUri`, is necessary to identify potential injection points. Look for usage of `eval()`, `Function()`, `child_process.exec()`, or similar functions that could execute strings as code based on URI parameters. Also, check for path traversal vulnerabilities if file paths are constructed from URI inputs without proper validation. The `JSON.parse` is used in multiple `from...Uri` functions and is a potential vulnerability point if the input URI query is not properly validated before parsing.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Craft a malicious URI for the `github-pullrequests` scheme that includes a potentially harmful command as a parameter. For example, if the URI handler uses a parameter to construct a file path, try to inject `..` to traverse directories or inject shell commands.
  2. Send this malicious URI to a victim user (e.g., via email, chat, or website).
  3. If the vulnerability exists, clicking on the link should trigger the injected command within the victim's VSCode environment.
  4. Observe if any unintended actions are performed in VSCode, such as file access, command execution, or unexpected behavior in the extension.
  5. For example, if a command like `pr.openFile` is vulnerable, a test URI could be: `vscode://vscode-pull-request-github/pr.openFile?file=malicious;touch%20/tmp/vuln.txt`
  6. Check if file `/tmp/vuln.txt` was created, which would indicate command injection.

### Potential Vulnerabilities in Command Handling (e.g., File/URL manipulation)
- Description: The extension defines and registers many commands in `/code/src/commands.ts`. Some of these commands handle file paths, URLs, or user inputs, such as `pr.openFileOnGitHub`, `pr.openOriginalFile`, `pr.openModifiedFile`, `pr.openDiffView`, `pr.create`, `pr.pickOnVscodeDev`, `pr.merge`, `pr.applySuggestion`, `review.openFile`, `review.openLocalFile`, `review.createSuggestionsFromChanges`, `review.createSuggestionFromChange`, `pr.checkoutByNumber`. If these commands do not properly validate or sanitize their inputs, attackers might be able to exploit them to perform actions outside of the intended scope, such as accessing arbitrary files or URLs, or triggering unintended operations.
- Impact: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized file access, opening malicious URLs, or other unintended side effects based on the specific command vulnerability.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No specific mitigations are apparent in the command handling code. A thorough code review is needed to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in each command handler.
- Missing Mitigations: Input validation and sanitization for file paths, URLs, and user-provided arguments in command handlers. Security review of command logic to prevent unintended actions.
- Preconditions: User needs to trigger a vulnerable command with malicious input, which can be achieved via crafted links, specific user interactions in the VSCode UI, or by manipulating the extension's settings or workspace files if these are used as command inputs.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/commands.ts`
    Analyze each command handler function in this file, paying close attention to how file paths, URLs, and user inputs are processed.
  - For example, in `pr.openFileOnGitHub`, check if the `e.changeModel.blobUrl` is properly validated before being used to open a URL. In file-related commands like `pr.openOriginalFile` and `pr.openModifiedFile`, check how file paths are handled and if there's a possibility of path traversal or arbitrary file access.
  - Visualize the data flow in each command handler to understand how external inputs are used and where vulnerabilities might be introduced.
- Security Test Case:
  1. For each command that handles file paths or URLs, craft malicious inputs that attempt to exploit path traversal or URL injection vulnerabilities.
  2. For example, for `pr.openFileOnGitHub`, try to pass a `blobUrl` that points to an external malicious website or a local file outside of the workspace.
  3. For file-related commands, try to pass file paths that include `..` to traverse directories outside the workspace.
  4. Observe if the extension performs any unintended actions, such as opening unexpected files or URLs, accessing files outside the workspace, or exhibiting other unusual behavior.
  5. For `pr.checkoutByNumber`, try to provide a negative number or a very large number, or non-numeric input, to see if the command handles invalid inputs correctly.

### Path Traversal in Temporary File Storage
- Description: The extension is potentially vulnerable to path traversal when creating temporary storage for media files during pull request review and in general temporary file operations. The `TemporaryState` class in `/code/src/common/temporaryState.ts` writes temporary files to the global storage URI. The `writeState` method constructs file paths by joining `this.path`, `workspace` name, `subpath`, and `filename`. The `asTempStorageURI` function in `/code/src/common/uri.ts` takes a file path from the URI query parameters and uses it to construct a temporary file path. If `subpath` or `filename` in `TemporaryState.write` or the `path` parameter in `asTempStorageURI` are derived from user-controlled input (e.g., URI parameters) and not properly validated, an attacker could potentially achieve path traversal and write files outside the intended temporary directory. This vulnerability could be triggered if a function using `TemporaryState.write` or `asTempStorageURI` receives malicious input for `subpath`, `filename` or `path` from an external source, such as URI parameters.
- Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations within the user's file system, potentially overwriting sensitive files, creating malicious files in startup directories, or achieving code execution by writing to configuration files. When exploited via media files during PR review, it could lead to overwriting existing files in the user's global storage, potentially causing data loss or corruption, or creating new files in unexpected locations for further attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: The code in `TemporaryState.ts` includes workspace name in the file path, which might offer some level of isolation between workspaces, but it does not sanitize `subpath` or `filename`. There are no explicit sanitizations or validations in `writeState` method to prevent path traversal. No explicit mitigations are evident in the provided code snippet for `asTempStorageURI` or `TemporaryState.write` to prevent path traversal. The usage of `pathUtils.join` and `vscode.Uri.joinPath` might offer some implicit protection but is not guaranteed to be sufficient against directory traversal attacks.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and validation for `subpath` and `filename` parameters in `TemporaryState.write` method and for `path` parameter in `asTempStorageURI`. Implement path validation to ensure that the final file path remains within the intended temporary storage directory. Consider using secure temporary file handling libraries that inherently prevent path traversal issues.
- Preconditions: A function in the extension must use `TemporaryState.write` or `asTempStorageURI` and pass user-controlled input as `subpath`, `filename` or `path` without proper validation. An attacker needs to control this user input, possibly through a crafted URI. For media files vulnerability, the user must be viewing a pull request diff in VS Code using the extension, the pull request diff must include a media file (image or video) change, and a threat actor must be able to craft or modify a pull request URI to include a malicious `path` query parameter with directory traversal sequences.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - File: `/code/src/common/temporaryState.ts`
    ```typescript
    private async writeState(subpath: string, filename: string, contents: Uint8Array, persistInSession: boolean): Promise<vscode.Uri> {
        let filePath: vscode.Uri = this.path;
        const workspace = (vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders && vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders.length > 0)
            ? vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].name : undefined;

        if (workspace) {
            filePath = vscode.Uri.joinPath(filePath, workspace);
        }

        if (subpath) {
            filePath = vscode.Uri.joinPath(filePath, subpath);
        }
        await vscode.workspace.fs.createDirectory(filePath);
        const file = vscode.Uri.joinPath(filePath, filename);
        await vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile(file, contents);
        ...
    }
    ```
    The `writeState` method uses `vscode.Uri.joinPath` to construct file paths. While `joinPath` itself does not prevent path traversal, the vulnerability arises if `subpath` or `filename` arguments to `writeState` are not validated and are derived from user-controlled input. An attacker could craft a malicious `subpath` like `../../../../` or a `filename` like `../../../../.bashrc` to traverse directories and potentially overwrite files outside the intended temporary storage.
  - File: `/code/src/common/uri.ts`
  - Function: `asTempStorageURI`
  - Vulnerable Code Snippet:
    ```typescript
    export async function asTempStorageURI(uri: vscode.Uri, repository: Repository): Promise<vscode.Uri | undefined> {
        try {
            const { commit, baseCommit, headCommit, isBase, path }: { commit: string, baseCommit: string, headCommit: string, isBase: string, path: string } = JSON.parse(uri.query);
            // ...
            const absolutePath = pathUtils.join(repository.rootUri.fsPath, path).replace(/\\/g, '/');
            // ...
            return TemporaryState.write(pathUtils.dirname(path), pathUtils.basename(path), contents);
        } catch (err) {
            return;
        }
    }
    ```
    `asTempStorageURI` extracts the `path` from the URI query. `pathUtils.join` combines `repository.rootUri.fsPath` and the attacker-controlled `path`, potentially resolving traversal sequences. `TemporaryState.write` uses parts of the potentially manipulated `path` to write a file, which could lead to writing outside the intended temporary directory if `path` contained traversal sequences.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Identify a code path in the extension where `TemporaryState.write` or `asTempStorageURI` is called and where the `subpath`, `filename` or `path` arguments can be influenced by user input (e.g., from URI parameters).
  2. Craft a malicious URI that, when processed by the extension and leads to a call to `TemporaryState.write` or `asTempStorageURI`, includes a path traversal sequence in the `subpath`, `filename` or `path`. For example, if URI parameter `filePath` is used as `subpath`, create a URI with `filePath=../../../../tmp` and `filename=evil.txt`. For `asTempStorageURI`, craft the `path` query parameter to include directory traversal sequences, for example: `../../../malicious.png`.
  3. Trigger the code path by clicking on the crafted malicious URI. For media files vulnerability, create a malicious pull request review URI for the image file. Send this malicious URI to a victim user and induce them to open it in VS Code.
  4. After triggering the URI, check if a file `evil.txt` is created in `/tmp` directory (or another directory outside the intended temporary storage) or check the file system under the user's global storage for file `malicious.png` in unexpected location.
  5. If the file is created in an unintended location, it indicates a path traversal vulnerability. For instance, using `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile(vscode.Uri.file('/tmp/evil.txt'))` to verify file creation. For media files, verify if a file named `malicious.png` (or similar based on the crafted path) is created in an unexpected location, outside the intended temporary storage, for example at `context.globalStorageUri/temp/../../../malicious.png` or even higher directory levels.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Issue Label Rendering (CVE-2023-36867)
- Description:
  1. An attacker could craft a malicious issue label containing JavaScript code.
  2. When this label is rendered in the VS Code extension, the JavaScript code could be executed due to improper sanitization of label content.
  3. This vulnerability can be triggered by an external attacker by creating a malicious label in a public GitHub repository or a repository where the attacker has the ability to create labels and then somehow trick a victim to view this label within the VS Code extension.
- Impact:
  - High: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the VS Code extension. This could potentially lead to:
    - Stealing user credentials or tokens managed by the extension.
    - Accessing local files or system information accessible to the extension.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user through the extension's authenticated session.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - In version 0.66.2, the project implemented a fix by using `supportHtml: true` for markdown rendering of issue labels. This is mentioned in `CHANGELOG.md`: "Use `supportHtml` for markdown that just cares about coloring spans for showing issue labels. [CVE-2023-36867](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36867)".
  - This suggests that previously `supportHtml: false` might not have been used when rendering issue labels, leading to the vulnerability. By setting `supportHtml: true` and ensuring proper escaping of user-provided label content when constructing the markdown string, the vulnerability should be mitigated.
- Missing Mitigations:
  - It's crucial to verify that all instances of issue label rendering in the code now correctly use `supportHtml: true` and properly escape user-provided label content to prevent HTML injection. Further source code analysis is needed to confirm complete mitigation. Verify that older versions before 0.66.2 are indeed vulnerable.
- Preconditions:
  - The victim must use the VS Code extension "vscode-pull-request-github".
  - The victim must view an issue or pull request within the extension where a malicious label is present.
- Source Code Analysis:
  - Based on the provided PROJECT FILES, there is no direct code related to rendering issue labels within webviews. The files mainly focus on backend logic, data structures, and utilities.
  - To confirm the mitigation, it's necessary to examine the codebase beyond these provided files, specifically looking for the code responsible for rendering issue labels in the extension's UI components, especially webviews.
  - We need to search for code sections that process issue labels and use `vscode.MarkdownString` to render them.
  - Verify if the fix in version 0.66.2, which involves using `supportHtml: true`, is applied to all relevant label rendering locations.
  - Confirm that user-provided label content is properly escaped before being used in `vscode.MarkdownString` constructor, even with `supportHtml: true`.
  - **File:** `/code/CHANGELOG.md`
  - **Content:** The changelog entry for version 0.66.2 indicates a fix for CVE-2023-36867 by switching to `supportHtml`. To confirm mitigation, codebase should be checked to verify all instances of issue label rendering are using `supportHtml: true` and that the underlying sanitization library (if any) is properly configured and up-to-date.
- Security Test Case:
  1. Create a public GitHub repository.
  2. In the repository, create an issue with a label.
  3. Edit the label and set its name to contain malicious JavaScript code, for example: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')">`.
  4. Apply this malicious label to a test issue in the repository.
  5. As a victim, use a VS Code extension version prior to 0.66.2 and connect to the GitHub repository. Navigate to the "Issues" view and locate the issue with the malicious label. Observe if the XSS is present.
  6. As a victim, update the VS Code extension to version 0.66.2 or later and repeat step 5. Observe if the malicious JavaScript code is executed. If the alert dialog does not appear and the label is rendered without executing the script, it suggests mitigation in newer versions.
  7. Inspect the rendered issue label in the VS Code extension. Verify if the JavaScript code from the label is executed (e.g., an alert box appears). If the JavaScript code is executed, the vulnerability might still be present or not fully mitigated. If the code is rendered as text, the vulnerability is likely mitigated. If the code is rendered as an image tag but without executing JavaScript (no alert), then `supportHtml: true` is likely enabled, but escaping might be missing or insufficient and further investigation of the escaping mechanism is needed.
