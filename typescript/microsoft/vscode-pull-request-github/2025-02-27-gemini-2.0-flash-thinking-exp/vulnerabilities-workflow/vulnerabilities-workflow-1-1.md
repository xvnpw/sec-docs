### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG files

- Description:
An attacker could craft a malicious SVG file that contains embedded JavaScript code. Because the project uses `svg-inline-loader` to process SVG files during the build process, this malicious SVG could be included in the extension package. When VS Code renders a view that includes this SVG (e.g., PR description, issue hover), the embedded JavaScript code could be executed, leading to XSS.

Steps to trigger vulnerability:
1. An attacker creates a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code, for example:
   ```xml
   <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
     <script>alert("XSS");</script>
   </svg>
   ```
2. The attacker submits a pull request to the `vscode-pull-request-github` repository and includes this malicious SVG file in the PR, for example as a new icon or part of documentation under `/code/resources/icons/malicious.svg`.
3. If the pull request is merged, the malicious SVG file will be processed by `svg-inline-loader` during the extension build process.
4. When a user installs the extension and opens a view that renders content from the extension (e.g., opens a PR description that somehow includes or references the malicious SVG, or if the malicious SVG is used as an icon in the UI and rendered), the JavaScript code embedded in the SVG will be executed in the context of the VS Code extension's webview.

- Impact:
Successful XSS attack can allow the attacker to:
    - Steal sensitive information, such as user tokens or session cookies, related to the VS Code extension.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user within the VS Code environment, potentially including actions with GitHub API if the extension has such permissions.
    - Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    - Modify the content and behavior of the VS Code extension's webviews.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
None. The project uses `svg-inline-loader` without any sanitization or security considerations for SVG files.

- Missing mitigations:
- Sanitize SVG files during the build process to remove any potentially malicious JavaScript code. This could be done by using a dedicated SVG sanitization library.
- Review all usages of SVG files within the extension's webviews and ensure that they are loaded and rendered securely, avoiding dynamic injection of SVG content if possible.
- Consider replacing `svg-inline-loader` with a more secure method for handling SVG files, or configure it with strict sanitization options if available.

- Preconditions:
- The attacker needs to be able to contribute to the `vscode-pull-request-github` project, for example by creating and merging a pull request.
- A user must install the vulnerable version of the VS Code extension.
- The vulnerable SVG must be rendered within a VS Code webview controlled by the extension.

- Source code analysis:
1. File `/code/scripts/preprocess-svg.js` uses `svg-inline-loader` to process SVG files.
2. `svg-inline-loader` by default can execute javascript code embedded in SVG files.
3. The processed SVG files are included in the extension package.
4. The extension renders webviews that can potentially display these SVG files, for example in PR descriptions or UI elements. Files like `/code/webviews/createPullRequestViewNew/index.ts`, `/code/webviews/editorWebview/index.ts`, and `/code/webviews/activityBarView/index.ts` confirm the usage of webviews.
5. If a malicious SVG is included, and rendered in a webview, XSS can be triggered.

- Security test case:
1. Create a malicious SVG file named `malicious.svg` with the following content:
   ```xml
   <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
     <script>alert("XSS Vulnerability");</script>
   </svg>
   ```
2. Place this file in the `/code/resources/icons/` directory within the project.
3. Modify the `/code/src/extension.ts` to include and render this SVG in a webview. For example, temporarily add the following code to the `activate` function:
   ```typescript
   const panel = vscode.window.createWebviewPanel(
       'vulnTest',
       'Vulnerability Test',
       vscode.ViewColumn.One,
       {}
   );
   panel.webview.html = `<img src="${vscode.Uri.joinPath(context.extensionUri, 'resources/icons/malicious.svg').toString()}" />`;
   ```
4. Build and run the extension in VS Code.
5. Execute the command to show the webview (`Vulnerability Test`).
6. Observe that an alert dialog with "XSS Vulnerability" is displayed, indicating successful execution of JavaScript code from the SVG file.
