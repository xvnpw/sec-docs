### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Release Notes Generation

* Description:
    The `release.yml` workflow, used to create releases when new tags are pushed, is vulnerable to command injection during release notes generation. The script constructs a `git log` command to list commits since the last tag. It uses the output of `git describe` to determine the last tag. The `git describe` command is constructed using shell interpolation of the output of another git command (`git rev-list`). If an attacker can create a Git tag with a malicious name containing shell command injection payloads, this payload will be executed in the context of the GitHub Actions runner when the `release.yml` workflow is triggered by pushing this tag.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. An attacker with tag creation privileges creates a Git tag with a malicious name, for example: `v1.0.0--abbrev=0--tags$(echo vulnerable > /tmp/test_injection)`.
    2. The attacker pushes this tag to the `main` branch of the repository.
    3. This push triggers the `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.
    4. In the `Write release notes` step, the workflow executes the vulnerable `git log` command.
    5. The malicious tag name injects the command `echo vulnerable > /tmp/test_injection` into the shell command executed by `git describe`.
    6. The injected command `echo vulnerable > /tmp/test_injection` is executed on the GitHub Actions runner.

* Impact:
    Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the GitHub Actions runner. This can lead to:
    - **Code Modification:** The attacker could modify the project's source code by committing and pushing changes.
    - **Secret Exfiltration:** The attacker could exfiltrate secrets stored in the GitHub repository or organization settings, such as API keys, access tokens, and other sensitive information.
    - **Supply Chain Attack:** The attacker could compromise the release process, potentially injecting malicious code into releases of `@vscode/codicons` package, affecting users who depend on this package.
    - **Data Breach:** The attacker could access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the GitHub Actions environment or potentially from connected systems if credentials are leaked.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The project does not currently implement any mitigations against this command injection vulnerability.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize or validate tag names to prevent shell command injection. Specifically, when constructing the `git describe` command, ensure that tag names are treated as literal strings and not interpreted as shell commands.
    - **Secure Command Construction:** Avoid using shell interpolation to construct commands, especially when dealing with external inputs or outputs from other commands. Use safer alternatives for constructing Git commands programmatically, if possible.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the GitHub Actions runner environment and any associated tokens have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. However, this will not directly mitigate command injection, but can limit the impact.

* Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to create and push Git tags to the `main` branch of the repository. In public repositories, this is typically restricted to maintainers or collaborators with write access. However, if repository settings are misconfigured or if an attacker compromises a maintainer account, this precondition can be met.
    - The `release.yml` workflow must be enabled and configured to run on tag push events, which is the default configuration in the provided files.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/.github/workflows/release.yml`
    2. **Section:** `Write release notes` step
    3. **Vulnerable Code:**
    ```yaml
          - name: Write release notes
            if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
            run: | # List all commits since last tag
              commits=$(git log --pretty=format:"* %s (%h)" $(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags `git rev-list --tags --skip=1  --max-count=1`)...)
              echo -e "This release includes:\n${commits}" > release_notes.txt

              {
                echo 'release_notes<<EOF'
                cat release_notes.txt
                echo EOF
              } >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
    ```
    4. **Vulnerability Breakdown:**
        - The `run: |` block executes shell commands.
        - `commits=$(...)` captures the output of the command within `$()` and assigns it to the `commits` variable.
        - The command inside `$()` is: `git log --pretty=format:"* %s (%h)" $(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags \`git rev-list --tags --skip=1  --max-count=1\`)...)`
        - The nested command `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags \`git rev-list --tags --skip=1  --max-count=1\`` is intended to find the name of the tag immediately preceding the current tag.
        - **Vulnerability:** The output of `git describe ...` is directly embedded into the outer `git log` command through shell interpolation. If the output of `git describe` (which is a tag name) contains shell- Metacharacters, these will be interpreted as shell commands, leading to command injection.

    5. **Visualization:**

    ```
    [GitHub Actions Workflow: release.yml]
        |
        |--- Write release notes step
        |     |
        |     |--- `commits=$(git log ... $(git describe ...)...)`  <-- Vulnerable Command
        |     |        |
        |     |        |--- `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags \`git rev-list ...\` <-- Retrieves tag name (potential injection point)
        |     |        |
        |     |--- `echo -e "This release includes:\n${commits}" > release_notes.txt`
        |
        |--- Create Release step (uses release_notes.txt)
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - You need write access to the GitHub repository to create and push tags.
        - Fork the repository if you don't have write access to the original.
    2. **Create a Malicious Tag:**
        ```bash
        git tag "v1.0.0--abbrev=0--tags\$(echo vulnerable_command_injection > /tmp/test_injection)"
        git push origin "v1.0.0--abbrev=0--tags\$(echo vulnerable_command_injection > /tmp/test_injection)"
        ```
        This command creates a tag named `v1.0.0--abbrev=0--tags$(echo vulnerable_command_injection > /tmp/test_injection)` and pushes it to the `origin` repository.
    3. **Trigger the Workflow:**
        Pushing the tag in the previous step automatically triggers the `release.yml` workflow.
    4. **Examine Workflow Logs:**
        - Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
        - Find the "Codicons Release" workflow run corresponding to the tag push you just made.
        - Click on the workflow run to view its details.
        - Navigate to the "publish" job and then to the "Write release notes" step logs.
        - **Check for successful injection:** If the command injection was successful, the command `echo vulnerable_command_injection > /tmp/test_injection` would have been executed on the runner.
    5. **Verify Command Execution (Out-of-band):**
       - Since direct output in logs might be sanitized or difficult to observe for command injection, a more reliable method is to use an out-of-band technique. In the example tag, we attempted to write to `/tmp/test_injection`. While direct file system access verification from outside the runner is not possible, in a real scenario, an attacker would use more impactful commands like exfiltrating secrets or modifying code. For testing purposes, observing any errors in the workflow logs related to the `git describe` or `git log` command, or unexpected behavior in release notes generation, can indicate successful injection.

        **Note:**  Directly verifying file creation on the runner is not straightforward from an external perspective. In a real attack scenario, malicious actions would be designed to be observable (e.g., data exfiltration to an external attacker-controlled server or code modification visible in the repository). For testing purposes, you might need to analyze the workflow execution environment more directly or use more observable side effects if simply checking logs is insufficient.
