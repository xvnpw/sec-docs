## Vulnerability List

There are no high or critical vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that are directly exploitable by an external attacker in a VSCode extension context and are introduced by the project itself, after applying the specified filtering criteria. The scripts are primarily build-time tools and not exposed during runtime in a VSCode extension in a way that would introduce high or critical vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker.

Therefore, the vulnerability list remains empty based on the provided filtering criteria.
