### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: SVG Sprite XSS via Malicious SVG Processing
- Description: The `svg-sprite.js` script in the `vscode-codicons` project is used to generate an SVG sprite from SVG files. This script does not sanitize the input SVG files before processing them with the `svg-sprite` library. If a malicious actor can inject a crafted SVG file containing an XSS payload into the `src/icons` directory of the `vscode-codicons` project (e.g., through a malicious pull request that gets merged by maintainers, or by compromising the development/build environment), the `svg-sprite` library may process this malicious SVG and include the XSS payload in the generated `codicon.svg` sprite.  If a VSCode extension then uses this compromised `@vscode/codicons` package and renders the `codicon.svg` sprite in a webview without proper sanitization, it will be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact: If a VSCode extension uses the generated `codicon.svg` sprite in a webview and doesn't sanitize it properly, an attacker who can inject malicious SVG code into the `src/icons` directory (e.g., via a supply chain attack) can achieve XSS in the extension's webview. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the webview, potentially stealing user data, manipulating the extension's functionality, or performing other malicious actions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. The provided code does not include any SVG sanitization for input or output of the `svg-sprite.js` script.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input SVG sanitization: Implement sanitization of SVG files in the `src/icons` directory before they are processed by `svg-sprite`. This can be done using libraries like `DOMPurify` or `sanitize-svg` to remove potentially malicious code from SVG files before sprite generation.
    - Output SVG sprite sanitization: Sanitize the generated `codicon.svg` sprite after it is created by `svg-sprite` to ensure no malicious code persists in the final output.
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning: Regularly scan dependencies, especially `svg-sprite`, for known vulnerabilities and update to patched versions promptly.
- Preconditions:
    1. A vulnerability exists in the `svg-sprite` library (or in the way it's used) that allows for the preservation of malicious code (e.g., XSS payloads) from input SVG files into the generated SVG sprite.
    2. A malicious actor is able to inject a crafted SVG file containing an XSS payload into the `src/icons` directory of the `vscode-codicons` project, and this malicious file is included in a release of the `@vscode/codicons` npm package.
    3. A VSCode extension depends on the `@vscode/codicons` npm package and uses the generated `codicon.svg` sprite in a webview.
    4. The VSCode extension does not properly sanitize the `codicon.svg` sprite content or its usage in the webview, making it vulnerable to XSS.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. The script `/code/scripts/svg-sprite.js` is responsible for generating the `codicon.svg` sprite.
    2. It reads SVG files from the `/code/src/icons` directory based on mappings defined in `/code/src/template/mapping.json`.
    3. It uses the `svg-sprite` library to process these SVG files and combine them into a single sprite.
    4. The script does not include any sanitization steps for the input SVG files before passing them to `svg-sprite`.
    5. If a malicious SVG file, containing for example a `<script>` tag for XSS, is placed in the `/code/src/icons` directory (e.g., `malicious.svg`):
        ```xml
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>
        </svg>
        ```
    6. When `scripts/svg-sprite.js` is executed, `svg-sprite` might process `malicious.svg` and include the `<script>` tag in the generated `codicon.svg` sprite without sanitization.
    7. Here is a simplified representation of the process:
        ```
        /code/src/icons/malicious.svg --> scripts/svg-sprite.js --> svg-sprite library --> dist/codicon.svg (potentially containing malicious <script> tag)
        ```
    8. If a VSCode extension uses this generated `dist/codicon.svg` and renders it in a webview like this:
        ```html
        <webview id="myWebview" srcdoc='<svg><use xlink:href="codicon.svg#malicious" /></svg>'></webview>
        ```
    9. And if the extension does not sanitize the `srcdoc` content, the JavaScript code within the malicious SVG (`<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>`) will be executed in the context of the webview, leading to XSS.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new SVG file named `malicious.svg` in the `/code/src/icons` directory with the following malicious content:
        ```xml
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>
        </svg>
        ```
    2. Run the `svg-sprite.js` script from the project root to regenerate the `codicon.svg` sprite:
        ```bash
        node /code/scripts/svg-sprite.js --outDir dist --outFile codicon.svg
        ```
    3. Verify that the `dist/codicon.svg` file is created or updated.
    4. Create a minimal VSCode extension project.
    5. In the extension's `package.json` add `@vscode/codicons` as a dependency:
        ```json
        "dependencies": {
          "@vscode/codicons": "*"
        }
        ```
    6. In the extension's main code (e.g., `extension.js`), create a webview panel and set its HTML content to render the `malicious` icon from the generated `codicon.svg` sprite.  Ensure you are serving the `codicon.svg` from the `@vscode/codicons` dependency, for example by copying it to the extension's workspace or referencing it via a relative path after npm install.  A simplified example of webview content could be:
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>Codicon Test</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <svg>
                <use xlink:href="./node_modules/@vscode/codicons/dist/codicon.svg#malicious" />
            </svg>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
    7. Run the VSCode extension and open the webview panel.
    8. Observe if an alert dialog with "XSS Vulnerability!" is displayed in the webview. If the alert appears, it confirms that the malicious script from `malicious.svg` was included in `codicon.svg` and executed in the webview, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
    9. **Note:** For a real-world scenario, the malicious SVG would likely be injected through a more subtle method, like within the path data of an icon, rather than a blatant `<script>` tag, to bypass simple visual inspections and automated checks. However, for proof of concept, a direct `<script>` tag is sufficient.
