## Vulnerability List

There are no high or critical vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that are directly exploitable by an external attacker in a VSCode extension.

After analyzing the provided scripts and configuration files, it appears they are primarily build-time tools for generating icon fonts and sprites. These scripts are not directly executed within a VSCode extension's runtime environment. Therefore, vulnerabilities in these scripts would typically affect the development/build process rather than the end-user experience in VSCode when using an extension that incorporates the generated assets.

While there might be theoretical vulnerabilities in the libraries used (like `opentype.js` or `svg-sprite`) if they were to process maliciously crafted input files, these scenarios are not directly related to external attackers exploiting a VSCode extension. The project files themselves do not introduce any obvious vulnerabilities that fit the criteria of being high or critical, exploitable by an external attacker in a VSCode extension, and not being insecure code patterns or DoS.

Therefore, based on the provided files and constraints, there are no vulnerabilities to report at this time.
