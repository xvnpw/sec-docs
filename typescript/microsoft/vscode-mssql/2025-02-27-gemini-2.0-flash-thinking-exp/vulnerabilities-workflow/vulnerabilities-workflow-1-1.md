## Vulnerability List for mssql VSCode Extension

**1. Vulnerability Name:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Query Results

- **Description:**
    An attacker can craft a malicious SQL query that, when executed by a user of the mssql extension, injects JavaScript code into the query results view. This injected code executes when the user views the results, potentially leading to information disclosure or other malicious actions within the VSCode extension's context.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the VSCode environment upon viewing query results. This can lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information accessible to the extension (e.g., connection profiles, tokens).
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user within VSCode.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Potentially gaining further access to the user's system through VSCode vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The project uses `ejs` templating for rendering SQL output in `src/controllers/sqlOutput.ejs`. Verification is still needed to confirm if ejs is configured for automatic HTML escaping and if this configuration is correctly applied during build. Reviewing `gulpfile.js` and build configurations is still necessary to confirm HTML escaping during the build process. No explicit sanitization or encoding is apparent in the provided `queryRunner.ts` file, which is responsible for handling query results. The newly provided files, including `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts`, files in `/code/src/models/`, and test files in `/code/test/unit/`, do not include any explicit mitigation for XSS in query results or execution plan views. There is no evidence of output sanitization in `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts` before data is sent to the webview. Analysis of the newly provided test files (`queryRunner.test.ts`, `reactWebviewBaseController.test.ts`, `webviewPanelController.test.ts`, `stubs.ts`) does not reveal any implemented mitigations for XSS. These test files primarily focus on functional testing of different components and do not include security-specific tests or sanitization implementations.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Robust output sanitization and encoding of query results before rendering in the webview, specifically HTML escaping to prevent XSS. This sanitization should be implemented within `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts` before emitting data to the webview or directly within the rendering templates/components.
    - Implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) for the webview to restrict resource loading and script execution sources for both query results and execution plan views.
    - Review and hardening of `angular2-slickgrid` configuration to ensure it's not vulnerable to XSS when rendering user-controlled data in `/code/src/views/htmlcontent/src/js/components/app.component.ts`.
    - Investigation and sanitization of data rendering in execution plan views, specifically in `executionPlanView.ts` and related React components in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/ExecutionPlan/`, to prevent XSS in execution plan graphs and node details.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to influence the SQL query executed by the victim. This can be done through social engineering, compromising query-generating systems, or by users running queries from untrusted sources.
    - The user must execute the malicious SQL query using the mssql extension and view the results in the VSCode UI.
    - The `mssql.enableRichExperiences` setting must be enabled to utilize the new query results pane.
    - For execution plan XSS (if applicable), the user must view the execution plan results pane.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Rendering Points:** `src/controllers/sqlOutput.ejs` remains a confirmed rendering point for tabular SQL query results. React components in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/ExecutionPlan/` are used for rendering execution plans, particularly `executionPlanView.ts`. The file `/code/src/views/htmlcontent/src/js/components/app.component.ts` using `angular2-slickgrid` is also a rendering point.
    2. **Data Flow:** `queryRunner.ts` (File: `/code/src/controllers/queryRunner.ts`) handles query execution and emits data to the webview through events. `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts` (File: `/code/src/models/sqlOutputContentProvider.ts`) manages the `QueryRunner` and webview communication. The `createQueryRunner` method in `SqlOutputContentProvider` sets up event listeners on the `QueryRunner`'s `eventEmitter`. The `resultSet` event handler in `createQueryRunner` is responsible for sending result set data to the webview:

    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/models/sqlOutputContentProvider.ts
    queryRunner.eventEmitter.on(
        "resultSet",
        async (resultSet: ResultSetSummary) => {
            if (this.shouldUseOldResultPane) {
                this._panels
                    .get(uri)
                    .proxy.sendEvent("resultSet", resultSet); // Potential XSS sink - data passed to webview without sanitization for sqlOutput.ejs
            } else {
                // ... (New Query Result Pane Logic - potentially vulnerable as well) ...
            }
        },
    );
    ```

    The code in `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts` does not show any sanitization of `resultSet` before it's passed to the webview via `proxy.sendEvent("resultSet", resultSet)` for the old result pane (using `sqlOutput.ejs`) or in the new query result pane logic. This confirms that data from SQL queries is directly sent to the webview without sanitization, creating a potential XSS vulnerability.
    3. **Template and Component Inspection:**  `sqlOutput.ejs` (from previous analysis) lacks explicit HTML escaping. The React components in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/ExecutionPlan/` and `angular2-slickgrid` component in `/code/src/views/htmlcontent/src/js/components/app.component.ts` also need to be reviewed for proper sanitization of data properties before rendering.
    4. **Configuration Verification:**  The provided files do not contain explicit configuration for HTML escaping in `ejs` or explicit sanitization functions in the data flow. Build configurations and component rendering logic still need to be reviewed to confirm HTML escaping and sanitization.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Malicious SQL Query for Query Results:** Craft a SQL query to return JavaScript code as data: `SELECT '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS in Query Results\')">';`
    2. **Execute Query:** Run this query against a SQL Server instance using the mssql extension. Ensure `mssql.enableRichExperiences` is enabled.
    3. **View Results:** Observe the query results pane in VSCode.
    4. **Verify XSS Execution (Query Results):** Check if the injected JavaScript code executes in the webview. A successful XSS will manifest as an alert box displaying "XSS in Query Results".
    5. **Malicious SQL Query for Execution Plan (if applicable):** Craft a SQL query that includes malicious data within elements that might be displayed in the execution plan graph or node tooltips. Example: `SELECT 1 AS [Operator Type], '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS in Execution Plan\')">' AS [Estimated CPU Cost] FOR XML PATH (''), ROOT('ExecutionPlan');`
    6. **Enable Actual Execution Plan:** Enable "Actual Execution Plan" for the query.
    7. **Execute Query with Execution Plan:** Run the crafted query with Actual Execution Plan enabled.
    8. **View Execution Plan:** Open and inspect the Execution Plan pane in VSCode.
    9. **Verify XSS Execution (Execution Plan):** Check if the injected JavaScript code executes in the execution plan webview, specifically when interacting with nodes or viewing tooltips. A successful XSS will manifest as an alert box displaying "XSS in Execution Plan".
    10. **Inspect HTML Source (Optional):** If VSCode allows, inspect the webview's HTML source for both query results and execution plan panes to confirm the presence of unencoded malicious JavaScript code.

## Mitigation Status

No mitigations are currently implemented in the provided project files to prevent stored XSS in query results or execution plan views. The `sqlOutputContentProvider.ts` file confirms the data flow to the webview without explicit sanitization. Further investigation into build configurations, `sqlOutput.ejs` template, and React component rendering logic in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/ExecutionPlan/` is still needed to confirm default ejs behavior, React component sanitization practices, and identify necessary sanitization implementations.  Analysis of the newly provided test files does not indicate any implemented mitigations.
