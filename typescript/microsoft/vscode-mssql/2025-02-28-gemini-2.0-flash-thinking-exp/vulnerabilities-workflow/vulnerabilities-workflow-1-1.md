### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Query Results Display

- Description:
An external attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into query results. When a user executes a query that retrieves this data, the VSCode mssql extension, while rendering the results in a webview, could execute the injected script. This is possible if a database user with write access inserts malicious script into a database table, which is then queried and displayed in the extension's results grid. The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the `hyperLinkFormatter` is used to display the malicious data.

- Impact:
Successful XSS injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the VSCode extension's webview. This could lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information such as credentials or tokens managed by the extension.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user within the extension, including modifying connection profiles or executing queries.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious external websites.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
The `hyperLinkFormatter` function in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/QueryResult/table/formatters.ts` includes a custom `escape()` function intended to sanitize HTML characters. However, this function is limited and may not be sufficient to prevent all XSS attack vectors. The `escape()` function only handles a basic set of HTML characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`).

```typescript
function escape(html: string): string {
    return html.replace(/[<|>|&|"|\']/g, function (match) {
        switch (match) {
            case "<":
                return "&lt;";
            case ">":
                return "&gt;";
            case "&":
                return "&amp;";
            case '"':
                return "&quot;";
            case "'":
                return "&#39;";
            default:
                return match;
        }
    });
}
```

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Robust HTML Sanitization Library**: Replace the custom `escape()` function with a well-vetted and comprehensive HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify. This library is designed to handle a wide range of XSS attack vectors and browser quirks, providing more reliable protection.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a Content Security Policy for the webview. A CSP can significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the resources the webview is allowed to load and execute. For example, a CSP can restrict the execution of inline scripts and only allow scripts from trusted sources.

- Preconditions:
    - Attacker requires write access to a database managed by SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
    - A victim user must connect to the compromised database using the VSCode mssql extension.
    - The victim user must execute a query that retrieves data containing the malicious payload.
    - The query results must be displayed in the results grid of the VSCode mssql extension, and the vulnerable `hyperLinkFormatter` must be used for the column containing the malicious payload.

- Source Code Analysis:
1. The code snippet from `/code/src/reactviews/pages/QueryResult/table/formatters.ts` shows the `hyperLinkFormatter` function, which is responsible for formatting cell values in the query results grid.
2. The `hyperLinkFormatter` function retrieves the display value of a cell using `getCellDisplayValue` and then renders it as a hyperlink:
   ```typescript
   valueToDisplay = getCellDisplayValue(value.displayValue);
   ...
   return `<a class="${cellClasses}" title="${valueToDisplay}">${valueToDisplay}</a>`;
   ```
3. The `getCellDisplayValue` function performs basic escaping and newline replacement before passing the value to the `escape()` function:
   ```typescript
   export function getCellDisplayValue(cellValue: string): string {
       let valueToDisplay =
           cellValue.length > 250 ? cellValue.slice(0, 250) + "..." : cellValue;
       // allow-any-unicode-next-line
       valueToDisplay = valueToDisplay.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/g, "â†µ");
       return escape(valueToDisplay);
   }
   ```
4. The custom `escape()` function in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/QueryResult/table/formatters.ts` provides a basic level of HTML escaping, but it is not comprehensive and can be bypassed by sophisticated XSS payloads.
5. The limited escaping in `escape()` combined with directly embedding the escaped value in the `<a>` tag's `title` and text content can lead to XSS if an attacker crafts a payload that bypasses the simple escaping.

- Security Test Case:
1. **Setup:**
    - Set up a SQL Server or Azure SQL Database instance and create a table `VulnerableTable` with a `VulnerableColumn` of type `VARCHAR(MAX)`.
    - As an attacker, connect to the database with write access and insert a malicious payload into `VulnerableTable.VulnerableColumn`:
      ```sql
      INSERT INTO VulnerableTable (VulnerableColumn) VALUES ('<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS Vulnerability!\')">');
      ```
2. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
    - As a victim, connect to the same database using the VSCode mssql extension.
    - Execute the query: `SELECT VulnerableColumn FROM VulnerableTable;`
3. **Verify Vulnerability:**
    - Observe if an alert dialog with "XSS Vulnerability!" appears when the query results are displayed. If so, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.

- Security test case (mitigated):
1. **Setup:** Same as above.
2. **Mitigation:** Replace the custom `escape()` function with DOMPurify in `hyperLinkFormatter` and `textFormatter` functions. Implement a strict Content Security Policy for the webview.
3. **Trigger Vulnerability:** Same as above.
4. **Verify Mitigation:**
    - Observe that no alert dialog appears.
    - Inspect the rendered HTML in the webview's developer tools to confirm that the malicious payload is properly sanitized and rendered as text, not as executable HTML.
