## Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Potential Property Injection in Table Designer
* Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious `tableChangeInfo` payload and trigger the `processTableEdit` reducer in `tableDesignerWebviewController.ts`.
    2. This payload contains a specially crafted `path` property within `tableChangeInfo`.
    3. The `processTableEdit` reducer passes this unsanitized `tableChangeInfo` to `_tableDesignerService.processTableEdit`.
    4. If `_tableDesignerService.processTableEdit` does not properly validate the `path` property, an attacker can potentially inject or modify arbitrary properties of the table object, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
* Impact: High. Property injection can lead to unauthorized modification of database objects or unexpected behaviors within the extension.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations: None. The code directly passes user-provided `tableChangeInfo` to the service without path validation.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Implement input validation and sanitization for the `path` property in `_tableDesignerService.processTableEdit`.
    - Add checks to ensure the `path` property targets only valid and expected table object properties.
    - Consider using a safer property update mechanism instead of direct property access using user-provided paths.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Table Designer UI and trigger the `processTableEdit` reducer, potentially through crafted webview messages.
* Source code analysis:
    1. The `processTableEdit` reducer in `tableDesignerWebviewController.ts` directly passes `payload.tableChangeInfo` to the service:
    ```typescript
    this.registerReducer("processTableEdit", async (state, payload) => {
        try {
            const editResponse =
                await this._tableDesignerService.processTableEdit(
                    payload.table,
                    payload.tableChangeInfo, // Vulnerable input
                );
            // ...
        } catch (e) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage(e.message);
            return state;
        }
        // ...
    });
    ```
    2. The `DesignerEdit` interface in `tableDesignerTabDefinition.ts` defines `DesignerPropertyPath` as `(string | number)[]`, allowing for arbitrary path manipulation.
* Security test case:
    1. Open VSCode and load the extension.
    2. Open a table designer (either by editing an existing table or creating a new one).
    3. Open the developer tools for the webview (if possible) or set up a proxy to intercept messages between the webview and the extension.
    4. Craft a malicious `processTableEdit` action payload as a JSON object. This payload should include:
        - `type: "processTableEdit"`
        - `table: ...` (a valid table object, can be an empty or dummy table object)
        - `payload: { tableChangeInfo: ... }`
        - Inside `tableChangeInfo`, create a crafted `path` array targeting a property you want to inject or modify. For example: `path: ["__proto__", "pollutedProperty"]`.
        - Set a `value` for the crafted path, e.g., `"maliciousValue"`.
        - Provide a valid `type` and `source` for `tableChangeInfo`.
    5. Send this crafted payload to the webview (either by manually sending it through developer tools or by modifying intercepted messages).
    6. Observe the behavior of the Table Designer and the extension. Check if the injected property is set on the table object or if any unexpected side effects occur.
    7. To verify the vulnerability, try to trigger unintended behavior by exploiting the injected property in subsequent operations within the Table Designer.
