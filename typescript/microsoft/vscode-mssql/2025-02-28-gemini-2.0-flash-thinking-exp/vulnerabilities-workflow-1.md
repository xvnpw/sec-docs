## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Query Results Display

- **Description:**
    An external attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into query results. When a user executes a query that retrieves this data, the VSCode mssql extension, while rendering the results in a webview, could execute the injected script. This is possible if a database user with write access inserts malicious script into a database table, which is then queried and displayed in the extension's results grid. The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the `hyperLinkFormatter` is used to display the malicious data.

- **Impact:**
    Successful XSS injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the VSCode extension's webview. This could lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information such as credentials or tokens managed by the extension.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user within the extension, including modifying connection profiles or executing queries.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious external websites.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The `hyperLinkFormatter` function in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/QueryResult/table/formatters.ts` includes a custom `escape()` function intended to sanitize HTML characters. However, this function is limited and may not be sufficient to prevent all XSS attack vectors. The `escape()` function only handles a basic set of HTML characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`).

    ```typescript
    function escape(html: string): string {
        return html.replace(/[<|>|&|"|\']/g, function (match) {
            switch (match) {
                case "<":
                    return "&lt;";
                case ">":
                    return "&gt;";
                case "&":
                    return "&amp;";
                case '"':
                    return "&quot;";
                case "'":
                    return "&#39;";
                default:
                    return match;
            }
        });
    }
    ```

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Robust HTML Sanitization Library**: Replace the custom `escape()` function with a well-vetted and comprehensive HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify. This library is designed to handle a wide range of XSS attack vectors and browser quirks, providing more reliable protection.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a Content Security Policy for the webview. A CSP can significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the resources the webview is allowed to load and execute. For example, a CSP can restrict the execution of inline scripts and only allow scripts from trusted sources.

- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker requires write access to a database managed by SQL Server or Azure SQL Database.
    - A victim user must connect to the compromised database using the VSCode mssql extension.
    - The victim user must execute a query that retrieves data containing the malicious payload.
    - The query results must be displayed in the results grid of the VSCode mssql extension, and the vulnerable `hyperLinkFormatter` must be used for the column containing the malicious payload.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The code snippet from `/code/src/reactviews/pages/QueryResult/table/formatters.ts` shows the `hyperLinkFormatter` function, which is responsible for formatting cell values in the query results grid.
    2. The `hyperLinkFormatter` function retrieves the display value of a cell using `getCellDisplayValue` and then renders it as a hyperlink:
       ```typescript
       valueToDisplay = getCellDisplayValue(value.displayValue);
       ...
       return `<a class="${cellClasses}" title="${valueToDisplay}">${valueToDisplay}</a>`;
       ```
    3. The `getCellDisplayValue` function performs basic escaping and newline replacement before passing the value to the `escape()` function:
       ```typescript
       export function getCellDisplayValue(cellValue: string): string {
           let valueToDisplay =
               cellValue.length > 250 ? cellValue.slice(0, 250) + "..." : cellValue;
           // allow-any-unicode-next-line
           valueToDisplay = valueToDisplay.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/g, "â†µ");
           return escape(valueToDisplay);
       }
       ```
    4. The custom `escape()` function in `/code/src/reactviews/pages/QueryResult/table/formatters.ts` provides a basic level of HTML escaping, but it is not comprehensive and can be bypassed by sophisticated XSS payloads.
    5. The limited escaping in `escape()` combined with directly embedding the escaped value in the `<a>` tag's `title` and text content can lead to XSS if an attacker crafts a payload that bypasses the simple escaping.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Set up a SQL Server or Azure SQL Database instance and create a table `VulnerableTable` with a `VulnerableColumn` of type `VARCHAR(MAX)`.
        - As an attacker, connect to the database with write access and insert a malicious payload into `VulnerableTable.VulnerableColumn`:
          ```sql
          INSERT INTO VulnerableTable (VulnerableColumn) VALUES ('<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS Vulnerability!\')">');
          ```
    2. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - As a victim, connect to the same database using the VSCode mssql extension.
        - Execute the query: `SELECT VulnerableColumn FROM VulnerableTable;`
    3. **Verify Vulnerability:**
        - Observe if an alert dialog with "XSS Vulnerability!" appears when the query results are displayed. If so, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed.

- **Security test case (mitigated):**
    1. **Setup:** Same as above.
    2. **Mitigation:** Replace the custom `escape()` function with DOMPurify in `hyperLinkFormatter` and `textFormatter` functions. Implement a strict Content Security Policy for the webview.
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:** Same as above.
    4. **Verify Mitigation:**
        - Observe that no alert dialog appears.
        - Inspect the rendered HTML in the webview's developer tools to confirm that the malicious payload is properly sanitized and rendered as text, not as executable HTML.

### 2. SQL Injection via `profileName` parameter in `vscode://ms-mssql.mssql/connect` URI

- **Description:**
    - An attacker crafts a malicious URI that includes a SQL injection payload within the `profileName` parameter. For example: `vscode://ms-mssql.mssql/connect?profileName='; DROP TABLE users; --`.
    - The attacker tricks a user into clicking this malicious URI. This could be done through various social engineering methods like phishing emails, malicious websites, or chat messages.
    - When the user clicks the URI, VSCode attempts to handle it using the mssql extension.
    - The `mssqlProtocolHandler.ts` file's `readProfileFromArgs` function parses the URI, extracting the `profileName` without sufficient sanitization.
    - If this `profileName` is then used in a SQL query (the code for actual query execution is not in provided files but assumed based on description), the injected SQL code could be executed against the database.

- **Impact:**
    - **Data Breach**: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information by injecting SQL queries to extract data.
    - **Data Manipulation**: The attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues.
    - **Privilege Escalation**: Depending on the database user's permissions used by the VSCode extension and the injected SQL code, the attacker could potentially escalate privileges and perform administrative tasks on the database server.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None apparent from the provided code. The `readProfileFromArgs` function lacks input validation and sanitization for the `profileName` parameter.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `profileName` parameter within the `readProfileFromArgs` function. This should include escaping special characters and validating the format of the input to ensure it only contains expected characters.
    - **Parameterized Queries**:  Utilize parameterized queries or stored procedures when performing database lookups based on the `profileName`. This prevents direct embedding of user-supplied input into SQL queries, effectively mitigating SQL injection risks.

- **Preconditions:**
    - VSCode mssql extension must be installed and active.
    - The attacker must be able to convince a user to click on a specially crafted `vscode://ms-mssql.mssql/connect` URI.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/mssqlProtocolHandler.ts`
    ```typescript
    private async readProfileFromArgs(
        query: string,
    ): Promise<IConnectionInfo | undefined> {
        ...
        const profileName = args.get("profileName"); // Vulnerable line: potential SQL injection
        if (profileName) {
            connectionInfo["profileName"] = profileName;
        }
        ...
    }
    ```
    - The code snippet shows that the `profileName` is directly extracted from the URI parameters using `args.get("profileName")` and assigned to `connectionInfo["profileName"]`. Without proper validation or sanitization before being used in database operations, this part of the code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup**: Install the VSCode mssql extension and have access to a SQL Server instance for testing (ensure this instance does not contain production or sensitive data).
    2. **Craft Malicious URI**: Create a URI with a SQL injection payload in the `profileName` parameter:
    ```markdown
    vscode://ms-mssql.mssql/connect?profileName='; EXEC xp_cmdshell 'echo Vulnerability Found'; --
    ```
    3. **Trigger URI Processing**: Simulate a user clicking this URI. In a real-world scenario, this could be through embedding the link in a webpage or email and tricking a user to click it. For testing, you can manually paste this URI into VSCode's "Open URL..." command (Ctrl+Shift+P, type "Open URL").
    4. **Analyze Logs and Behavior**:
        - **Check VSCode logs (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools -> Console)**: Look for any error messages or unusual behavior in the extension's console output that might indicate SQL injection attempts.
        - **Monitor SQL Server logs**: Examine the SQL Server logs for any executed commands that match the injected payload (e.g., `DROP TABLE users`, `xp_cmdshell 'echo Vulnerability Found'`, or other unexpected commands).
        - **Observe Extension Behavior**: Observe the extension's behavior after clicking the link. While a direct UI change might not be immediately apparent, any unusual delays, errors, or crashes in the extension could be indicators of a vulnerability being triggered.
    5. **Expected Result**: A successful test would show evidence in the SQL Server logs (if `xp_cmdshell` or similar commands are used) or VSCode logs indicating an attempted SQL injection when processing the crafted URI. If the system is properly protected, the test should not show execution of injected SQL and ideally, the extension should handle the invalid `profileName` gracefully without attempting a potentially vulnerable database operation.

### 3. Potential Property Injection in Table Designer

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious `tableChangeInfo` payload and trigger the `processTableEdit` reducer in `tableDesignerWebviewController.ts`.
    2. This payload contains a specially crafted `path` property within `tableChangeInfo`.
    3. The `processTableEdit` reducer passes this unsanitized `tableChangeInfo` to `_tableDesignerService.processTableEdit`.
    4. If `_tableDesignerService.processTableEdit` does not properly validate the `path` property, an attacker can potentially inject or modify arbitrary properties of the table object, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

- **Impact:** High. Property injection can lead to unauthorized modification of database objects or unexpected behaviors within the extension.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code directly passes user-provided `tableChangeInfo` to the service without path validation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement input validation and sanitization for the `path` property in `_tableDesignerService.processTableEdit`.
    - Add checks to ensure the `path` property targets only valid and expected table object properties.
    - Consider using a safer property update mechanism instead of direct property access using user-provided paths.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Table Designer UI and trigger the `processTableEdit` reducer, potentially through crafted webview messages.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The `processTableEdit` reducer in `tableDesignerWebviewController.ts` directly passes `payload.tableChangeInfo` to the service:
    ```typescript
    this.registerReducer("processTableEdit", async (state, payload) => {
        try {
            const editResponse =
                await this._tableDesignerService.processTableEdit(
                    payload.table,
                    payload.tableChangeInfo, // Vulnerable input
                );
            // ...
        } catch (e) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage(e.message);
            return state;
        }
        // ...
    });
    ```
    2. The `DesignerEdit` interface in `tableDesignerTabDefinition.ts` defines `DesignerPropertyPath` as `(string | number)[]`, allowing for arbitrary path manipulation.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open VSCode and load the extension.
    2. Open a table designer (either by editing an existing table or creating a new one).
    3. Open the developer tools for the webview (if possible) or set up a proxy to intercept messages between the webview and the extension.
    4. Craft a malicious `processTableEdit` action payload as a JSON object. This payload should include:
        - `type: "processTableEdit"`
        - `table: ...` (a valid table object, can be an empty or dummy table object)
        - `payload: { tableChangeInfo: ... }`
        - Inside `tableChangeInfo`, create a crafted `path` array targeting a property you want to inject or modify. For example: `path: ["__proto__", "pollutedProperty"]`.
        - Set a `value` for the crafted path, e.g., `"maliciousValue"`.
        - Provide a valid `type` and `source` for `tableChangeInfo`.
    5. Send this crafted payload to the webview (either by manually sending it through developer tools or by modifying intercepted messages).
    6. Observe the behavior of the Table Designer and the extension. Check if the injected property is set on the table object or if any unexpected side effects occur.
    7. To verify the vulnerability, try to trigger unintended behavior by exploiting the injected property in subsequent operations within the Table Designer.
