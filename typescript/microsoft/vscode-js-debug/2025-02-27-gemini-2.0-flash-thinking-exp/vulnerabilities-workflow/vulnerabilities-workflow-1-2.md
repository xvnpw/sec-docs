- Vulnerability Name: Unprotected CDP Proxy Access
- Description: The js-debug extension offers a CDP sharing mechanism via the `extension.js-debug.requestCDPProxy` command. This command, when invoked with a debug session ID, returns a WebSocket server address. This WebSocket server acts as a proxy to the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) of the specified debug session. If this WebSocket endpoint lacks proper security measures, an external attacker could exploit this by establishing an unauthorized connection. Upon successful connection, the attacker could then send arbitrary CDP commands, effectively gaining complete control over the debugging session.
- Impact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the debugged application. For example, in a browser debugging session, the attacker could manipulate the webpage, extract sensitive data, or trigger actions on behalf of the user. In a Node.js debugging session, the attacker could similarly execute code on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or complete system compromise depending on the privileges of the debugged process.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Based on the provided project files, there are no apparent mitigations implemented to protect the CDP proxy WebSocket endpoint. The code in `dapDebugServer.ts` and `debugServer.ts` (from previous analysis) sets up the debug server and DAP communication, but lacks any authentication or authorization for the CDP proxy. The test file `cdpProxy.test.ts` (from previous analysis) also confirms the functionality without any security tests. The documentation in `EXTENSION_AUTHORS.md` (from previous analysis) describes the feature but does not mention any security considerations or access controls. Analysis of the files in this batch, including `/code/src/test/framework/reactTest.ts`, `/code/src/test/stacks/stacksTest.ts`, `/code/src/test/completion/completion.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/infra/infra.ts`, `/code/src/test/extension/pickAttach.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/extension/profiling.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/extension/extensionHostConfigurationProvider.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/extension/nodeConfigurationProvider.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/reporters/logTestReporter.ts`, `/code/src/test/reporters/logReporterUtils.ts`, `/code/src/test/reporters/goldenTextReporterUtils.ts`, `/code/src/test/reporters/goldenTextReporter.ts`, `/code/src/test/threads/threadsTest.ts`, `/code/src/test/variables/variablesTest.ts`, `/code/src/test/breakpoints/breakpointsTest.ts`, `/code/src/test/browser/browser-args.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/browser/framesTest.ts`, `/code/src/test/browser/blazorSourcePathResolverTest.ts`, `/code/src/test/browser/browser-launch.test.ts`, `/code/src/test/browser/performance.test.ts`, `/code/src/build/generate-contributions.ts`, `/code/src/build/generateDap.ts`, `/code/src/build/generateCdp.ts`, `/code/src/build/jsDebugCustom.ts`, `/code/src/build/documentReadme.ts`, `/code/src/build/wasmCustom.ts`, `/code/src/build/dapCustom.ts`, `/code/src/build/nodeCustom.ts`, `/code/src/build/generateUtils.ts`, `/code/src/diagnosticTool/diagnosticPaths.ts`, `/code/src/diagnosticTool/index.ts`, `/code/src/diagnosticTool/useDump.ts`, does not reveal any implemented mitigations for the CDP proxy vulnerability. Specifically, `cdpProxy.ts` (from previous analysis) which implements the CDP proxy server, does not include any authentication or authorization mechanisms. The server creation and connection handling logic in `createServer` and `on('connection', ...)` within `cdpProxy.ts` lacks security checks. The file `/code/src/ui/requestCDPProxy.ts` registers the command but does not add any security measures.  The file `/code/src/test/common/cdpTransport.test.ts` from this batch (previous analysis), tests the functionality of CDP transport, but it doesn't introduce or test any security mitigations for the CDP proxy. The files in this batch are primarily test files, build scripts, documentation generation, API definition generation, custom protocol definitions and diagnostic tool utilities, and do not contain any security-related code that would mitigate the CDP proxy vulnerability.
- Missing Mitigations: The primary missing mitigation is the implementation of authentication and authorization for the CDP proxy WebSocket endpoint. This could involve:
    - Authentication: Verifying the identity of the client attempting to connect to the WebSocket endpoint. This could be achieved using API keys, tokens, or other authentication mechanisms.
    - Authorization: Ensuring that the authenticated client has the necessary permissions to access and control the specified debug session. This would involve checking if the client is authorized to interact with the target debug session ID.
    Additionally, it would be beneficial to:
    - Limit Access: Restrict access to the `extension.js-debug.requestCDPProxy` command to only authorized extensions or users, if possible.
    - Secure Communication: Encrypt WebSocket communication using WSS to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Preconditions:
    - A debug session must be actively running within VSCode, utilizing the js-debug extension.
    - The attacker must be capable of triggering the `extension.js-debug.requestCDPProxy` command. This might be achieved through a separate, potentially compromised, VSCode extension, or by socially engineering a user to execute a malicious command.
    - The attacker needs network access to the WebSocket server address exposed by the `extension.js-debug.requestCDPProxy` command. This could be local access if the attacker is running code on the same machine as VSCode, or remote access if port forwarding or other network configurations are in place.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - `cdpProxy.ts` (from previous analysis): This file implements the `CdpProxyProvider` and the WebSocket server for CDP proxying.
        - `createServer()`: This method creates a WebSocket server using `acquireTrackedWebSocketServer` from `portLeaseTracker.ts` (from previous analysis). It sets `perMessageDeflate: true` and a random `path` for the WebSocket endpoint. However, it **lacks any authentication or authorization checks**.
        - `server.on('connection', client => { ... })`: This section handles new WebSocket connections. It creates a `ClientHandle` for each connection and sets up message and close handlers.  The `on('message', ...)` handler parses incoming messages as CDP commands and invokes either `invokeJsDebugDomainMethod` or `invokeCdpMethod`.  Critically, **no checks are performed to verify the origin or identity of the client connecting to the proxy**. Any client that can reach the WebSocket endpoint can send commands.
        - `invokeCdpMethod()`: This method directly forwards CDP commands to the `cdp.session.sendOrDie()` method after potentially replaying some events. There is **no access control** here, any valid CDP command received will be executed against the debug session.
        - `invokeJsDebugDomainMethod()`: This method handles methods within the `JsDebug` domain, specifically the `subscribe` method. This method also **lacks any authorization checks** and allows any connected client to subscribe to CDP events from the debug session.
    - `debugAdapter.ts` (from previous analysis): This file initializes and manages the `DebugAdapter`, including handling the `requestCDPProxy` command.
        - `_requestCDPProxy()`: This method simply calls `this._cdpProxyProvider.proxy()` to get the proxy information and return it. There is **no check on who is calling this command** or if they are authorized to access the debug session.
    - `portLeaseTracker.ts` (from previous analysis): This file provides utilities for managing port allocation and tracking, used by `cdpProxy.ts` to acquire a WebSocket server. It does **not introduce any security mitigations** for the CDP proxy itself, focusing on port management rather than access control.
    - `connection.ts` (from previous analysis): This file handles DAP connection and message processing. After reviewing the code, there is **no implementation of authentication or authorization checks** for incoming requests, including the `requestCDPProxy` command. The `_onMessage` function in `Connection` class processes messages based on their type and command, but does not include any security-related checks to verify the legitimacy of the request origin or user permissions before invoking the corresponding handlers.
    - `/code/src/ui/requestCDPProxy.ts`: This file registers the `requestCDPProxy` command.
        - `registerCommand(vscode.commands, Commands.RequestCDPProxy, ...)`: This function registers the `extension.js-debug.requestCDPProxy` command. The command handler retrieves the debug session and calls `session.customRequest('requestCDPProxy')`. It then handles tunneling for remote scenarios but **does not implement any authentication or authorization** for the CDP proxy access itself. It directly exposes the proxy information without security checks.

    *Visualization:* The diagram illustrates the flow of a malicious request. An attacker's VSCode extension triggers the `extension.js-debug.requestCDPProxy` command. This leads to the `CdpProxyProvider` creating an unprotected WebSocket server. The attacker can then connect to this server and send CDP commands to the debug session, gaining control. The highlighted "WebSocket Server" node emphasizes the vulnerability's location.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Initiate a debugging session in VSCode using js-debug (e.g., a Node.js or Chrome debug session). Ensure the session is active and responsive to debugging commands.
    2. Open the VSCode command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    3. Execute the command `Developer: Show Running Extensions`.
    4. Locate the "JavaScript Debugger (Nightly)" or "JavaScript Debugger" extension in the list. Right-click on it and select "Copy Extension ID".
    5. In a new VSCode window or another editor, create a simple VSCode extension or script that can execute VSCode commands. This script will be used to trigger the vulnerability.
    6. Within this extension/script, use the VSCode API to execute the `extension.js-debug.requestCDPProxy` command, providing the session ID of the active debug session. You can obtain the session ID programmatically or by manually inspecting the debug session in VSCode. Example code snippet:
    ```typescript
    import * as vscode from 'vscode';
    import WebSocket from 'ws'; // Ensure 'ws' is installed in your test environment

    export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
        const jsDebugExtensionId = 'ms-vscode.js-debug-nightly'; // Or 'ms-vscode.js-debug' for stable
        const jsDebugExtension = vscode.extensions.getExtension(jsDebugExtensionId);
        if (!jsDebugExtension) {
            console.error('js-debug extension not found');
            return;
        }
        await jsDebugExtension.activate(); // Ensure extension is activated
        const sessionId = 'YOUR_DEBUG_SESSION_ID'; // Replace with the actual session ID
        try {
            const cdpProxyInfo = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('extension.js-debug.requestCDPProxy', sessionId);
            if (cdpProxyInfo && typeof cdpProxyInfo === 'object' && 'host' in cdpProxyInfo && 'port' in cdpProxyInfo) {
                console.log('CDP Proxy Info:', cdpProxyInfo);
                // Proceed to connect to the WebSocket using cdpProxyInfo
                const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://${cdpProxyInfo.host}:${cdpProxyInfo.port}${cdpProxyInfo.path}`); // Include path here

                ws.onopen = () => {
                    console.log('WebSocket connected');
                    const command = { "id": 1, "method": "Runtime.evaluate", "params": { "expression": "console.log('CDP Command executed successfully!')" } };
                    ws.send(JSON.stringify(command));
                };

                ws.onmessage = (event) => {
                    console.log('WebSocket message received:', event.data);
                    ws.close();
                };

                ws.onclose = () => {
                    console.log('WebSocket closed');
                };

                ws.onerror = (error) => {
                    console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
                };


            } else {
                console.error('Failed to get CDP proxy info or invalid response:', cdpProxyInfo);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error requesting CDP proxy:', error);
        }
    }

    export function deactivate() {}
    ```
    **Note:** Replace `YOUR_DEBUG_SESSION_ID` with the actual debug session ID. You might need to find a way to dynamically get the session ID if it's not readily available. For testing purposes, a hardcoded valid session ID might suffice. Also, ensure you have installed the `ws` library using `npm install ws` in your test extension project if you are using Node.js for your test script. **Important**: The WebSocket URL should now include `cdpProxyInfo.path`.

    7. Run the extension/script created in step 6 within VSCode.
    8. Observe the output of the extension/script and the debugged session. If the WebSocket connection is successfully established and the CDP command is executed (as indicated by "CDP Command executed successfully!" in the debug console of the debugged session, or any other expected side-effect of the command), then the vulnerability is confirmed. If you encounter WebSocket errors or are unable to execute CDP commands, further investigation might be needed, but successful command execution demonstrates the vulnerability.
