### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Custom Template Loading

- Description:
    1. An attacker can configure the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting to point to a malicious file path.
    2. When the extension attempts to generate a docstring, it uses the configured `customTemplatePath` to load a template file.
    3. Due to insufficient validation of the `customTemplatePath`, an attacker can provide a path that traverses outside the workspace directory.
    4. The extension will then read and use the template from the attacker-controlled path, potentially leading to information disclosure if the attacker can control the content of the template file.

- Impact:
    - **High:**  An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the user's file system if the VSCode instance is running in a workspace that the attacker has some knowledge of the file structure. While the direct impact is limited by what an attacker can do with reading file content within the extension's context, information disclosure of sensitive data within the workspace is possible. In a more sophisticated attack scenario, if the attacker can somehow influence the execution context further based on the file read, the impact could escalate.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code attempts to check if the path is absolute and use `path.join(vs.workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath)` if it's relative, but this does not prevent path traversal if the provided path already contains traversal sequences like `../`.

    - Source code location: `/code/src/generate_docstring.ts`

    ```typescript
    if (!path.isAbsolute(customTemplatePath)) {
        customTemplatePath = path.join(vs.workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath);
    }

    return getCustomTemplate(customTemplatePath);
    ```
    - `/code/src/docstring/get_template.ts`

    ```typescript
    export function getCustomTemplate(templateFilePath: string): string {
        return readFileSync(templateFilePath, "utf8");
    }
    ```

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Path validation and sanitization:** Implement robust path validation to ensure that the `customTemplatePath` always resolves to a file within the user's workspace or extension's designated template directory. This could include:
        - Resolving the path to its absolute form.
        - Checking if the resolved path is within the workspace root using a function like `path.isWithinWorkspace(resolvedPath, workspaceRoot)`.
        - Sanitizing the path to remove path traversal sequences before attempting to read the file.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must configure the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting.
    - The attacker needs to have knowledge of the file system structure where the VSCode workspace is located to craft a valid path traversal string.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Configuration Retrieval:** In `/code/src/generate_docstring.ts`, the `getTemplate()` function retrieves the `customTemplatePath` from the VSCode workspace configuration.
    ```typescript
    private getTemplate(): string {
        const config = this.getConfig();
        let customTemplatePath = config.get("customTemplatePath").toString();
        ...
    ```
    2. **Path Handling:** If `customTemplatePath` is not empty, the code checks if it's absolute. If not, it attempts to make it absolute relative to `vs.workspace.rootPath`. However, this step is insufficient to prevent path traversal.
    ```typescript
        if (!path.isAbsolute(customTemplatePath)) {
            customTemplatePath = path.join(vs.workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath);
        }
    ```
    3. **Template Loading:** The `getCustomTemplate()` function in `/code/src/docstring/get_template.ts` is then called with the potentially attacker-controlled path.
    ```typescript
        return getCustomTemplate(customTemplatePath);
    }
    ```
    4. **File Reading:**  The `getCustomTemplate()` function uses `readFileSync` to read the file content from the provided path without any further validation. This allows reading any file that the VSCode process has permissions to access, based on the potentially manipulated path.
    ```typescript
    export function getCustomTemplate(templateFilePath: string): string {
        return readFileSync(templateFilePath, "utf8");
    }
    ```
    5. **Vulnerable Flow Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Configures customTemplatePath] --> B(getTemplate() in generate_docstring.ts);
        B --> C{isAbsolute(customTemplatePath)?};
        C -- No --> D[path.join(workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath)];
        C -- Yes --> D[customTemplatePath];
        D --> E(getCustomTemplate() in get_template.ts);
        E --> F[readFileSync(templateFilePath)];
        F --> G[Return Template Content];
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure you have a VSCode workspace open.
    2. **Set custom template path:** In VSCode settings for `autoDocstring`, set `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` to a path that traverses outside your workspace, for example:  `../../../.vscode/settings.json`.  (Note: adjust the number of `../` based on your workspace directory structure and where you want to traverse to. For testing, you can aim to read a known file outside the workspace but accessible by your user account).
    3. **Open a Python file:** Open a Python file in the workspace.
    4. **Place cursor below a function definition.**
    5. **Trigger docstring generation:**  Type `"""` and press Enter (if `generateDocstringOnEnter` is enabled) or use the command `Generate Docstring`.
    6. **Observe Error (or lack thereof):** If the vulnerability exists, the extension might attempt to read the file at the traversed path. Depending on the file content and how the extension handles errors, you might see an error message in the "autoDocstring" output channel, or the extension might fail silently.
    7. **Verify File Read (if possible):** To definitively prove file read, you could try to read a file with known content or a file that would cause a visible error if read (e.g., a very large file, or a non-text file if the extension expects text). If you can read `../../../.vscode/settings.json`, you will see the content of your VSCode settings in the output if logging was verbose enough, or you might be able to infer success by the absence of errors when a valid template would be expected.
    8. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable):** The extension attempts to read the file specified by the path traversal, potentially leading to information disclosure.
    9. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated):** The extension should either refuse to load the custom template and log an error indicating an invalid path, or gracefully fall back to a default template without attempting to read the file outside the workspace.
