### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal via Custom Template Path
- Description:
    1. An attacker can configure the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting to point to a file outside the currently opened VSCode workspace.
    2. When the user attempts to generate a docstring, the extension reads the file specified in `customTemplatePath` as a template.
    3. If the specified path points to a sensitive file outside the workspace, the extension will read and use this arbitrary file as a template.
    4. This can lead to information disclosure as the attacker can read the content of arbitrary files on the user's system that the VSCode process has access to. While the current implementation might lead to errors if the file is not a valid mustache template, the core issue is the ability to read arbitrary files.
- Impact: Information Disclosure. An attacker can potentially read any file on the user's system that the VSCode process has permissions to access.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The extension checks if the `customTemplatePath` is an absolute path using `path.isAbsolute`.
    - If the path is relative, it is resolved using `path.join(vs.workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath)`.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Path validation to ensure that the resolved `customTemplatePath` remains within the bounds of the `vs.workspace.rootPath`.
    - Implement a check to verify if the resolved template file path is within the workspace root directory. This could be achieved by ensuring that the resolved path starts with the workspace root path.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the "autoDocstring" extension installed in VSCode.
    - The user must configure the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting to a path pointing outside the currently opened workspace. This can be achieved through VSCode settings UI or by directly editing the settings.json file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `src/generate_docstring.ts`, the `getTemplate()` function is responsible for resolving and retrieving the docstring template.
    2. It retrieves the `customTemplatePath` from the extension's configuration:
        ```typescript
        let customTemplatePath = config.get("customTemplatePath").toString();
        ```
    3. It checks if the path is absolute. If not, it attempts to resolve it relative to the workspace root:
        ```typescript
        if (!path.isAbsolute(customTemplatePath)) {
            customTemplatePath = path.join(vs.workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath);
        }
        ```
    4. Finally, it calls `getCustomTemplate()` from `src/docstring/get_template.ts` to read the template file:
        ```typescript
        return getCustomTemplate(customTemplatePath);
        ```
    5. In `src/docstring/get_template.ts`, the `getCustomTemplate()` function directly reads the file content using `readFileSync` without any validation to ensure the path is within the workspace:
        ```typescript
        export function getCustomTemplate(templateFilePath: string): string {
            return readFileSync(templateFilePath, "utf8");
        }
        ```
    6. There is no check to verify that `customTemplatePath`, after being resolved, is actually within the workspace. This allows a malicious user to set `customTemplatePath` to an arbitrary file path outside the workspace, leading to arbitrary file read when the extension attempts to generate a docstring.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Open VSCode and create or open any Python project workspace.
    2. Open the VSCode settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
    3. Search for "autoDocstring customTemplatePath".
    4. In the "Auto Docstring: Custom Template Path" setting, enter an absolute path to a sensitive file on your system that is outside your current workspace. For example:
        - On Linux/macOS: `/etc/passwd`
        - On Windows: `C:\Windows\win.ini`
    5. Open a Python file within your workspace.
    6. Define a simple Python function (e.g., `def test_function(arg1): pass`).
    7. Place the text cursor on the line immediately below the function definition.
    8. Trigger the "Generate Docstring" command (e.g., by typing `"""` and pressing Enter if `autoDocstring.generateDocstringOnEnter` is enabled, or using the command palette).
    9. Observe the output. If the vulnerability is present, the extension might throw an error because `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\win.ini` is not a valid mustache template. However, the more critical issue is that the extension attempted to read this file.
    10. To further confirm the arbitrary file read, you could create a simple mustache template file outside your workspace (e.g., `/tmp/test_template.mustache` on Linux/macOS) with content like `User defined template: {{name}}`. Set `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` to this file and regenerate the docstring. If the docstring is generated using your custom template, it confirms that the extension is indeed reading files from arbitrary paths.
