### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal / Arbitrary File Read via Custom Template Path

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can configure the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting to point to a malicious file path, potentially outside the currently opened VSCode workspace. This configuration can be achieved by manipulating workspace settings, such as through a malicious repository or compromised settings file.
    2. When a user attempts to generate a docstring, the extension uses the configured `customTemplatePath` to load a template file.
    3. Due to insufficient validation of the `customTemplatePath`, an attacker can provide a path that traverses outside the workspace directory or points to an arbitrary file on the user's system.
    4. The extension will then read and use the template from the attacker-controlled path using Node's `readFileSync`, potentially leading to information disclosure if the attacker can control the content of the template file or read sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\win.ini`. The extension reads the file content verbatim without checking if it's within a trusted area.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:**  An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the user's file system if the VSCode instance is running in a workspace that the attacker has some knowledge of the file structure. Sensitive file contents outside of the intended directory may be read and inserted into the active editor. This may expose confidential information (e.g. system files or data not related to the project). While the direct impact is limited by what an attacker can do with reading file content within the extension's context, information disclosure of sensitive data within the workspace and potentially system files is possible. In a more sophisticated attack scenario, if the attacker can somehow influence the execution context further based on the file read, the impact could escalate.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code attempts to check if the path is absolute and use `path.join(vs.workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath)` if it's relative, but this does not prevent path traversal if the provided path already contains traversal sequences like `../`.
    - Source code location: `/code/src/generate_docstring.ts`

    ```typescript
    if (!path.isAbsolute(customTemplatePath)) {
        customTemplatePath = path.join(vs.workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath);
    }

    return getCustomTemplate(customTemplatePath);
    ```
    - `/code/src/docstring/get_template.ts`

    ```typescript
    export function getCustomTemplate(templateFilePath: string): string {
        return readFileSync(templateFilePath, "utf8");
    }
    ```
    - No validation or path restrictions are applied in the code that reads the custom template file.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Path validation and sanitization:** Implement robust path validation to ensure that the `customTemplatePath` always resolves to a file within the user's workspace or extension's designated template directory. This could include:
        - Resolving the path to its absolute form.
        - Checking if the resolved path is within the workspace root using a function like `path.isWithinWorkspace(resolvedPath, workspaceRoot)`.
        - Sanitizing the path to remove path traversal sequences before attempting to read the file.
    - Implement validation to constrain the `customTemplatePath` only to trusted directories (for example, relative to the project root).
    - Reject absolute paths or prompt the user for confirmation when the path points outside an allowed directory.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must configure the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting.
    - The attacker must be able to supply or change the workspace settings (for example, via a malicious repository or compromised settings file) that set `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` to an arbitrary file path.
    - The attacker needs to have knowledge of the file system structure where the VSCode workspace is located to craft a valid path traversal string.
    - The user must have the "autoDocstring" extension installed in VSCode.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Configuration Retrieval:** In `/code/src/generate_docstring.ts`, the `getTemplate()` function retrieves the `customTemplatePath` from the VSCode workspace configuration.
    ```typescript
    private getTemplate(): string {
        const config = this.getConfig();
        let customTemplatePath = config.get("customTemplatePath").toString();
        ...
    ```
    2. **Path Handling:** If `customTemplatePath` is not empty, the code checks if it's absolute. If not, it attempts to make it absolute relative to `vs.workspace.rootPath`. However, this step is insufficient to prevent path traversal.
    ```typescript
        if (!path.isAbsolute(customTemplatePath)) {
            customTemplatePath = path.join(vs.workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath);
        }
    ```
    3. **Template Loading:** The `getCustomTemplate()` function in `/code/src/docstring/get_template.ts` is then called with the potentially attacker-controlled path.
    ```typescript
        return getCustomTemplate(customTemplatePath);
    }
    ```
    4. **File Reading:**  The `getCustomTemplate()` function uses `readFileSync` to read the file content from the provided path without any further validation. This allows reading any file that the VSCode process has permissions to access, based on the potentially manipulated path.
    ```typescript
    export function getCustomTemplate(templateFilePath: string): string {
        return readFileSync(templateFilePath, "utf8");
    }
    ```
    5. **Vulnerable Flow Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Configures customTemplatePath] --> B(getTemplate() in generate_docstring.ts);
        B --> C{isAbsolute(customTemplatePath)?};
        C -- No --> D[path.join(workspace.rootPath, customTemplatePath)];
        C -- Yes --> D[customTemplatePath];
        D --> E(getCustomTemplate() in get_template.ts);
        E --> F[readFileSync(templateFilePath)];
        F --> G[Return Template Content];
    ```
    - In `src/generate_docstring.ts`, the function `getTemplate()` retrieves the configuration value for `customTemplatePath`.
    - In the absence of a check for allowed directories, if a relative path is provided, it is resolved against the workspace root (`vs.workspace.rootPath`).
    - The function `getCustomTemplate(templateFilePath)` immediately calls
    ```ts
    return readFileSync(templateFilePath, "utf8");
    ```
    without validating that the file lies within a trusted area.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure you have a VSCode workspace open and the "autoDocstring" extension installed.
    2. **Set custom template path:** In VSCode settings for `autoDocstring`, set `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` to a path that traverses outside your workspace, for example:  `../../../.vscode/settings.json` or an absolute path to a sensitive file such as `/etc/passwd` (Linux/macOS) or `C:\Windows\win.ini` (Windows).  (Note: adjust the number of `../` based on your workspace directory structure and where you want to traverse to. For testing, you can aim to read a known file outside the workspace but accessible by your user account). Alternatively, create or open a workspace that contains a settings file (e.g. `.vscode/settings.json`) with:  `{ "autoDocstring.customTemplatePath": "/etc/passwd" }`
    3. **Open a Python file:** Open a Python file in the workspace.
    4. **Place cursor below a function definition.**
    5. **Trigger docstring generation:**  Type `"""` and press Enter (if `generateDocstringOnEnter` is enabled) or use the command `Generate Docstring`.
    6. **Observe Error (or lack thereof):** If the vulnerability exists, the extension might attempt to read the file at the traversed path. Depending on the file content and how the extension handles errors, you might see an error message in the "autoDocstring" output channel, or the extension might fail silently.
    7. **Verify File Read (if possible):** To definitively prove file read, you could try to read a file with known content or a file that would cause a visible error if read (e.g., a very large file, or a non-text file if the extension expects text). If you can read `../../../.vscode/settings.json`, you will see the content of your VSCode settings in the output if logging was verbose enough, or you might be able to infer success by the absence of errors when a valid template would be expected. To further confirm, create a simple mustache template file outside your workspace (e.g., `/tmp/test_template.mustache` on Linux/macOS) with content like `User defined template: {{name}}`. Set `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` to this file and regenerate the docstring.
    8. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable):** The extension attempts to read the file specified by the path traversal, potentially leading to information disclosure. The generated docstring will contain the content of the arbitrary file, or the extension might throw an error due to invalid template format, but the attempt to read the file confirms the vulnerability.
    9. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated):** The extension should either refuse to load the custom template and log an error indicating an invalid path, or gracefully fall back to a default template without attempting to read the file outside the workspace.


- **Vulnerability Name:** Template and Snippet Injection via Malicious Custom Templates

- **Description:**
    1. The extension uses the [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) templating engine to generate docstrings.
    2. The global escaping for Mustache is disabled (via setting `Mustache.escape = (text: string) => text`), so a custom template file is rendered verbatim.
    3. An attacker who controls the custom template file (by supplying a malicious repository or modifying workspace settings) may introduce additional mustache tags or snippet placeholder syntax into the template.
    4. When the extension generates a docstring using this malicious custom template, the injected mustache tags or snippet placeholders are processed by the templating engine or VS Code's snippet engine.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** The generated docstring may include unexpected snippet constructs or injected placeholder text. In environments where snippet syntax is trusted, this could mislead the user or lead to further exploitation steps if downstream integrations evaluate the snippet content. The injected content is rendered unsanitized.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension uses a “logicless” templating engine (Mustache) but disables its escaping functionality, leaving injected content unsanitized.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Re-enable or incorporate context‐appropriate escaping/sanitization when rendering templates.
    - Validate the custom template file to ensure only expected placeholder constructs are present.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must control the custom template file (for example, by providing a malicious repository or by manipulating workspace settings so that `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` points to an attacker–controlled file).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `src/docstring/docstring_factory.ts`, the template passed into the factory is stored without sanitization.
    2. When generating the docstring, the code calls:
    ```ts
    let docstring = render(this.template, templateData);
    ```
    3. The global escape function for Mustache is disabled with
    ```ts
    Mustache.escape = (text: string) => text;
    ```
    allowing any embedded mustache tags or snippet syntax in the template to be rendered directly.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a custom template file (e.g. place it in the project or an attacker controlled location) that includes malicious snippet syntax, such as:
    ```
    {{#placeholder}}${{evil_placeholder}}{{/placeholder}}
    ```
    2. Set the workspace setting `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` to point to this file.
    3. Open a Python file and trigger the “Generate Docstring” command.
    4. Inspect the inserted docstring to confirm that the injected snippet payload appears, proving that unsanitized template injection occurred.


- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Information Disclosure via Detailed Error Logging

- **Description:**
    1. When docstring generation fails (for example, due to malformed function definitions or template errors), the extension’s error handling pathway is triggered.
    2. The error object is serialized using `JSON.stringify(error)`.
    3. A detailed stack trace is appended using `getStackTrace(error)`.
    4. This detailed error information, including absolute file paths, internal file locations, and complete stack traces, is written to the extension’s output log, even though users only see a generic error message in the UI.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** An attacker who can trigger such errors (for instance, by supplying a malformed Python file or a corrupted custom template) could force the extension to log detailed internal information. This information might expose system file paths and inner workings of the extension that can assist further targeted attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The user–facing error message is generic. However, detailed error information is still logged in the “autoDocstring” output channel without sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Sanitize error log contents by redacting or summarizing sensitive details before writing them to the output log.
    - Limit the verbosity of internal error log details, ensuring that absolute paths and internal stack frames are not exposed.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to cause an error in the docstring generation process (for example, by including a deliberately malformed function definition or corrupt custom template) so that the exception is caught and logged.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `src/extension.ts`, the registered command for `autoDocstring.generateDocstring` wraps the generation call in a try–catch block.
    2. On exception, the error is serialized using:
    ```ts
        const errorString = JSON.stringify(error);
        let stackTrace = "";
        if (error instanceof Error) {
            stackTrace = "\n\t" + getStackTrace(error);
        }
        return logError(errorString + stackTrace);
    ```
    3. The `getStackTrace` function in `src/telemetry.ts` iterates the error’s stack frames, extracting file names and line numbers with little sanitization, and this information is logged verbatim.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a Python file containing a deliberately malformed function definition (or otherwise trigger an error in template processing, e.g. by setting `customTemplatePath` to a non-mustache file).
    2. Trigger the “Generate Docstring” command to force an error.
    3. Open the “autoDocstring” output channel in VS Code.
    4. Verify that the log shows detailed internal error information (absolute file paths, internal stack traces, etc.) that could provide valuable information for an attacker. For example, the log should contain file paths from the user's system and potentially internal paths of the extension.
