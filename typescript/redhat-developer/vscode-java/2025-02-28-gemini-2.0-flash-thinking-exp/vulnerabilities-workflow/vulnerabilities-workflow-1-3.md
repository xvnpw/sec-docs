- vulnerability name: Gradle Wrapper Checksum Bypass Vulnerability
- description: |
    The VSCode Java extension allows users to specify allowed or disallowed SHA-256 checksums for Gradle Wrappers using the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting. However, if this setting is misconfigured or bypassed, a malicious actor could potentially provide a crafted Gradle Wrapper with a replaced `gradle-wrapper.jar`. This malicious wrapper could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine when the extension attempts to import or interact with a Gradle project.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. An attacker creates a malicious Gradle Wrapper distribution, replacing the legitimate `gradle-wrapper.jar` with a compromised version containing malicious code.
    2. The attacker entices a victim (VSCode Java extension user) to open a Java project that is configured to use this malicious Gradle Wrapper. This could be done by sharing a repository containing the project or by social engineering.
    3. If the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting is not properly configured to disallow this malicious wrapper's checksum, or if the checksum verification process is bypassed, the extension will proceed to use the malicious Gradle Wrapper when importing or building the project.
    4. Upon using the malicious Gradle Wrapper, the attacker's code within the compromised `gradle-wrapper.jar` will be executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
- impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially gaining full control of the system.
    - **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can steal sensitive data from the victim's machine, including source code, credentials, and personal information.
    - **Malware Installation:** The attacker can install malware on the victim's machine, leading to further compromise and persistent access.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** If the VSCode process runs with elevated privileges, the attacker can gain those elevated privileges.

- currently implemented mitigations: |
    The `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting allows users to define a list of allowed or disallowed SHA-256 checksums for Gradle Wrappers. This setting, if correctly configured, acts as a mitigation by preventing the extension from using wrappers with unverified or disallowed checksums.

    The code snippet from `README.md` shows:
    ```markdown
    * `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums`: Defines allowed/disallowed SHA-256 checksums of Gradle Wrappers.
    ```
- missing mitigations: |
    - **Strict Default Configuration:** The default configuration should be more secure. Instead of implicitly allowing all wrappers if the setting is not configured, the extension should, by default, disallow all wrappers unless explicitly allowed by the user. A whitelist approach would be more secure than a blacklist or implicit allow-all.
    - **Robust Checksum Verification:**  The checksum verification process needs to be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it cannot be bypassed by a malicious actor.  The code should enforce checksum verification and fail securely if verification fails.
    - **User Interface Warning:** If the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting is not configured, or if a wrapper's checksum is not found in the allowed list, the extension should display a prominent warning to the user, clearly indicating the potential security risk and prompting them to configure the setting. This warning should be more visible than just a setting description.
    - **Secure Default Checksums:** The extension could ship with a built-in, curated list of checksums for known safe Gradle Wrapper versions. This would provide a baseline of security out-of-the-box.
    - **Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits of the Gradle wrapper integration, especially the checksum verification logic, should be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- preconditions: |
    1. The victim has the VSCode Java extension installed.
    2. The victim opens a Java project that uses a malicious Gradle Wrapper.
    3. The `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting is either not configured, misconfigured or the checksum verification is bypassed.
- source code analysis: |
    The provided project files do not contain the source code for the Gradle wrapper checksum verification logic itself. This functionality is likely implemented within the `Eclipse &trade; JDT Language Server` project, as indicated in `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

    ```markdown
    vscode-java is a Visual Studio Code extension that uses a language server for its Java language
    smartness. Usually vscode-java features depend on the [Eclipse &trade; JDT Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls),
    (a.k.a. eclipse.jdt.ls) and the contributions should be coordinated between the two repositories.
    ```

    Therefore, to analyze the checksum verification logic, one would need to examine the source code of the `eclipse.jdt.ls` project, specifically looking for the implementation of the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting and the Gradle wrapper handling mechanisms.

    Without access to the relevant source code in `eclipse.jdt.ls`, a detailed step-by-step code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerability trigger is not possible from the provided PROJECT FILES alone.  However, based on the documentation and the nature of the feature, the vulnerability likely lies in how the extension handles or fails to handle cases where:

    1. The `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting is not defined.
    2. The checksum of a Gradle wrapper is not present in the allowed list defined in the setting.
    3. The checksum verification process itself has a flaw, allowing a malicious wrapper to pass verification.
- security test case: |
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install VSCode and the Java Extension.
        - Create a simple Java project with Gradle.
        - Configure the project to use Gradle Wrapper.
    2. **Prepare Malicious Gradle Wrapper:**
        - Download a legitimate Gradle Wrapper.
        - Extract the `gradle-wrapper.jar` from the downloaded wrapper.
        - Create a new `gradle-wrapper.jar` with malicious code injected. This malicious code could be designed to simply display a message or perform more harmful actions like creating a file or sending network requests.
        - Replace the legitimate `gradle-wrapper.jar` in the downloaded wrapper distribution with the malicious one.
        - Calculate the SHA-256 checksum of the *original* legitimate `gradle-wrapper.jar`.
    3. **Configure VSCode Settings (Vulnerable Scenario):**
        - Ensure the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting is either not set or is configured in a way that would *allow* the malicious wrapper (e.g., by whitelisting the checksum of the legitimate wrapper, but not explicitly disallowing others).
    4. **Trigger Project Import:**
        - Open the Java project in VSCode.
        - Observe if the malicious code in the crafted `gradle-wrapper.jar` gets executed during project import or Gradle task execution.  You can verify this by looking for the output of the malicious code (e.g., the displayed message, created file, or network request).
    5. **Configure VSCode Settings (Mitigated Scenario - Expected Behavior):**
        - Configure the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting to *disallow* the checksum of the malicious wrapper (e.g., by blacklisting checksums or only whitelisting specific, known-good checksums, *excluding* the malicious wrapper's checksum).
    6. **Retry Project Import:**
        - Re-open the Java project in VSCode.
        - Observe if the extension now *prevents* the use of the malicious Gradle Wrapper, ideally by showing an error message related to checksum verification failure and refusing to import the project or execute Gradle tasks. The malicious code should *not* be executed in this scenario.

    **Expected Result (Vulnerable Scenario):** The malicious code within the crafted `gradle-wrapper.jar` is executed when the project is opened or Gradle tasks are run, indicating a vulnerability.

    **Expected Result (Mitigated Scenario):** VSCode Java extension detects that the Gradle Wrapper is not trusted (due to checksum mismatch against allowed checksums or absence of allowed checksums by default and no explicit user trust). The extension refuses to use the wrapper, preventing the malicious code from executing and showing a security warning or error to the user.

    **Note:** This test case assumes the attacker can successfully deliver the malicious Gradle Wrapper to the victim and that the victim will open a project using it. The focus of the test is to verify the checksum verification mechanism within the VSCode Java extension and whether it can be bypassed, not the delivery method.
