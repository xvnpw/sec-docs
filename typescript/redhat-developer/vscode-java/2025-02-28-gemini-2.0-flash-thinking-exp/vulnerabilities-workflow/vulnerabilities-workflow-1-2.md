### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Execution via `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` user setting
  - Description:
    1. An attacker can modify the `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting in the workspace configuration of a VSCode project.
    2. The `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting allows users to provide extra VM arguments to the Java Language Server.
    3. By crafting malicious VM arguments, an attacker can inject arbitrary JVM options, including `-javaagent`, which can execute arbitrary code when the Java Language Server starts.
    4. When a user opens a workspace containing this malicious setting, the Java Language Server starts with the injected VM arguments, leading to arbitrary command execution.
  - Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode instance. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malicious activities.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Workspace trust is partially implemented. The extension prompts a warning message if `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` in workspace settings includes `-javaagent`. User can choose to disallow the setting. See `src/settings.ts:checkJavaPreferences`.
    - The extension checks if the javagent path is within the workspace folders. See `src/settings.ts:isInWorkspaceFolder`.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation of `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting to prevent injection of malicious arguments.
    - Restrict the scope of `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` to user settings only, preventing workspace-level overrides.
    - Completely disallow `-javaagent` and other potentially dangerous JVM options in workspace settings.
  - Preconditions:
    - The user opens a workspace with a malicious `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting.
    - User must "Allow" the unsafe `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting if prompted by the workspace trust mechanism, or workspace trust must be disabled.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `src/settings.ts:checkJavaPreferences`, the extension checks for `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting.
    2. It uses `getJavaagentFlag` to detect if `-javaagent` is present in the settings.
    3. If `-javaagent` is found and workspace is untrusted, it prompts a warning message.
    4. The `parseVMargs` function in `src/javaServerStarter.ts` parses the `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting and adds them as arguments to the Java Language Server process.
    5. **Vulnerability:** The `parseVMargs` function does not perform any sanitization or validation on the VM arguments, allowing arbitrary JVM options to be passed directly to the Java Language Server. This includes `-javaagent`.
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/javaServerStarter.ts
    export function parseVMargs(params: any[], vmargsLine: string) {
        if (!vmargsLine) {
            return;
        }
        const vmargs = vmargsLine.match(/(?:[^\s"]+|"[^"]*")+/g);
        if (vmargs === null) {
            return;
        }
        vmargs.forEach(arg => {
            // remove all standalone double quotes
            arg = arg.replace(/(\\)?"/g, ($0, $1) => { return ($1 ? $0 : ''); });
            // unescape all escaped double quotes
            arg = arg.replace(/(\\)"/g, '"');
            params.push(arg);
        });
    }
    ```
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Create a `.vscode` folder in the workspace root.
    3. Create a `settings.json` file inside the `.vscode` folder with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "java.jdt.ls.vmargs": "-javaagent:malicious.jar"
    }
    ```
    4. Create a malicious Java agent `malicious.jar`. This jar should contain a Java agent that executes a reverse shell or any other malicious command. For example, using `ProcessBuilder` and `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`.
    5. Place `malicious.jar` in the workspace root (or any path).
    6. Open the workspace in VSCode.
    7. If prompted with "Security Warning!", click "Allow".
    8. Observe that the malicious code in `malicious.jar` is executed when the Java Language Server starts. For example, check for a reverse shell connection or a modified file system.

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in `java.format.settings.url` and `java.settings.url` settings
  - Description:
    1. The extension allows users to specify URLs or file paths for `java.format.settings.url` and `java.settings.url` settings.
    2. These settings are used to load Eclipse formatter settings and workspace Java settings respectively.
    3. An attacker could craft a malicious workspace configuration that includes a path traversal sequence in these settings, such as `../`, to access files outside the intended workspace scope.
    4. When VSCode loads the workspace with these malicious settings, the extension might attempt to access and load files from arbitrary locations based on the user-provided path traversal.
  - Impact: Potential information disclosure by reading arbitrary files from the user's file system, depending on the file access permissions of the VSCode process.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None specific to path traversal in these settings are mentioned in the provided files.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation of `java.format.settings.url` and `java.settings.url` to prevent path traversal sequences.
    - Restrict file access to only within the workspace or extension-defined directories when loading settings from file paths.
    - Consider using secure file path handling methods to prevent traversal.
  - Preconditions:
    - The user opens a workspace with a malicious `java.format.settings.url` or `java.settings.url` setting containing path traversal characters.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `src/settings.ts:openFormatter`, the extension handles `java.format.settings.url`.
    2. The `getPath` function resolves the path.
    3. The code checks if the path is remote using `isRemote` but doesn't have specific checks for path traversal sequences in local file paths.
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/settings.ts
    function getPath(f) {
        if (workspace.workspaceFolders && !path.isAbsolute(f)) {
            workspace.workspaceFolders.forEach(wf => { // Iterates over workspace folders
                const file = path.resolve(wf.uri.path, f); // Resolves path relative to workspace folder
                if (fs.existsSync(file)) { // Checks if file exists
                    return file; // Returns file path if it exists within workspace folders
                }
            });
        } else {
            return path.resolve(f); // Resolves path as absolute path
        }
        return null; // Returns null if file not found within workspace folders or as absolute path
    }
    ```
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Create a `.vscode` folder in the workspace root.
    3. Create a `settings.json` file inside the `.vscode` folder with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "java.format.settings.url": "../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"
    }
    ```
    4. Open the workspace in VSCode.
    5. Trigger the "Java: Open Java Formatter Settings" command.
    6. Observe if the extension attempts to read and display the content of `/etc/passwd` or throws an error indicating a path traversal attempt. (Note: the success of reading `/etc/passwd` depends on file permissions).
