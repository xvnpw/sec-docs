## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: **Unsafe Deserialization via `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` Setting**
  - Description:
    1. An attacker can modify the workspace settings for the `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting.
    2. This setting allows users to provide extra VM arguments used to launch the Java Language Server.
    3. A malicious attacker can inject a VM argument that leverages Java deserialization vulnerabilities, such as using `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.registry.builder=...` to point to a malicious RMI registry builder.
    4. When the VSCode Java extension starts the Java Language Server, it will use these VM arguments.
    5. If a deserialization gadget chain is present in the classpath of the Java Language Server (which is highly likely given it's based on Eclipse JDT), the attacker can achieve remote code execution when the Language Server starts.
  - Impact: Remote code execution on the machine running VSCode.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The extension checks for workspace trust before applying workspace settings. However, this only prompts the user to trust the workspace, and if the user trusts the workspace (or if workspace trust is not enabled/bypassed), the vulnerability is still exploitable.
    - The extension checks for `javaagent` flags in `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` and prompts for user confirmation if found in workspace settings, but this mitigation does not cover other deserialization vectors.
    - The extension attempts to validate `java.home` and `java.jdt.ls.java.home` settings against minimum JRE requirements.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization or validation of the `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting to prevent injection of dangerous VM arguments.
    - Disabling or warning against the use of `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` in untrusted workspaces.
    - Running the Language Server in a sandbox with restricted permissions.
  - Preconditions:
    1. Workspace trust is enabled but the user trusts a malicious workspace, or workspace trust is disabled/bypassed.
    2. The attacker has the ability to modify workspace settings (e.g., by sharing a malicious workspace configuration file).
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/settings.ts`
    2. Function: `checkJavaPreferences(context: ExtensionContext)`
    3. Line: 222-243: This section checks for workspace trust and user confirmation for `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` if it contains `-javaagent` flags. However, it does not prevent other forms of malicious VM arguments.
    4. Function: `prepareParams(requirements: RequirementsData, workspacePath, context: ExtensionContext, isSyntaxServer: boolean)` in `/code/src/javaServerStarter.ts`
    5. Line: 87-101: This function retrieves the `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting and parses it into VM arguments for the Java Language Server. There is no sanitization or validation of the content of `vmargs` before passing it to the Java runtime.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious workspace configuration file (`.vscode/settings.json`) with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "java.jdt.ls.vmargs": "-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.registry.builder=org.example.MaliciousBuilder"
    }
    ```
    (Note: `org.example.MaliciousBuilder` is just an example, a real exploit would require a valid gadget chain and builder class).
    2. Create a Java project in VSCode and open the malicious workspace configuration file within it.
    3. Trust the workspace if prompted.
    4. Observe that when the Java Language Server starts, the malicious VM argument will be used.
    5. If a suitable deserialization exploit is crafted and placed in the classpath of the Java Language Server, code execution can be achieved.
