## Combined Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: **Remote Code Execution via Malicious `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` Setting (Unsafe Deserialization and Arbitrary Command Execution)**
  - Description:
    1. An attacker can modify the `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting in the workspace configuration of a VSCode project. This setting allows users to provide extra VM arguments used to launch the Java Language Server.
    2. By crafting malicious VM arguments, an attacker can inject arbitrary JVM options. This includes leveraging Java deserialization vulnerabilities or using `-javaagent` to execute arbitrary code when the Java Language Server starts.
    3. For deserialization attacks, a malicious attacker can inject a VM argument such as `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.registry.builder=...` to point to a malicious RMI registry builder. If a deserialization gadget chain is present in the classpath of the Java Language Server, remote code execution can be achieved.
    4. For arbitrary command execution via `-javaagent`, an attacker can inject a VM argument like `-javaagent:malicious.jar`. This allows execution of arbitrary code within a malicious Java agent when the Language Server starts.
    5. When a user opens a workspace containing this malicious setting, the Java Language Server starts with the injected VM arguments, leading to remote code execution on the user's machine.
  - Impact: Remote code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode instance. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, or further malicious activities.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The extension checks for workspace trust before applying workspace settings. However, this only prompts the user to trust the workspace, and if the user trusts the workspace (or if workspace trust is not enabled/bypassed), the vulnerability is still exploitable.
    - The extension checks for `javaagent` flags in `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` and prompts for user confirmation if found in workspace settings. See `src/settings.ts:checkJavaPreferences`. User can choose to disallow the setting.
    - The extension checks if the javagent path is within the workspace folders. See `src/settings.ts:isInWorkspaceFolder`.
    - The extension attempts to validate `java.home` and `java.jdt.ls.java.home` settings against minimum JRE requirements.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation of the `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting to prevent injection of malicious arguments, including both deserialization gadgets and `-javaagent` flags, and other potentially dangerous JVM options.
    - Disabling or warning against the use of `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` in untrusted workspaces more aggressively than just prompting for `-javaagent`.
    - Restrict the scope of `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` to user settings only, preventing workspace-level overrides.
    - Completely disallow `-javaagent` and other potentially dangerous JVM options in workspace settings.
    - Running the Language Server in a sandbox with restricted permissions.
  - Preconditions:
    1. Workspace trust is enabled but the user trusts a malicious workspace, or workspace trust is disabled/bypassed.
    2. The attacker has the ability to modify workspace settings (e.g., by sharing a malicious workspace configuration file).
    3. For `-javaagent` exploitation, the user must "Allow" the unsafe `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting if prompted by the workspace trust mechanism, or workspace trust must be disabled.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/settings.ts`
    2. Function: `checkJavaPreferences(context: ExtensionContext)`
    3. Line: 222-243: This section checks for workspace trust and user confirmation for `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` if it contains `-javaagent` flags. However, it does not prevent other forms of malicious VM arguments, such as those used for deserialization exploits.
    4. Function: `prepareParams(requirements: RequirementsData, workspacePath, context: ExtensionContext, isSyntaxServer: boolean)` in `/code/src/javaServerStarter.ts`
    5. Line: 87-101: This function retrieves the `java.jdt.ls.vmargs` setting and parses it into VM arguments for the Java Language Server. There is no sanitization or validation of the content of `vmargs` before passing it to the Java runtime.
    6. Function: `parseVMargs(params: any[], vmargsLine: string)` in `/code/src/javaServerStarter.ts`
    7. ```typescript
        // File: /code/src/javaServerStarter.ts
        export function parseVMargs(params: any[], vmargsLine: string) {
            if (!vmargsLine) {
                return;
            }
            const vmargs = vmargsLine.match(/(?:[^\s"]+|"[^"]*")+/g);
            if (vmargs === null) {
                return;
            }
            vmargs.forEach(arg => {
                // remove all standalone double quotes
                arg = arg.replace(/(\\)?"/g, ($0, $1) => { return ($1 ? $0 : ''); });
                // unescape all escaped double quotes
                arg = arg.replace(/(\\)"/g, '"');
                params.push(arg);
            });
        }
        ```
    8. **Vulnerability:** The `parseVMargs` function does not perform any sanitization or validation on the VM arguments, allowing arbitrary JVM options to be passed directly to the Java Language Server. This includes `-javaagent` and arguments for deserialization exploits.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Deserialization Exploit Test Case:**
        1. Create a malicious workspace configuration file (`.vscode/settings.json`) with the following content:
            ```json
            {
                "java.jdt.ls.vmargs": "-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.registry.builder=org.example.MaliciousBuilder"
            }
            ```
            (Note: `org.example.MaliciousBuilder` is just an example, a real exploit would require a valid gadget chain and builder class within the classpath of the Java Language Server).
        2. Create a Java project in VSCode and open the malicious workspace configuration file within it.
        3. Trust the workspace if prompted.
        4. Observe that when the Java Language Server starts, the malicious VM argument will be used.
        5. If a suitable deserialization exploit is crafted and placed in the classpath of the Java Language Server, code execution can be achieved.

    2. **`-javaagent` Exploit Test Case:**
        1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
        2. Create a `.vscode` folder in the workspace root.
        3. Create a `settings.json` file inside the `.vscode` folder with the following content:
            ```json
            {
                "java.jdt.ls.vmargs": "-javaagent:malicious.jar"
            }
            ```
        4. Create a malicious Java agent `malicious.jar`. This jar should contain a Java agent that executes a reverse shell or any other malicious command. For example, using `ProcessBuilder` and `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`.
        5. Place `malicious.jar` in the workspace root (or any path).
        6. Open the workspace in VSCode.
        7. If prompted with "Security Warning!", click "Allow".
        8. Observe that the malicious code in `malicious.jar` is executed when the Java Language Server starts. For example, check for a reverse shell connection or a modified file system.

- Vulnerability Name: **Path Traversal in `java.format.settings.url` and `java.settings.url` settings**
  - Description:
    1. The extension allows users to specify URLs or file paths for `java.format.settings.url` and `java.settings.url` settings.
    2. These settings are used to load Eclipse formatter settings and workspace Java settings respectively.
    3. An attacker could craft a malicious workspace configuration that includes a path traversal sequence in these settings, such as `../`, to access files outside the intended workspace scope.
    4. When VSCode loads the workspace with these malicious settings, the extension might attempt to access and load files from arbitrary locations based on the user-provided path traversal.
  - Impact: Potential information disclosure by reading arbitrary files from the user's file system, depending on the file access permissions of the VSCode process.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None specific to path traversal in these settings are mentioned in the provided files.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation of `java.format.settings.url` and `java.settings.url` to prevent path traversal sequences.
    - Restrict file access to only within the workspace or extension-defined directories when loading settings from file paths.
    - Consider using secure file path handling methods to prevent traversal.
  - Preconditions:
    - The user opens a workspace with a malicious `java.format.settings.url` or `java.settings.url` setting containing path traversal characters.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    1. In `src/settings.ts:openFormatter`, the extension handles `java.format.settings.url`.
    2. The `getPath` function resolves the path.
    3. The code checks if the path is remote using `isRemote` but doesn't have specific checks for path traversal sequences in local file paths.
    4. ```typescript
        // File: /code/src/settings.ts
        function getPath(f) {
            if (workspace.workspaceFolders && !path.isAbsolute(f)) {
                workspace.workspaceFolders.forEach(wf => { // Iterates over workspace folders
                    const file = path.resolve(wf.uri.path, f); // Resolves path relative to workspace folder
                    if (fs.existsSync(file)) { // Checks if file exists
                        return file; // Returns file path if it exists within workspace folders
                    }
                });
            } else {
                return path.resolve(f); // Resolves path as absolute path
            }
            return null; // Returns null if file not found within workspace folders or as absolute path
        }
        ```
    5. **Vulnerability:** The `getPath` function, while attempting to resolve paths within workspace folders, still uses `path.resolve()` which can be vulnerable to path traversal if the input `f` contains `../` sequences, especially when handling absolute paths or when workspace folder checks are bypassed or insufficient.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Create a `.vscode` folder in the workspace root.
    3. Create a `settings.json` file inside the `.vscode` folder with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "java.format.settings.url": "../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"
        }
        ```
    4. Open the workspace in VSCode.
    5. Trigger the "Java: Open Java Formatter Settings" command.
    6. Observe if the extension attempts to read and display the content of `/etc/passwd` or throws an error indicating a path traversal attempt. (Note: the success of reading `/etc/passwd` depends on file permissions).

- Vulnerability Name: **Gradle Wrapper Checksum Bypass Vulnerability**
- Description:
    1. The VSCode Java extension allows users to specify allowed or disallowed SHA-256 checksums for Gradle Wrappers using the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting.
    2. If this setting is misconfigured or bypassed, a malicious actor could provide a crafted Gradle Wrapper with a replaced `gradle-wrapper.jar`.
    3. This malicious wrapper could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine when the extension attempts to import or interact with a Gradle project.
    4. An attacker entices a victim (VSCode Java extension user) to open a Java project that is configured to use this malicious Gradle Wrapper.
    5. If the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting is not properly configured to disallow this malicious wrapper's checksum, or if the checksum verification process is bypassed, the extension will proceed to use the malicious Gradle Wrapper when importing or building the project.
    6. Upon using the malicious Gradle Wrapper, the attacker's code within the compromised `gradle-wrapper.jar` will be executed on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
- Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, Malware Installation, Privilege Escalation. The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially gaining full control of the system, stealing sensitive data, installing malware, or escalating privileges.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting allows users to define a list of allowed or disallowed SHA-256 checksums for Gradle Wrappers. This setting, if correctly configured, acts as a mitigation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Strict Default Configuration:** Default to disallowing all wrappers unless explicitly allowed by the user (whitelist approach).
    - **Robust Checksum Verification:** Thoroughly review and ensure the checksum verification process cannot be bypassed. Enforce checksum verification and fail securely if verification fails.
    - **User Interface Warning:** Display a prominent warning if the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting is not configured or if a wrapper's checksum is not in the allowed list.
    - **Secure Default Checksums:** Ship with a built-in, curated whitelist of checksums for known safe Gradle Wrapper versions.
    - **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Gradle wrapper integration and checksum verification logic.
- Preconditions:
    1. The victim has the VSCode Java extension installed.
    2. The victim opens a Java project that uses a malicious Gradle Wrapper.
    3. The `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting is either not configured, misconfigured, or the checksum verification is bypassed.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The source code for the Gradle wrapper checksum verification logic is likely within the `eclipse.jdt.ls` project.
    - Detailed code analysis requires examining the `eclipse.jdt.ls` source code, specifically for the implementation of `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` and Gradle wrapper handling.
    - Without access to `eclipse.jdt.ls` source code, pinpointing the vulnerability trigger within the provided project files is not possible. The vulnerability likely lies in handling cases where the `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` setting is not defined, checksum is not in the allowed list, or the checksum verification process itself is flawed.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Install VSCode and Java Extension; create a simple Java project with Gradle using Gradle Wrapper.
    2. **Prepare Malicious Gradle Wrapper:** Replace `gradle-wrapper.jar` in a legitimate Gradle Wrapper distribution with a malicious one containing code execution. Calculate the SHA-256 checksum of the *original* legitimate `gradle-wrapper.jar`.
    3. **Configure VSCode Settings (Vulnerable Scenario):** Ensure `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` is not set or allows the malicious wrapper (e.g., whitelisting the legitimate wrapper's checksum but not disallowing others).
    4. **Trigger Project Import:** Open the Java project in VSCode and observe if malicious code executes during project import or Gradle task execution.
    5. **Configure VSCode Settings (Mitigated Scenario - Expected Behavior):** Configure `java.imports.gradle.wrapper.checksums` to *disallow* the malicious wrapper's checksum (e.g., blacklist or whitelist excluding the malicious wrapper).
    6. **Retry Project Import:** Re-open the project and observe if the extension prevents the use of the malicious Gradle Wrapper and shows an error. Malicious code should not execute.

    **Expected Result (Vulnerable Scenario):** Malicious code executes, indicating vulnerability.
    **Expected Result (Mitigated Scenario):** Extension prevents malicious wrapper use, showing security warning/error, indicating mitigation works.
