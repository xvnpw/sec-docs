- vulnerability name: Gradle Arguments Injection
- description: |
  The `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting in the VSCode Java extension allows users to specify command-line arguments that are passed to Gradle during project import and build processes. An external attacker, if they can somehow manipulate this setting, could inject malicious Gradle commands. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when the extension interacts with a Gradle project.

  To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker would need to:
  1. Find a way to modify the VSCode settings, specifically `java.import.gradle.arguments`. This could potentially be achieved by exploiting another vulnerability in VSCode or by tricking a user into manually changing the setting.
  2. Once the setting is modified, the next time the user opens a Java project that uses Gradle, or reloads the project, the injected arguments will be passed to the Gradle command.
  3. If the injected arguments contain malicious Gradle tasks or scripts, they will be executed by Gradle with the privileges of the user running VSCode.

- impact: |
  High. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions. The impact is severe as it allows for complete compromise of the development environment.
- vulnerability rank: high
- currently implemented mitigations: |
  None. Based on the analyzed files, there are no implemented mitigations for this vulnerability. The project does not currently implement any input validation or sanitization for the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting. The extension directly passes the user-provided arguments to the Gradle command-line interface. There are no checks in place to prevent the injection of malicious commands. The files provided in this batch (`/code/src/refactoring/changeSignaturePanel.ts`, `/code/src/refactoring/extractInterface.ts`, `/code/test/runtest.ts`, `/code/test/common.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/rename.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/projects.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/extension.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/utils.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/index.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/codeActionProvider.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/publicApi.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/gotoSuperImplementation.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/snippetCompletionProvider.test.ts`, `/code/test/lightweight-mode-suite/extension.test.ts`, `/code/test/lightweight-mode-suite/index.ts`, `/code/test/lightweight-mode-suite/publicApi.test.ts`) do not include any code changes that would mitigate this vulnerability. Therefore, the vulnerability is still present and unmitigated.
- missing mitigations: |
  - Input validation and sanitization: Implement robust input validation for the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting to prevent the injection of malicious commands. Only allow expected and safe arguments.
  - Restrict setting scope: Consider restricting the scope of this setting to prevent modification by untrusted sources or extensions. Implement proper settings management with user consent mechanisms for sensitive settings.
  - User warnings: Display clear warnings to the user when potentially dangerous settings like `java.import.gradle.arguments` are modified, especially if the modification is done by an external source.
- preconditions: |
  - An attacker must be able to modify the VSCode setting `java.import.gradle.arguments`.
  - A user must open a Java project that uses Gradle within VSCode after the setting has been maliciously modified.
- source code analysis: |
  After reviewing the provided files (`/code/src/refactoring/changeSignaturePanel.ts`, `/code/src/refactoring/extractInterface.ts`, `/code/test/runtest.ts`, `/code/test/common.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/rename.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/projects.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/extension.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/utils.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/index.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/codeActionProvider.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/publicApi.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/gotoSuperImplementation.test.ts`, `/code/test/standard-mode-suite/snippetCompletionProvider.test.ts`, `/code/test/lightweight-mode-suite/extension.test.ts`, `/code/test/lightweight-mode-suite/index.ts`, `/code/test/lightweight-mode-suite/publicApi.test.ts`), no code related to sanitizing or validating the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting is present. The newly added files focus on refactoring functionalities (`changeSignaturePanel.ts`, `extractInterface.ts`), test infrastructure (`runtest.ts`, `common.ts`, `index.ts`), and various test cases for different features like rename, project operations, extension functionalities, utilities, code action providers, public API, goto super implementation, and snippet completion provider.

  Specifically, `changeSignaturePanel.ts` and `extractInterface.ts` introduce webview panels and quick pick menus for refactoring operations, but they do not interact with or modify VSCode settings related to Gradle arguments. The test files define and execute tests for existing features and do not introduce new functionalities or security measures.

  Therefore, none of these files contain any logic that would address or mitigate the Gradle arguments injection vulnerability. The extension continues to rely on user-provided settings without proper validation.

  The vulnerability flow remains unchanged:

  ```
  [Attacker Modifies Setting: java.import.gradle.arguments] --> [VSCode Java Extension Reads Setting] --> [Extension Executes Gradle CLI with Injected Arguments] --> [Gradle Executes Malicious Commands]
  ```

  This batch of files does not introduce any mitigations. The Gradle arguments injection vulnerability is still present and unmitigated.
- security test case: |
  1. **Attacker Setup (Manual Setting Modification):**
     - Open Visual Studio Code.
     - Open the Settings UI (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings on macOS).
     - Navigate to "Extensions" and then find "Java" extension settings.
     - Search for `java.import.gradle.arguments`.
     - In the "Value" field for `java.import.gradle.arguments`, enter the following malicious argument: `--init-script=malicious.gradle`

  2. **Create Malicious Gradle Init Script:**
     - Create a new file named `malicious.gradle` in a temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp/malicious.gradle` on Linux/macOS or `C:\temp\malicious.gradle` on Windows).
     - Add the following content to `malicious.gradle` (this is a simple example, more harmful commands could be used):
       ```gradle
       println "Vulnerable VSCode Java Extension Detected!"
       task maliciousTask {
           doLast {
               println "Executing malicious task..."
               // Example: Print the current user's name (can be replaced with more harmful commands)
               def userName = System.getProperty("user.name")
               println "Current User: " + userName
           }
       }
       ```

  3. **Open a Java Project with Gradle:**
     - Open a folder in VSCode that contains a `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file (a typical Java Gradle project). If you don't have one, you can create a simple Gradle project.
     - VSCode Java extension should attempt to import the Gradle project automatically.

  4. **Observe for Malicious Output:**
     - Open the VSCode Output panel (View -> Output).
     - In the Output panel dropdown, select "Java Language Server".
     - Check the "Java Language Server" output for the following lines, which would indicate successful command injection:
       ```
       Vulnerable VSCode Java Extension Detected!
       Executing malicious task...
       Current User: <Your User Name>
       ```
     - If you see these messages, it confirms that the malicious Gradle init script provided through `java.import.gradle.arguments` was executed by the VSCode Java extension during project import, demonstrating the vulnerability.

     **Note:** This test case assumes manual modification of settings for demonstration purposes. A real attacker scenario would involve finding an automated way to modify these settings, possibly through another vulnerability.
