# Combined Vulnerability List

## Vulnerability 1: Insecure Download of JDT Language Server Binary in Build and Test Workflows

- **Description:**
  The VSCode Java extension downloads the JDT Language Server binary over an unencrypted HTTP connection during build and test workflows and when the gulp build script `gulpfile.js` is executed. This insecure protocol is susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker positioned on an insecure network can intercept the HTTP request and replace the legitimate JDT Language Server binary or snapshot with a malicious one.

  *Triggering Steps:*
  1. The attacker positions themselves on a network where traffic is unencrypted, such as a public Wi-Fi hotspot, or compromises the network (e.g., through DNS spoofing).
  2. A developerâ€™s machine or a Continuous Integration (CI) environment initiates a download of the JDT Language Server binary or snapshot over HTTP. This occurs during execution of gulp tasks like `download_server` or `build_or_download` or in other build and test-related scripts.
  3. The attacker intercepts the HTTP request to `download.eclipse.org/jdtls/snapshots/jdt-language-server-latest.tar.gz` or similar endpoints.
  4. The attacker replaces the legitimate binary or snapshot with a malicious one containing injected code.
  5. When the extension loads and executes the downloaded JDT Language Server binary, the injected malicious payload is executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

- **Impact:**
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the VSCode extension host. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system.
    - Compromise of the user's workspace, enabling the attacker to steal sensitive information, modify project files, or inject further malware.
    - Unauthorized operations and data exfiltration from connected systems.
    - Lateral movement within the compromised network.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical (Initially ranked as High in one report, but due to potential for RCE, Critical is more appropriate)

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  Parts of the build and release pipelines outside of specific gulp tasks and CI workflows enforce the use of HTTPS URLs. However, critical locations responsible for downloading the JDT Language Server binary, such as the `download_server_fn` gulp task in `gulpfile.js`, still utilize HTTP. Therefore, for these vulnerable paths, no effective mitigations are currently implemented.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  To fully mitigate this vulnerability, the following measures are necessary:
    - **Replace HTTP with HTTPS:**  All HTTP endpoints used for downloading the JDT Language Server binary or snapshot must be replaced with secure HTTPS endpoints. Specifically, the download URL in `gulpfile.js` should be changed to `https://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/snapshots/jdt-language-server-latest.tar.gz` and similar changes should be applied to all other relevant build and test scripts.
    - **Implement Integrity Checks:**  Integrity checks must be implemented to ensure that the downloaded JDT Language Server binary or snapshot has not been tampered with during transit. This can be achieved through:
        - **Checksum Verification:** Calculate and verify a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA256) of the downloaded file against a known, trusted checksum.
        - **Digital Signatures:** Verify a digital signature of the downloaded file using a trusted public key from the JDT Language Server project.

- **Preconditions:**
  The following preconditions must be met for this vulnerability to be exploitable:
    - The developer or build process executes the vulnerable gulp tasks (`download_server`, `build_or_download`) or other build/test workflows that trigger the HTTP download.
    - The machine performing the download (developer's machine or CI runner) is connected to a network where HTTP traffic can be intercepted and modified by an attacker. This includes insecure networks like public Wi-Fi or compromised networks susceptible to MITM attacks.
    - The attacker has the capability to intercept and modify HTTP traffic directed towards the download URL (`download.eclipse.org/jdtls/snapshots/jdt-language-server-latest.tar.gz` or similar).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - **File:** `/code/gulpfile.js`
  - ```javascript
    const fse = require('fs-extra');
    const download = require('download');
    const decompress = require('gulp-decompress');
    const gulp = require('gulp');

    const JDT_LS_SNAPSHOT_URL = "http://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/snapshots/jdt-language-server-latest.tar.gz" // Vulnerable HTTP URL

    function download_server_fn(){
        fse.removeSync('./server');
        download(JDT_LS_SNAPSHOT_URL) // Insecure HTTP download
            .pipe(decompress())
            .pipe(gulp.dest('./server'));
    }

    gulp.task('download_server', download_server_fn)
    gulp.task('build_or_download', gulp.series(download_server_fn, 'compile'));
    ```
  - **Analysis:**
    The `download_server_fn` function within the `gulpfile.js` is responsible for downloading the JDT Language Server snapshot. It utilizes the `JDT_LS_SNAPSHOT_URL` constant, which is defined using `http://`. This initiates an insecure HTTP connection when the `download` function is called. The downloaded archive is then decompressed and placed in the `./server` directory.  The gulp tasks `download_server` and `build_or_download` directly execute this vulnerable download process. There are no integrity checks or HTTPS usage in this code path, making it vulnerable to MITM attacks.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Test Setup:**
     - Set up a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy, such as mitmproxy, on your testing machine. Configure your system or the build environment to route HTTP traffic through this proxy.
     - Configure the MITM proxy to intercept requests to `download.eclipse.org/jdtls/snapshots/jdt-language-server-latest.tar.gz`.
     - Prepare a malicious archive file (e.g., `malicious-jdtls.tar.gz`). This archive should contain a modified JDT Language Server that, upon startup, executes a command to indicate successful execution (e.g., `touch /tmp/pwned` on Linux/macOS or `New-Item -ItemType file -Path C:\temp\pwned.txt` on Windows in a startup script within the JDT LS).
     - Configure the MITM proxy to return this `malicious-jdtls.tar.gz` file instead of the legitimate JDT Language Server snapshot when the specified URL is requested.

  2. **Execution:**
     - Navigate to the project directory in a terminal.
     - Execute the gulp task that triggers the vulnerable download: `gulp download_server` or `gulp build_or_download`.
     - Observe the MITM proxy logs to confirm that the request to `download.eclipse.org/jdtls/snapshots/jdt-language-server-latest.tar.gz` is intercepted and the malicious archive is served by the proxy.

  3. **Verification:**
     - After the gulp task completes, start VSCode and open a Java project in a test workspace. This should trigger the VSCode Java extension to start the downloaded JDT Language Server.
     - Check for the execution of the injected command. For example, check if the `/tmp/pwned` file exists on Linux/macOS or if `C:\temp\pwned.txt` exists on Windows.
     - If the injected command has been executed successfully, it confirms that the malicious archive was downloaded, extracted, and executed due to the insecure HTTP download, demonstrating Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

## Vulnerability 2: Gradle Arguments Injection

- **Description:**
  The VSCode Java extension allows users to configure Gradle command-line arguments through the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting. This setting is intended to provide flexibility in how Gradle projects are imported and built. However, if an attacker can manipulate this setting, they can inject malicious Gradle commands. When the extension interacts with a Gradle project, these injected arguments are passed directly to the Gradle command-line interface, leading to potential arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

  *Triggering Steps:*
  1. An attacker finds a way to modify the VSCode user or workspace settings, specifically targeting the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
     - Exploiting another vulnerability within VSCode or a related extension that allows for settings modification.
     - Tricking a user into manually changing the setting through social engineering or phishing.
     - If the user uses shared workspace settings and an attacker has write access to the workspace configuration files.
  2. Once the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting is modified to include malicious Gradle commands or scripts, the next time the user:
     - Opens a Java project that uses Gradle within VSCode.
     - Reloads an existing Gradle project in VSCode.
     - Triggers a Gradle task through the VSCode Java extension.
  3. The VSCode Java extension reads the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting and passes these arguments to the Gradle command-line interface when invoking Gradle for project import or build operations.
  4. Gradle executes the injected malicious commands or scripts with the privileges of the user running VSCode.

- **Impact:**
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, with the same privileges as the VSCode process. The impact is considered high due to the potential for complete system compromise:
    - Full control over the user's development environment and potentially the entire system.
    - Stealing sensitive data, including source code, credentials, and personal information.
    - Installation of malware, backdoors, or other malicious software.
    - Modification or deletion of critical system files or project resources.
    - Launching further attacks from the compromised system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  Based on the analysis of the provided code files and the current extension behavior, there are no implemented mitigations for this vulnerability. The extension directly utilizes the user-provided arguments from the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting without any input validation, sanitization, or checks to prevent command injection.  The analyzed files (`/code/src/refactoring/...`, `/code/test/...`) do not introduce any security measures to address this issue.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  To mitigate the Gradle Arguments Injection vulnerability, the following mitigations are essential:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting. This should include:
        - Defining a whitelist of allowed Gradle arguments and options.
        - Sanitizing user input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or commands.
        - Parsing and verifying the structure of the provided arguments to ensure they conform to expected patterns.
    - **Restrict Setting Scope and Modification:** Consider restricting the scope of the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting to prevent modification by untrusted sources or extensions. Explore options such as:
        - Making the setting configurable only at the user level and not at the workspace level, limiting the risk of malicious workspace settings.
        - Implementing user consent mechanisms or warnings when sensitive settings like `java.import.gradle.arguments` are modified, especially by external sources or extensions.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Evaluate if the level of flexibility provided by allowing arbitrary Gradle arguments is necessary. If possible, restrict the functionality to only the required Gradle operations and avoid passing user-controlled arguments directly to the command line.
    - **User Warnings:** Display clear and prominent warnings to the user when potentially dangerous settings like `java.import.gradle.arguments` are modified, especially if the modification is detected as originating from an external or untrusted source.

- **Preconditions:**
  The following conditions must be in place for this vulnerability to be exploitable:
    - An attacker must be able to successfully modify the VSCode setting `java.import.gradle.arguments`. The method of modification can vary (e.g., exploiting another vulnerability, social engineering, compromised workspace settings).
    - The user must subsequently open a Java project that utilizes Gradle within VSCode or reload an existing Gradle project after the setting has been maliciously altered.
    - The VSCode Java extension must process and apply the modified `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting when interacting with the Gradle project.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  Based on the provided code files (`/code/src/refactoring/...`, `/code/test/...`) and the current understanding of how VSCode extensions handle settings, there is no evidence of any sanitization or validation being performed on the `java.import.gradle.arguments` setting within these files or the extension's core logic. The extension relies on VSCode's settings API to read the configured arguments and directly passes them to the Gradle CLI.

  The provided files focus on refactoring features and testing infrastructure and do not include any code related to settings validation or security hardening for Gradle argument handling.

  The vulnerability flow is as follows:

  ```
  [Attacker Modifies VSCode Setting: java.import.gradle.arguments] --> [VSCode Java Extension Reads Setting] --> [Extension Executes Gradle CLI with Unvalidated Injected Arguments] --> [Gradle Executes Malicious Commands]
  ```

  The lack of input validation and direct passthrough of user-controlled settings to command-line execution makes the extension vulnerable to Gradle argument injection.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Attacker Setup (Manual Setting Modification):**
     - Open Visual Studio Code.
     - Access the Settings UI (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings on macOS).
     - Go to "Extensions" and locate the "Java" extension settings.
     - Search for `java.import.gradle.arguments`.
     - In the "Value" field for `java.import.gradle.arguments`, enter a malicious Gradle argument, for example: `--init-script=malicious.gradle`

  2. **Create Malicious Gradle Init Script:**
     - Create a new file named `malicious.gradle` in a temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp/malicious.gradle` or `C:\temp\malicious.gradle`).
     - Add malicious Gradle code to `malicious.gradle`. For example, to demonstrate code execution, use:
       ```gradle
       initscript {
           dependencies {
               classpath files('/tmp') // Add /tmp to classpath (for demo purposes, potentially dangerous)
           }
       }

       gradle.taskGraph.whenReady {
           println "Vulnerable VSCode Java Extension Detected!"
           def process = "touch /tmp/pwned_vscode_gradle_injection".execute() // Example malicious command (Linux/macOS)
           process.waitFor()
           println "Executed malicious command."
       }
       ```
       *(Note: Adjust the malicious command for your operating system. For Windows, use `cmd /c echo pwned > C:\temp\pwned_vscode_gradle_injection.txt`)*

  3. **Open a Java Project with Gradle:**
     - Open a folder in VSCode that contains a `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file (a typical Java Gradle project). If needed, create a simple Gradle project for testing.
     - Allow the VSCode Java extension to import the Gradle project automatically.

  4. **Observe for Malicious Output and Side Effects:**
     - Open the VSCode Output panel (View -> Output).
     - Select "Java Language Server" in the Output panel dropdown.
     - Examine the "Java Language Server" output for messages from the malicious init script, such as "Vulnerable VSCode Java Extension Detected!" and "Executed malicious command.".
     - Check for the side effect of the malicious command. For instance, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned_vscode_gradle_injection` (or `C:\temp\pwned_vscode_gradle_injection.txt` on Windows) has been created.

  5. **Verification:**
     - If you observe the malicious messages in the "Java Language Server" output and the side effect (e.g., the creation of the `pwned` file), it confirms that the malicious Gradle init script provided through `java.import.gradle.arguments` was executed by the VSCode Java extension during project import. This demonstrates successful Gradle argument injection and arbitrary code execution.

     **Important:** This test case is for demonstration and verification purposes in a controlled environment. In a real attack scenario, the malicious actions could be far more harmful. Always test security vulnerabilities responsibly and in isolated test environments.
