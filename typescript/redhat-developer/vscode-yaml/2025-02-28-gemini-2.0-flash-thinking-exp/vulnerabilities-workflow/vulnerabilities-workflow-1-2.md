### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Schema Poisoning via Schema Cache

- Description:
    1. An attacker identifies a publicly accessible JSON schema URL that is used by the VSCode YAML extension for validation. This could be a schema from a well-known schema store or a custom schema configured by a user.
    2. The attacker compromises the server hosting the JSON schema or finds a way to inject malicious content into the schema hosted at that URL.
    3. The VSCode YAML extension, when validating a YAML file associated with this schema, fetches the schema from the compromised URL.
    4. The extension caches this poisoned schema locally in the `JSONSchemaCache` to improve performance and reduce network requests.
    5. Subsequently, whenever a user opens or edits a YAML file that is associated with this schema, the extension retrieves the poisoned schema from its local cache.
    6. The extension uses this poisoned schema for validation, completion, and hover information. This could lead to incorrect validation results, misleading autocompletion suggestions, and potentially other unexpected behaviors depending on the nature of the malicious schema content. While direct code execution is unlikely in this architecture, the integrity of the extension's core functionalities is compromised.

- Impact:
    - **Compromised YAML Validation:** Users will receive incorrect validation results, potentially leading to the acceptance of invalid YAML files or rejection of valid ones.
    - **Misleading Autocompletion and Hover:** Autocompletion suggestions and hover information will be based on the poisoned schema, misleading users and potentially causing them to introduce errors into their YAML files.
    - **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose trust in the extension's reliability and security if it uses and relies on potentially malicious external resources without sufficient integrity checks.
    - **Potential for Further Exploitation (Low Probability):** While not immediately evident, if the schema processing logic itself has vulnerabilities, a carefully crafted malicious schema could potentially trigger more severe issues. However, in this context, the schema is primarily used for data validation and UI enhancements, reducing the likelihood of direct code execution vulnerabilities.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - **Schema Caching with ETag:** The extension uses ETag headers to conditionally fetch schemas. If the server responds with a 304 Not Modified and a matching ETag, the cached schema is used. This is implemented in `JSONSchemaDocumentContentProvider.getJsonSchemaContent`.
    - **HTTPS for Schema Downloads:** By default, the extension will likely use HTTPS for schemas from known schema stores, providing transport layer security. However, the code also supports `http://` schemas and custom schema schemes, which might not enforce HTTPS.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Schema Content Integrity Validation:** The extension relies solely on ETag for cache validation. It does not perform any integrity checks on the schema content itself after downloading and before caching it. Implementing content hashing (e.g., SHA256) and verifying the hash against a known good value or a signature would enhance integrity.
    - **Schema Sanitization/Validation before Caching:** The extension does not sanitize or validate the downloaded schema content before caching and using it. Validating the schema against a meta-schema or applying sanitization rules could help prevent certain types of malicious schema injection.
    - **Cache Invalidation Mechanism for Poisoned Schemas:** There is no mechanism to detect if a cached schema has been poisoned after initial caching. Implementing a periodic re-validation or user-initiated cache invalidation would be beneficial.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Web Worker (if applicable):** If the web worker environment is used to process schemas, implementing a Content Security Policy could restrict the capabilities of loaded schemas and limit the impact of malicious content.

- Preconditions:
    1. The user must be using the VSCode YAML extension.
    2. The user must be working with a YAML file that is configured to use an external JSON schema, and this schema URL must be accessible over HTTP or HTTPS.
    3. The attacker must be able to compromise the server hosting the JSON schema at the configured URL or find a way to inject malicious content.
    4. The extension must fetch and cache the poisoned schema.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`src/json-schema-content-provider.ts:getJsonSchemaContent`**: This function fetches the JSON schema content from a given URI.
        ```typescript
        export async function getJsonSchemaContent(uri: string, schemaCache: IJSONSchemaCache): Promise<string> {
            const cachedETag = schemaCache.getETag(uri);
            // ... proxy and header configuration ...
            return xhr({ url: uri, followRedirects: 5, headers }) // HTTP request to fetch schema
                .then(async (response) => {
                    const etag = response.headers['etag'];
                    if (typeof etag === 'string') {
                        await schemaCache.putSchema(uri, etag, response.responseText); // Caching schema with ETag
                    }
                    return response.responseText;
                })
                // ... error handling and cache retrieval ...
        }
        ```
        - The code makes an HTTP request using `request-light.xhr` to fetch the schema.
        - It checks for an ETag in the response headers.
        - If an ETag is present, it caches the schema content and the ETag using `schemaCache.putSchema`.
        - It handles 304 status codes to retrieve from cache.
        - In case of errors, it attempts to retrieve from cache as a fallback.

    2. **`src/json-schema-cache.ts:JSONSchemaCache`**: This class manages the local schema cache.
        ```typescript
        export class JSONSchemaCache implements IJSONSchemaCache {
            // ... cache path and memento initialization ...

            async putSchema(schemaUri: string, eTag: string, schemaContent: string): Promise<void> {
                // ... initialization check ...
                if (!this.cache[schemaUri]) {
                    this.cache[schemaUri] = { eTag, schemaPath: this.getCacheFilePath(schemaUri) };
                } else {
                    this.cache[schemaUri].eTag = eTag;
                }
                try {
                    const cacheFile = this.cache[schemaUri].schemaPath;
                    await fs.writeFile(cacheFile, schemaContent); // Writing schema content to cache file
                    await this.memento.update(CACHE_KEY, this.cache); // Updating memento
                } catch (err) {
                    // ... error handling ...
                }
            }

            async getSchema(schemaUri: string): Promise<string | undefined> {
                // ... initialization check ...
                const cacheFile = this.cache[schemaUri]?.schemaPath;
                if (await fs.pathExists(cacheFile)) {
                    return await fs.readFile(cacheFile, { encoding: 'UTF8' }); // Reading schema content from cache file
                }
                return undefined;
            }
            // ... other methods ...
        }
        ```
        - `putSchema` stores the schema content in a local file within the extension's global storage path. The filename is derived from an MD5 hash of the schema URI.
        - `getSchema` retrieves the schema content from the local file based on the URI.
        - There are no explicit checks for malicious content or integrity validation beyond relying on the ETag for conditional updates during fetching.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Create a mock HTTP server that hosts a legitimate JSON schema (e.g., `legitimate-schema.json`) and serves it at `http://example.com/legitimate-schema.json`.
        - Configure the VSCode YAML extension to use this schema for a test YAML file (e.g., using `yaml.schemas` setting).
    2. **Initial Test (Verify Legitimate Schema):**
        - Open the test YAML file in VSCode.
        - Verify that the YAML extension correctly validates the file against the legitimate schema from `http://example.com/legitimate-schema.json`.
        - Observe that the schema is cached locally (you can monitor file system changes in the extension's storage path or use debugging to inspect the cache).
    3. **Poison Schema:**
        - Modify the mock HTTP server to serve a "poisoned" version of the JSON schema (e.g., `poisoned-schema.json`) at the same URL `http://example.com/legitimate-schema.json`. This poisoned schema could introduce intentionally incorrect validation rules or misleading descriptions. Ensure the server is configured in a way that the ETag might remain the same, or if possible, manipulate or remove ETag headers to force cache re-fetch. If ETag manipulation is not feasible, proceed assuming that the cache invalidation might happen due to server configuration changes in real-world scenarios.
    4. **Test with Poisoned Schema:**
        - Close and reopen the test YAML file in VSCode (or trigger schema re-validation in another way, like editing the file if settings are configured for live validation). This should trigger the extension to potentially re-fetch the schema (or use the existing cached version if ETag is unchanged in a more restrictive test scenario).
        - Observe the validation results, autocompletion suggestions, and hover information for the test YAML file.
        - **Vulnerability Confirmation:** If the validation results, autocompletion, or hover information now reflect the characteristics of the *poisoned schema* instead of the *legitimate schema*, it indicates that schema poisoning has occurred via the cache. For example, if the poisoned schema removes validation for a required field, and no validation error is shown for that missing field in the YAML file, it confirms the vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker, by compromising an external schema source, could influence the behavior of the VSCode YAML extension through schema cache poisoning.
