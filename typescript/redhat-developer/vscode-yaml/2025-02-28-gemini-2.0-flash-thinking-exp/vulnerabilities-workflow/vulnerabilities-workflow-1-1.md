### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Schema Download via Proxy Misconfiguration
  - Description:
    1. Attacker sets up a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy server.
    2. User configures VSCode to use this proxy server for HTTP requests in settings (`http.proxy`).
    3. User, either intentionally or unintentionally, sets `http.proxyStrictSSL` to `false`, disabling SSL certificate verification for proxy connections.
    4. The VSCode YAML extension attempts to download a JSON schema from a URL (e.g., defined in `yaml.schemas` or schema store) via HTTP proxy.
    5. The MITM attacker intercepts the schema download request.
    6. Attacker serves a malicious JSON schema to the VSCode YAML extension through the proxy.
    7. The VSCode YAML extension, due to `http.proxyStrictSSL: false`, accepts the malicious schema without proper SSL certificate verification.
    8. The extension uses this malicious schema for YAML validation, autocompletion, and hover features.
  - Impact:
    - **Incorrect YAML Validation:** Malicious schema can be crafted to always report YAML as valid, even if it contains errors, leading users to deploy misconfigured YAML files. Conversely, it could falsely flag valid YAML as invalid, disrupting development workflow.
    - **Misleading Autocompletion and Hover:** Autocompletion and hover information will be based on the attacker-controlled schema, potentially leading to users inserting incorrect YAML structures or values.
    - **Potential Language Server Exploitation:** While less direct, if the YAML language server has vulnerabilities in its schema processing logic, a highly crafted malicious schema could potentially trigger these vulnerabilities, although this is a secondary and less likely impact.
  - Vulnerability Rank: High
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the extension code to enforce strict SSL for proxy connections. The extension relies on the user-configured `http.proxyStrictSSL` setting.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - **Enforce `http.proxyStrictSSL: true`**: Programmatically enforce strict SSL certificate verification for all schema downloads within the extension, regardless of the user's `http.proxyStrictSSL` setting. This would prevent MITM attacks on schema downloads via proxy.
    - **Warn User for Insecure Configuration**: If enforcing `http.proxyStrictSSL: true` is not desired for compatibility reasons, implement a warning message to the user if `http.proxy` is set but `http.proxyStrictSSL` is `false`, highlighting the security risks.
  - Preconditions:
    - User must be using an HTTP proxy and have configured it in VSCode settings (`http.proxy`).
    - User must have set `http.proxyStrictSSL` to `false` (or be using the default, which appears to be false).
    - An attacker must be positioned to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the network path between the user and the proxy server.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/json-schema-content-provider.ts`
    ```typescript
    import { xhr, configure as configureHttpRequests } from 'request-light';
    // ...
    export async function getJsonSchemaContent(uri: string, schemaCache: IJSONSchemaCache): Promise<string> {
        // ...
        const httpSettings = workspace.getConfiguration('http');
        configureHttpRequests(httpSettings.proxy, httpSettings.proxyStrictSSL); // [highlight] Proxy and strictSSL settings are configured here
        // ...
        return xhr({ url: uri, followRedirects: 5, headers }) // [highlight] xhr request to download schema
        // ...
    }
    ```
    - The code snippet shows that the `configureHttpRequests` function from `request-light` is used to set up proxy and `strictSSL` settings based on VSCode's `http` configuration. If `http.proxyStrictSSL` is `false`, `request-light` will disable SSL certificate verification for proxy connections, making the schema download vulnerable to MITM attacks.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Malicious Proxy**: Use a tool like `mitmproxy` to set up an intercepting proxy. Configure it to listen on a specific port (e.g., 8080) and to replace the content of a specific schema URL with a malicious schema (e.g., a schema that always validates any YAML).
    2. **Configure VSCode Proxy**: In VSCode settings, set `http.proxy` to `http://localhost:8080` (or the address of your malicious proxy) and `http.proxyStrictSSL` to `false`.
    3. **Configure YAML Schema**: In VSCode settings, configure `yaml.schemas` to associate a YAML file (e.g., `test.yaml`) with a schema URL that will be intercepted by your proxy (e.g., a schema from `schemastore.org` or a public GitHub URL using HTTP).
    ```json
    "yaml.schemas": {
        "http://json.schemastore.org/schema-to-intercept.json": "test.yaml"
    }
    ```
    4. **Create Test YAML File**: Create a YAML file named `test.yaml` with some content that should normally be validated against the schema. Include both valid and invalid YAML content according to the *original* schema (not the malicious one).
    5. **Open `test.yaml`**: Open the `test.yaml` file in VSCode.
    6. **Verify Incorrect Validation**: Observe that the YAML validation in VSCode does not report errors even for the invalid YAML content. This indicates that the malicious schema (which might be configured to always validate) served by the proxy is being used instead of the legitimate schema.
    7. **(Optional) Verify Autocompletion/Hover**: Further confirm the use of the malicious schema by checking if autocompletion suggestions or hover information is based on the malicious schema's definitions (if you crafted a malicious schema with modified definitions).
