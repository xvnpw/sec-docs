- **Vulnerability Name:** SSRF in Remote Schema Fetching  
  **Description:**  
  The extension supports dynamic schema retrieval by reading a “modeline” in YAML files (for example, a comment like  
  `# yaml-language-server: $schema=http://attacker-controlled.example/xyz`). In the file **json-schema-content-provider.ts**, the function `getJsonSchemaContent` uses the URL directly when calling the HTTP request (via the `xhr` function). No validation is performed to ensure that the URL does not target local or internal resources. An attacker who supplies a malicious YAML file can force the extension to fetch schema content from an attacker–controlled (or even an internal) endpoint.  
  **Step-by-step Trigger:**  
  1. An attacker crafts a YAML file whose first line sets the schema to a URL of their choosing—for example:  
     ```
     # yaml-language-server: $schema=http://127.0.0.1:80/secret
     ```  
  2. A victim (running VSCode with the extension enabled) opens the malicious YAML file.  
  3. The extension’s language server extracts the schema URL; the simple check ensures the URL starts with `"http"` and proceeds.  
  4. The HTTP request (via `xhr({ url: uri, ... })`) is issued without domain whitelisting, sending the request to the attacker–controlled resource or an internal endpoint.  
  **Impact:**  
  The SSRF vulnerability can cause the extension to:  
  - Retrieve data from internal resources that would normally be unreachable from the Internet.  
  - Expose details of internal systems or configuration information.  
  This may provide a foothold for further attacks such as lateral movement or remote code execution, depending on how the fetched content is processed.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The code verifies that the URL from the YAML modeline begins with `"http"` (or `"https"`).  
  - Proxy-related configuration values (`http.proxy` and `http.proxyStrictSSL`) are passed into the HTTP request library.  
  However, these measures do not restrict the destination of the request.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - No domain/IP whitelisting or detailed URL validation.  
  - Lack of logic to reject URLs that target localhost, private IP ranges, or any hosts not explicitly allowed.  
  - No URL–parsing to catch directory traversal or redirection issues.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The victim must open a YAML file supplied by an attacker (delivered via phishing or by downloading an untrusted file).  
  - The extension must be active and allow outgoing HTTP requests based solely on the simple URL “starts with ‘http’” check.  
  - The network configuration permits such outgoing connections.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  1. In **json-schema-content-provider.ts**, the method `getJsonSchemaContent(uri, schemaCache)` simply passes the extracted URI to `xhr()` after a minimal check.  
  2. The check in `provideTextDocumentContent` only confirms `origUri.startsWith('http')` without validating the remainder of the URL.  
  3. No protective whitelisting or filtering is applied; see the following visualization:  
     - **Input:** YAML file with a modeline like `# yaml-language-server: $schema=http://127.0.0.1:80/secret`  
     - **Extraction & Check:** The URI passes the simple “http” check  
     - **Action:** `xhr({ url: origUri, followRedirects: 5, headers })` is called  
     - **Result:** The extension contacts the attacker–controlled or internal URL.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:** Create a YAML file (e.g., `malicious.yaml`) with the first line as:  
     ```
     # yaml-language-server: $schema=http://127.0.0.1:80/secret
     ```  
     (Alternately, point to an attacker–controlled server where you can log incoming HTTP requests.)  
  2. **Execution:**  
     - Open the file in Visual Studio Code with the extension enabled.  
     - Use an HTTP proxy or monitor a local server (e.g. on localhost:80) to capture outbound requests.  
  3. **Expected Result:**  
     - The extension issues an HTTP GET request to the specified URL immediately upon processing the modeline.  
  4. **Validation:**  
     - Confirm via logs or a proxy that the request is sent, demonstrating the lack of proper URL validation.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Deletion via Unsanitized Input in Test Utility Function  
  **Description:**  
  In the file **/code/test/ui-test/util/utility.ts**, the function `deleteFileInHomeDir(filename: string)` computes a path by joining the user’s home directory with the supplied filename and then unconditionally deletes it if it exists. No sanitization is performed to prevent directory traversal (for example, using sequences such as `../`). An attacker able to invoke this function with a crafted filename could force deletion of arbitrary files or directories outside the intended target.  
  **Step-by-step Trigger:**  
  1. An attacker (or an automated script) calls this function or forces the test harness to execute it, supplying a malicious filename such as `"../.vscode"` (or any other directory–traversing value).  
  2. The function uses `path.join(os.homedir(), filename)`, which may resolve to a directory outside the home folder, such as `/home/../.vscode` (i.e. `/ .vscode`).  
  3. It then checks for existence and calls `fs.rmSync` with `{ recursive: true, force: true }`, deleting the target directory or file.  
  **Impact:**  
  If an attacker can trigger this function, they could delete important files or configuration directories on the user’s system. This would lead to data loss, compromise user settings, and could be the prelude to broader system compromise.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - There is no input sanitization or validation; the function directly uses the supplied filename.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Input validation to disallow directory traversal characters (such as `"../"`).  
  - Enforcement that the resolved file path remains within a safe, designated directory.  
  - Exclusion of test utility functions from production builds of the VSCode extension.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The test utility function must be accessible in a production runtime environment (e.g. if test code is inadvertently packaged and exposed).  
  - An attacker must be able to supply the filename parameter (for instance, via a command or API that calls this function).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  1. The function calls `os.homedir()` to get the user’s home directory (e.g., `/home/user`).  
  2. It then uses `path.join(homeDir, filename)` without checking for directory traversal.  
  3. A malicious filename such as `"../sensitiveDir"` will resolve to a directory outside of `/home/user`.  
  4. The file exists check (`fs.existsSync`) and subsequent deletion (`fs.rmSync`) operate on the unsanitized path, enabling deletion of unintended files.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:**  
     - Ensure the extension build inadvertently includes the test utility functions.  
     - Place a marker file within a directory adjacent to the home directory (or simulate such a file in a controlled environment).  
  2. **Execution:**  
     - Invoke the `deleteFileInHomeDir` function with a filename value like `"../markerFile"` using a test command or API.  
     - Monitor the file system to check if the marker file is deleted.  
  3. **Expected Result:**  
     - Without proper sanitization, the function deletes the marker file located outside the intended directory.  
  4. **Validation:**  
     - Verify that when a sanitized filename is provided, deletion is restricted to within the home directory, whereas unsanitized inputs result in deletion outside the safe area.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Creation via Unsanitized Input in Test Utility Function  
  **Description:**  
  In the file **/code/test/ui-test/util/utility.ts**, the function `createCustomFile(path: string)` uses the provided file path directly without any validation or sanitization. The function simulates creation of a new file by issuing commands to the VSCode command prompt and then saving the resulting editor content. If an attacker can control the `path` parameter, they might force the extension to create or overwrite files at arbitrary locations using directory traversal sequences.  
  **Step-by-step Trigger:**  
  1. An attacker supplies a malicious file path—for example, a value including traversal sequences like `"../../malicious.txt"`.  
  2. The function calls the VSCode command prompt to execute the “new file” command and later sets the file name via an input box using the raw value of the `path` parameter.  
  3. The file is created at the resolved location without any checks, potentially overwriting important configuration or system files.  
  **Impact:**  
  Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to create or overwrite files outside the intended directory scope. This could lead to application misconfiguration, data corruption, or a vector for further code injection or escalation of privileges.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No sanitization or validation is performed on the user-supplied file path.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Input sanitization to remove directory traversal patterns (e.g. filtering out `"../"` sequences).  
  - Enforcement that file creation is restricted to a safe, pre–defined directory.  
  - Avoid packaging test utility functions in the production VSCode extension.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The function must be accessible from a production interface (for example, if test UI commands are inadvertently exposed).  
  - An attacker must be able to supply a controlled file path value.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  1. The function opens the command prompt via `new Workbench().openCommandPrompt()` and issues the command `>new file`.  
  2. It then calls `editor.save()` and later retrieves another input box where it directly sets the text to the provided file path.  
  3. There is no subsequent check to ensure that the file path is within an allowed directory.  
  4. A malicious path containing traversal characters will cause the file to be created (or overwritten) in an arbitrary file system location.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:**  
     - Confirm that the extension build includes the test utilities.  
     - Prepare a controlled environment where file writes to unintended directories are monitored (for example, create a harmless file in a location that should not normally be writable).  
  2. **Execution:**  
     - Invoke the `createCustomFile` function with a malicious path value such as `"../../restricted/important.txt"`.  
     - Observe the location at which the file is created.  
  3. **Expected Result:**  
     - Without proper input sanitization, the file will be created or overwritten at the location indicated by the manipulated path.  
  4. **Validation:**  
     - Verify that a secure implementation would reject the malicious path or restrict file creation to a safe directory, thereby preventing arbitrary file writing.
