### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Schema Poisoning via SchemaStore URL Redirection
- Description:
    1. The VSCode YAML extension fetches JSON schemas from remote URLs, including those from SchemaStore (schemastore.org).
    2. An attacker compromises SchemaStore, performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, or DNS poisoning against schemastore.org or other schema URLs used by the extension.
    3. The attacker redirects schema requests to a malicious server they control.
    4. The malicious server serves a crafted JSON schema containing malicious payloads.
    5. The VSCode YAML extension downloads and caches this malicious schema without integrity checks.
    6. When validating YAML files, the extension uses the poisoned schema.
    7. Depending on the nature of the malicious payload in the schema and vulnerabilities in the YAML language server or VSCode itself, this could lead to code injection, arbitrary command execution, or other malicious outcomes when processing YAML files.
- Impact: High
    - Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's VSCode environment when they open or validate YAML files. This can allow the attacker to gain control over the user's machine, steal sensitive data, or further compromise the system.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension fetches schemas over HTTP/HTTPS but does not verify the integrity of the schema content after download.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Schema Validation against Meta-Schema:** Before using a downloaded schema, validate it against a trusted JSON meta-schema to ensure it conforms to expected schema structure and does not contain malicious or unexpected elements.
    - **Subresource Integrity (SRI) or similar:** If feasible for dynamically fetched schemas, implement SRI or a similar mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of schemas fetched from remote URLs. This would involve checking a cryptographic hash of the schema against a known trusted value.
    - **Curated Local Schema Store Fallback:** Provide an option to use a curated, locally hosted schema store as a fallback or alternative to relying solely on remote schema stores like SchemaStore. This would reduce dependency on external resources and potential compromise.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Schema Loading:** If VSCode and the YAML language server environment support it, implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which schemas can be loaded, limiting the attack surface.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the VSCode YAML extension installed and actively using it to validate YAML files.
    - The attacker must be able to compromise SchemaStore, perform a MitM attack, or DNS poisoning for schema URLs used by the extension (e.g., schemastore.org).
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious JSON schema that can exploit vulnerabilities when processed by the YAML language server or VSCode.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/json-schema-content-provider.ts`
    - Function: `getJsonSchemaContent(uri: string, schemaCache: IJSONSchemaCache)`
    ```typescript
    export async function getJsonSchemaContent(uri: string, schemaCache: IJSONSchemaCache): Promise<string> {
        // ...
        return xhr({ url: uri, followRedirects: 5, headers }) // Vulnerable line: Fetches schema without integrity check
            .then(async (response) => {
                // cache only if server supports 'etag' header
                const etag = response.headers['etag'];
                if (typeof etag === 'string') {
                    await schemaCache.putSchema(uri, etag, response.responseText); // Caches schema
                }
                return response.responseText; // Returns schema content directly
            })
            // ...
    }
    ```
    - The `getJsonSchemaContent` function, located in `/code/src/json-schema-content-provider.ts`, is responsible for fetching JSON schema content from a given URI.
    - It utilizes the `xhr` function from the `request-light` library to make HTTP requests to retrieve the schema.
    - The code fetches the schema content at the provided `uri` without performing any integrity checks on the downloaded schema content.
    - Specifically, after receiving the `response` from the `xhr` call, the `response.responseText`, which contains the schema content, is directly used.
    - If the server provides an 'etag' header, the schema content is cached in the `schemaCache` along with the etag, using `schemaCache.putSchema()`.
    - The function then returns the `response.responseText` directly, which is subsequently used by the extension for YAML validation.
    - The absence of any validation or integrity checks on the schema content after it's fetched and before it's used for validation is the core of the vulnerability.
    - An attacker who can control the server serving the schema at the provided `uri` can serve malicious schema content. This malicious content will be fetched, cached, and used by the extension, potentially leading to schema poisoning.
    - File: `/code/src/json-schema-cache.ts`
    - Function: `putSchema(schemaUri: string, eTag: string, schemaContent: string)`
    ```typescript
    async putSchema(schemaUri: string, eTag: string, schemaContent: string): Promise<void> {
        // ...
        try {
          const cacheFile = this.cache[schemaUri].schemaPath;
          await fs.writeFile(cacheFile, schemaContent);

          await this.memento.update(CACHE_KEY, this.cache);
        } catch (err) {
          delete this.cache[schemaUri];
          logToExtensionOutputChannel(err);
        }
    }
    ```
    - The `putSchema` function in `/code/src/json-schema-cache.ts` is responsible for caching the schema content.
    - It receives the `schemaContent` directly from `getJsonSchemaContent` without any validation.
    - It stores this `schemaContent` into a file in the cache directory using `fs.writeFile`.
    - If an attacker manages to inject malicious content into the schema, this function will cache the malicious schema, making the poisoning persistent.
    - Subsequent requests for the same schema URI may retrieve the malicious cached version, even if the original source is no longer compromised, amplifying the impact of the schema poisoning attack.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install the VSCode YAML extension.
        - Set up a local malicious HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server`). This server will serve a crafted malicious JSON schema. Let's say the server runs on `http://localhost:8000`.
        - Create a malicious JSON schema file (`malicious_schema.json`) on your malicious server. This schema should be crafted to potentially exploit vulnerabilities when processed by a JSON schema validator or YAML parser. For a basic test, it could simply define an unexpected or overly complex schema structure. For a more advanced test, research known JSON schema vulnerabilities and try to incorporate them.
        - Example `malicious_schema.json`:
        ```json
        {
          "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
          "title": "Malicious Schema",
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "malicious_property": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "This is a malicious property",
              "x-vscode-evil-payload": "evil_script()" // Example of a malicious extension property (not directly executable, but illustrates the point)
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        - Serve this `malicious_schema.json` file from your malicious server at `http://localhost:8000/malicious_schema.json`.

    2. **Configure VSCode YAML Extension:**
        - Open VSCode settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        - Search for "yaml.schemas".
        - Click "Edit in settings.json".
        - Add a new schema association in your `settings.json` to associate a YAML file with your malicious schema URL:
        ```json
        "yaml.schemas": {
            "http://localhost:8000/malicious_schema.json": "test_malicious.yaml"
        }
        ```
        - Create a new YAML file named `test_malicious.yaml` in your workspace.

    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open `test_malicious.yaml` in VSCode.
        - The VSCode YAML extension will attempt to validate `test_malicious.yaml` using the schema specified in `yaml.schemas`.
        - Because of the setting, it will fetch the schema from `http://localhost:8000/malicious_schema.json`, which is served by your malicious server.

    4. **Observe and Verify:**
        - Observe if VSCode behaves unexpectedly or if errors occur during schema loading or validation.
        - Monitor network traffic to confirm that the schema is being fetched from your malicious server (`http://localhost:8000/malicious_schema.json`).
        - Examine the VSCode YAML extension's output logs (View -> Output, select "YAML Support" in the dropdown) for any error messages or unusual activity related to schema loading or validation.
        - **Advanced Verification (Conceptual):** For a more thorough test, you would need to analyze how the YAML language server and VSCode process schemas. You'd aim to craft a schema that exploits specific vulnerabilities in schema processing, which might be reflected in crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior in VSCode or the language server. The `x-vscode-evil-payload` example in the malicious schema is a placeholder; actual exploits would depend on discovered vulnerabilities.

    5. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable Case):**
        - If the extension is vulnerable, you might observe:
            - No errors reported by the extension despite using a crafted, potentially invalid or malicious schema.
            - Unexpected behavior in VSCode, depending on the nature of the vulnerability exploited by the malicious schema.
            - Error messages in the YAML extension output if the malicious schema causes parsing or validation failures, but even in this case, lack of integrity check before processing is the vulnerability.

    6. **Mitigation Test:**
        - After implementing mitigations (like schema validation against meta-schema, SRI), repeat the test.
        - **Expected Outcome (Mitigated Case):**
            - The extension should report errors when loading or processing the malicious schema if it fails meta-schema validation or SRI checks.
            - VSCode should not exhibit unexpected behavior.
            - The extension should ideally fall back to a safe state and not use the potentially malicious schema.
