## Deep Analysis: Exploit Weaknesses in CDK Deployment Process -> Compromised Deployment Credentials

This analysis delves into the "High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Weaknesses in CDK Deployment Process -> Compromised Deployment Credentials" within the context of an application built using AWS CDK. We will break down each stage of the attack, explore the potential vulnerabilities, and discuss mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Attack Path:**

This attack path focuses on compromising the credentials used to deploy changes to the AWS infrastructure defined by the CDK application. The attacker's goal is not to directly exploit the application's runtime vulnerabilities but rather to gain control over the deployment process itself. This control allows them to inject malicious code, modify infrastructure, or disrupt services, potentially with significant impact.

**Stage 1: Exploit Weaknesses in CDK Deployment Process**

This initial stage highlights the attacker's focus on the *process* of deploying the CDK application. This process typically involves:

1. **Local Development:** Developers write CDK code, defining infrastructure as code.
2. **Synthesis:** The CDK CLI synthesizes the CDK code into CloudFormation templates.
3. **Deployment:** The CDK CLI or other tools (like CI/CD pipelines) use AWS credentials to deploy the CloudFormation templates, creating or updating AWS resources.

Potential weaknesses in this process that attackers might exploit include:

* **Lack of Secure Credential Management:**
    * **Storing credentials directly in code:** This is a major security blunder and easily exploitable.
    * **Storing credentials in environment variables without proper protection:** While better than hardcoding, insecure environment variable management can still lead to exposure.
    * **Using shared or overly permissive IAM roles for deployment:**  If the deployment process uses a role with excessive permissions, a compromise of those credentials grants broad access.
* **Insecure CI/CD Pipelines:**
    * **Storing deployment credentials within the CI/CD system without proper encryption or secrets management:**  Compromising the CI/CD system grants access to these credentials.
    * **Lack of access controls and auditing on the CI/CD pipeline:**  Unauthorized modifications to the pipeline can lead to credential exposure or malicious deployments.
    * **Vulnerabilities in CI/CD tools themselves:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform could grant access to secrets.
* **Insufficiently Secured Development Environments:**
    * **Lack of endpoint security on developer machines:** Malware on a developer's machine could steal AWS credentials.
    * **Poor access control to developer machines:** Unauthorized access could lead to credential theft.
* **Weak Authentication and Authorization for Deployment Tools:**
    * **Using default passwords or weak authentication for the CDK CLI or other deployment tools.**
    * **Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for deployment actions.**
* **Lack of Auditing and Monitoring of Deployment Activities:**
    * **Insufficient logging of deployment actions makes it difficult to detect and respond to malicious deployments.**
    * **Lack of alerts for unusual deployment activity.**

**Stage 2: Compromised Deployment Credentials**

This stage represents the successful outcome of the attacker's efforts in Stage 1. Having gained access to the AWS credentials used for deployment, the attacker can now manipulate the infrastructure. The provided attack vectors for achieving this are:

**2.1 Phishing:**

* **Mechanism:**  The attacker tricks authorized users (developers, DevOps engineers) into revealing their AWS credentials. This can be done through various methods:
    * **Spear phishing emails:** Targeting specific individuals with personalized messages.
    * **Fake login pages:** Mimicking AWS login portals to capture credentials.
    * **Social engineering:** Manipulating users into divulging information.
* **CDK Relevance:** If deployment credentials are tied to individual user accounts or roles assumed by users, phishing becomes a direct threat.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Security awareness training:** Educating users about phishing tactics.
    * **Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement:** Even if credentials are phished, MFA provides an additional layer of security.
    * **Phishing simulation exercises:** Regularly testing users' susceptibility to phishing attacks.
    * **Email security solutions:** Implementing tools to detect and block phishing emails.

**2.2 Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:**

* **Mechanism:** The attacker attempts to log in with known or guessed credentials.
    * **Credential stuffing:** Using lists of previously compromised usernames and passwords from other breaches.
    * **Brute-force:** Systematically trying different password combinations.
* **CDK Relevance:** If deployment credentials are tied to individual user accounts or if the deployment process uses weak or default passwords, this attack vector is viable.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Strong password policies:** Enforcing complex and unique passwords.
    * **Account lockout policies:** Limiting the number of failed login attempts.
    * **Rate limiting login attempts:** Slowing down brute-force attacks.
    * **Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement:** Significantly reduces the effectiveness of this attack.

**2.3 Leaked Credentials:**

* **Mechanism:**  Deployment credentials are unintentionally exposed in publicly accessible locations.
    * **Public repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):** Accidentally committing credentials in code or configuration files.
    * **Logs and error messages:** Credentials appearing in logs that are not properly secured.
    * **Paste sites or forums:** Developers unintentionally sharing credentials while seeking help.
    * **Compromised internal systems:** Credentials stored on internal systems that are subsequently breached.
* **CDK Relevance:** CDK code often involves configuration and deployment scripts, increasing the risk of accidental credential exposure.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Code scanning tools:** Implementing tools to detect secrets in code before committing.
    * **`.gitignore` and similar mechanisms:** Properly configuring version control to exclude sensitive files.
    * **Secure logging practices:** Avoiding logging sensitive information and securing log storage.
    * **Regularly scanning public repositories for leaked credentials.**
    * **Educating developers about the risks of leaking credentials.**

**2.4 Compromised Developer Machines:**

* **Mechanism:** The attacker gains access to a developer's machine where AWS credentials might be stored or configured.
    * **Malware infections:** Keyloggers, spyware, or remote access trojans.
    * **Physical access:** Unauthorized access to the developer's laptop.
    * **Social engineering:** Tricking developers into installing malicious software.
* **CDK Relevance:** Developers often configure their machines with AWS CLI profiles or environment variables containing deployment credentials.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Endpoint security solutions:** Antivirus, anti-malware, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) software.
    * **Operating system and software patching:** Keeping systems up-to-date to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.
    * **Strong password policies and MFA for developer accounts.**
    * **Full disk encryption:** Protecting data on the hard drive in case of physical theft.
    * **Regular security audits of developer machines.**

**2.5 Insufficient IAM Policies:**

* **Mechanism:** The IAM roles or users used for deployment have overly permissive permissions, granting access beyond what is strictly necessary.
* **CDK Relevance:** CDK deployments rely heavily on IAM roles. If the deployment role has excessive permissions, a compromise of those credentials allows the attacker to perform a wider range of actions.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Granting only the necessary permissions required for deployment.
    * **Regularly reviewing and refining IAM policies.**
    * **Using AWS managed policies as a starting point and customizing them as needed.**
    * **Implementing IAM Access Analyzer to identify overly permissive policies.**
    * **Using temporary security credentials (STS) where appropriate.**

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

A successful compromise of deployment credentials can have severe consequences:

* **Infrastructure Modification:** The attacker can modify existing infrastructure, potentially introducing backdoors, disabling security controls, or causing service disruptions.
* **Data Exfiltration:** With sufficient permissions, the attacker could access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in AWS services.
* **Resource Provisioning:** The attacker could provision new, malicious resources within the AWS account, leading to increased costs and potential further attacks.
* **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt services by deleting or misconfiguring critical resources.
* **Supply Chain Attack:** By compromising the deployment process, the attacker can inject malicious code into the application codebase or infrastructure, affecting all subsequent deployments.

**Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies:**

To defend against this attack path, a layered security approach is crucial:

**Credential Management:**

* **Never hardcode credentials in code.**
