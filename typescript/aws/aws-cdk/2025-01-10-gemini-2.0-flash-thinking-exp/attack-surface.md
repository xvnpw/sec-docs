# Attack Surface Analysis for aws/aws-cdk

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded or Exposed Credentials in CDK Code](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_or_exposed_credentials_in_cdk_code.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive AWS credentials (access keys, secret keys) or other secrets are directly embedded within the CDK codebase or configuration files.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** Developers might inadvertently hardcode credentials when defining resources or configuring integrations within their CDK stacks. CDK's declarative nature can sometimes make it tempting to include such information directly for simplicity.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes an AWS access key and secret key within a Lambda function's environment variables defined in the CDK code. This code is then committed to a public repository.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the associated AWS account or resources, unauthorized access to data, potential for data breaches, and financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure secrets management solutions like AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and integrate them with CDK using appropriate constructs (e.g., `SecretValue.secretsManager()`).
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information in environment variables directly within the CDK code.
        *   Leverage IAM roles and instance profiles to grant permissions to resources instead of relying on explicit credentials.
        *   Implement code scanning tools and linters to detect potential hardcoded secrets during development.
        *   Enforce regular secret rotation policies.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive IAM Roles Created by CDK](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_iam_roles_created_by_cdk.md)

*   **Description:** IAM roles created by CDK grant excessive or unnecessary permissions to AWS resources.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** Developers might define IAM policies with broad `*` actions or resources within their CDK code, or they might not fully understand the principle of least privilege when defining role policies. CDK's ease of use can sometimes lead to overly permissive configurations.
    *   **Example:** A CDK stack defines an IAM role for a Lambda function with `s3:*` permission on all S3 buckets in the account, even though the function only needs read access to a specific bucket.
    *   **Impact:** Lateral movement within the AWS environment, unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, and potential for resource manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining IAM role policies in CDK. Grant only the necessary permissions required for the resource to function.
        *   Use specific resource ARNs instead of wildcards (`*`) in IAM policies.
        *   Regularly review and refine IAM role policies generated by CDK.
        *   Utilize CDK's policy generation features and consider using policy templates or managed policies where appropriate.
        *   Implement automated policy analysis tools to identify overly permissive roles.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Generated CloudFormation Templates](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_generated_cloudformation_templates.md)

*   **Description:** The CloudFormation templates generated by CDK might contain security vulnerabilities due to incorrect configurations or logic within the CDK code.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** Errors or insecure patterns in the CDK code can translate into vulnerable configurations within the generated CloudFormation templates. This can include misconfigured security groups, network ACLs, or resource properties.
    *   **Example:** A CDK stack incorrectly configures a security group for an EC2 instance, allowing inbound traffic from `0.0.0.0/0` on port 22.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to deployed resources, potential for data breaches, and compromise of the application's infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the generated CloudFormation templates, especially for security-sensitive configurations.
        *   Utilize tools like `cfn-lint` to validate the generated CloudFormation templates for potential security issues.
        *   Implement unit and integration tests for your CDK code to ensure it generates secure configurations.
        *   Stay updated with best practices for securing AWS resources and translate those into secure CDK patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Secrets Management During Deployment](./attack_surfaces/insecure_secrets_management_during_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** Secrets required for deploying resources are handled insecurely during the CDK deployment process.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** While CDK provides mechanisms for secure secret management, developers might inadvertently expose secrets during deployment by logging them, passing them as plain text parameters, or storing them insecurely in the CDK state file.
    *   **Example:** A database password is passed as a plain text parameter to a CloudFormation stack during CDK deployment, making it visible in logs and the CloudFormation console.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to databases or other secured resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid passing secrets as plain text parameters during CDK deployment.
        *   Utilize secure secret injection methods provided by AWS services (e.g., using Secrets Manager with Lambda environment variables).
        *   Ensure the CDK state file (typically stored in S3) has appropriate access controls.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive information during the CDK deployment process.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Development Environment](./attack_surfaces/compromised_development_environment.md)

*   **Description:** The developer's machine or the CI/CD environment used to run CDK commands is compromised.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** If the environment where CDK is executed is compromised, attackers can gain access to AWS credentials configured for the CDK CLI, manipulate the CDK code, or inject malicious changes during the deployment process.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's laptop and uses the configured AWS credentials to deploy malicious infrastructure through CDK.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the AWS environment, deployment of malicious resources, data breaches, and significant financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong security practices for developer machines (e.g., endpoint security, multi-factor authentication).
        *   Secure the CI/CD pipeline used for CDK deployments with robust access controls and auditing.
        *   Implement least privilege principles for IAM roles used by the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Regularly scan development and CI/CD environments for vulnerabilities.
        *   Use temporary credentials or assume roles when interacting with AWS through the CDK CLI.
