# Attack Tree Analysis for aws/aws-cdk

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Vulnerabilities in CDK Code -> Improper Handling of Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cdk_code_-_improper_handling_of_secrets.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in CDK Code:** This is the initial stage where the attacker focuses on finding weaknesses within the code written using AWS CDK. This could involve:
    * Examining the codebase for insecure practices.
    * Analyzing custom constructs for logical flaws.
    * Identifying dependency vulnerabilities.

* **Improper Handling of Secrets:** The attacker successfully identifies that the CDK code is not securely managing sensitive information. Attack vectors include:
    * **Hardcoded Secrets:**  Directly finding API keys, passwords, or other credentials embedded as plain text within the CDK code files.
    * **Insecure Storage in Environment Variables:** Discovering secrets stored in environment variables that are not properly secured or are logged.
    * **Secrets Stored in Version Control:** Finding secrets that were accidentally committed to the version control system's history.
    * **Exposure in Synthesized CloudFormation Templates:** Locating secrets that were inadvertently included in the generated CloudFormation templates before deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Weaknesses in CDK Deployment Process -> Compromised Deployment Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_weaknesses_in_cdk_deployment_process_-_compromised_deployment_credentials.md)

* **Exploit Weaknesses in CDK Deployment Process:** The attacker targets the process used to deploy the CDK application to AWS, looking for vulnerabilities in how deployments are authenticated and authorized.

* **Compromised Deployment Credentials:** The attacker successfully gains access to the AWS credentials used for deploying the CDK application. Attack vectors include:
    * **Phishing:** Tricking authorized users into revealing their AWS credentials.
    * **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** Attempting to log in with known or guessed credentials.
    * **Leaked Credentials:** Discovering credentials that were unintentionally exposed (e.g., on public repositories, in logs).
    * **Compromised Developer Machines:** Gaining access to a developer's machine where AWS credentials might be stored or configured.
    * **Insufficient IAM Policies:** Exploiting overly permissive IAM roles assigned to deployment processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Weaknesses in CDK Deployment Process -> Tampering with Synthesized CloudFormation Template](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploit_weaknesses_in_cdk_deployment_process_-_tampering_with_synthesized_cloudform_283acfd2.md)

* **Exploit Weaknesses in CDK Deployment Process:**  As in the previous path, the attacker targets the deployment process.

* **Tampering with Synthesized CloudFormation Template:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the generated CloudFormation template *before* it is deployed to AWS and modifies it to introduce malicious elements. Attack vectors include:
    * **Compromised Build Environment:** Gaining access to the build server or CI/CD pipeline where the template is generated.
    * **Insecure Storage of Templates:** Accessing the directory where the `.cdk.out` folder or the final CloudFormation template is stored if it's not properly secured.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (Less Likely but Possible):** Intercepting the template during its transfer if the communication channel is not secure.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Deployment Tools:** If custom deployment scripts or tools are used, exploiting vulnerabilities within those tools to modify the template.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in CDK Code](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cdk_code.md)

This node represents a broad category of attacks focused on weaknesses within the developer-written CDK code itself. Attack vectors include:

* **Insecure Defaults in Constructs:** Leveraging the default settings of CDK constructs that are not secure (e.g., publicly accessible S3 buckets, open security groups).
* **Logic Flaws in Custom Constructs:** Exploiting errors or oversights in the logic of custom CDK constructs that lead to insecure infrastructure configurations.
* **Improper Handling of Secrets:** (As detailed in High-Risk Path 1).
* **Configuration Errors Leading to Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting misconfigurations in resource properties or policies defined in the CDK code.
* **Dependency Vulnerabilities in CDK Project:**  Taking advantage of known vulnerabilities in the libraries and packages used by the CDK project.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Improper Handling of Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_improper_handling_of_secrets.md)

This node, already detailed in High-Risk Path 1, is critical due to the direct and severe impact of exposing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Weaknesses in CDK Deployment Process](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_weaknesses_in_cdk_deployment_process.md)

This node represents a critical stage where attackers can compromise the integrity of the deployment. Attack vectors include:

* **Compromised Deployment Credentials:** (As detailed in High-Risk Path 2).
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Deployment:** Intercepting and modifying deployment commands or the CloudFormation template during transmission.
* **Tampering with Synthesized CloudFormation Template:** (As detailed in High-Risk Path 3).
* **Supply Chain Attacks on CDK CLI or Dependencies:** Compromising the CDK CLI tool or its dependencies to inject malicious code during deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromised Deployment Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromised_deployment_credentials.md)

This node, already detailed in High-Risk Path 2, is critical because it provides attackers with the authority to make significant changes to the infrastructure.
