# Threat Model Analysis for aws/aws-cdk

## Threat: [Hardcoded Secrets in CDK Code](./threats/hardcoded_secrets_in_cdk_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the source code repository (e.g., via compromised developer account or exposed repository) could discover hardcoded sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, or other credentials directly embedded within the CDK code. They could then use these credentials to access and potentially compromise the associated AWS resources.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to AWS resources, data breaches, potential financial loss due to resource usage or compromised services.

**Affected CDK Component:** CDK Application Code (specifically, the source files where infrastructure is defined).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize secure secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
* Retrieve secrets dynamically during CDK synthesis or application runtime.
* Implement code review processes to identify and remove hardcoded secrets.
* Employ static analysis tools to detect potential secrets in the codebase.
* Enforce pre-commit hooks to prevent committing code containing secrets.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in CDK Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_cdk_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit known security vulnerabilities in the npm packages (or other language-specific packages) that the AWS CDK relies on. This could potentially allow them to execute arbitrary code during the CDK synthesis process, compromise the developer's environment, or introduce malicious code into the deployed infrastructure.

**Impact:** Compromised development environment, potential for supply chain attacks affecting deployed infrastructure, denial of service during deployment.

**Affected CDK Component:** CDK CLI, CDK Constructs (as they depend on underlying libraries).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update CDK and its dependencies to the latest versions.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
* Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the development pipeline.
* Pin dependency versions to ensure consistent and tested builds.

## Threat: [Malicious Third-Party CDK Constructs](./threats/malicious_third-party_cdk_constructs.md)

**Description:** Developers might unknowingly use third-party CDK constructs (available on platforms like constructs.dev) that contain malicious code. This code could be designed to exfiltrate data, create backdoors in the infrastructure, or perform other unauthorized actions during deployment.

**Impact:** Compromised deployed infrastructure, data breaches, unauthorized access points, potential for long-term persistence of malicious elements.

**Affected CDK Component:** CDK Constructs (specifically, externally sourced constructs).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Exercise caution when using third-party constructs.
* Thoroughly review the code and reputation of the construct author before incorporating it.
* Prefer using official AWS CDK constructs or well-vetted community constructs.
* Implement code scanning and security reviews for all external dependencies.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive IAM Roles for CDK Deployment](./threats/overly_permissive_iam_roles_for_cdk_deployment.md)

**Description:** The IAM role used by the CDK for deployment might be granted excessive permissions, allowing it to perform actions beyond what is strictly necessary for provisioning the defined infrastructure. If this role is compromised (e.g., through leaked credentials), attackers could leverage these broad permissions to perform unauthorized actions across the AWS account.

**Impact:** Increased blast radius in case of compromise, potential for widespread resource manipulation or data breaches.

**Affected CDK Component:** IAM Role configuration within the CDK application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining IAM roles for CDK deployment.
* Grant only the necessary permissions required for the specific infrastructure being provisioned.
* Utilize fine-grained IAM policies and resource-level permissions where possible.
* Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to CDK deployment roles.

## Threat: [Tampering with Synthesized CloudFormation Templates](./threats/tampering_with_synthesized_cloudformation_templates.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the build pipeline or the `cdk.out` directory before deployment could potentially modify the synthesized CloudFormation templates. They could inject malicious resources, alter security group rules, or make other changes to compromise the infrastructure being deployed.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised infrastructure, introduction of backdoors, potential for data breaches or resource hijacking.

**Affected CDK Component:** CDK Synthesis output (CloudFormation templates).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls and integrity checks on the build pipeline.
* Sign or hash the synthesized templates to ensure immutability before deployment.
* Utilize secure artifact storage and retrieval mechanisms.
