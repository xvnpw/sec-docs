# Attack Surface Analysis for aws/aws-cdk

## Attack Surface: [1. Secrets Management in CDK Code](./attack_surfaces/1__secrets_management_in_cdk_code.md)

*   **Description:** Developers unintentionally embed sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens) directly within the CDK code (TypeScript, Python, etc.).
*   **How AWS CDK Contributes to Attack Surface:** CDK code, being code, is susceptible to the common programming mistake of hardcoding secrets. The declarative nature of CDK might sometimes obscure the runtime context where secrets are needed, potentially increasing the likelihood of hardcoding.
*   **Example:** A developer hardcodes an API key directly into a CDK construct defining an API Gateway integration:

    ```typescript
    const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'MyApi');
    const integration = new apigateway.AwsIntegration({
        service: '...',
        path: '...',
        options: {
            credentialsRole: iam.Role.fromRoleArn(this, 'CredRole', 'arn:aws:iam::...'),
            integrationHttpMethod: 'POST',
            requestTemplates: {
                'application/json': JSON.stringify({ apiKey: 'hardcodedApiKey123' }) // Hardcoded API Key!
            }
        }
    });
    ```

*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials leading to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, and potential account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize Secret Management Services:** Integrate with AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, or HashiCorp Vault to store and retrieve secrets dynamically.
    *   **Dynamic Secret Retrieval in CDK:** Use CDK mechanisms to fetch secrets at deployment time, such as `ssm.StringParameter.valueForStringParameter()` or `secretsmanager.Secret.fromSecretNameV2()`.
    *   **Code Scanning and Linting:** Employ static analysis tools and linters to automatically detect potential hardcoded secrets in CDK code during development and CI/CD.

## Attack Surface: [2. Insecure CDK Constructs and Patterns](./attack_surfaces/2__insecure_cdk_constructs_and_patterns.md)

*   **Description:** Developers use CDK constructs in a way that results in insecure infrastructure configurations, such as overly permissive IAM roles, open security groups, or publicly accessible resources.
*   **How AWS CDK Contributes to Attack Surface:** CDK simplifies infrastructure provisioning, but it also abstracts away some of the underlying security considerations. Developers might unknowingly create insecure configurations if they lack sufficient security knowledge or rely on default settings without proper review within their CDK code.
*   **Example:** A developer creates a security group using CDK and inadvertently opens it to the public internet (0.0.0.0/0) on port 22 (SSH):

    ```typescript
    const securityGroup = new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'MySecurityGroup', {
        vpc: vpc,
        allowAllOutbound: true, // Not ideal for security
        description: 'Example Security Group'
    });

    securityGroup.addIngressRule(ec2.Peer.ipv4('0.0.0.0/0'), ec2.Port.tcp(22), 'Allow SSH from anywhere'); // Insecure!
    ```

*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches due to publicly exposed data, and potential for resource abuse or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the resource and data exposed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Security Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of CDK code, specifically focusing on security configurations of IAM roles, security groups, network configurations, and resource access policies defined in CDK.
    *   **Policy-as-Code Tools:** Integrate security linters and policy-as-code tools (e.g., Checkov, cfn-nag, AWS CloudFormation Guard) into the development and CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan CDK code for security violations before deployment.
    *   **Leverage CDK Security Best Practices:** Utilize CDK's built-in security features and follow security best practices documented in AWS CDK documentation and security guides.

## Attack Surface: [3. Third-Party CDK Constructs and Libraries](./attack_surfaces/3__third-party_cdk_constructs_and_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Reliance on external CDK constructs or libraries from sources like the CDK Construct Hub or package registries (npm, PyPI, Maven) that may contain vulnerabilities or malicious code.
*   **How AWS CDK Contributes to Attack Surface:** CDK's extensibility and the CDK Construct Hub encourage the use of third-party constructs to simplify complex infrastructure deployments. This introduces a supply chain risk directly related to the CDK ecosystem if these external dependencies are not properly vetted before being incorporated into CDK applications.
*   **Example:** A developer uses a third-party construct from an untrusted source to deploy a complex application, unknowingly including a vulnerable dependency within the construct that gets deployed as part of the infrastructure defined by CDK.

    ```typescript
    import * as someThirdPartyConstruct from 'untrusted-cdk-construct'; // Potentially vulnerable

    const myApp = new someThirdPartyConstruct.MyAppConstruct(this, 'MyApp', {
        // ... configurations
    });
    ```

*   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the deployed infrastructure, potential for backdoors, data exfiltration, or compromise of the deployment process itself, all stemming from the use of a CDK construct.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Vetting Third-Party Constructs:** Carefully evaluate and audit third-party constructs before using them in CDK applications. Check the author's reputation, community support, security history, and code quality.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of third-party constructs used in CDK projects.
    *   **Pinning Versions:** Pin specific versions of third-party constructs in `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc., to control updates and avoid unexpected changes or newly introduced vulnerabilities in newer versions.

## Attack Surface: [4. Compromised CI/CD Pipeline for CDK Deployments](./attack_surfaces/4__compromised_cicd_pipeline_for_cdk_deployments.md)

*   **Description:** The CI/CD pipeline used to automate CDK deployments is compromised, allowing attackers to inject malicious changes into the infrastructure deployment process orchestrated by CDK.
*   **How AWS CDK Contributes to Attack Surface:** CDK deployments are typically automated through CI/CD pipelines. A compromised pipeline can directly manipulate the CDK application deployment, leading to the deployment of malicious infrastructure through the CDK framework. The automation inherent in CDK deployments amplifies the impact of a compromised pipeline.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD system and modifies the CDK code repository or the deployment scripts to introduce a backdoor into the infrastructure that will be provisioned by CDK during the next automated deployment.
*   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised infrastructure via CDK, backdoors, data breaches, service disruption, and potential for persistent access to the AWS environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure CI/CD Infrastructure:** Harden the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure itself, including build agents, control plane, and network segmentation.
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing and modifying the CI/CD pipeline used for CDK deployments.
    *   **Code Signing and Verification:** Use code signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of CDK code deployed through the pipeline. Verify signatures before CDK deployment steps.

## Attack Surface: [5. Insufficient IAM Permissions for CDK Deployment Roles](./attack_surfaces/5__insufficient_iam_permissions_for_cdk_deployment_roles.md)

*   **Description:** The IAM role used by the CDK deployment process (e.g., CloudFormation execution role) is granted overly broad permissions, exceeding what is strictly required for infrastructure deployment orchestrated by CDK.
*   **How AWS CDK Contributes to Attack Surface:** CDK deployments rely on IAM roles to interact with AWS services to provision infrastructure. Overly permissive roles used by CDK create a larger attack surface if these roles are compromised, as they can be leveraged to perform actions beyond the intended CDK deployment scope.
*   **Example:** The CloudFormation execution role used by CDK is granted `AdministratorAccess` policy, allowing it to perform any action in the AWS account, even though CDK only needs permissions to create and manage specific infrastructure resources defined in the CDK application.
*   **Impact:** If the CDK deployment role is compromised, attackers can leverage its excessive permissions to perform unauthorized actions across the entire AWS account, beyond the intended infrastructure scope managed by CDK.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Deployment Roles:** Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining IAM roles for CDK deployments. Grant only the minimum necessary permissions required for CDK infrastructure provisioning and management.
    *   **Scope Down Permissions:** Scope down the permissions of CDK deployment roles to specific resources and actions, avoiding wildcard permissions where possible.

## Attack Surface: [6. CDK Toolkit (CDK CLI and Libraries) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/6__cdk_toolkit__cdk_cli_and_libraries__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities are discovered in the CDK Toolkit itself (the `cdk` CLI, core libraries, or underlying dependencies).
*   **How AWS CDK Contributes to Attack Surface:** Developers rely on the CDK Toolkit for development and deployment of CDK applications. Vulnerabilities in the toolkit can directly impact the security of the CDK development environment and the deployment process, potentially allowing manipulation of CDK deployments.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a CDK CLI dependency allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a developer's machine when they run `cdk deploy`, potentially compromising the deployment process or developer credentials used by the CDK CLI.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of developer machines using CDK, manipulation of CDK deployments, unauthorized access to AWS resources through compromised CDK tooling, and potential for supply chain attacks targeting CDK users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep CDK Toolkit Updated:** Regularly update the CDK Toolkit and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and release notes for the CDK Toolkit and its ecosystem.
    *   **Trusted Installation Sources:** Download and install the CDK Toolkit only from trusted and official sources (e.g., npm, PyPI, AWS official documentation).
