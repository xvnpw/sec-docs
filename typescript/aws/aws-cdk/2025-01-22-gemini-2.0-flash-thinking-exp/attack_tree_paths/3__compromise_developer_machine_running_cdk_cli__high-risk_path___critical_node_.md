#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Steal Credentials, Malicious Deployments

This attack vector focuses on compromising a developer's machine to steal AWS credentials and subsequently use these credentials to perform malicious deployments via the AWS CDK CLI.  This is a critical concern because developer machines often hold elevated privileges and access to sensitive infrastructure configurations.

**Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

1.  **Compromise Developer Machine:** The attacker first needs to gain unauthorized access to the developer's machine. This can be achieved through various methods:
    *   **Phishing:**  Tricking the developer into clicking malicious links or opening infected attachments, leading to malware installation.
    *   **Malware/Ransomware:**  Exploiting software vulnerabilities to install malware that can steal credentials, provide remote access, or encrypt data.
    *   **Social Engineering:**  Manipulating the developer into revealing credentials or installing malicious software.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising software or tools used by the developer (e.g., IDE plugins, dependencies) to inject malicious code.
    *   **Physical Access:**  Gaining physical access to the developer's machine when unattended or through social engineering.
    *   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access to the developer machine.
    *   **Vulnerable Software:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system, applications, or development tools installed on the developer machine.

2.  **Credential Stealing:** Once the machine is compromised, the attacker aims to steal AWS credentials. Common methods include:
    *   **Credential Harvesting from AWS CLI Configuration:**  Extracting credentials stored in the `~/.aws/credentials` file or environment variables used by the AWS CLI.
    *   **Memory Scraping:**  Extracting credentials from the memory of running processes, especially if credentials are temporarily loaded into memory by the AWS CLI or CDK CLI.
    *   **Keylogging:**  Capturing keystrokes to intercept credentials as they are typed.
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing active AWS CLI sessions or temporary credentials.
    *   **Exploiting AWS SDK Vulnerabilities:**  In rare cases, vulnerabilities in the AWS SDK itself could be exploited to gain access to credentials.

3.  **Malicious Deployments via CDK CLI:** With stolen AWS credentials, the attacker can now use the CDK CLI to perform malicious actions:
    *   **Deploy Malicious Infrastructure:** Deploy new AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, Lambda functions, databases) designed for malicious purposes like cryptomining, data exfiltration, or launching further attacks.
    *   **Modify Existing Infrastructure:**  Alter existing CDK stacks to introduce backdoors, weaken security configurations, disrupt services, or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Deploy resources or modify existing ones to gain access to and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in AWS services like S3, RDS, or DynamoDB.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Deploy resources or modify configurations to cause service disruptions or outages.
    *   **Resource Hijacking:**  Take control of existing AWS resources for malicious purposes.
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  Use compromised AWS resources as a stepping stone to further compromise other parts of the AWS environment or connected systems.

#### 4.2. Risk Attribute Analysis

*   **Likelihood: Medium** -  While compromising a developer machine requires effort, it is a realistic scenario. Developers are often targeted due to their privileged access. Phishing and malware attacks are common, and developer machines may not always have the same level of security hardening as production servers. The "Medium" likelihood reflects the balance between the effort required by the attacker and the potential vulnerabilities in developer environments.

*   **Impact: High** - The impact of this attack is potentially very high. Successful credential theft and malicious deployments can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Loss of sensitive data, leading to regulatory fines, reputational damage, and financial losses.
    *   **Service Disruption:**  Downtime and unavailability of critical applications and services.
    *   **Financial Loss:**  Costs associated with incident response, remediation, data recovery, and potential regulatory penalties.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust and damage to brand reputation.
    *   **Supply Chain Compromise:**  If the compromised application is part of a larger supply chain, the impact can extend to downstream customers and partners.

*   **Effort: Medium** -  The effort required for this attack is considered medium. While sophisticated attacks exist, simpler methods like phishing or readily available malware can be effective.  The attacker needs to have some understanding of developer workflows and AWS credentials, but readily available tools and information can lower the barrier to entry.

*   **Skill Level: Medium** -  A medium skill level is required.  While advanced persistent threats (APTs) might employ highly sophisticated techniques, many successful attacks rely on readily available tools and techniques that can be executed by individuals with moderate technical skills.  Understanding basic networking, operating systems, and common attack vectors is sufficient for many scenarios.

*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium** -  Detecting this type of attack can be moderately difficult.  If the attacker is careful, malicious deployments might blend in with legitimate CDK deployments, especially if monitoring and logging are not robust.  Detecting credential theft on a developer machine can also be challenging without endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions or strong security monitoring.  However, unusual AWS API activity or infrastructure changes could raise red flags if proper monitoring is in place.

*   **Insight: Secure developer machines, enforce MFA, implement least privilege access.** - This insight highlights the core principles for mitigating this attack path.  It emphasizes the importance of securing developer endpoints, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS access, and adhering to the principle of least privilege.
