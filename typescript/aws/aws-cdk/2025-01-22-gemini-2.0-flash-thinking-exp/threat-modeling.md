# Threat Model Analysis for aws/aws-cdk

## Threat: [Hardcoded Secrets in CDK Code](./threats/hardcoded_secrets_in_cdk_code.md)

*   **Description:** Developers accidentally or intentionally embed sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or tokens directly into CDK code files. An attacker gaining access to the codebase (e.g., through source code repository compromise, insider threat, or exposed build artifacts) can extract these secrets. This is a direct consequence of how developers write CDK code and manage secrets within it.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of sensitive data, unauthorized access to AWS resources, potential data breaches, and service disruption.
*   **Affected CDK Component:** CDK Code (Constructs, Stacks, App)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never hardcode secrets.**
    *   Utilize AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and manage secrets.
    *   Retrieve secrets dynamically at runtime using mechanisms like `SecretValue.secretsManager()` or `StringParameter.valueFromLookup()`.
    *   Implement pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipeline checks to scan for and prevent hardcoded secrets in CDK code.
    *   Educate developers on secure secret management practices specifically within the context of CDK.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive IAM Policies in CDK](./threats/overly_permissive_iam_policies_in_cdk.md)

*   **Description:** Developers define IAM roles and policies in CDK code that grant excessive privileges to AWS resources beyond what is strictly necessary. An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in the application or gaining unauthorized access can leverage these overly permissive roles defined *through CDK* to escalate privileges and perform actions they shouldn't be authorized to do. The threat originates from how IAM is configured *using CDK*.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized resource access and modification, privilege escalation, and potential lateral movement within the AWS environment.
*   **Affected CDK Component:**  IAM Constructs (Roles, Policies, Users, Groups)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Apply the principle of least privilege** when defining IAM policies in CDK.
    *   Utilize CDK's `grant` methods on resources to automatically generate least privilege policies.
    *   Regularly review and audit IAM policies defined in CDK code.
    *   Use IAM policy validation tools (e.g., AWS IAM Access Analyzer) to identify overly permissive policies generated by CDK.
    *   Implement automated policy reviews in CI/CD pipelines specifically for CDK-generated policies.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Security Groups and Network ACLs in CDK](./threats/misconfigured_security_groups_and_network_acls_in_cdk.md)

*   **Description:** Developers misconfigure Security Groups or Network ACLs *in CDK*, for example, by opening up unnecessary ports or allowing traffic from `0.0.0.0/0` when it's not required. An attacker can exploit these misconfigurations, which are a direct result of CDK configuration, to gain unauthorized network access to resources.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized network access, data breaches, service disruption, and potential for lateral movement.
*   **Affected CDK Component:** EC2 Constructs (Security Groups, NetworkAcl)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Follow the principle of least privilege for network access when configuring resources in CDK.**
    *   Explicitly define necessary ports and source IP ranges in Security Groups and Network ACLs within CDK code.
    *   Avoid using overly broad rules like allowing traffic from `0.0.0.0/0` unless absolutely necessary and well-justified in the CDK context.
    *   Utilize CDK's higher-level constructs that provide secure defaults where possible for network configurations.
    *   Implement security linters and policy-as-code tools to validate network configurations defined in CDK.
    *   Regularly review and audit Security Group and Network ACL configurations generated by CDK.

## Threat: [Compromised CI/CD Pipeline for CDK Deployments](./threats/compromised_cicd_pipeline_for_cdk_deployments.md)

*   **Description:** The CI/CD pipeline *specifically used to deploy CDK stacks* is compromised. An attacker gaining control of this pipeline can inject malicious changes into the CDK code or deployment process, leading to the deployment of compromised infrastructure. This directly impacts the CDK deployment workflow.
*   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised infrastructure, backdoors in the system, data breaches, service disruption, and long-term system compromise.
*   **Affected CDK Component:** CDK Deployment Pipeline (CDK CLI, CI/CD System Integration)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure itself, focusing on aspects relevant to CDK deployments.**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the CI/CD pipeline used for CDK.
    *   Utilize secure secret management within the CI/CD pipeline for AWS credentials used by the CDK CLI.
    *   Implement code signing and verification for CDK deployments to ensure integrity throughout the CDK deployment process.
    *   Regularly audit CI/CD pipeline configurations and access logs, paying attention to CDK deployment activities.
    *   Follow security best practices for CI/CD systems, specifically considering the CDK deployment context.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to CDK Deployment Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_cdk_deployment_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** AWS credentials *used for CDK deployments* are compromised. An attacker with these credentials can deploy, modify, or delete infrastructure managed by CDK. This is a direct threat to the CDK-managed infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized infrastructure modification or deletion, data breaches, service disruption, and potential for complete account takeover if highly privileged credentials are compromised.
*   **Affected CDK Component:** CDK Deployment Process (AWS CLI, AWS SDK, IAM Roles)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize IAM roles with least privilege specifically for CDK deployment credentials.**
    *   Never store deployment credentials directly in CDK code or CI/CD configuration files.
    *   Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to store and manage deployment credentials used by CDK.
    *   Rotate deployment credentials regularly used for CDK deployments.
    *   Monitor for unauthorized or suspicious activity related to deployment credentials used by CDK.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accounts used for CDK deployments.
