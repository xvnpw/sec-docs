#### 4.1. Threat Actors

Potential threat actors who might target a CI/CD pipeline for CDK deployments include:

*   **External Attackers:**
    *   **Cybercriminals:** Motivated by financial gain, they might inject malware, ransomware, or backdoors to exfiltrate data, disrupt services, or gain persistent access for future attacks.
    *   **Nation-State Actors:** Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) seeking to gain strategic advantages, conduct espionage, or disrupt critical infrastructure. They may target organizations with valuable data or strategic importance.
    *   **Hacktivists:** Driven by ideological or political motivations, they might aim to disrupt services, deface infrastructure, or leak sensitive information to cause reputational damage.

*   **Insecure Pipeline Configuration:**
    *   Pipeline configurations stored in insecure locations or without version control.
    *   Lack of pipeline-as-code practices, making configurations harder to audit and manage.
    *   Misconfigured pipeline steps that introduce security risks (e.g., running with excessive privileges).
*   **Weak Network Security:**
    *   CI/CD pipeline accessible from untrusted networks.
    *   Lack of network segmentation to isolate the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Insufficient firewall rules and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

#### 4.4. Potential Impacts

A successful compromise of the CI/CD pipeline for CDK deployments can have severe and wide-ranging impacts:

*   **Service Disruption and Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Intentional Misconfiguration:** Attackers can intentionally misconfigure infrastructure components, leading to service outages and denial of service.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Deployment of resource-intensive malicious components can exhaust resources and cause service degradation or outages.
*   **Resource Hijacking and Cryptocurrency Mining:**
    *   Compromised infrastructure can be used for unauthorized cryptocurrency mining, resulting in unexpected AWS costs and performance degradation.
    *   Resources can be hijacked for other malicious purposes, such as botnet operations or launching attacks against other targets.
*   **Lateral Movement and Further Compromise:**
    *   Compromised infrastructure can be used as a stepping stone to attack other parts of the AWS environment, on-premises networks, or connected systems.
    *   Attackers can leverage compromised infrastructure to gain access to more sensitive systems and data.
*   **Supply Chain Poisoning (if applicable):**
    *   If the CDK application or infrastructure components are distributed or used by other organizations, a compromised pipeline can lead to wider supply chain attacks, affecting downstream users.
*   **Reputational Damage and Financial Losses:**
    *   Security incidents resulting from a compromised CI/CD pipeline can lead to significant reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and financial losses due to incident response costs, remediation efforts, regulatory fines, and business disruption.
