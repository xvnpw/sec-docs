# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for aws/aws-cdk

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Code Reviews for CDK Code](./mitigation_strategies/implement_code_reviews_for_cdk_code.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a mandatory code review process for all changes to CDK code before they are merged into the main branch or deployed.
    2.  Define clear code review guidelines that specifically include security considerations for infrastructure as code, focusing on common CDK misconfigurations and IAM policy best practices.
    3.  Train development team members on secure CDK coding practices, common infrastructure vulnerabilities, and how to identify security issues during code reviews.
    4.  Utilize a code review platform (e.g., GitHub Pull Requests, GitLab Merge Requests) to facilitate the review process and track changes.
    5.  Ensure that at least one reviewer with security awareness and CDK expertise approves each CDK code change before it is deployed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Infrastructure Misconfiguration (High Severity): Incorrectly configured resources leading to vulnerabilities due to CDK code errors.
    *   Accidental Exposure of Secrets (Medium Severity): Unintentionally hardcoding or logging sensitive information in CDK code.

    *   Logic Flaws in Infrastructure Definition (Medium Severity): Errors in the infrastructure logic defined in CDK that can lead to security weaknesses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Infrastructure Misconfiguration: High Reduction - Proactive identification and correction of misconfigurations in CDK code before deployment.
    *   Accidental Exposure of Secrets: Medium Reduction - Increased scrutiny reduces the chance of secrets being inadvertently included in CDK code.
    *   Overly Permissive IAM Policies: High Reduction - Reviewers can enforce least privilege principles during IAM policy creation within CDK.

*   **Description:**
    1.  Integrate a SAST tool specifically designed for infrastructure as code (or adaptable to it) into the CI/CD pipeline. Examples include Checkov, tfsec (can be adapted), or custom scripts using CDK's `Aspects`.
    2.  Configure the SAST tool with rulesets that are relevant to AWS security best practices, CIS benchmarks for AWS, and CDK-specific security guidelines.
    3.  Run the SAST tool automatically on every commit or pull request to the `infrastructure` repository containing CDK code.
    4.  Set up the CI/CD pipeline to fail or generate warnings if the SAST tool detects high or medium severity security issues in CDK code.
    5.  Establish a process for reviewing and addressing findings from the SAST tool, prioritizing critical and high severity issues related to CDK configurations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to refine Checkov configuration with CDK-specific rules and ensure comprehensive coverage of CDK security guidelines. Integrate SAST results more tightly into the development workflow for issue tracking and resolution related to CDK code findings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Least Privilege Principles in CDK Code](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_least_privilege_principles_in_cdk_code.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Design CDK stacks to grant only the minimum necessary permissions required for each AWS resource to function correctly, as defined in CDK code.
    2.  Avoid using wildcard actions (`*`) or resources (`*`) in IAM policies defined within CDK code.
    3.  Leverage CDK's constructs like `Grant` methods and `PolicyStatement` to create fine-grained IAM policies tailored to specific resource actions and ARNs within CDK code.
    4.  Utilize resource-based policies where applicable in CDK to further restrict access to resources defined in CDK.
    5.  Regularly review and refine IAM policies defined in CDK code as application requirements evolve to ensure they remain least privileged.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity): Reducing the potential impact of compromised resources deployed by CDK by limiting their permissions defined in CDK.
    *   Lateral Movement (Medium Severity): Restricting the ability of attackers to move between resources deployed by CDK by limiting permissions defined in CDK.

    *   Infrastructure Misconfiguration (Medium Severity): Hardening infrastructure configurations beyond default settings using CDK.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach due to Lack of Encryption: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of data breaches by enabling encryption in CDK.
    *   Unauthorized Access due to Open Network Access: High Reduction - Prevents unauthorized access by restricting network access configured in CDK.
    *   Privilege Escalation due to Weak Resource Policies: Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk of escalation by strengthening resource policies defined in CDK.
    *   Infrastructure Misconfiguration: Medium Reduction - Improves overall infrastructure security posture through hardening configurations in CDK.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Encryption is enabled for some resources deployed by CDK, and basic network controls are in place. More comprehensive security hardening across all CDK stacks is needed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Develop a checklist of security hardening measures for common CDK constructs. Provide training to developers on security hardening techniques in CDK. Implement automated checks (SAST, custom scripts) to verify security hardening configurations in CDK code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Never Hardcode Secrets in CDK Code](./mitigation_strategies/never_hardcode_secrets_in_cdk_code.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Absolutely avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys, passwords, database credentials, or certificates directly in CDK code.
    2.  Do not embed secrets in CDK stack definitions, resource properties, or environment variables within CDK code.
    3.  Refrain from logging secrets or printing them to console output during CDK deployments or application runtime initiated by CDK.
    4.  Educate developers on the severe security risks of hardcoding secrets in CDK code and enforce policies against this practice.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Secrets in Version Control (High Severity): Preventing secrets from being committed to version control systems through CDK code.
    *   Secret Leakage through Logs or Output (High Severity): Avoiding unintentional disclosure of secrets in logs or console output from CDK deployments.
    *   Credential Theft (High Severity): Reducing the risk of credential theft if CDK code is compromised or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Secrets in Version Control: High Reduction - Eliminates the risk of version control exposure by prohibiting hardcoding secrets in CDK code.
    *   Secret Leakage through Logs or Output: High Reduction - Prevents leakage through logs and output by avoiding hardcoding and logging secrets in CDK deployments.
    *   Credential Theft: High Reduction - Significantly reduces credential theft risk by not embedding secrets in CDK code.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Generally implemented. Developers are aware of the risks of hardcoding secrets in CDK code, and code reviews aim to catch such instances.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement automated checks (SAST, secret scanning tools) to detect hardcoded secrets in CDK code and prevent commits containing them. Reinforce training on secure secrets management and the dangers of hardcoding in CDK context.
