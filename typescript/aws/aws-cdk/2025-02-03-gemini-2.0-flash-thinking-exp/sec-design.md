# BUSINESS POSTURE

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) project aims to provide a developer-friendly way to define cloud infrastructure as code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. It allows developers to use familiar programming languages to define their infrastructure, abstracting away the complexities of raw CloudFormation templates.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify cloud infrastructure management for developers.
  - Increase developer productivity by using familiar programming languages for infrastructure as code.
  - Promote best practices and reusable infrastructure patterns through CDK constructs.
  - Accelerate cloud adoption and innovation on the AWS platform.
  - Reduce errors and inconsistencies in infrastructure deployments compared to manual configuration or raw CloudFormation.
  - Enable easier testing and version control of infrastructure configurations.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the CDK framework could lead to widespread misconfigurations and security breaches in AWS customer environments.
  - Complexity of the CDK framework might lead to misuse or unintended consequences if not properly understood.
  - Dependency on the CDK framework could create vendor lock-in if not carefully managed.
  - Bugs or limitations in CDK could delay project timelines or require workarounds.
  - Open-source nature of the project requires community trust and reliance on the maintainers for security and stability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) - Implemented by AWS for all its services and open-source projects. Described in internal AWS security documentation and general AWS security best practices.
  - security control: Code Reviews - Implemented via GitHub pull requests and AWS internal code review processes. Described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines and AWS internal development processes.
  - security control: Static Code Analysis - Likely implemented using internal AWS tools and potentially integrated into the build pipeline. Not publicly documented in detail but standard practice for AWS projects.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Likely implemented using internal AWS tools to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies. Not publicly documented in detail but standard practice for AWS projects.
  - security control: Build Pipeline Security - Implemented using AWS CodeBuild and other AWS services with IAM roles and access controls. Described in AWS documentation for CodeBuild and CI/CD best practices.
  - security control: Access Control to Repository - Implemented via GitHub permissions and AWS IAM for internal access. Described in GitHub documentation and AWS IAM documentation.
  - security control: Infrastructure as Code Security Scanning - While not explicitly stated for CDK itself, AWS provides services like AWS Security Hub and AWS Config that can be used to scan deployed infrastructure based on CloudFormation templates generated by CDK. Described in AWS Security Hub and AWS Config documentation.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature implies public code visibility, potentially increasing the attack surface if vulnerabilities are discovered before patches are available. Mitigation is through proactive security practices and community engagement.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party dependencies introduces supply chain risks. Mitigation is through dependency scanning and careful dependency management.
  - accepted risk: Complexity of the framework might lead to misconfigurations by users. Mitigation is through comprehensive documentation, examples, and best practices guidance.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Supply Chain Security Hardening - Implement measures to verify the integrity and provenance of dependencies, potentially using tools like sigstore or similar mechanisms for verifying package signatures.
  - security control: Infrastructure as Code Security Scanning (Pre-deployment) - Integrate security scanning tools into the CDK build process to analyze generated CloudFormation templates for security misconfigurations before deployment. Tools like `cfn-lint` or commercial IaC security scanners can be used.
  - security control: Runtime Security Monitoring for CDK Applications - Provide guidance and examples for users on how to implement runtime security monitoring for applications deployed using CDK, leveraging AWS security services like CloudWatch, GuardDuty, and Security Hub.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: CDK CLI operations that interact with AWS services must be authenticated using valid AWS credentials.
    - Requirement: Access to the CDK GitHub repository and build systems should be authenticated and authorized.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: CDK CLI operations should respect AWS IAM permissions of the authenticated user or role.
    - Requirement: CDK constructs should enforce least privilege principles when creating IAM roles and policies for deployed resources.
    - Requirement: Access to CDK repository and build systems should be authorized based on roles and responsibilities.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: CDK CLI should validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: CDK constructs should validate user-provided properties to ensure they are within expected ranges and formats, preventing unexpected behavior or security issues in generated CloudFormation templates.
    - Requirement: CDK should validate dependencies and external resources to prevent supply chain attacks.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data handled by CDK, such as API keys or secrets, should be encrypted at rest and in transit.
    - Requirement: CDK should provide mechanisms for users to easily integrate encryption into their infrastructure deployments, such as using AWS KMS for key management and encryption of data at rest and in transit for services like S3, EBS, and RDS.
    - Requirement: Secrets management should be integrated with CDK, encouraging users to use services like AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for storing and retrieving sensitive information instead of hardcoding them in CDK code.
