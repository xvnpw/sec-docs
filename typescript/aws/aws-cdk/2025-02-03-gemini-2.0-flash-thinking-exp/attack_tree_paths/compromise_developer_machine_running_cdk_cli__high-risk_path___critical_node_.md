### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Developer Machine Running CDK CLI

**Node:** Compromise Developer Machine Running CDK CLI [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Criticality:** CRITICAL

**Rationale:** This attack path is considered high-risk and critical because a compromised developer machine acts as a gateway to the entire infrastructure deployment pipeline. Developers using CDK CLI often possess significant privileges and access to sensitive AWS credentials necessary for deploying and managing infrastructure. Compromising this node allows attackers to bypass many traditional security controls focused on the deployed infrastructure itself, as the attack originates from within a trusted environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker compromises a developer's machine that is used to run the CDK CLI and deploy infrastructure. This can be achieved through various methods like phishing, malware, social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the developer's machine.

    *   **Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Phishing:**
            *   **Spear Phishing Emails:** Targeted emails disguised as legitimate communications (e.g., from IT support, colleagues, or trusted vendors) containing malicious links or attachments designed to install malware or steal credentials.
            *   **Watering Hole Attacks:** Compromising websites frequently visited by developers to inject malicious code that exploits browser vulnerabilities or tricks users into downloading malware.
        *   **Malware:**
            *   **Drive-by Downloads:** Unintentional malware downloads from compromised websites, often exploiting browser or plugin vulnerabilities.
            *   **Malicious Software Packages:**  Compromised or malicious software packages downloaded from package managers (e.g., npm, pip) or third-party repositories, potentially introduced through supply chain attacks.
            *   **Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities:**  Targeting known vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or browser extensions installed on the developer's machine.
        *   **Social Engineering:**
            *   **Pretexting:**  Creating a fabricated scenario to trick the developer into revealing sensitive information (e.g., AWS credentials, passwords) or performing actions that compromise their machine (e.g., installing remote access software).
            *   **Baiting:** Offering something enticing (e.g., free software, access to restricted resources) to lure the developer into clicking a malicious link or downloading malware.
            *   **Quid Pro Quo:** Offering a service or benefit in exchange for information or actions that compromise the machine (e.g., posing as IT support and requesting credentials to "fix" an issue).
        *   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Developer Machine:**
            *   **Unpatched Operating System and Software:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated operating systems, applications, or libraries.
            *   **Insecure Configurations:** Weak passwords, default configurations, or disabled security features on the developer machine.
            *   **Physical Access:**  Gaining unauthorized physical access to the developer's machine to install malware, steal credentials, or modify system settings (less likely but still a potential vector in some scenarios).

**Exploitation:**

*   **Exploitation:**
    *   **Steal AWS Credentials:** Extract AWS credentials stored on the compromised machine (e.g., in AWS CLI configuration files, environment variables, or session tokens).
    *   **Modify CDK Code:** Alter the CDK code to inject malicious resources, backdoors, or insecure configurations into the deployed infrastructure.
    *   **Initiate Malicious Deployments:** Use the stolen credentials and potentially modified CDK code to deploy compromised infrastructure to the AWS account.

    *   **Detailed Breakdown of Exploitation Techniques:**
        *   **Steal AWS Credentials:**
            *   **Accessing AWS CLI Configuration Files:** Attackers can target files like `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` which often store AWS access keys and secret access keys.
            *   **Harvesting Environment Variables:**  Credentials might be stored as environment variables (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) for easier access by CDK CLI.
            *   **Extracting Session Tokens:**  If developers use temporary credentials (e.g., via `aws sts assume-role`), session tokens might be cached in memory or temporary files, which can be extracted.
            *   **Credential Caching Tools:** If developers use credential management tools like `aws-vault`, attackers might attempt to compromise these tools or their caches to steal credentials.
            *   **Memory Scraping:** In more sophisticated attacks, malware could attempt to directly scrape credentials from the memory of running processes.
        *   **Modify CDK Code:**
            *   **Direct Code Modification:** Attackers can directly modify CDK code files (e.g., `.ts` or `.py` files) within the developer's project repository to inject malicious resources or alter configurations.
            *   **Dependency Manipulation:**  Attackers could compromise or replace dependencies used by the CDK project (e.g., npm packages, Python libraries) to inject malicious code that gets executed during deployment.
            *   **Configuration File Tampering:** Modifying CDK configuration files (e.g., `cdk.json`, `tsconfig.json`) to alter deployment behavior or introduce vulnerabilities.
            *   **Backdoor Injection:** Injecting code that creates backdoors in the deployed infrastructure, such as:
                *   Creating EC2 instances with SSH keys controlled by the attacker.
                *   Adding IAM roles with overly permissive policies that the attacker can assume.
                *   Modifying security groups to allow unauthorized access.
                *   Introducing vulnerable or malicious Lambda functions.
        *   **Initiate Malicious Deployments:**
            *   **Direct CDK CLI Deployment:** Using the stolen AWS credentials and potentially modified CDK code, the attacker can execute `cdk deploy` commands to deploy compromised infrastructure to the AWS account.
            *   **Automated Pipeline Exploitation:** If the developer's machine is part of a CI/CD pipeline, the attacker could leverage the compromised machine to trigger malicious deployments through the pipeline, potentially automating the attack and increasing its scale.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact:** Full control over deployments, potential injection of backdoors into the infrastructure, data exfiltration, and widespread compromise of the application and its environment.

    *   **Detailed Breakdown of Potential Impacts:**
        *   **Full Control over Deployments:**  The attacker gains the ability to deploy, modify, and delete any infrastructure resource within the AWS account managed by the compromised CDK project. This includes compute resources (EC2, Lambda), storage (S3, EBS), databases (RDS, DynamoDB), networking (VPC, subnets), and security configurations (IAM, Security Groups).
        *   **Potential Injection of Backdoors:**  Attackers can establish persistent backdoors within the infrastructure, allowing them to maintain long-term access even after the initial compromise is detected or remediated. This can be achieved through injected code, compromised IAM roles, or persistent access mechanisms within deployed resources.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:**  With control over the infrastructure, attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored within the AWS environment. This could include customer data, application secrets, intellectual property, and other confidential information stored in databases, S3 buckets, or other data stores.
        *   **Widespread Compromise of Application and Environment:**  A successful attack can lead to a complete compromise of the application and its underlying infrastructure. This can result in:
            *   **Service Disruption and Outages:**  Attackers can intentionally disrupt services, leading to downtime and loss of availability.
            *   **Data Breaches and Confidentiality Loss:**  Exfiltration of sensitive data can lead to significant financial and reputational damage.
            *   **Integrity Compromise:**  Modification of data or application logic can lead to incorrect or malicious behavior.
            *   **Financial Losses:**  Direct financial losses due to data breaches, service disruptions, and remediation costs, as well as potential regulatory fines and legal liabilities.
            *   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and damage to the organization's reputation.
            *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** If the compromised application or infrastructure is part of a larger supply chain, the compromise can propagate to downstream customers or partners.
