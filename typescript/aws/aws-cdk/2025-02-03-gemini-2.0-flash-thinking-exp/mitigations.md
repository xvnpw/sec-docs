# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for aws/aws-cdk

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Static Code Analysis for CDK Code](./mitigation_strategies/implement_static_code_analysis_for_cdk_code.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Static Code Analysis for CDK Code
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Static Analysis Tool:** Select a static analysis tool compatible with your CDK language (TypeScript or Python). Examples include ESLint with security plugins for TypeScript, or Bandit and Semgrep for Python.
    2.  **Configure Security Rules:** Configure the chosen tool with rules specifically designed to detect security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in infrastructure-as-code, focusing on CDK constructs and patterns. Focus on rules that identify:
        *   Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) within CDK code.
        *   Insecure default configurations for AWS resources as defined in CDK (e.g., public S3 buckets, unencrypted databases).
        *   Overly permissive IAM policies and roles generated by CDK.
        *   Potential injection vulnerabilities within CDK logic related to resource naming or property manipulation.
    3.  **Integrate into Development Environment:** Integrate the static analysis tool into developer IDEs (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) to provide immediate feedback during CDK code writing.
    4.  **Integrate into CI/CD Pipeline:** Incorporate the tool into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan CDK code on every commit, pull request, or build. Configure the pipeline to fail if critical security violations are detected in the CDK code.
    5.  **Establish Remediation Workflow:** Define a process for addressing and remediating security findings identified by the static analysis tool specifically for CDK code issues.
    6.  **Regularly Update Rules:** Keep the static analysis tool's ruleset updated to incorporate new security best practices, vulnerability patterns, and CDK framework updates relevant to IaC.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Hardcoded Secrets (High Severity):** Developers accidentally embed sensitive credentials directly in the CDK code, which can be exposed in version control or deployment artifacts generated by CDK.
    *   **Insecure Defaults (Medium Severity):** CDK code uses default resource configurations that are not secure, leading to vulnerabilities like publicly accessible resources or unencrypted data deployed by CDK.
    *   **IAM Policy Misconfigurations (Medium Severity):** CDK code creates overly permissive IAM roles or policies, granting excessive privileges to resources provisioned by CDK and potentially leading to privilege escalation.
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities in CDK Logic (Low Severity):** While less common in CDK, dynamic string construction for resource names or properties based on external input within CDK code could introduce injection points.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Hardcoded Secrets (High):** High impact. Significantly reduces the risk of accidental secret exposure in CDK code by proactively identifying and preventing commits containing secrets.
    *   **Insecure Defaults (Medium):** Medium impact. Reduces the likelihood of deploying insecurely configured resources defined by CDK by highlighting and enforcing secure configurations within the CDK code.
    *   **IAM Policy Misconfigurations (Medium):** Medium impact. Reduces the risk of overly permissive access in CDK-generated IAM policies by identifying and prompting correction of IAM policy issues early in the CDK development cycle.
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities in CDK Logic (Low):** Low impact. Provides some detection of potential injection points within CDK code, but might require more specialized rules and manual review for complex CDK scenarios.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. ESLint is used for code style checks in the TypeScript CDK project, integrated into developer IDEs and CI/CD pipeline for basic linting of CDK code.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Security-focused rules and plugins for ESLint are not fully configured to detect CDK-specific security vulnerabilities. CI/CD pipeline integration needs to be enhanced to fail builds on security rule violations in CDK code and enforce remediation workflows for CDK-related issues.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Conduct Regular Code Reviews of CDK Infrastructure Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/conduct_regular_code_reviews_of_cdk_infrastructure_definitions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Conduct Regular Code Reviews of CDK Infrastructure Definitions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Implement a mandatory code review process for all changes to CDK code before they are merged into the main branch or deployed via CDK.
    2.  **Security-Focused Reviewers:** Ensure that code reviewers possess security expertise and are trained on CDK security best practices and secure infrastructure patterns *specifically within the context of CDK*.
    3.  **Review Checklist:** Develop a security-focused checklist for code reviews, specifically tailored for CDK code, covering aspects like:
        *   IAM policy and role definitions *within CDK* (least privilege, resource constraints).
        *   Network configurations *defined in CDK* (security groups, NACLs, VPC settings).
        *   Resource policies *managed by CDK* (S3 bucket policies, KMS key policies).
        *   Encryption settings *configured through CDK* (at rest and in transit).
        *   Logging and monitoring configurations *defined in CDK*.
        *   Secrets management practices *within the CDK application*.
        *   Compliance with organizational security policies and standards *as implemented in CDK*.
    4.  **Peer Review Process:** Utilize a peer review process where at least one other developer (preferably with security knowledge in CDK and IaC) reviews each CDK code change.
    5.  **Documentation and Tracking:** Document code review findings and track their resolution, specifically focusing on issues identified in CDK code. Use code review tools to manage the process and ensure accountability for CDK changes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Misconfigurations (Medium to High Severity):** Human errors in CDK code can lead to security misconfigurations in the deployed infrastructure that are not caught by automated tools alone. Code reviews of CDK definitions can identify these errors before deployment via CDK.
    *   **Logical Vulnerabilities in Infrastructure Design (Medium Severity):** Code reviews of CDK code can help identify flaws in the overall infrastructure design from a security perspective, as defined and implemented through CDK, such as unnecessary public exposure or weak security boundaries created by CDK constructs.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** Code reviews of CDK definitions can ensure that infrastructure definitions comply with organizational security policies and industry best practices *as implemented using CDK*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Misconfigurations (Medium to High):** Medium to High impact. Significantly reduces the risk of deploying misconfigured infrastructure via CDK by adding a human review layer to catch errors in CDK code missed by automation.
    *   **Logical Vulnerabilities in Infrastructure Design (Medium):** Medium impact. Helps identify and correct design flaws in CDK-defined infrastructure that could lead to security weaknesses.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium):** Medium impact. Increases adherence to security policies and standards by proactively reviewing CDK code for compliance.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Code reviews are mandatory for all code changes, including CDK code, using pull requests in Git.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Security expertise specifically in CDK and IaC security is not consistently represented in code reviews. A formal security-focused checklist specifically for CDK code reviews is missing. Training on CDK security best practices for reviewers is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Unit and Integration Testing for CDK Constructs](./mitigation_strategies/unit_and_integration_testing_for_cdk_constructs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Unit and Integration Testing for CDK Constructs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Unit Tests for Constructs:** Write unit tests for individual CDK constructs to validate their behavior and security configurations in isolation. Focus unit tests on:
        *   IAM role and policy generation *within CDK constructs* (verify least privilege).
        *   Security group rule configurations *defined in CDK constructs* (verify intended network access).
        *   Resource property settings *within CDK constructs* (verify encryption, logging, etc.).
        *   Input validation and error handling within *custom CDK constructs*.
    2.  **Integration Tests for Deployed Infrastructure (CDK-Deployed):** Implement integration tests that deploy a test stack based on your CDK code and verify the security posture of the deployed infrastructure. Focus integration tests on:
        *   IAM permissions in action *for CDK-deployed resources* (verify resources can only access what they are intended to).
        *   Network connectivity *of CDK-deployed infrastructure* (verify intended network access and restrictions).
        *   Resource policies *of CDK-deployed resources* (verify access control to resources like S3 buckets).
        *   Compliance with security requirements *for CDK-deployed infrastructure* (e.g., encryption enabled, logging configured).
    3.  **Automated Test Execution:** Integrate unit and integration tests into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests on every commit, pull request, or build *related to CDK code changes*. Configure the pipeline to fail if tests fail.
    4.  **Test Coverage:** Aim for reasonable test coverage of security-critical aspects of your CDK code. Prioritize testing for IAM, network configurations, and resource policies *defined in CDK*.
    5.  **Regular Test Review and Updates:** Regularly review and update tests to reflect changes in CDK code, security requirements, and infrastructure design *as implemented in CDK*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Misconfigurations due to Code Errors (Medium to High Severity):** Errors in CDK code logic can lead to security misconfigurations in deployed infrastructure that are not easily detected by static analysis or code reviews alone. Testing CDK constructs helps catch these errors.
    *   **Unexpected Infrastructure Behavior (Medium Severity):** Testing verifies that the infrastructure deployed by CDK behaves as intended from a security perspective, reducing the risk of unexpected vulnerabilities due to CDK misconfigurations.
    *   **Regression in Security Configurations (Medium Severity):** Tests help prevent regressions in security configurations when CDK code is modified or updated over time, ensuring consistent security in CDK-managed infrastructure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Misconfigurations due to Code Errors (Medium to High):** Medium to High impact. Significantly reduces the risk of deploying misconfigured infrastructure via CDK due to coding errors by providing automated verification of security configurations defined in CDK.
    *   **Unexpected Infrastructure Behavior (Medium):** Medium impact. Increases confidence in the security posture of CDK-deployed infrastructure by verifying intended behavior.
    *   **Regression in Security Configurations (Medium):** Medium impact. Helps maintain a consistent security posture over time for CDK-managed infrastructure by preventing unintended security regressions in CDK code.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic unit tests exist for some core CDK constructs, primarily focused on functional correctness, not security. Integration tests for CDK-deployed infrastructure are not implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Security-focused unit tests for CDK constructs are largely missing. Integration tests for verifying deployed infrastructure security *specifically deployed by CDK* are completely absent. Test automation and CI/CD integration for security tests of CDK code need to be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Least Privilege IAM Principles in CDK](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_least_privilege_iam_principles_in_cdk.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Least Privilege IAM Principles in CDK
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default Deny Approach (in CDK):** Start with a default deny approach for IAM policies *defined within CDK*. Grant permissions only when explicitly necessary in your CDK code.
    2.  **Granular Permissions (in CDK):** Utilize CDK's IAM constructs (e.g., `PolicyStatement`, `Role`, `Policy`) to define granular permissions *within your CDK code*. Avoid using wildcard actions (`*`) and resources (`*`) whenever possible in CDK IAM definitions.
    3.  **Resource-Specific Permissions (in CDK):** Specify resource ARNs in IAM policies *generated by CDK* to restrict actions to specific resources instead of all resources of a given type.
    4.  **Action-Specific Permissions (in CDK):** Grant only the necessary actions required for a specific task or resource *in CDK-defined IAM policies*. Avoid granting broad action sets like `ec2:*` or `s3:*` in CDK.
    5.  **Principle of Least Privilege Review (for CDK IAM):** Regularly review and refine IAM policies generated by CDK to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege. Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify overly permissive policies *created by CDK*.
    6.  **Custom IAM Policies (in CDK):** Create custom IAM policies tailored to the specific needs of your application and infrastructure components *within CDK* instead of relying solely on managed policies, which may be overly broad when used in CDK.
    7.  **CDK Best Practices:** Follow CDK best practices for IAM management, such as using `grant` methods on resources to automatically generate least privilege policies *within CDK*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Overly permissive IAM policies *defined in CDK* can allow attackers to escalate their privileges within the AWS environment, gaining access to sensitive resources or performing unauthorized actions on CDK-managed infrastructure.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** Excessive permissions *granted by CDK-defined IAM policies* can facilitate lateral movement within the AWS environment if an attacker compromises one resource, allowing them to access other CDK-managed resources they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Overly broad data access permissions *defined in CDK IAM policies* can increase the risk of data breaches if an attacker gains access to a resource with excessive data access privileges granted by CDK.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High):** High impact. Significantly reduces the risk of privilege escalation in CDK-managed infrastructure by enforcing granular and restrictive IAM policies *defined within CDK*.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium):** Medium impact. Reduces the potential for lateral movement within CDK-managed infrastructure by limiting the scope of permissions and restricting access to only necessary resources *through CDK IAM policies*.
    *   **Data Breaches (High):** High impact. Reduces the risk of data breaches in CDK-managed resources by limiting data access to only authorized resources and roles *via CDK IAM policies*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of least privilege principles, but wildcard permissions are sometimes used for convenience in CDK code. IAM policies generated by CDK are not consistently reviewed for adherence to least privilege.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal guidelines and training on least privilege IAM *specifically in CDK* are needed. Automated checks (e.g., static analysis rules, custom CDK Aspects) to enforce least privilege *in CDK IAM definitions* are missing. Regular IAM policy reviews and audits *of CDK-generated policies* are not consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize CDK Aspects for Security Policy Enforcement](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_cdk_aspects_for_security_policy_enforcement.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize CDK Aspects for Security Policy Enforcement
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Security Policies (for CDK Enforcement):** Define organizational security policies that can be enforced through infrastructure-as-code *using CDK Aspects*. Examples include:
        *   Mandatory encryption at rest for all storage resources *deployed by CDK*.
        *   Enabling server-side encryption for S3 buckets *created by CDK*.
        *   Enforcing HTTPS for all load balancers *defined in CDK*.
        *   Requiring logging for specific resource types *provisioned by CDK*.
        *   Restricting public access to certain resource types *managed by CDK*.
    2.  **Develop Custom CDK Aspects:** Create custom CDK Aspects to automatically apply these security policies to your infrastructure definitions *within CDK*. Aspects can traverse the CDK construct tree and modify resource properties to enforce policies *during CDK synthesis*.
    3.  **Aspect Implementation Examples:**
        *   **Encryption Aspect:** Aspect to iterate through all `Bucket` constructs *in CDK code* and enforce server-side encryption.
        *   **HTTPS Aspect:** Aspect to iterate through all `LoadBalancer` constructs *in CDK code* and enforce HTTPS listeners.
        *   **Logging Aspect:** Aspect to iterate through relevant resource types (e.g., `Bucket`, `DatabaseInstance`) *in CDK code* and enable logging.
        *   **Public Access Restriction Aspect:** Aspect to iterate through resources *in CDK code* and restrict public access by default.
    4.  **Apply Aspects to Stacks:** Apply the custom security Aspects to your CDK stacks to automatically enforce the defined policies during stack synthesis *within CDK*.
    5.  **Aspect Testing:** Write unit tests for your custom Aspects to ensure they correctly enforce the intended security policies *within the CDK context*.
    6.  **Aspect Maintenance:** Regularly review and update Aspects to reflect changes in security policies, CDK framework updates, and new resource types *supported by CDK*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Policy Violations (Medium to High Severity):** Inconsistent or missing enforcement of security policies across infrastructure *deployed by CDK* can lead to vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
    *   **Configuration Drift from Security Standards (Medium Severity):** Manual configurations or deviations from IaC *outside of CDK Aspects* can lead to drift from established security standards over time for CDK-managed infrastructure.
    *   **Human Error in Policy Enforcement (Medium Severity):** Manual enforcement of security policies *outside of CDK Aspects* is prone to human error and inconsistencies in CDK-managed infrastructure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Policy Violations (Medium to High):** High impact. Significantly reduces the risk of security policy violations in CDK-deployed infrastructure by automating policy enforcement across all CDK-defined infrastructure.
    *   **Configuration Drift from Security Standards (Medium):** Medium impact. Helps maintain consistent security configurations and reduces drift in CDK-managed infrastructure by automatically applying policies during CDK deployment.
    *   **Human Error in Policy Enforcement (Medium):** Medium impact. Reduces human error in policy enforcement for CDK-managed infrastructure by automating policy application and ensuring consistent application of security standards through CDK Aspects.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. CDK Aspects are not currently used for security policy enforcement in the project.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Custom CDK Aspects need to be developed to enforce key security policies *within the CDK framework*. A process for defining, implementing, and maintaining security Aspects needs to be established *for CDK projects*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/implement_infrastructure_as_code__iac__security_scanning.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Scanning
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose an IaC Security Scanner:** Select a dedicated IaC security scanning tool (e.g., Checkov, Terrascan, Bridgecrew, Snyk Infrastructure as Code) that supports AWS CDK and your chosen CDK language.
    2.  **Configure Scanner Rules (for CDK):** Configure the IaC security scanner with rules that align with security best practices for AWS and CDK. Focus on rules that detect:
        *   Overly permissive security groups and NACLs *defined in CDK*.
        *   Exposed storage buckets (S3, EBS) *configured by CDK*.
        *   Insecure server configurations (e.g., unencrypted instances, public AMIs) *defined in CDK*.
        *   Missing security controls (e.g., logging, encryption) *in CDK definitions*.
        *   Compliance violations (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) *as they relate to CDK-defined infrastructure*.
    3.  **Integrate into CI/CD Pipeline (for CDK):** Integrate the IaC security scanner into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan CDK code for security misconfigurations before deployment. Configure the pipeline to fail if critical security violations are detected in the CDK code by the scanner.
    4.  **Remediation Workflow (for IaC Scan Findings):** Establish a process for addressing and remediating security findings identified by the IaC security scanner *specifically for CDK code issues*. This includes assigning ownership, tracking progress, and verifying fixes in CDK code.
    5.  **Scanner Rule Updates:** Regularly update the IaC security scanner's ruleset to incorporate new security best practices, vulnerability patterns, and AWS service updates *relevant to CDK and IaC security*.
    6.  **Policy Exceptions (Controlled - for IaC Scanning):** Implement a controlled process for managing exceptions to IaC security scanning rules when deviations are necessary and justified *within the context of CDK deployments*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Misconfigurations in Infrastructure (Medium to High Severity):** CDK code may contain security misconfigurations that are not caught by static code analysis or code reviews alone. IaC security scanning of CDK code provides a dedicated layer of defense.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** IaC security scanning of CDK code can help ensure that infrastructure definitions comply with industry standards and regulatory requirements *as implemented through CDK*.
    *   **Drift from Security Baselines (Medium Severity):** While primarily focused on pre-deployment scanning of CDK code, IaC security scanning can help establish and maintain security baselines for infrastructure configurations *defined in CDK*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Misconfigurations in Infrastructure (Medium to High):** High impact. Significantly reduces the risk of deploying misconfigured infrastructure via CDK by proactively identifying and preventing security issues in CDK code before deployment.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium):** Medium impact. Increases adherence to compliance standards by automatically checking infrastructure configurations defined in CDK against compliance rules.
    *   **Drift from Security Baselines (Medium):** Medium impact. Helps establish and maintain security baselines for CDK-defined infrastructure by providing a mechanism to verify CDK configurations against defined standards.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Dedicated IaC security scanning tools are not currently used to scan CDK code in the project's CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Missing Implementation:** An IaC security scanning tool needs to be selected, configured to scan CDK code, and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. A remediation workflow for scanner findings related to CDK code needs to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Secrets Management within CDK](./mitigation_strategies/secure_secrets_management_within_cdk.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Secrets Management within CDK
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets (in CDK Applications):** Identify all secrets required by your CDK application and infrastructure *defined by CDK* (e.g., database passwords, API keys, OAuth tokens, TLS certificates).
    2.  **Centralized Secrets Storage:** Utilize a centralized and secure secrets management service like AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (SecureString) to store and manage secrets *used in your CDK application*.
    3.  **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets (in CDK Code):** **Never hardcode secrets directly into CDK code, configuration files, or environment variables *used by CDK applications*.**
    4.  **Retrieve Secrets at Runtime (in CDK Applications):** Retrieve secrets dynamically at runtime within your CDK application using mechanisms provided by CDK and AWS SDKs.
        *   Use `SecretValue.secretsManager()` to retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager *within CDK code*.
        *   Use `SecretValue.ssmSecureParameter()` to retrieve secrets from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (SecureString) *within CDK code*.
    5.  **IAM Access Control for Secrets:** Implement strict IAM access control policies to restrict access to secrets stored in Secrets Manager or Parameter Store. Grant access only to authorized roles and resources *managed by CDK* that require the secrets.
    6.  **Secret Rotation (if applicable):** Implement secret rotation for sensitive secrets (e.g., database passwords) *used in CDK applications* to reduce the impact of compromised credentials. Secrets Manager provides built-in secret rotation capabilities.
    7.  **Audit Logging for Secret Access:** Enable audit logging for access to secrets in Secrets Manager or Parameter Store to track who is accessing secrets and when *within the context of CDK application usage*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Hardcoded Secrets (High Severity):** Hardcoding secrets in CDK code or configuration files exposes them in version control, deployment artifacts generated by CDK, and potentially logs, leading to credential compromise.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets (High Severity):** If secrets used by CDK applications are not securely managed and access is not properly controlled, unauthorized users or resources could gain access to sensitive credentials.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Hardcoded Secrets (High):** High impact. Eliminates the risk of hardcoded secret exposure in CDK code by enforcing the use of secure secrets management services for CDK applications.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets (High):** High impact. Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized secret access for CDK applications by centralizing secrets management and enforcing strict access control.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. AWS Secrets Manager is used for some database passwords in CDK applications, but some API keys are still managed via environment variables or configuration files. Hardcoding in CDK code is generally avoided, but vigilance is required.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent and comprehensive use of Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for all secrets *used by CDK applications* is missing. A formal policy and process for secrets management in CDK projects needs to be established and enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Establish a Process for Managing Infrastructure Changes via CDK](./mitigation_strategies/establish_a_process_for_managing_infrastructure_changes_via_cdk.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Establish a Process for Managing Infrastructure Changes via CDK
*   **Description:**
    1.  **CDK-First Approach:** Promote a "CDK-first" approach to infrastructure management. All infrastructure changes should ideally be made through CDK code and deployed via your CI/CD pipeline *using CDK*.
    2.  **Discourage Manual Changes (Outside of CDK):** Discourage or strictly control manual changes to infrastructure outside of CDK. Implement technical controls (e.g., IAM permissions) and organizational policies to prevent or limit manual changes *to CDK-managed infrastructure*.
    3.  **Document Manual Changes (if necessary):** If manual changes are absolutely necessary (e.g., for emergency troubleshooting), ensure they are properly documented, justified, and tracked *in relation to the CDK-managed infrastructure*.
    4.  **Incorporate Manual Changes into CDK:** Establish a process for incorporating necessary manual changes back into your CDK codebase as soon as possible. This ensures that the CDK code remains the source of truth for infrastructure configuration *managed by CDK*.
    5.  **Version Control for CDK Code:** Use version control (e.g., Git) to track all changes to CDK code. This provides an audit trail of infrastructure modifications *made through CDK* and allows for easy rollback if needed.
    6.  **CI/CD Pipeline for Deployments (CDK-Based):** Utilize a robust CI/CD pipeline for deploying CDK applications. This ensures consistent and repeatable deployments *via CDK*, reduces human error, and facilitates automated security checks *for CDK deployments*.
    7.  **Training and Awareness:** Provide training and awareness to development and operations teams on the importance of managing infrastructure through CDK and the risks associated with manual changes *to CDK-managed infrastructure*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Configuration Drift (Medium to High Severity):** Manual changes outside of CDK are the primary cause of configuration drift in CDK-managed infrastructure, leading to security misconfigurations and inconsistencies.
    *   **Undocumented Infrastructure Changes (Medium Severity):** Manual changes to CDK-managed infrastructure are often poorly documented or not documented at all, making it difficult to understand the current infrastructure state and troubleshoot issues.
    *   **Inconsistent Security Posture (Medium Severity):** Manual changes to CDK-managed infrastructure can lead to inconsistent security configurations across different environments or resources, weakening the overall security posture.
    *   **Human Error in Manual Configuration (Medium Severity):** Manual configuration of CDK-managed infrastructure is prone to human error, increasing the risk of security misconfigurations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration Drift (Medium to High):** High impact. Significantly reduces configuration drift in CDK-managed infrastructure by promoting CDK-based infrastructure management and discouraging manual changes.
    *   **Undocumented Infrastructure Changes (Medium):** Medium impact. Improves infrastructure documentation and reduces undocumented changes in CDK-managed infrastructure by making CDK code the primary source of truth.
    *   **Inconsistent Security Posture (Medium):** Medium impact. Promotes a more consistent security posture for CDK-managed infrastructure by enforcing IaC and reducing manual configuration variations.
    *   **Human Error in Manual Configuration (Medium):** Medium impact. Reduces human error in managing CDK-managed infrastructure by automating infrastructure deployments through CDK and CI/CD.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. CDK-first approach is encouraged, but manual changes to CDK-managed infrastructure are sometimes made for expediency. A formal process for incorporating manual changes back into CDK is lacking.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal policies and procedures to strictly control manual infrastructure changes *to CDK-managed infrastructure* are needed. A clear process for documenting and incorporating manual changes into CDK code needs to be established and enforced. Training on CDK-first principles and the risks of manual changes *to CDK-managed infrastructure* is required.
