#### 4.1. Threat Actors

Potential threat actors who might target a CI/CD pipeline include:

*   **External Attackers:**
    *   **Nation-State Actors:** Motivated by espionage, sabotage, or disruption of critical infrastructure.
    *   **Cybercriminals:** Financially motivated, seeking to steal data, inject ransomware, or utilize compromised resources for malicious activities.
    *   **Hacktivists:** Driven by ideological or political motives, aiming to disrupt services or deface systems.
*   **Malicious Insiders:**
    *   **Disgruntled Employees:** Seeking revenge or financial gain by sabotaging systems or stealing sensitive information.

*   **Supply Chain Attackers:**
    *   Attackers targeting third-party dependencies, plugins, or tools used within the CI/CD pipeline to inject malicious code indirectly into the deployment process.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors

Attackers can compromise a CI/CD pipeline through various attack vectors:

*   **Credential Compromise:**
    *   **Stolen Credentials:** Obtaining credentials for CI/CD systems, code repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), or AWS accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities.
    *   **Weak Credentials:** Exploiting weak or default passwords on CI/CD systems or related accounts.
*   **Vulnerability Exploitation:**
    *   **CI/CD Platform Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform itself (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
    *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in plugins or extensions used by the CI/CD platform.
    *   **Operating System and Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating systems or infrastructure hosting the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (CI/CD Dependencies):**
    *   **Compromised Dependencies:** Injecting malicious code into dependencies used by the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., npm packages, Python libraries, Docker images).
    *   **Malicious Plugins/Extensions:** Installing compromised or malicious plugins/extensions into the CI/CD platform.
*   **Insider Threats (Malicious or Negligent):**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Insiders intentionally injecting malicious code into the codebase or deployment scripts.
    *   **Misconfigurations:** Unintentional misconfigurations by insiders leading to security vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Social Engineering:**
    *   Tricking developers or operators into revealing credentials, installing malicious software, or performing actions that compromise the pipeline.
*   **Misconfigurations and Weak Security Practices:**
    *   **Weak Access Controls:** Insufficiently restrictive access controls for CI/CD systems, repositories, and AWS accounts.
    *   **Insecure Configurations:** Default or insecure configurations of CI/CD tools, lacking security hardening.
    *   **Overly Permissive IAM Roles:** Granting excessive permissions to IAM roles used by the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Lack of Security Auditing and Monitoring:** Insufficient logging and monitoring of CI/CD pipeline activities.
*   **Code Injection:**
    *   Directly injecting malicious code into the application codebase that is then deployed through the pipeline.

#### 4.3. Potential Impacts

A successful compromise of the CI/CD pipeline can lead to severe impacts:

*   **Unauthorized Infrastructure Modifications:**
    *   Attackers can modify CDK code or deployment scripts to create, modify, or delete AWS resources without authorization.
    *   This can lead to service disruption, data loss, unexpected costs, and security misconfigurations.
*   **Data Breaches:**
    *   Attackers can modify infrastructure to expose sensitive data stored in AWS services (e.g., S3 buckets, databases).
    *   Stolen credentials from the CI/CD pipeline can be used to directly access and exfiltrate sensitive data.
*   **Service Disruption:**
    *   Malicious infrastructure modifications or deployment process disruptions can lead to service outages and impact business operations.
    *   Attackers could introduce denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities through infrastructure changes.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (Downstream Impacts):**
    *   If the compromised pipeline is used to deploy software for customers or other internal teams, attackers can inject malicious code into these deployments, leading to wider supply chain attacks.
*   **Credential Theft and Lateral Movement:**
    *   Stolen AWS credentials from the CI/CD pipeline can be used to access other parts of the AWS environment, enabling lateral movement and further compromise.
*   **Reputational Damage:**
    *   Security breaches and service disruptions resulting from a compromised CI/CD pipeline can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Compliance Violations:**
    *   Data breaches and security incidents can lead to violations of regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS), resulting in fines and legal repercussions.
*   **Resource Hijacking:**
    *   Compromised CI/CD pipelines can be used to deploy cryptocurrency miners or other malicious workloads on AWS infrastructure, leading to unexpected costs and resource consumption.

#### 4.4. Specific Risks for CDK Applications

The "Compromised CI/CD Pipeline" threat is particularly critical for CDK applications due to:

*   **Infrastructure-as-Code Nature:** CDK relies on code to define and manage infrastructure. Compromising the pipeline allows attackers to directly manipulate this code, leading to large-scale and impactful infrastructure changes with a single malicious commit or pipeline modification.
*   **Automated Deployments Amplify Impact:** CDK pipelines automate infrastructure deployments. Malicious changes injected into the pipeline are automatically propagated to the AWS environment, potentially causing rapid and widespread damage across the entire infrastructure.
*   **IAM Role Misconfiguration Risks:** CDK deployments often involve IAM roles with significant permissions to manage AWS resources. If the CI/CD pipeline's IAM role is compromised, attackers can leverage these elevated permissions to perform extensive actions within the AWS account.
*   **Secrets Management Complexity:** Managing secrets within CDK code and CI/CD pipelines requires careful consideration. Improper handling of secrets can create vulnerabilities if these secrets are exposed through a compromised pipeline, leading to broader access to AWS resources.

#### 4.5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies
