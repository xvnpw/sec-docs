# Attack Surface Analysis for aws/aws-cdk

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded Secrets in CDK Code](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_secrets_in_cdk_code.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or tokens are directly embedded within the CDK code.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** CDK code defines infrastructure as code. Developers might mistakenly hardcode secrets within this code, treating it as configuration rather than sensitive data, especially when quickly prototyping or lacking security awareness.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes an API key for a third-party service directly into the CDK code while configuring an integration, instead of using a secure secret management solution. This code is then committed to a repository.
    *   **Impact:** Credential compromise, unauthorized access to external services or AWS resources if the secret is for AWS, data breaches, and potential lateral movement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Absolutely avoid hardcoding secrets in CDK code.**
        *   **Mandatory use of AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** for managing secrets. CDK provides seamless integration with these services.
        *   **Implement automated secret scanning tools** in CI/CD pipelines and developer pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of secrets.
        *   **Conduct regular code reviews** with a focus on identifying and removing any potential hardcoded secrets.
        *   **Educate development teams** on secure coding practices and the dangers of hardcoding secrets in IaC.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Flaws in Infrastructure Definition](./attack_surfaces/logic_flaws_in_infrastructure_definition.md)

*   **Description:** Errors in the CDK code logic lead to insecure infrastructure configurations, such as unintentionally creating publicly accessible resources or misconfigured security groups.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** CDK's abstraction, while simplifying infrastructure management, can also mask the underlying complexity. Developers might make logical errors in their CDK code that result in unintended security misconfigurations without fully grasping the implications of the generated CloudFormation or deployed resources.
    *   **Example:** A developer incorrectly configures an S3 bucket policy in CDK, intending to restrict access but accidentally making it publicly readable due to a logical error in the policy definition. This misconfiguration is deployed, exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, denial of service, compliance violations, and potential for exploitation of misconfigured services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement thorough code reviews** focusing on security aspects of infrastructure configurations defined in CDK.
        *   **Utilize infrastructure-as-code scanning tools** that can analyze CDK code for potential security misconfigurations and policy violations before deployment.
        *   **Employ automated security testing** of deployed infrastructure to validate configurations against security best practices and identify any deviations from intended secure states.
        *   **Leverage CDK's built-in validation and testing features** where applicable to catch logical errors early in the development process.
        *   **Promote modularity and reusability of secure CDK constructs** to reduce the likelihood of errors in common infrastructure patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Developer Workstations](./attack_surfaces/compromised_developer_workstations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a developer's workstation used for CDK development and deployment, gaining access to sensitive credentials and code.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** CDK CLI relies on AWS credentials configured on the developer's workstation to deploy and manage infrastructure. Compromising the workstation can directly expose these credentials, allowing attackers to manipulate the AWS environment via CDK.
    *   **Example:** A developer's workstation is compromised through malware. The attacker gains access to AWS credentials configured for the CDK CLI, enabling them to deploy malicious infrastructure, exfiltrate data, or disrupt services by modifying CDK deployments.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the AWS environment, infrastructure manipulation, data breaches, denial of service, and potential for long-term compromise if backdoors are deployed via CDK.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce strong endpoint security measures** on all developer workstations (antivirus, EDR, firewalls, disk encryption, regular patching).
        *   **Implement least privilege access** for developer accounts on workstations, limiting unnecessary administrative rights.
        *   **Mandatory use of multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all AWS accounts used with CDK CLI.
        *   **Consider using temporary credentials or session tokens** for CDK deployments instead of long-lived access keys stored directly on workstations.
        *   **Regularly train developers** on security best practices, phishing awareness, and the importance of workstation security.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure CI/CD Pipelines using CDK](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cicd_pipelines_using_cdk.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in CI/CD pipelines that automate CDK deployments allow attackers to compromise the infrastructure deployment process.
    *   **How AWS CDK Contributes:** CDK deployments are often automated through CI/CD pipelines. Insecurely configured pipelines become a direct and powerful attack vector to the entire infrastructure defined and managed by CDK, as they control the deployment process itself.
    *   **Example:** A CI/CD pipeline stores AWS credentials in plaintext environment variables or insecurely configured secret stores. An attacker gains access to the pipeline configuration or the pipeline execution environment and extracts these credentials, allowing them to inject malicious CDK code or directly manipulate the AWS environment.
    *   **Impact:** Full infrastructure compromise, unauthorized deployments of malicious infrastructure, data breaches, denial of service, and potential for persistent backdoors within the deployed environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Securely manage AWS credentials** within CI/CD pipelines using dedicated secret management solutions provided by the CI/CD platform or external services like AWS Secrets Manager. Avoid storing credentials as plaintext environment variables.
        *   **Implement robust access control** for CI/CD pipelines, strictly limiting access to authorized personnel and systems.
        *   **Harden CI/CD pipeline infrastructure** itself, ensuring secure configurations, regular patching, and vulnerability scanning of pipeline components.
        *   **Use secure pipeline scripting practices** to prevent vulnerabilities like command injection or insecure dependency management within pipeline scripts.
        *   **Implement pipeline security scanning and auditing** to detect misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized changes to pipeline definitions.
        *   **Separate pipeline environments** (e.g., development, staging, production) and enforce strict access controls and segregation between them.
