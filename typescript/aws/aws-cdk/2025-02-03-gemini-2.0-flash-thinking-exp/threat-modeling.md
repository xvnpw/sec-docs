# Threat Model Analysis for aws/aws-cdk

## Threat: [Hardcoded Secrets in CDK Code](./threats/hardcoded_secrets_in_cdk_code.md)

**Description:** Developers embed sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) directly in CDK code. An attacker gaining access to the code repository can extract these secrets.

**Impact:** Full compromise of affected AWS resources or external services accessed by the secrets. Data breaches, unauthorized access, and financial loss.

**Affected CDK Component:** CDK Code (Stacks, Constructs, Properties)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never hardcode secrets.
*   Use AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, or other secret management solutions.
*   Utilize CDK Context or Environment Variables to pass secrets securely.
*   Implement code scanning tools to detect hardcoded secrets.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive IAM Roles and Policies](./threats/overly_permissive_iam_roles_and_policies.md)

**Description:** CDK code defines IAM roles or policies granting excessive privileges. An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in a resource with such a role can escalate privileges and gain broader access to the AWS environment.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, and potential account takeover.

**Affected CDK Component:** CDK IAM Module (Roles, Policies, Users, Groups)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant only necessary permissions.
*   Use specific resource ARNs and actions in IAM policies instead of wildcards.
*   Regularly review and audit IAM policies defined in CDK code.
*   Utilize IAM Policy validation tools and linters.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Security Groups and Network ACLs](./threats/misconfiguration_of_security_groups_and_network_acls.md)

**Description:** CDK code incorrectly configures Security Groups or Network ACLs, opening up unintended ports or allowing access from unauthorized IP ranges. An attacker can exploit these misconfigurations to gain network access to vulnerable resources.

**Impact:** Unauthorized network access, data breaches, compromise of backend systems, and denial of service.

**Affected CDK Component:** CDK EC2 Module (Security Groups, Network ACLs)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Default Deny Principle: Configure to deny all traffic by default and explicitly allow only necessary traffic.
*   Use specific port ranges and source IP ranges in rules.
*   Regularly review and audit Security Group and Network ACL configurations in CDK code.
*   Utilize network security scanning tools to identify open ports and misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Compromised CDK CLI Installation](./threats/compromised_cdk_cli_installation.md)

**Description:** The CDK CLI installation is compromised (e.g., malware, supply chain attack). Malicious code executes during CDK operations, potentially stealing credentials or modifying infrastructure.

**Impact:** Credential theft, unauthorized infrastructure modifications, data breaches, and potential account takeover.

**Affected CDK Component:** CDK CLI

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Install CDK CLI from trusted sources only (official AWS repositories).
*   Use package managers with integrity checks.
*   Regularly scan development machines for malware.
*   Implement endpoint security solutions on developer machines.

## Threat: [Compromised CI/CD Pipeline](./threats/compromised_cicd_pipeline.md)

**Description:** The CI/CD pipeline used for CDK deployments is compromised. Attackers inject malicious code into the deployment process, modify infrastructure, or steal credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized infrastructure modifications, data breaches, service disruption, and potential supply chain attacks.

**Affected CDK Component:** CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), Deployment Scripts

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure CI/CD pipeline infrastructure and configurations.
*   Implement strong access controls for CI/CD systems and pipelines.
*   Regularly audit and patch CI/CD systems and plugins.
*   Use dedicated IAM roles with least privilege for CI/CD pipelines.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control to Deployment Credentials](./threats/insufficient_access_control_to_deployment_credentials.md)

**Description:** Inadequate access control to AWS credentials used by the CI/CD pipeline for CDK deployments. Unauthorized individuals can use these credentials to deploy or modify infrastructure.

**Impact:** Unauthorized infrastructure modifications, service disruption, and potential security breaches.

**Affected CDK Component:** CI/CD Pipeline Credentials, IAM Roles

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Principle of Least Privilege for CI/CD pipeline IAM roles.
*   Restrict access to CI/CD pipeline credentials to authorized personnel and systems only.
*   Rotate CI/CD pipeline credentials regularly.
*   Use short-lived credentials where possible.

## Threat: [Stored Credentials in CI/CD Configuration](./threats/stored_credentials_in_cicd_configuration.md)

**Description:** AWS credentials are stored directly in CI/CD pipeline configurations. If the CI/CD system is compromised, these credentials could be exposed.

**Impact:** Credential theft, unauthorized infrastructure modifications, and potential account takeover.

**Affected CDK Component:** CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, Credential Storage

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing credentials directly in CI/CD configurations.
*   Use CI/CD system's built-in secret management features.
*   Utilize AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) or OIDC federation for credential-less deployments where possible.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to CloudFormation Stacks](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_cloudformation_stacks.md)

**Description:** Insufficient access control to CloudFormation stacks deployed by CDK. Unauthorized users can modify or delete stacks, leading to service disruption or data loss.

**Impact:** Service disruption, data loss, unauthorized infrastructure modifications, and potential compliance violations.

**Affected CDK Component:** CloudFormation, IAM (Stack Policies, Resource Policies)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access control for CloudFormation stacks using IAM policies.
*   Principle of Least Privilege for users and roles accessing CloudFormation stacks.
*   Regularly review and audit CloudFormation stack access policies.
*   Use CloudFormation Stack Policies to prevent accidental or malicious stack modifications.

## Threat: [Accidental or Malicious Stack Deletion](./threats/accidental_or_malicious_stack_deletion.md)

**Description:** Accidental or malicious deletion of CloudFormation stacks deployed by CDK results in service outages and data loss.

**Impact:** Service outages, data loss, significant recovery effort, and potential business disruption.

**Affected CDK Component:** CloudFormation, CDK CLI

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement CloudFormation Stack Policies to prevent stack deletion.
*   Enable termination protection on critical CloudFormation stacks.
*   Implement robust backup and recovery mechanisms for critical data and infrastructure.
*   Restrict stack deletion permissions to highly authorized personnel only.
*   Implement multi-person approval processes for stack deletion operations.
