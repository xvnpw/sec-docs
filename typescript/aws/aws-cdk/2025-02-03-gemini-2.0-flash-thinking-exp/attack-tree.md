## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CDK Code Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cdk_code_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Hardcoded Secrets in CDK Code [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker finds hardcoded API keys, passwords, or other credentials directly embedded in the CDK code (e.g., in strings, comments, or configuration files).
        *   **Exploitation:**  Use the stolen credentials to access sensitive resources like databases, APIs, internal services, or other AWS resources.
        *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the targeted sensitive resources and potential data breaches.
    *   **Insecure IAM Configurations in CDK Code [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** CDK code defines overly permissive IAM roles or policies, granting excessive privileges to resources.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attacker exploits these overly permissive roles to perform actions beyond intended scope, such as privilege escalation, data exfiltration, resource manipulation, or denial of service.
        *   **Impact:** Broad access to AWS resources, potentially leading to significant data breaches, infrastructure compromise, and control.
    *   **Missing Security Best Practices in Resource Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** CDK code fails to implement security best practices when configuring AWS resources (e.g., creating public S3 buckets, insecure security group rules, disabling encryption, weak authentication).
        *   **Exploitation:** Attacker exploits these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to data in S3 buckets, bypass network security controls via insecure security groups, or exploit other weaknesses resulting from missing security features.
        *   **Impact:** Data breaches due to public exposure, unauthorized access to application components, and potential service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Machine Running CDK CLI [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_machine_running_cdk_cli__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker compromises a developer's machine that is used to run the CDK CLI and deploy infrastructure. This can be achieved through various methods like phishing, malware, social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the developer's machine.
    *   **Exploitation:**
        *   **Steal AWS Credentials:** Extract AWS credentials stored on the compromised machine (e.g., in AWS CLI configuration files, environment variables, or session tokens).
        *   **Modify CDK Code:** Alter the CDK code to inject malicious resources, backdoors, or insecure configurations into the deployed infrastructure.
        *   **Initiate Malicious Deployments:** Use the stolen credentials and potentially modified CDK code to deploy compromised infrastructure to the AWS account.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over deployments, potential injection of backdoors into the infrastructure, data exfiltration, and widespread compromise of the application and its environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CDK Deployment Process Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cdk_deployment_process_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline for CDK Deployments [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline responsible for deploying CDK applications. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform itself, compromising credentials used by the pipeline, or injecting malicious code into the pipeline configuration.
        *   **Exploitation:**
            *   **Inject Malicious CDK Code:** Modify the CDK code within the pipeline to introduce backdoors or insecure configurations.
            *   **Modify Deployment Parameters:** Alter deployment parameters to deploy compromised infrastructure or bypass security controls.
            *   **Steal AWS Credentials:** Extract AWS credentials managed by the CI/CD pipeline for deployments.
        *   **Impact:** Critical impact as the attacker gains control over the entire deployment process, enabling them to deploy malicious infrastructure, steal credentials, and potentially disrupt or take over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misuse of CDK Constructs Leading to Insecure Configurations [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/misuse_of_cdk_constructs_leading_to_insecure_configurations__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers, due to lack of understanding or insufficient training, misuse CDK constructs in a way that leads to insecure configurations. This can involve misunderstanding the security implications of construct properties, failing to configure security-related aspects, or choosing inappropriate constructs for security-sensitive resources.
    *   **Exploitation:**
        *   **Unintentionally Exposing Resources:**  Misconfigure constructs to create publicly accessible resources (e.g., databases, message queues) that should be private.
        *   **Weak Security Settings:** Deploy resources with weak default security settings because developers are unaware of the need to customize them for stronger security.
        *   **Missing Security Features:** Fail to enable or configure essential security features offered by CDK constructs (e.g., encryption, access logging, network segmentation).
    *   **Impact:** Unintentional exposure of sensitive data, deployment of infrastructure with weak security posture, and increased vulnerability to various attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CDK State Management Vulnerabilities (CDK Toolkit)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cdk_state_management_vulnerabilities__cdk_toolkit_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromise CDK Toolkit Stack Resources (e.g., S3 Bucket) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker targets the resources managed by the CDK Toolkit stack, particularly the S3 bucket where CloudFormation templates and deployment artifacts are stored. This could involve exploiting misconfigurations in the bucket's access policies or gaining access through compromised credentials.
        *   **Exploitation:**
            *   **Modify Deployment Artifacts:** Alter CloudFormation templates or other artifacts stored in the S3 bucket to inject malicious resources or configurations into future deployments.
            *   **Access Deployment History:** Gain access to past deployment information, potentially revealing sensitive configuration details or secrets if improperly managed.
            *   **Potentially Gain Control over Future Deployments:** By manipulating the toolkit stack's state, an attacker might be able to influence or control future CDK deployments.
        *   **Impact:** High impact as compromising the toolkit stack can lead to control over future deployments and potential infrastructure manipulation.
    *   **Exploit IAM Role of CDK Toolkit Stack [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker attempts to exploit the IAM role associated with the CDK Toolkit stack. If this role is overly permissive, it could be leveraged for privilege escalation within the AWS account.
        *   **Exploitation:**
            *   **Privilege Escalation:** Use the toolkit stack's IAM role to perform actions beyond the intended scope of CDK operations, potentially gaining broader access to AWS resources and escalating privileges within the account.
        *   **Impact:** Critical impact due to potential privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain wider control over the AWS account and its resources.
