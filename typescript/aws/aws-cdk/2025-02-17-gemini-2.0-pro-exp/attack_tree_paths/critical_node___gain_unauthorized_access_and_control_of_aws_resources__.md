# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Unauthorized Access and Control of AWS Resources (AWS CDK Application)

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path leading to "Gain Unauthorized Access and Control of AWS Resources" within the context of an AWS CDK application.  We aim to:

*   **Identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors** that could be exploited to achieve this critical node.
*   **Assess the likelihood and impact** of each step in the attack path.
*   **Propose concrete mitigation strategies** and security best practices to reduce the risk of successful exploitation.
*   **Prioritize remediation efforts** based on the severity and exploitability of identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Enhance the overall security posture** of the AWS CDK application and its deployed infrastructure.
*   **Provide actionable recommendations** for the development team.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path culminating in unauthorized access and control of AWS resources provisioned by an AWS CDK application.  The scope includes:

*   **CDK Application Code:**  Analysis of the CDK code itself for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and insecure practices. This includes IaC (Infrastructure as Code) definitions.
*   **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):**  Examination of IAM roles, policies, users, and groups defined and used by the CDK application.  This is a critical area for privilege escalation and unauthorized access.
*   **AWS Resource Configurations:**  Review of the security configurations of AWS resources provisioned by the CDK application (e.g., S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, RDS databases, etc.).
*   **Deployment Pipeline:**  Assessment of the security of the CI/CD pipeline used to deploy the CDK application, including access controls and vulnerability scanning.
*   **Runtime Environment:** Consideration of the security of the environment where the application runs after deployment (e.g., network security, operating system security).
* **External Dependencies:** Analysis of third-party libraries and dependencies used by the CDK application and the deployed resources.

**Out of Scope:**

*   **Physical Security:**  Physical security of AWS data centers is managed by AWS and is outside the scope of this application-level analysis.
*   **AWS Account-Level Compromise (Root Credentials):** While a compromised AWS root account would grant full access, this analysis focuses on vulnerabilities *within* the CDK application and its deployed resources, assuming the root account itself is secured.  We are looking at *lateral movement* and *privilege escalation* within the scope of the application's resources.
*   **Social Engineering (Targeting AWS Employees):** This analysis focuses on technical vulnerabilities, not social engineering attacks targeting AWS personnel.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow a structured approach, combining several techniques:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the attack tree as a starting point and expand upon it, identifying specific attack vectors and sub-goals.  We will consider common attack patterns and known vulnerabilities.
2.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will thoroughly review the CDK application code (TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.) for security vulnerabilities, using both manual inspection and automated static analysis tools (e.g., `cdk-nag`, `cfn-lint`, SonarQube, Snyk).
3.  **IAM Policy Analysis:**  We will meticulously analyze IAM policies, roles, and permissions to identify overly permissive configurations, potential privilege escalation paths, and violations of the principle of least privilege. Tools like `IAM Access Analyzer`, `PMapper`, and `Cloudsplaining` will be used.
4.  **Resource Configuration Review:**  We will examine the security configurations of deployed AWS resources, looking for common misconfigurations (e.g., publicly accessible S3 buckets, overly permissive security groups, unencrypted data at rest).  AWS Config and AWS Security Hub will be leveraged.
5.  **Dependency Analysis:**  We will identify and analyze all third-party dependencies used by the CDK application and the deployed resources, checking for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or OWASP Dependency-Check.
6.  **Penetration Testing (Optional, but Recommended):**  If feasible, ethical hacking (penetration testing) will be conducted to simulate real-world attacks and validate the effectiveness of security controls. This would be performed in a controlled, non-production environment.
7. **Dynamic Analysis (Optional):** If the application has a runtime component, dynamic analysis tools can be used to identify vulnerabilities during execution.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**Critical Node:** [[Gain Unauthorized Access and Control of AWS Resources]]

Let's break down potential attack paths leading to this critical node, focusing on the CDK context:

**4.1. Attack Path 1: Compromised Credentials / Secrets**

*   **Sub-Goal 1.1: Obtain AWS Access Keys:**
    *   **1.1.1:  Hardcoded Credentials in CDK Code:**  Developers mistakenly include AWS access keys or other sensitive credentials directly in the CDK code (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) that are committed to the source code repository.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common mistake, especially in early development stages)
        *   **Impact:** High (direct access to AWS resources)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never** hardcode credentials. Use environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager, or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
            *   Use `.gitignore` (or equivalent) to prevent sensitive files from being committed.
            *   Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for hardcoded secrets (e.g., `git-secrets`, `trufflehog`).
            *   Use static analysis tools to detect hardcoded secrets.
    *   **1.1.2:  Exposed Credentials in CI/CD Pipeline:**  Credentials used by the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., to deploy the CDK application) are exposed due to misconfigured pipeline settings, insecure storage of secrets, or compromised build servers.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use secure secret management features of the CI/CD platform (e.g., AWS CodePipeline secrets, GitHub Actions secrets, GitLab CI/CD variables).
            *   Regularly rotate credentials.
            *   Implement least privilege for CI/CD pipeline roles.
            *   Monitor pipeline logs for suspicious activity.
    *   **1.1.3:  Compromised Developer Workstation:**  An attacker gains access to a developer's workstation (e.g., through phishing, malware) and steals AWS credentials stored locally (e.g., in `~/.aws/credentials`, environment variables).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for developer accounts.
            *   Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
            *   Educate developers about phishing and social engineering attacks.
            *   Encourage the use of temporary credentials (e.g., AWS STS AssumeRole).
            *   Use a credential management tool.
    *   **1.1.4 Leaked credentials in public repositories:** Publicly available code repositories, forums, or paste sites may contain accidentally leaked credentials.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Regularly scan public repositories for leaked credentials using automated tools.
            *   Educate developers about the risks of sharing code publicly.

*   **Sub-Goal 1.2:  Use Obtained Credentials to Access AWS Resources:**  The attacker uses the compromised credentials to authenticate to the AWS API and access resources.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if credentials are valid)
    *   **Impact:** High (depends on the permissions associated with the credentials)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement least privilege principle for all IAM roles and users.
        *   Use MFA for all AWS accounts and IAM users.
        *   Monitor AWS CloudTrail logs for suspicious API calls.

        *   Using wildcard permissions (`*`) unnecessarily.
        *   Granting access to sensitive resources (e.g., S3 buckets, KMS keys) without proper restrictions.
        *   Failing to implement least privilege.
        *   Misconfigured trust relationships in IAM roles.
        *   Using managed policies instead of creating custom policies.
        *   Not using conditions in IAM policies.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common error in IaC)
                *   **Impact:** High (can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege.  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions.

        *   Publicly accessible S3 buckets.
        *   EC2 instances with overly permissive security groups (e.g., allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 on all ports).
        *   Unencrypted data at rest (e.g., EBS volumes, RDS databases).
        *   Unencrypted data in transit (e.g., not using HTTPS for API communication).
        *   Disabled logging or monitoring.
        *   Vulnerable versions of software or operating systems.
        *   Lack of input validation in Lambda functions or API Gateway configurations.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium

        *   **Impact:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use dependency analysis tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and remediate vulnerable dependencies.
            *   Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions.
            *   Consider using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool.
    * **2.1.4: Logic Errors in CDK Code:** Custom resources or constructs within the CDK application may contain logic errors that can be exploited.
        * **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
        * **Impact:** Variable (depends on the logic error)
        * **Mitigation:**
            * Thoroughly test custom resources and constructs.
            * Implement robust error handling and input validation.
