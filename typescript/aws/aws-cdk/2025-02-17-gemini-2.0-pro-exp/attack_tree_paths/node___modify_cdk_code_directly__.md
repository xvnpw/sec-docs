Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Modify CDK Code Directly" attack tree path, tailored for an AWS CDK application development context.

## Deep Analysis: "Modify CDK Code Directly" Attack Tree Path

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Modify CDK Code Directly" attack path, identify potential vulnerabilities, assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation, and propose concrete mitigation strategies within the context of an AWS CDK application development workflow.  This analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the security posture of their CDK code and deployment process.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where an attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository hosting the AWS CDK application code and makes malicious modifications.  The scope includes:

*   **Source Code Repository:**  The primary focus is on the repository itself (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, AWS CodeCommit).  We assume the application uses a Git-based repository.
*   **CDK Code:**  The analysis considers the types of modifications an attacker might make to the CDK code and their potential impact on the deployed infrastructure.
*   **Development Workflow:**  We'll examine how the development team's practices and tools can either increase or decrease the risk of this attack.
*   **Access Control:**  We'll analyze the access control mechanisms in place for the repository and related resources.
*   **Detection Mechanisms:** We will consider how to detect such modifications.
* **Impact on AWS resources:** We will consider impact on AWS resources.

This analysis *excludes* attacks that don't involve direct modification of the CDK code in the repository (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in deployed applications, social engineering attacks to obtain credentials without repository access).  It also excludes attacks on the AWS account itself that are not directly related to the CDK code modification.
