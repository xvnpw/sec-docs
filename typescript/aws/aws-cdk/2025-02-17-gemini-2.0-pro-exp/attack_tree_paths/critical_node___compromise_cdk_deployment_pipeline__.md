Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Manipulate CDK Source Code" attack path, focusing on an AWS CDK application deployment pipeline.

## Deep Analysis: Manipulate CDK Source Code in AWS CDK Deployment Pipeline

### 1. Define Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and potential mitigations related to an attacker manipulating the source code of an AWS CDK application within its deployment pipeline.  We aim to identify specific weaknesses that could allow an attacker to inject malicious code or configurations, ultimately compromising the deployed infrastructure.  The analysis will provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the security posture of the CDK application and its deployment process.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following:

*   **Source Code Repositories:**  Specifically, Git repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, AWS CodeCommit) used to store the CDK application's source code.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**  How the source code repository interacts with the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
*   **CDK Application Code:**  The TypeScript/Python/Java/etc. code that defines the AWS infrastructure.
*   **Build and Deployment Processes:**  The steps within the pipeline that handle the CDK code, including synthesis ( `cdk synth`), deployment (`cdk deploy`), and any associated scripting.
*   **Access Control Mechanisms:**  Permissions and roles associated with the source code repository, CI/CD pipeline, and AWS accounts involved.
* **Secrets Management**: How secrets are used and stored.

This analysis *excludes* the following (for now, but could be expanded upon later):

*   Attacks targeting the underlying operating systems of build servers.
*   Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the AWS CDK framework itself (we assume the CDK is up-to-date).
*   Social engineering attacks targeting developers directly (although this is indirectly relevant).

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attackers, their motivations, and their capabilities.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine the attack surface presented by the source code repository and CI/CD pipeline integration.  This includes identifying common weaknesses and misconfigurations.
3.  **Attack Vector Enumeration:**  Detail specific ways an attacker could exploit the identified vulnerabilities to manipulate the CDK source code.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential consequences of successful code manipulation, including the types of infrastructure compromises that could occur.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose concrete steps to reduce the risk of source code manipulation, including preventative and detective controls.
6.  **Tooling and Automation:** Suggest tools and techniques to automate security checks and enforce best practices.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: Manipulate CDK Source Code

**4.1 Threat Modeling**

*   **Potential Attackers:**
    *   **External Attackers:**  Individuals or groups with no legitimate access to the organization's systems.  Motivated by financial gain, espionage, or disruption.
    *   **Malicious Insiders:**  Employees or contractors with legitimate access who intentionally seek to harm the organization.  Motivated by revenge, financial gain, or ideological reasons.
    *   **Compromised Insiders:**  Employees or contractors whose accounts or credentials have been compromised by external attackers.  The attacker leverages the insider's access.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   **Basic:**  Ability to perform reconnaissance, exploit publicly known vulnerabilities, and use basic scripting.
    *   **Intermediate:**  Ability to develop custom exploits, bypass basic security controls, and maintain persistence.
    *   **Advanced:**  Ability to conduct sophisticated social engineering attacks, exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, and operate stealthily.

**4.2 Vulnerability Analysis**

*   **Weak Repository Access Controls:**
    *   **Overly Permissive Permissions:**  Developers or CI/CD service accounts having write access to the `main` or `master` branch without requiring pull requests or code reviews.
    *   **Lack of Branch Protection Rules:**  Absence of rules enforcing code reviews, status checks, or requiring signed commits before merging to protected branches.
    *   **Shared Credentials:**  Multiple developers using the same credentials to access the repository, making attribution difficult and increasing the risk of compromise.
    *   **Weak or Reused Passwords:**  Developers using easily guessable passwords or reusing passwords across multiple services.
    *   **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Not enforcing MFA for repository access, making it easier for attackers to compromise accounts.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Misconfigurations:**
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials:**  Storing AWS access keys, secrets, or other sensitive information directly in the CDK code or pipeline configuration files.
    *   **Insecure Secret Management:**  Using environment variables for secrets without proper encryption or access controls.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The pipeline not validating or sanitizing inputs from external sources (e.g., webhooks, build parameters), potentially allowing code injection.
    *   **Overly Permissive Pipeline Roles:**  The CI/CD pipeline's IAM role having excessive permissions to AWS resources, allowing an attacker to perform actions beyond what's necessary for deployment.
    *   **Lack of Pipeline Auditing:**  Insufficient logging or monitoring of pipeline activities, making it difficult to detect or investigate malicious actions.

*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Outdated CDK Versions:** Using older versions of the AWS CDK with known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries:**  The CDK application relying on third-party libraries with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Lack of Dependency Scanning:**  Not regularly scanning dependencies for vulnerabilities.

**4.3 Attack Vector Enumeration**

*   **Direct Code Modification:**
    *   An attacker with write access to the repository directly modifies the CDK code to inject malicious resources (e.g., a backdoor EC2 instance, a Lambda function that exfiltrates data, an IAM role with elevated privileges).
    *   An attacker compromises a developer's account (e.g., through phishing or credential stuffing) and uses that account to push malicious code.

*   **Pull Request Manipulation:**
    *   An attacker submits a seemingly legitimate pull request that contains hidden malicious code.  If code reviews are inadequate, the malicious code gets merged.
    *   An attacker compromises a reviewer's account and approves a malicious pull request.

*   **Dependency Poisoning:**
    *   An attacker publishes a malicious package with a similar name to a legitimate dependency (typosquatting) and tricks the developer into installing it.
    *   An attacker compromises a legitimate dependency and injects malicious code into it.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Injection:**
    *   An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g., a script injection vulnerability) to modify the build process and inject malicious code during the `cdk synth` or `cdk deploy` stages.
    *   An attacker gains access to the CI/CD system and modifies the pipeline configuration to execute arbitrary commands.

**4.4 Impact Assessment**

The impact of successful code manipulation can be severe:

*   **Data Breach:**  Exfiltration of sensitive data stored in AWS resources (e.g., S3 buckets, databases).
*   **Resource Hijacking:**  Use of compromised AWS resources for malicious purposes (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, launching DDoS attacks).
*   **Infrastructure Sabotage:**  Deletion or modification of critical infrastructure components, leading to service disruption.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Costs associated with data breaches, resource hijacking, and incident response.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and damage to the organization's reputation.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Non-compliance with industry regulations and legal requirements.

**4.5 Mitigation Recommendations**

*   **Strengthen Repository Access Controls:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to developers and CI/CD service accounts.
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Require pull requests and code reviews for all changes to protected branches.  Ensure reviewers are knowledgeable and thorough.
    *   **Branch Protection Rules:**  Enforce rules requiring code reviews, status checks (e.g., successful builds, passing tests), and signed commits before merging.
    *   **Strong Authentication:**  Enforce strong passwords and MFA for all repository accounts.
    *   **Regular Access Reviews:**  Periodically review and revoke unnecessary access permissions.

*   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**
    *   **Secrets Management:**  Use a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, HashiCorp Vault) to store and manage sensitive information.  Never hardcode credentials.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize all inputs to the pipeline to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Least Privilege IAM Roles:**  Grant the CI/CD pipeline's IAM role only the minimum necessary permissions to deploy the CDK application.
    *   **Pipeline Auditing:**  Enable detailed logging and monitoring of pipeline activities.  Implement alerts for suspicious events.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Pipelines:**  Define the CI/CD pipeline itself using IaC (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, CDK) to ensure consistency, repeatability, and auditability.

*   **Manage Dependencies Securely:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Scanning:**  Use tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, `snyk`, or `Dependabot` to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated Dependency Updates:**  Automate the process of updating dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Remediation Process:**  Establish a process for promptly addressing identified vulnerabilities in dependencies.

*   **Code Security Best Practices:**
    *   **Secure Coding Training:**  Provide developers with training on secure coding practices for CDK applications.
    *   **Static Code Analysis:**  Use static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, ESLint with security plugins) to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the CDK code.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits of the CDK application and its deployment pipeline.

* **Implement Detective Controls:**
    * **AWS CloudTrail:** Monitor API calls for suspicious activity.
    * **AWS Config:** Track configuration changes and set up rules to detect non-compliant configurations.
    * **Amazon GuardDuty:** Use threat detection service to identify malicious activity.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Centralize logs and security events for analysis and correlation.
