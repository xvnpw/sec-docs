### Vulnerability: Arbitrary Local File Open via Crafted Links in Markdown Preview

* **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Local File Open via Crafted Links in Markdown Preview

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file containing a hyperlink.
    2. The hyperlink is designed to point to a local file on the user's system using schemes like `vscode-resource://`, `file:///`, or relative paths. Examples include `[Click Me](vscode-resource://..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd)` or `[Click here](file:///etc/passwd)`.
    3. A user opens this markdown file in VS Code and previews it using Markdown Preview Enhanced.
    4. The user clicks on the crafted hyperlink in the preview.
    5. The `clickTagA` command in `extension-common.ts` is executed to handle the link click.
    6. Due to insufficient sanitization in the `clickTagA` function, the provided path is not properly validated or restricted.
    7. VS Code attempts to open the file at the resolved path, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive local files if the attacker's crafted path successfully targets readable system files or files outside the intended workspace.

* **Impact:**
    - High: An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the user's local file system that the VS Code process has access to. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, private keys, source code, or personal documents. In advanced scenarios, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone for further exploitation if combined with other vulnerabilities or social engineering.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the `clickTagA` function to prevent arbitrary local file opening. While the code performs several string replacements on the `href`, these replacements are insufficient to prevent path traversal or restrict access to local `file:///` or `vscode-resource://` URIs.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust path sanitization and validation in the `clickTagA` function.
    - Restrict allowed URI schemes to only `http://`, `https://`, and potentially `mailto:` if needed. Block or sanitize `file://`, `vscode-resource://` and similar schemes for local file access.
    - Before opening any local file path derived from a hyperlink, validate that it is within the workspace or a designated safe directory and explicitly intended to be opened. Forbid absolute paths and path traversal sequences like `../`.
    - Implement a user confirmation dialog before opening any local files from links clicked in the preview, especially for potentially risky schemes or local file paths.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension installed in VS Code.
    - The user must open and preview a malicious markdown file provided by the attacker.
    - The user must click on the specially crafted hyperlink within the preview.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/extension-common.ts
    async function clickTagA({
        uri,
        href,
        scheme,
    }: {
        uri: string;
        href: string;
        scheme: string;
    }) {
        href = decodeURIComponent(href); // Step 1: Decode URI
        href = href
        .replace(/^vscode\-resource:\/\//, '') // Step 2: Remove vscode-resource prefix
        .replace(/^vscode\-webview\-resource:\/\/(.+?)\//, '') // Step 3: Remove vscode-webview-resource prefix
        .replace(/^file\/\/\//, '${scheme}:///') // Step 4: Replace file:/// with scheme:///
        .replace(
            /^https:\/\/file\+\.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net\//,
            `${scheme}:///`, // Step 5: Replace CDN vscode-resource prefix
        )
        .replace(/^https:\/\/.+\.vscode-cdn.net\//, `${scheme}:///`) // Step 6: Replace CDN prefix
        .replace(
            /^https?:\/\/(.+?)\.vscode-webview-test.com\/vscode-resource\/file\/+/,
            `${scheme}:///`, // Step 7: Replace vscode-webview-test prefix
        )
        .replace(
            /^https?:\/\/file(.+?)\.vscode-webview\.net\/+/,
            `${scheme}:///`, // Step 8: Replace vscode-webview.net prefix
        );
        if (
        ['.pdf', '.xls', '.xlsx', '.doc', '.ppt', '.docx', '.pptx'].indexOf(
            path.extname(href),
        ) >= 0
        ) {
        try {
            utility.openFile(href); // Step 9: Open file using utility.openFile
        } catch (error) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage(error);
        }
        } else if (href.startsWith(`${scheme}://`)) { // Step 10: Check if href starts with scheme://
        // openFilePath = href.slice(8) # remove protocol
        const openFilePath = decodeURI(href); // Step 11: Decode URI again
        const fileUri = vscode.Uri.parse(openFilePath); // Step 12: Parse URI
        // ... rest of the function to open file in VS Code (implicitly using vscode.workspace.openTextDocument or similar)
        } else if (href.match(/^https?:\/\//)) {
        vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.open', vscode.Uri.parse(href));
        } else {
        utility.openFile(href);
        }
    }
    ```
    The `clickTagA` function is triggered when a link in the markdown preview is clicked. The function processes the `href` attribute of the link, attempting to normalize and open the target resource.  Despite several string replacements aimed at handling VS Code resource URIs, the function lacks proper validation to prevent opening arbitrary local files. Specifically:

    - **Insufficient Sanitization:** The string replacements do not effectively prevent path traversal sequences like `../` or block the `file:///` scheme.
    - **Direct File Opening:** For `href` values starting with the scheme (which can be manipulated to be `file://`), the code directly proceeds to parse the `href` as a URI and attempts to open it using VS Code's file opening mechanisms.
    - **No Workspace Context Check:** There is no check to ensure that the resolved file path is within the user's workspace or a designated safe directory.

    This lack of validation allows an attacker to craft links that, when clicked, can lead to VS Code attempting to open sensitive local files like `/etc/passwd` or user-specific files by using `file:///` URIs or relative paths with `vscode-resource://`.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new markdown file, for example, `poc.md`, in any directory.
    2. Add the following markdown content to `poc.md`:
        ```markdown
        [Click here to open /etc/passwd](file:///etc/passwd)  <!-- For Linux/macOS -->
        [Click here to open Hosts File](file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts) <!-- For Windows -->
        [Click here for Path Traversal](vscode-resource://..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd) <!-- Path Traversal Example -->
        ```
    3. Open `poc.md` in VS Code.
    4. Open the preview for `poc.md` using "Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side" command.
    5. In the preview, click on any of the links provided (e.g., "Click here to open /etc/passwd" or "Click here for Path Traversal").
    6. Observe if VS Code attempts to open the targeted file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `hosts` file). If VS Code tries to open the file, shows its content in a new editor window, or displays an error message related to accessing the file, the vulnerability is confirmed. You might need to adjust the file paths in the test case based on your operating system and file permissions.


### Vulnerability: File Import Path Traversal

* **Vulnerability Name:** File Import Path Traversal

* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file.
    2. This file leverages markdown import features using `@import`, image syntax `![](path/to/file.md)`, or wikilink syntax `![[file]]` to include external files.
    3. The path specified in the import statement includes path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate outside the intended workspace directory. For example: `@import "../../.ssh/id_rsa"` or `![](../../etc/passwd)`.
    4. A victim opens and previews this malicious markdown file using the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension in VSCode.
    5. When the extension renders the preview, it processes the import statement and attempts to read the file specified by the attacker-controlled path.
    6. Due to insufficient path validation, the extension reads and displays the content of the attacker-specified file, even if it's outside the intended workspace scope.

* **Impact:**
    - High: An external attacker can create a malicious markdown file that, when previewed, allows reading arbitrary files from the victim's file system that the VS Code process has access to. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as private keys, configuration files, or personal documents.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High

* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. Based on the analysis, there is no explicit path validation or sanitization implemented within the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension code for file import paths. The file import functionality is likely handled by the underlying `crossnote` library without additional security measures in this extension.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust path validation and sanitization for all file import paths (including `@import`, image paths, wikilink paths).
    - Ensure that all resolved file paths for imports are restricted to the workspace directory or a designated safe directory.
    - Sanitize user-provided paths to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `./`).
    - Consider implementing sandboxing or isolation for file reading operations during markdown rendering to limit the scope of file system access.

* **Preconditions:**
    1. The user has the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension installed in VS Code.
    2. The user opens a markdown file provided by the attacker in VS Code.
    3. The user opens the markdown preview for the malicious file using Markdown Preview Enhanced.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The `src/preview-provider.ts` file is responsible for generating the markdown preview and utilizes the `crossnote` library's `NotebookMarkdownEngine` for markdown parsing and rendering.
    2. The `getEngine(sourceUri)` method in `PreviewProvider` retrieves the `NotebookMarkdownEngine` instance, which is responsible for processing markdown content, including file import syntax.
    3. The `generateHTMLTemplateForPreview` and `parseMD` methods of `NotebookMarkdownEngine` (from `crossnote`) are used to convert markdown to HTML, during which file import statements are processed.
    4. **Vulnerability Point:** The code within `src/preview-provider.ts` and related files in this project **lacks explicit path validation or sanitization logic** for file paths used in `@import`, `![]()`, or `![[]]` syntax before these paths are processed by the `crossnote` library.
    5. If the `crossnote` library itself does not perform sufficient path validation, it results in a path traversal vulnerability, allowing access to files outside the intended workspace.
    6. The provided project files do not contain any mitigation for this vulnerability within the extension's code.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new directory for testing, e.g., `mpe-import-vuln`.
    2. Inside `mpe-import-vuln`, create a new markdown file named `malicious_import.md`.
    3. In `malicious_import.md`, add the following line to attempt importing a sensitive file using path traversal:
        ```markdown
        @import "../../.ssh/id_rsa"  <!-- Assumes ~/.ssh/id_rsa exists, use a safer file for testing like /etc/passwd on Linux -->
        ```
        For safer testing on Linux: `@import "../../etc/passwd"` or on Windows: `@import "../../Windows/win.ini"`
    4. Open VS Code and open the `mpe-import-vuln` directory as a workspace.
    5. Open the `malicious_import.md` file in the editor.
    6. Run the command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side` (or `Open Preview`).
    7. Observe the markdown preview pane.
    8. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Present):** If vulnerable, the content of the targeted file (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `/etc/passwd`) will be rendered within the markdown preview, possibly as plain text or within a code block.
    9. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Mitigated):** If mitigated, the preview should either fail to render the import, display an error message about an invalid path, or render harmless content instead of the targeted file's content.
