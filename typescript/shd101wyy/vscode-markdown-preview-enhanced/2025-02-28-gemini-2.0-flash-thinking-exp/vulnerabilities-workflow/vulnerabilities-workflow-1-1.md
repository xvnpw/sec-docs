### Vulnerability 1

* Vulnerability Name:  Local File Path Traversal via Link Following

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a markdown file containing a hyperlink.
    2. The hyperlink is designed to exploit path traversal, using relative paths and URI encoding to navigate outside the intended workspace directory. For example, a link could be `[Click Me](vscode-resource://..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd)`.
    3. A user opens this markdown file in VS Code and previews it using Markdown Preview Enhanced.
    4. The user clicks on the crafted hyperlink in the preview.
    5. The `clickTagA` command in `extension-common.ts` is executed to handle the link click.
    6. Due to insufficient sanitization in the `clickTagA` function, the relative path `../../../../etc/passwd` is not properly resolved against the workspace root.
    7. VS Code attempts to open the file at the resolved path, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive local files like `/etc/passwd` if the attacker's crafted path successfully traverses outside the workspace and reaches system files.

* Impact:
    - High: An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the user's local file system, depending on the file system permissions and the effectiveness of path traversal sanitization within VS Code's `openTextDocument` and related functions. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information if the attacker can successfully target readable system files or files outside the intended workspace.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code snippets specifically within the `clickTagA` function to prevent path traversal based on relative paths or URI encoded paths like `..%2f`. The code performs some string replacements on the `href`, but these do not seem sufficient to prevent path traversal.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust path sanitization and validation in the `clickTagA` function.
    - Before opening any local file path derived from a hyperlink, resolve the path against the workspace root and verify that it remains within the workspace or a designated safe directory.
    - Consider using VS Code's API for handling workspace-relative file paths securely.
    - Implement checks to prevent opening files with known sensitive paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, system configuration files).

* Preconditions:
    - The user must open and preview a malicious markdown file provided by the attacker.
    - The user must click on the specially crafted hyperlink within the preview.

* Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/extension-common.ts
    async function clickTagA({
        uri,
        href,
        scheme,
    }: {
        uri: string;
        href: string;
        scheme: string;
    }) {
        href = decodeURIComponent(href); // Step 1: Decode URI
        href = href
        .replace(/^vscode\-resource:\/\//, '') // Step 2: Remove vscode-resource prefix
        .replace(/^vscode\-webview\-resource:\/\/(.+?)\//, '') // Step 3: Remove vscode-webview-resource prefix
        .replace(/^file\/\/\//, '${scheme}:///') // Step 4: Replace file:/// with scheme:///
        .replace(
            /^https:\/\/file\+\.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net\//,
            `${scheme}:///`, // Step 5: Replace CDN vscode-resource prefix
        )
        .replace(/^https:\/\/.+\.vscode-cdn.net\//, `${scheme}:///`) // Step 6: Replace CDN prefix
        .replace(
            /^https?:\/\/(.+?)\.vscode-webview-test.com\/vscode-resource\/file\/+/,
            `${scheme}:///`, // Step 7: Replace vscode-webview-test prefix
        )
        .replace(
            /^https?:\/\/file(.+?)\.vscode-webview\.net\/+/,
            `${scheme}:///`, // Step 8: Replace vscode-webview.net prefix
        );
        if (
        ['.pdf', '.xls', '.xlsx', '.doc', '.ppt', '.docx', '.pptx'].indexOf(
            path.extname(href),
        ) >= 0
        ) {
        try {
            utility.openFile(href); // Step 9: Open file using utility.openFile
        } catch (error) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage(error);
        }
        } else if (href.startsWith(`${scheme}://`)) { // Step 10: Check if href starts with scheme://
        // openFilePath = href.slice(8) # remove protocol
        const openFilePath = decodeURI(href); // Step 11: Decode URI again
        const fileUri = vscode.Uri.parse(openFilePath); // Step 12: Parse URI

        // ... rest of the function to open file in VS Code
        } else if (href.match(/^https?:\/\//)) {
        vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.open', vscode.Uri.parse(href));
        } else {
        utility.openFile(href);
        }
    }
    ```
    The vulnerability arises because even after the series of string replacements, relative paths like `../../../../etc/passwd` can still be present in the `href` and are not validated against a safe base directory before being passed to `vscode.workspace.openTextDocument` (indirectly through `vscode.window.showTextDocument`). The initial `decodeURIComponent` and subsequent `decodeURI` in step 11 are intended for URL decoding but do not sanitize path traversal sequences.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new markdown file named `malicious.md` in any workspace.
    2. Add the following markdown content to `malicious.md`:
        ```markdown
        [Click here to trigger vulnerability](vscode-resource://..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd)
        ```
    3. Open `malicious.md` in VS Code.
    4. Open the preview for `malicious.md` using "Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side" command.
    5. In the preview, click on the "Click here to trigger vulnerability" link.
    6. Observe if VS Code attempts to open the `/etc/passwd` file (or similar sensitive file path for your OS). If VS Code tries to open the file or shows its content in a new editor window, the vulnerability is confirmed.

This test case attempts to read a sensitive file. A more benign test could target a file within the user's home directory to avoid potential permission issues during testing. For example, on Linux/macOS, you could use `vscode-resource://..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f~%2f.bashrc` to attempt to open the `.bashrc` file. On Windows, you could try `vscode-resource://..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f%USERPROFILE%/.bashrc` or similar OS specific paths.
