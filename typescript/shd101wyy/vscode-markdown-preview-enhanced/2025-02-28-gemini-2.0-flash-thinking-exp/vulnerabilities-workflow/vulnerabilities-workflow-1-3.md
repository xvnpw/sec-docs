### Vulnerability List for Markdown Preview Enhanced

* Vulnerability Name: File Import Path Traversal

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file.
    2. This file contains a file import statement using `@import`, image syntax `![](path/to/file.md)`, or wikilink syntax `![[file]]`.
    3. The path in the import statement includes path traversal sequences such as `../` to target files outside of the current workspace directory.
    4. A victim opens and previews this malicious markdown file using the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension in VSCode.
    5. When the extension renders the preview, it processes the import statement and attempts to read the file specified by the attacker-controlled path.
    6. Due to insufficient path validation, the extension reads and displays the content of the attacker-specified file, even if it's outside the intended workspace scope.

* Impact:
    An external attacker can create a malicious markdown file that, when previewed by a victim, allows the attacker to read arbitrary files from the victim's file system that the VSCode process has access to. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, private keys, source code, or personal documents, depending on the attacker's target path and the victim's file system structure and permissions.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. Based on the provided project files, there is no explicit path validation or sanitization implemented for file import paths within the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension code. The file import functionality is likely handled by the `crossnote` dependency, and this extension does not add any mitigation layer.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Path validation: Implement checks to ensure that all file import paths are within the workspace directory or a designated safe directory.
    - Path sanitization: Sanitize user-provided paths to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `./`).
    - Sandboxing or isolation: Isolate the file reading operations performed during markdown rendering to prevent access to sensitive areas of the file system.

* Preconditions:
    1. The victim has the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension installed in VSCode.
    2. The victim opens a markdown file provided by the attacker in VSCode.
    3. The victim opens the markdown preview for the malicious file using Markdown Preview Enhanced.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. The `src/preview-provider.ts` file is responsible for generating the markdown preview.
    2. The `PreviewProvider` class utilizes the `crossnote` library's `NotebookMarkdownEngine` to parse and render markdown content.
    3. The `getEngine(sourceUri)` method in `PreviewProvider` retrieves the `NotebookMarkdownEngine` instance.
    4. The `generateHTMLTemplateForPreview` and `parseMD` methods of `NotebookMarkdownEngine` (from `crossnote` dependency) are used to convert markdown to HTML.
    5. File import functionalities like `@import`, image syntax `![](...)`, and wikilink syntax `![[...]]` are processed within the `crossnote` library during markdown parsing.
    6. **Vulnerability Point:** The code in `src/preview-provider.ts` and related files in this project **does not include any explicit path validation or sanitization logic** for file paths used in import statements before passing them to the `crossnote` library for processing.
    7. If the `crossnote` library itself lacks proper path validation and sanitization for file imports, it results in a path traversal vulnerability.
    8. The provided project files do not contain any mitigation for this potential vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new directory for testing, for example, `mpe-test-vuln`.
    2. Inside `mpe-test-vuln`, create a new markdown file named `malicious.md`.
    3. In `malicious.md`, add the following line:
    ```markdown
    @import "../../.ssh/id_rsa"
    ```
    *Note: This test assumes that the user has a `.ssh/id_rsa` file in their home directory. For safer testing, you can target a less sensitive file that is expected to exist, for example, on Linux systems: `@import "../../etc/passwd"` or on Windows: `@import "../../Windows/win.ini"`.*
    4. Open VSCode and open the `mpe-test-vuln` directory as a workspace.
    5. Open the `malicious.md` file in the editor.
    6. Run the command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side` (or `Open Preview`).
    7. Observe the markdown preview pane.
    8. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Present):** If the vulnerability exists, the content of the targeted file (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `/etc/passwd`) will be rendered within the markdown preview, likely as plain text or within a code block if the extension tries to syntax highlight it.
    9. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerability Mitigated):** If the vulnerability is mitigated, the preview should either fail to render the import, render an error message indicating an invalid path, or render an empty or harmless content instead of the targeted file's content.
