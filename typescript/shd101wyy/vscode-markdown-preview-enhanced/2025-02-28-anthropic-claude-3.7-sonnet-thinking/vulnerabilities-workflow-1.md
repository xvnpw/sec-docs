# Security Vulnerabilities

## 1. Remote Code Execution via Malicious Workspace Configuration Files  

**Description:**  
- An attacker can craft a repository that contains a malicious ".crossnote" folder (e.g. by supplying a manipulated config.js, parser.js, or head.html file).  
- When a victim opens such a repository in VS Code, the extension (in its NotebooksManager) calls the helper function `loadConfigsInDirectory` on the workspace config directory (at "./.crossnote").  
- If these configuration files include executable JavaScript code or payloads, the unsanitized evaluation and direct merging into the notebook configuration may cause arbitrary code to be executed in the extension host.  

**Impact:**  
- Arbitrary code execution on the victim's system (e.g. running any command or script with the extension's privileges), which may lead to a full compromise of the user environment.  

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
- The code wraps the load calls in try–catch blocks and logs errors (see NotebooksManager's `loadNotebookConfig` method).  
- However, no sanitization or sandboxing of the content loaded from configuration files is performed.  

**Missing Mitigations:**  
- Input validation and sandboxing of any configuration file content before evaluation.  
- A verification mechanism (such as digital signatures or user confirmation) to ensure that configuration files from a workspace are trusted.  

**Preconditions:**  
- The victim must open a repository that includes a ".crossnote" folder containing crafted configuration files.  

**Source Code Analysis:**  
- In `NotebooksManager.loadNotebookConfig`, the code calls:  
  • `workspaceConfig = await loadConfigsInDirectory(workspaceConfigPath.fsPath, notebook.fs, createWorkspaceConfigDirectoryIfNotExists)`  
- No further validation is done on the returned configuration object before merging (along with global and VS Code config).  
- Because the helper (from the external "crossnote" package) likely uses dynamic evaluation for .js configuration files, malicious payloads may be executed.  

**Security Test Case:**  
- Prepare a test repository that includes a ".crossnote/config.js" file containing malicious payload (for example, code that starts an unexpected child process or writes a file to a sensitive location).  
- Open the repository in VS Code with the extension enabled so that `updateNotebookConfig` is triggered.  
- Observe whether the payload executes (e.g. by monitoring for unexpected side effects such as process creation, file creation, or network requests).

## 2. Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious Markdown Code Chunks  

**Description:**  
- The extension supports "code chunks" in markdown that use flags such as `{cmd=true}` (for example in the "code-chunks.md" test file).  
- An attacker can supply a manipulated markdown file that includes a code chunk block with the `{cmd=true}` parameter and with an arbitrary shell command embedded in its content.  
- When the victim opens the malicious markdown file in VS Code (and if code/chunk execution is enabled via configuration such as "enableScriptExecution"), the extension (via its PreviewProvider) eventually calls a function like `runCodeChunk` (which in turn calls the engine's `runCodeChunk`).  
- Because the underlying engine (from "crossnote"/"mume") simply passes the chunk content to a shell without strict validation, the malicious command may be executed.  

**Impact:**  
- An attacker-controlled shell command is run on the victim's machine. This can result in full remote code execution, file system compromise, data exfiltration, or other severe impacts.  

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
- There is a configuration flag "enableScriptExecution" that may disable automatic code execution, but if a user enables or does not disable it, there is no further check on code chunk content.  

**Missing Mitigations:**  
- A mandatory user prompt or explicit confirmation before executing code chunks from an untrusted repository.  
- Sandboxing of the execution environment so that even if a malicious command is sent, it is contained.  
- Strict validation or whitelisting of allowed commands before running them.  

**Preconditions:**  
- The victim must open a markdown file from a malicious repository that contains a code chunk marked with `{cmd=true}`.  
- The extension's code chunk execution feature must be active (live update enabled or the user explicitly runs a "run code chunk" command).  

**Source Code Analysis:**  
- In the test file "code-chunks.md," several examples use code chunks with "`bash {cmd=true}`" and "`js {cmd=node ...}`".  
- In the PreviewProvider (e.g. the functions `runCodeChunk` and `runAllCodeChunks`), the code calls the engine's corresponding functions without any sanitization of the command content.  
- The engine (provided by crossnote/mume) is expected to execute the given command via a child process without additional validation.  

**Security Test Case:**  
- Create a markdown file that contains a code chunk with `{cmd=true}` where the command is a malicious payload (for example, on Windows: `calc.exe` or on Unix: `touch /tmp/compromised` or any command demonstrating unauthorized action).  
- Open the markdown file in VS Code with the extension active and trigger the "Run Code Chunk" command.  
- Verify that the command is executed by checking if the calculator opens or the file is created, respectively.

## 3. Code Injection via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Preview HTML

**Description:**  
- The extension's preview is implemented as a webview that communicates with the extension host using the message channel.  
- In the initialization of the preview (in the PreviewProvider class), a message listener is registered via `previewPanel.webview.onDidReceiveMessage` that directly calls:  
  `vscode.commands.executeCommand(\`_crossnote.\${message.command}\`, ...message.args)`  
- No validation or whitelisting is applied to the incoming `message.command` field.  
- An attacker who is able to influence the content loaded into the preview (for example, by supplying a malicious repository that includes a manipulated "head.html" file or by taking advantage of the markdown's allowance for inline HTML if script execution is enabled) could inject a JavaScript payload that posts a crafted message to the extension host.  
- This could force the extension to execute unintended commands.  

**Impact:**  
- This may permit arbitrary command injection within the context of the extension host, offering another path to remote code execution or control over extension behavior.  

**Vulnerability Rank:** High  

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
- The preview webview is generated by the engine's `generateHTMLTemplateForPreview` function, and—ideally—a content security policy should limit external script execution. However, the configuration here leaves the `contentSecurityPolicy` parameter as an empty string.  
- There is no explicit validation in the onDidReceiveMessage handler.  

**Missing Mitigations:**  
- Validate and restrict the list of allowed command names in messages (for example, by using a whitelist of permitted command identifiers).  
- Apply a robust content security policy in the generated HTML to prevent injection of malicious scripts that might post arbitrary messages.  

**Preconditions:**  
- The attacker must be able to influence the preview's HTML content (for example, by introducing malicious code in a configuration file such as "head.html" or if the markdown is allowed to include unsanitized inline HTML/JS).  

**Source Code Analysis:**  
- In `src/extension-common.ts`, the following code is used to handle messages from the webview:  
  ```js
  previewPanel.webview.onDidReceiveMessage(
    (message) => {
      vscode.commands.executeCommand(
        \`_crossnote.\${message.command}\`,
        ...message.args,
      );
    },
    null,
    this.context.subscriptions,
  );
  ```  
- Because `message.command` is concatenated directly to the prefix without checking against a list of expected strings, an attacker who controls the webview may send an unexpected command.  

**Security Test Case:**  
- Prepare a malicious markdown file or configuration file that causes the preview's HTML to include an injected script that posts a message with a non‐standard command (for example, `"_crossnote.deleteSensitiveFiles"` with arbitrary arguments).  
- Open the repository in VS Code and allow the preview to load.  
- Use a debugger or log analysis to check if the injected command is received and executed by the extension host.  
- Verify that proper message validation (if added) blocks the attempt.
