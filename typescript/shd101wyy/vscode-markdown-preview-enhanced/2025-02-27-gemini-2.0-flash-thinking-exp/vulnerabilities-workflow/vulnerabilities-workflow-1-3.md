### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Code Chunk Command Injection
- Description:
    1. The extension allows users to execute code chunks within markdown documents.
    2. The language identifier specified in the code chunk block is used to determine the execution environment.
    3. By crafting a malicious language identifier, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the execution environment.
    4. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when the markdown document is previewed or when code chunks are explicitly executed.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - Potential for data exfiltration, system compromise, or further exploitation.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided project files. The code relies on the `crossnote` library for code execution, and there is no explicit sanitization of language identifiers in the extension's code. The configuration `enableScriptExecution` controls the general ability to execute scripts, but does not prevent command injection if the language identifier itself is maliciously crafted.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation of language identifiers to prevent command injection.
    - Secure code execution environment with proper sandboxing or isolation.
    - Whitelisting of allowed languages and execution parameters.
- Preconditions:
    - User must open and preview a malicious markdown document in VSCode using the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension.
    - User must have the extension installed and activated.
- Source code analysis:
    1. In `src/extension-common.ts`, the `runCodeChunk` and `runAllCodeChunks` commands are registered. These commands are triggered from the preview webview.
    2. These commands in `src/preview-provider.ts` likely call the `crossnote` library to execute the code chunk. The provided code in `preview-provider.ts` shows the setup of the preview and message handling, but not the code chunk execution itself, which is assumed to be handled by the `crossnote` library.
    3. Examining `test/markdown/code-chunks.md` and `test/markdown/diagrams.md` (from previous context, not in provided files, but relevant to understand feature), we can see various language identifiers used in code blocks, such as `bash`, `js`, `python`, `latex`, `gnuplot`, `erd`, `mermaid`, `puml`, `plantuml`, `wavedrom`, `viz`, `vega`, `vega-lite`, `ditaa`.
    4. The vulnerability lies in the potential lack of sanitization of these language identifiers before they are passed to the code execution functions in `crossnote`. The provided code does not show any sanitization in the extension itself.
    5. An attacker could attempt to inject malicious commands by crafting a language identifier like `bash; malicious_command; bash` or similar, hoping that the underlying execution mechanism interprets this as a valid language and executes the injected command.
    ```typescript
    // Example vulnerable code path (conceptual, actual code might be in crossnote):
    // In preview-provider.ts or crossnote library:
    function executeCodeChunk(language: string, code: string, options: any) {
        // Vulnerable point: language identifier is used directly in command execution
        const command = `${language} -c "${code}"`; // Example: bash -c "ls -l"
        // If language is controlled by attacker, they can inject commands.
        // Example: language = "bash; rm -rf /tmp; bash"
        // command becomes: "bash; rm -rf /tmp; bash" -c "..."
        // This will execute "rm -rf /tmp" before executing the intended code.
        child_process.execSync(command, options);
    }
    ```
- Security test case:
    1. Create a new markdown file named `command_injection.md`.
    2. Add the following markdown content to the file:
    ```markdown
    ## Command Injection Test

    ```bash; touch /tmp/pwned; bash
    echo "This is a test"
    ```

    ```js {cmd=bash; touch /tmp/pwned_js; bash}
    console.log("This is a test");
    ```

    ```python {cmd=bash -c "touch /tmp/pwned_python"}
    print("This is a test")
    ```
    3. Open `command_injection.md` in VSCode.
    4. Open the preview for `command_injection.md` (`Ctrl+Shift+V` or `Cmd+Shift+V`).
    5. Execute the code chunks by right-clicking in the preview and selecting "Run All Code Chunks" or by using the command palette to run code chunks.
    6. After execution, check if the files `/tmp/pwned`, `/tmp/pwned_js`, and `/tmp/pwned_python` exist on the system.
    7. If these files are created, it confirms that command injection is successful, and arbitrary commands could be executed.
