## Threat Model: TypeORM Application - Focused High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application using TypeORM by exploiting its weaknesses.

**Sub-Tree:**

*   Compromise Application via TypeORM Exploitation (OR)
    *   *** Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (OR) ***  <-- HIGH-RISK PATH
        *   Manipulate Query Builder (AND)
            *   *** Inject Malicious Input into Raw SQL Queries (CRITICAL NODE) ***
    *   *** Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (OR) ***  <-- HIGH-RISK PATH
        *   *** Insecure Database Credentials (AND) (CRITICAL NODE) ***

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. High-Risk Path: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**

*   **Description:** This path represents the risk of attackers injecting malicious SQL code into database queries executed by TypeORM. This can occur when user-provided input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in query construction. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

    *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Input into Raw SQL Queries**
        *   **Attack Vector:** When developers use TypeORM's `query()` method to execute raw SQL queries and directly incorporate unsanitized user input into these queries, it creates a direct pathway for SQL injection attacks.
        *   **Mechanism:** An attacker can craft malicious input that, when concatenated into the raw SQL query, alters the query's intended logic. This can allow them to bypass security checks, retrieve sensitive data, modify existing data, or even execute arbitrary database commands.
        *   **Example:**  Consider the following code:
            ```typescript
            const userId = req.params.id;
            const user = await connection.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);
            ```
            An attacker could provide a malicious `userId` like `1 OR 1=1` to retrieve all users, or `1; DROP TABLE users;` to delete the entire users table.
        *   **Risk Factors:**
            *   High Likelihood: Direct use of raw queries with user input is a common and easily made mistake.
            *   High Impact: Successful exploitation can lead to full database compromise.
            *   Low Effort: Standard SQL injection techniques and readily available tools can be used.
            *   Beginner/Intermediate Skill Level: Basic understanding of SQL injection is sufficient.
            *   Medium Detection Difficulty: While detectable through query analysis, it requires vigilance and proper logging.

**2. High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities**

*   **Description:** This path highlights the risks associated with insecurely configured application settings, particularly those related to database access. If an attacker can gain access to sensitive configuration information, they can potentially bypass application security and directly access the database.

    *   **Critical Node: Insecure Database Credentials**
        *   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the risk of database credentials (username, password, host, port) being stored insecurely. Common insecure storage methods include:
            *   Hardcoding credentials directly in the application code.
            *   Storing credentials in version control systems.
            *   Placing credentials in easily accessible configuration files without proper access controls.
            *   Exposing credentials through overly permissive environment variable configurations.
        *   **Mechanism:** If an attacker gains access to these insecurely stored credentials, they can directly connect to the database, bypassing the application layer entirely. This grants them full control over the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data.
        *   **Example:**  Finding database credentials hardcoded in a configuration file committed to a public repository or accessible through a misconfigured server.
        *   **Risk Factors:**
            *   Medium Likelihood: While best practices discourage it, insecure credential storage remains a common misconfiguration.
            *   Critical Impact: Successful exploitation grants full database access, bypassing all application security.
            *   Low Effort:  Often requires basic access to the server or configuration files.
            *   Beginner Skill Level:  Requires basic system administration knowledge or access to sensitive files.
            *   Hard Detection Difficulty: May not leave obvious traces if access appears legitimate.
