### Key TypeORM Attack Surface List (High & Critical - TypeORM Direct Involvement)

Here's an updated list focusing on high and critical attack surfaces directly involving TypeORM:

*   **SQL Injection via Raw Queries:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into queries executed against the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    *   **How TypeORM Contributes:** TypeORM's `query()` method allows developers to execute raw SQL queries. If user-provided data is directly concatenated into these queries without proper sanitization, it creates a direct pathway for SQL injection.
    *   **Example:**
        ```typescript
        const userId = req.params.id; // User-provided input
        const user = await connection.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`); // Vulnerable
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Full database compromise, data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements:** TypeORM supports this through its query builder and repository methods. This ensures user input is treated as data, not executable code.
        *   **Avoid using the `query()` method with unsanitized user input.** If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, carefully sanitize and validate all user-provided data.

*   **ORM Injection through Query Builder Manipulation:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the parameters or conditions used in TypeORM's query builder methods (e.g., `find`, `where`) to construct unintended or malicious SQL queries.
    *   **How TypeORM Contributes:** If application logic directly incorporates user input into the arguments of query builder methods without proper validation, attackers can influence the generated SQL.
    *   **Example:**
        ```typescript
        const searchCriteria = req.query.criteria; // User-provided input
        const users = await userRepository.find({ where: searchCriteria }); // Potentially vulnerable
        ```
    *   **Impact:** High. Unauthorized data access, data filtering bypass, potential data modification depending on the manipulated query.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate and sanitize user input before using it in query builder methods.** Define allowed values or patterns for input parameters.
        *   **Use a predefined set of allowed search criteria or filters.** Avoid directly passing arbitrary user input to the `where` clause.
        *   **Consider using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to map and validate user input before using it in database queries.**

*   **Insecure Use of `synchronize: true` in Production:**
    *   **Description:** Enabling the `synchronize: true` option in a production environment allows TypeORM to automatically alter the database schema based on entity definitions. This can lead to unintended schema changes or data loss if an attacker gains control or if there are errors in entity definitions.
    *   **How TypeORM Contributes:** TypeORM provides this convenience feature, but it's inherently risky in production due to the potential for unintended database modifications.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gaining access to the application's configuration could potentially modify entity definitions, leading to TypeORM altering the production database schema upon application restart.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Data loss, database corruption, application instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never use `synchronize: true` in production environments.**
        *   **Use database migrations for schema management in production.** TypeORM supports migrations, providing a controlled and versioned way to update the database schema.

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs:**
    *   **Description:** TypeORM's logging can output detailed information, including SQL queries with parameters. If logging is not properly configured or access to logs is not restricted, sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, personal information) might be exposed.
    *   **How TypeORM Contributes:** TypeORM's logging mechanism, while helpful for debugging, can inadvertently expose sensitive information if not handled carefully.
    *   **Example:**  TypeORM logging might output a query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE password = 'user_provided_password'`.
    *   **Impact:** High. Exposure of sensitive user data, potential credential compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure TypeORM logging appropriately for production environments.** Avoid logging sensitive data or use a less verbose logging level.
        *   **Implement secure log management practices.** Restrict access to log files, use log rotation, and consider log anonymization or masking techniques.
