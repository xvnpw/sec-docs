# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typeorm/typeorm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Always Use Parameterized Queries via TypeORM](./mitigation_strategies/always_use_parameterized_queries_via_typeorm.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Prioritize Query Builder and Repository Methods:** Developers must consistently utilize TypeORM's Query Builder and Repository methods for all database interactions. These are designed to automatically parameterize queries, preventing SQL injection.
    *   **Step 2: Parameterize Raw SQL Queries (If Necessary):** If raw SQL queries (`query()` method) are absolutely unavoidable, developers *must* use parameterization. Pass user-provided values as the `parameters` array in the `query()` method.  Never construct raw SQL queries by directly concatenating user input strings.
    *   **Step 3: Code Review for Raw SQL Usage:** Regularly review the codebase to identify and minimize instances of raw SQL queries.  Refactor raw SQL to use Query Builder or Repository methods whenever feasible.
    *   **Step 4: Developer Training on TypeORM Parameterization:** Ensure developers are thoroughly trained on how TypeORM handles parameterization and the critical importance of using it, especially when dealing with user inputs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Severity: High) - Directly mitigates SQL injection vulnerabilities by ensuring user inputs are treated as data, not executable code, within database queries constructed by TypeORM.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High risk reduction -  Effectively eliminates SQL injection risks arising from TypeORM usage by enforcing parameterized queries, which is a core security feature of TypeORM when used correctly.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Largely implemented as the application primarily relies on TypeORM's Query Builder and Repository methods. Parameterized queries are the standard practice for most data access operations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Occasional use of raw SQL queries might still exist in older modules or specific complex queries. These instances need to be identified and refactored to leverage TypeORM's parameterization capabilities or Query Builder.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize TypeORM's Validation Features in Entities](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_typeorm's_validation_features_in_entities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Define Validation Decorators in Entities:**  Leverage TypeORM's built-in validation capabilities by using validation decorators (e.g., `@Length`, `@IsEmail`, `@IsNotEmpty`, `@Min`, `@Max`) directly within entity property definitions.
    *   **Step 2: Enable Validation in TypeORM Configuration:** Ensure that validation is enabled in your TypeORM configuration.  This might involve setting configuration options or using framework integrations that automatically trigger validation.
    *   **Step 3: Handle Validation Errors:** Implement proper error handling to catch and process validation errors thrown by TypeORM when saving or updating entities. Return informative error messages to the user and log validation failures.
    *   **Step 4: Combine with Application-Level Validation (Defense-in-Depth):** While TypeORM validation is helpful, it should be considered a part of a defense-in-depth strategy.  Complement it with validation at the application layer (e.g., using DTO validation or framework validation pipes) for more comprehensive input validation.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues (Severity: Medium) - Ensures data stored in the database conforms to defined constraints and business rules enforced by entity validation decorators in TypeORM.
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (Severity: Low) -  Indirectly helps by ensuring that even if unintended properties are attempted to be set, validation rules might prevent invalid data from being persisted.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium risk reduction - Improves data quality and consistency by enforcing validation rules at the ORM level.
    *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities: Low risk reduction - Provides a minor indirect benefit as a secondary check.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Entity validation decorators are used in some entities, particularly in newer modules. However, validation is not consistently applied across all entities and properties.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A systematic review and implementation of validation decorators across all relevant entity properties is needed.  Validation needs to be consistently enabled and error handling for validation failures needs to be robustly implemented throughout the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Be Mindful of Eager Loading in TypeORM Relationships](./mitigation_strategies/be_mindful_of_eager_loading_in_typeorm_relationships.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Default to Lazy Loading:**  Design entity relationships to use lazy loading by default. This means related entities are only loaded when explicitly accessed.
    *   **Step 2: Use Eager Loading Selectively:**  Employ eager loading (`relations` option in `find` methods or `leftJoinAndSelect` in Query Builder) strategically and only when necessary to retrieve related data in a single query.
    *   **Step 3: Analyze Query Performance with Eager Loading:**  Carefully analyze the performance impact of eager loading, especially for complex relationships. Monitor query execution times and database load.
    *   **Step 4: Avoid Excessive Eager Loading:**  Prevent eager loading of deeply nested or circular relationships, as this can lead to performance bottlenecks and excessive data retrieval (over-fetching).
    *   **Step 5: Optimize Queries with Query Builder:** For complex data retrieval scenarios, utilize TypeORM's Query Builder to construct optimized queries that precisely specify the required data and relationships, avoiding unnecessary eager loading.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium) - Prevents performance degradation and potential DoS conditions caused by inefficient queries resulting from excessive eager loading in TypeORM.
    *   Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium) - Improves application responsiveness by optimizing data retrieval and avoiding unnecessary database load associated with over-fetching due to eager loading.
    *   Data Exposure (Severity: Low) -  Reduces the risk of unintentionally exposing related data that might not be necessary for the current operation by controlling data retrieval through lazy loading and selective eager loading.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium risk reduction - Mitigates DoS risks related to query performance by optimizing data loading strategies within TypeORM.
    *   Performance Degradation: Medium risk reduction - Improves application performance by reducing database load and query execution times.
    *   Data Exposure: Low risk reduction - Offers a minor indirect benefit in controlling data exposure.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Lazy loading is generally the default behavior for relationships. However, eager loading is used in various parts of the application, sometimes without careful consideration of its performance implications.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A systematic review of eager loading usage is needed to identify instances where it is unnecessary or causing performance issues.  Lazy loading should be enforced as the standard, and eager loading should be applied consciously and strategically only when performance benefits are clearly demonstrated.  Developer guidelines on relationship loading strategies within TypeORM are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated with TypeORM Releases and Security Advisories](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated_with_typeorm_releases_and_security_advisories.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Monitor TypeORM Releases:** Regularly check for new TypeORM releases on GitHub, npm, or the official TypeORM website.
    *   **Step 2: Review Release Notes and Changelogs:** Carefully review release notes and changelogs for each new TypeORM version to identify bug fixes, security patches, and new features.
    *   **Step 3: Subscribe to Security Advisories (If Available):** If TypeORM provides a security advisory mailing list or notification system, subscribe to it to receive timely alerts about potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Step 4: Timely Updates:**  Plan and execute timely updates of TypeORM to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.  Prioritize security updates.
    *   **Step 5: Test After Updates:**  Thoroughly test the application after updating TypeORM to ensure compatibility and identify any regressions introduced by the update.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   ORM-Specific Vulnerabilities (Severity: Varies, can be High) - Addresses potential security vulnerabilities within TypeORM itself by applying security patches and bug fixes released in newer versions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   ORM-Specific Vulnerabilities: High risk reduction -  Crucial for mitigating known vulnerabilities in TypeORM and maintaining a secure ORM layer.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TypeORM updates are performed periodically, but not always in a timely manner after new releases.  Monitoring of release notes and security advisories is not consistently proactive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a process for regularly monitoring TypeORM releases and security advisories.  Implement a policy for timely updates, especially for security-related releases.  Integrate TypeORM update checks into the development workflow and security maintenance schedule.
