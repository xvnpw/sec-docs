*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Higher Risk of Error:** Manual parameterization in raw SQL is more prone to developer error compared to the automatic parameterization of Query Builder. Developers must be meticulous and fully understand the importance of parameterization in this context.
    *   **Reduced Readability and Maintainability:** Raw SQL queries, even when parameterized, can be less readable and harder to maintain than queries built with Query Builder.
    *   **Potential for Misuse:** Developers might be tempted to use raw SQL unnecessarily, potentially increasing the attack surface if not properly controlled.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Minimize Raw SQL Usage:**  Continuously strive to refactor raw SQL queries to use Query Builder or Repository methods whenever possible.
    *   **Strict Code Review for Raw SQL:**  Implement mandatory and rigorous code reviews specifically focusing on any instances of raw SQL usage to ensure correct parameterization and justify the necessity of raw SQL.
    *   **Provide Clear Examples and Documentation:**  Offer clear and concise examples in developer documentation and training materials demonstrating the correct way to parameterize raw SQL queries in TypeORM, and explicitly show *incorrect* examples (string concatenation) to highlight the risks.

#### Step 3: Code Review for Raw SQL Usage

*   **Analysis:** This step is a critical control mechanism. Regular code reviews specifically targeting raw SQL usage are essential for enforcing the mitigation strategy and identifying deviations. Code reviews act as a safety net, catching potential vulnerabilities that might have been missed during development.  This proactive approach helps maintain a secure codebase over time.

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Dedicated Code Review Checklist:**  Create a specific checklist for code reviewers focusing on SQL injection prevention and raw SQL usage in TypeORM.
    *   **Security-Focused Training for Reviewers:**  Provide specialized training for code reviewers on identifying SQL injection vulnerabilities and best practices for secure TypeORM development.
    *   **Automated Code Analysis Tools (Optional):**  Explore the use of static analysis security testing (SAST) tools that can automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities and highlight raw SQL usage for review.

#### Step 4: Developer Training on TypeORM Parameterization

*   **Analysis:**  Developer training is fundamental to the success of this mitigation strategy.  Well-trained developers are the first line of defense against security vulnerabilities.  Training should not only cover *how* to use parameterized queries in TypeORM but also *why* it is crucial for security and the potential consequences of SQL injection attacks.  Practical, hands-on training with real-world examples is most effective.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Proactive Security Mindset:**  Empowers developers to write secure code from the outset, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced.
