# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typeorm/typeorm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Parameterized Queries in TypeORM](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_parameterized_queries_in_typeorm.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strictly Utilize TypeORM Query Builder and Repository Methods:**  Developers must exclusively use TypeORM's Query Builder and Repository methods for all database interactions. These methods are designed to automatically parameterize queries, preventing SQL injection.
    2.  **Ban Raw SQL Queries:** Explicitly prohibit the construction of raw SQL queries using string concatenation or template literals within the application code. Code reviews should actively look for and reject any instances of raw SQL.
    3.  **TypeORM Configuration Review:** Review TypeORM configuration to ensure default settings encourage parameterized queries and do not inadvertently enable insecure query building practices.
    4.  **Developer Training Focused on TypeORM:** Provide targeted training to developers specifically on how to leverage TypeORM's Query Builder and Repository API to construct secure, parameterized queries. Highlight the dangers of bypassing these methods and resorting to raw SQL.
    5.  **Static Analysis for TypeORM Usage:**  If possible, explore static analysis tools or linters that can be configured to specifically check for proper usage of TypeORM's query building features and flag potential raw SQL constructions within TypeORM context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):**  Directly mitigates SQL Injection vulnerabilities by ensuring user-provided data is always treated as data, not executable SQL code, when interacting with the database through TypeORM.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from database interactions managed by TypeORM. When consistently enforced, it can virtually eliminate this class of vulnerability within the ORM's scope.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:**  Developers generally use TypeORM's Repository methods for standard CRUD operations, which inherently use parameterized queries. However, awareness and strict enforcement are not consistent across all development practices, especially for complex queries.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Ban on Raw SQL:**  No explicit project-wide rule or coding standard formally banning raw SQL queries in TypeORM contexts.
    *   **Static Analysis for TypeORM:**  No static analysis tools are currently configured to specifically enforce TypeORM parameterized query usage or detect raw SQL within TypeORM interactions.
    *   **Targeted TypeORM Training:**  Specific training focused on secure query building *within* TypeORM is lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for TypeORM Entity Updates to Prevent Mass Assignment](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_data_transfer_objects__dtos__for_typeorm_entity_updates_to_prevent_mass_assignment.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define DTOs for TypeORM Entities:** For every TypeORM entity that is exposed for creation or updates via API endpoints, create dedicated DTO classes. These DTOs should precisely define the allowed fields that can be modified through API requests.
    2.  **Map and Validate Request Data to DTOs (Pre-TypeORM Entity):** In API controllers, receive request data and immediately map it to the corresponding DTO. Use validation libraries (e.g., `class-validator` with NestJS) to validate the DTO data against the defined rules *before* interacting with TypeORM entities.
    3.  **TypeORM Entity Updates via DTOs Only:**  When updating TypeORM entities, instantiate or retrieve the entity and then selectively update its properties *only* from the validated DTO properties. Avoid directly assigning the entire DTO or request body to the TypeORM entity using methods like `Object.assign` which bypass explicit field control.
    4.  **TypeORM Entity Design for Mass Assignment Awareness:**  While DTOs are the primary control, consider using TypeORM's `@Exclude` decorator on sensitive entity properties that should *never* be directly updated via API requests as an additional layer of defense within the entity definition itself.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerability (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting TypeORM's default update behavior to modify unintended entity properties by sending extra or unexpected fields in API requests. This directly protects against unauthorized data modification and potential privilege escalation scenarios within the application's data model managed by TypeORM.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerability (High Impact):**  Effectively eliminates mass assignment vulnerabilities within the TypeORM context by enforcing strict control over which entity fields can be updated through API interactions. DTOs act as a secure intermediary, ensuring only intended data modifications are applied to TypeORM entities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** DTOs are used in some API endpoints for data validation and transformation, but their primary role in preventing mass assignment for TypeORM entities is not consistently enforced across all relevant API operations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent DTO Enforcement for TypeORM Updates:** DTOs are not universally mandated for all TypeORM entity creation and update operations. Some endpoints might still directly manipulate entities with request data, bypassing DTO-based protection.
    *   **Project Standard for DTO-Driven TypeORM Updates:**  Lack of a clear project-wide standard or guideline that explicitly requires DTOs for all TypeORM entity updates to prevent mass assignment.
    *   **Automated Enforcement/Linting for DTO Usage with TypeORM:** No automated checks or linting rules are in place to ensure DTOs are consistently used for TypeORM entity updates, leaving room for developer oversight.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update TypeORM Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_typeorm_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor TypeORM Releases and Security Advisories:**  Actively monitor the official TypeORM GitHub repository, release notes, and security advisories for announcements of new versions, bug fixes, and security patches. Subscribe to relevant notification channels if available.
    2.  **Establish a Proactive Update Schedule for TypeORM:**  Implement a regular schedule (e.g., monthly or quarterly) for reviewing and updating the TypeORM library to the latest stable version. Treat TypeORM updates as a priority, especially when security patches are released.
    3.  **Thorough Testing After TypeORM Updates:** After updating TypeORM, conduct comprehensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests, to verify compatibility with the updated library and ensure no regressions or unexpected behavior are introduced in the application's TypeORM interactions.
    4.  **Automated Dependency Update Tools for TypeORM (with Controlled Rollout):** Consider using automated dependency update tools (like Dependabot) to streamline the process of proposing TypeORM updates. However, configure these tools to allow for manual review and testing before automatically merging TypeORM updates, especially for major version changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known TypeORM Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Directly mitigates the risk of attackers exploiting publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities within the TypeORM library itself. Keeping TypeORM updated ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched and the application benefits from the latest security improvements in the ORM.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known TypeORM Vulnerabilities (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known TypeORM vulnerabilities. Regular updates are crucial for maintaining the security posture of the application's data access layer and preventing attacks that target weaknesses in the ORM library itself.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Reactive Updates:** TypeORM updates are generally performed reactively, often when a bug or compatibility issue is encountered, rather than proactively on a scheduled basis to address potential security vulnerabilities.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Proactive Update Schedule for TypeORM:**  No established schedule or process for proactively updating TypeORM on a regular cadence.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Monitoring for TypeORM:**  No automated systems in place to specifically monitor for and alert on newly disclosed security vulnerabilities in TypeORM.
    *   **Formal Testing Protocol for TypeORM Updates:**  Lack of a defined testing protocol specifically for verifying application stability and security after TypeORM library updates.
