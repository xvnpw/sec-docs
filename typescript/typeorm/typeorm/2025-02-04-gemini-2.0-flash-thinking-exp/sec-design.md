# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust, flexible, and easy-to-use Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for TypeScript and JavaScript developers.
  - Simplify database interactions, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than database-specific code.
  - Support a wide range of database systems and features.
  - Maintain high performance and reliability.
  - Foster a strong community and provide excellent documentation and support.
- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in TypeORM could lead to data breaches or corruption in applications that use it.
  - Bugs or instability could disrupt applications relying on TypeORM, impacting business operations.
  - Lack of support for new database features or versions could limit adoption and developer satisfaction.
  - Poor performance could negatively affect application responsiveness and user experience.
  - Insufficient documentation or community support could hinder adoption and increase development costs for users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - publicly accessible code allows for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Unit and Integration Tests - automated tests help ensure code correctness and prevent regressions, including potential security flaws. Implemented in: GitHub Actions workflows and project's test suite.
  - security control: GitHub Issue Tracking - public issue tracker allows users to report bugs and security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub Issues.
  - security control: Dependency Management - using `npm` and `package-lock.json` to manage dependencies and ensure consistent builds. Implemented in: `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential delay in security patch releases due to the open-source and community-driven nature of the project.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by TypeORM.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement Dependency Vulnerability Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits, potentially by external security experts, to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for handling security vulnerability reports, including responsible disclosure and timely patching.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using TypeORM to build secure applications, focusing on topics like input validation and secure database interactions.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - TypeORM itself does not handle application-level authentication.
    - TypeORM should support secure connection methods to databases that enforce authentication (e.g., username/password, certificate-based authentication, OAuth).
    - TypeORM configuration should allow specifying secure authentication mechanisms supported by the underlying database.
  - Authorization:
    - TypeORM does not enforce application-level authorization.
    - TypeORM should facilitate the implementation of authorization logic within applications by providing mechanisms to query and manipulate data based on user roles and permissions (e.g., through query builders and data access patterns).
    - TypeORM should not bypass database-level authorization mechanisms.
  - Input Validation:
    - TypeORM should provide mechanisms to prevent common injection attacks, such as SQL injection.
    - TypeORM should encourage or enforce parameterized queries or prepared statements as the default way to interact with databases to mitigate SQL injection risks.
    - TypeORM should validate input data types and formats where applicable to prevent unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - TypeORM should support secure connections to databases using encryption protocols like TLS/SSL.
    - TypeORM should not implement its own cryptography for data at rest encryption, but should rely on database-level encryption features when required.
    - If TypeORM handles sensitive data in memory (e.g., during data transformation), consider secure handling practices to avoid exposing sensitive information.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Data Persistence and Retrieval: Ensuring reliable and secure storage and retrieval of application data is critical for all applications using TypeORM. Data loss or corruption can lead to significant business disruption.
  - Data Integrity: Maintaining the integrity of data stored and managed by TypeORM is crucial. Data corruption or unauthorized modification can have severe consequences for business operations and data accuracy.
  - Application Availability: TypeORM's stability and performance directly impact the availability of applications that depend on it. Issues in TypeORM can lead to application downtime or performance degradation.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data handled by TypeORM is application data, which can vary greatly in sensitivity.
  - Sensitivity depends on the application domain and can include:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII): User names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, etc.
    - Financial Data: Credit card numbers, bank account details, transaction history.
    - Healthcare Information: Patient records, medical history.
    - Intellectual Property: Proprietary business data, trade secrets.
    - Authentication Credentials: Passwords, API keys, tokens (indirectly, if stored in databases managed by TypeORM).
  - The sensitivity level requires careful consideration of security controls to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this data.
