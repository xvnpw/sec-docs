## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Input Validation in Query Builder Usage](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_input_validation_in_query_builder_usage.md)

**Attack Vector:** Dynamic Query Building Vulnerabilities -> Insufficient Input Validation in Query Builder Usage
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit the lack of proper input validation when user-provided data is directly used in TypeORM's Query Builder to construct database queries. This leads to SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Parameterize Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries in Query Builder using `:paramName` syntax.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation *before* using user inputs in Query Builder conditions. Sanitize and validate data types, formats, and allowed values.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit dynamic query building based on user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe use of `query()` or `createQueryRunner().query()` with unsanitized input](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_use_of__query____or__createqueryrunner___query____with_unsanitized_input.md)

**Attack Vector:** Raw SQL Query Vulnerabilities -> Unsafe use of `query()` or `createQueryRunner().query()` with unsanitized input
*   **Description:** Developers using raw SQL queries via `query()` or `createQueryRunner().query()` methods and directly embedding unsanitized user inputs bypass TypeORM's protections, creating direct SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Minimize Raw SQL:** Avoid using raw SQL queries whenever possible.
    *   **Parameterization for Raw SQL:** If raw SQL is necessary, *always* use parameterized queries even with `query()` method.
    *   **Code Review:** Rigorously review all code using raw SQL queries for input handling and parameterization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting insecure migration processes to run malicious migrations](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_migration_processes_to_run_malicious_migrations.md)

**Attack Vector:** Unauthorized Migration Execution -> Exploiting insecure migration processes to run malicious migrations
*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the migration execution environment or process and execute malicious migrations. This allows them to modify the database schema, insert backdoors, corrupt data, or disrupt the application.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Secure Migration Process:** Restrict access to migration scripts and execution environments. Use secure deployment pipelines and access control.
    *   **Migration Auditing:** Implement auditing and logging of migration executions.
    *   **Separate Migration Environment:** Consider a separate, controlled environment for running migrations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting known vulnerabilities in older TypeORM versions](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_older_typeorm_versions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Outdated TypeORM Version -> Exploiting known vulnerabilities in older TypeORM versions
*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of TypeORM exposes the application to known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers can exploit these public vulnerabilities.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Regularly Update TypeORM:** Keep TypeORM and its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories for TypeORM and dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Finding database credentials hardcoded or in insecure configuration files](./attack_tree_paths/finding_database_credentials_hardcoded_or_in_insecure_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exposed Database Credentials -> Finding database credentials hardcoded or in insecure configuration files
*   **Description:** Database credentials are inadvertently exposed by being hardcoded in the application code or stored in insecure configuration files (e.g., in version control, publicly accessible files). Attackers can gain full database access if they find these credentials.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Secure Credential Management:** Use secure credential management practices like environment variables or secrets management systems.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:** Never hardcode database credentials in the application code.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database Users):** Use database users with minimal necessary privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing application input validation and injecting malicious data that TypeORM processes unsafely](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_application_input_validation_and_injecting_malicious_data_that_typeorm_processes_unsafely.md)

**Attack Vector:** Application-Level Input Validation Failures leading to TypeORM Exploitation -> Bypassing application input validation and injecting malicious data that TypeORM processes unsafely
*   **Description:** Even with secure TypeORM usage, vulnerabilities arise if the application fails to properly validate input *before* passing it to TypeORM. This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection (if inputs reach dynamic queries), data integrity issues, or logic bypasses.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Comprehensive Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation at the application level for all user inputs used with TypeORM.
    *   **Input Sanitization (with caution):** Sanitize inputs, but prioritize validation.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Input Handling):** Process only necessary input data and validate against expected formats and constraints.
