# Threat Model Analysis for typeorm/typeorm

## Threat: [Raw SQL Injection](./threats/raw_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into raw SQL queries executed by TypeORM using `query()` or `createQueryRunner().query()`. This is achieved by manipulating user inputs that are directly concatenated into the SQL string without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach: Unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data from the database.
    *   Data Manipulation: Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to data integrity compromise.
    *   Account Takeover: Compromising user credentials or session data stored in the database, leading to unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   Denial of Service: Overloading the database server with resource-intensive malicious queries, causing service disruption.
*   **TypeORM Component Affected:** `QueryRunner.query()`, `Connection.query()`
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Raw SQL:** Minimize the use of `query()` and `createQueryRunner().query()` methods. Prefer using TypeORM's Query Builder or Repository methods.
    *   **Parameterization for Raw SQL (if unavoidable):** If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, always use parameterized queries. Ensure user inputs are passed as parameters and not directly embedded into the SQL string.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in any queries, even parameterized ones, as a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate instances of raw SQL usage and ensure proper parameterization where raw SQL is used.

## Threat: [Query Builder SQL Injection](./threats/query_builder_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure usage of TypeORM's Query Builder. This can occur when developers dynamically construct `where()` conditions or other query parts by directly embedding unsanitized user input instead of using parameters.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data by manipulating query conditions to bypass intended data access restrictions.
    *   Data Manipulation: Modifying or deleting data by crafting malicious queries that alter the intended query logic.
    *   Authorization Bypass: Circumventing authorization checks by manipulating query parameters to access data that should be restricted.
*   **TypeORM Component Affected:** Query Builder (`createQueryBuilder()`, `where()`, `andWhere()`, `orWhere()`, etc.)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use Parameters in Query Builder:**  Utilize parameter placeholders (`:paramName`) and the `setParameters()` method when building dynamic queries with user input in Query Builder.
    *   **Avoid String Interpolation in Query Builder Conditions:** Do not directly embed user input into string templates used for `where()` conditions.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user inputs even when using Query Builder, as it can prevent other types of issues and improve overall security.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Review Query Builder usage to ensure parameters are used correctly and user input is not directly embedded in query conditions.

## Threat: [Database Credential Exposure through Misconfiguration](./threats/database_credential_exposure_through_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to database credentials due to insecure storage or exposure related to TypeORM configuration. This can happen if credentials are hardcoded in the application, stored in plain text configuration files used by TypeORM, exposed in logs or error messages during TypeORM initialization, or accessible through insecure environment variables used in TypeORM configuration.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Database Access: Direct access to the database bypassing application security controls.
    *   Data Breach: Full access to database contents, enabling data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
    *   Data Manipulation: Unauthorized modification or deletion of data, leading to data integrity compromise.
    *   Denial of Service: Potential for attackers to disrupt database services or delete critical data.
*   **TypeORM Component Affected:** `DataSourceOptions` (connection configuration), Configuration Loading
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Store database credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:** Never hardcode database credentials directly in the application code, especially within TypeORM configuration.
    *   **Restrict Access to Configuration Files:** Limit access to configuration files used by TypeORM containing database credentials to authorized personnel and processes.
    *   **Secure Logging Practices:** Prevent database connection strings or credentials from being logged in application logs or error messages, especially during TypeORM startup.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of TypeORM configuration and credential management practices.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in TypeORM or Drivers](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_typeorm_or_drivers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in the TypeORM library itself, database drivers used by TypeORM, or transitive dependencies. These vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution: Exploitation of vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   Data Breach: Vulnerabilities could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to data stored in the database.
    *   Denial of Service: Vulnerabilities could be exploited to crash the application or database server.
*   **TypeORM Component Affected:** Core TypeORM Library, Database Drivers (e.g., `pg`, `mysql`, `sqlite3`), Dependencies
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Keep TypeORM, database drivers, and all other dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and monitor vulnerability databases for new vulnerabilities affecting TypeORM and its dependencies.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA practices to manage and track dependencies, identify vulnerabilities, and ensure timely updates.
    *   **Security Testing:** Include security testing in the development lifecycle to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in TypeORM usage and dependencies.
