### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: SQL Injection via Raw SQL Queries

#### 4.1. Deeper Dive into the Vulnerability

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection vulnerability that occurs when malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g., to dump the database contents to the attacker). In the context of TypeORM and raw SQL queries, the vulnerability arises when developers directly embed user-provided input into SQL query strings without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Why Raw SQL Queries are Vulnerable:**

*   **Direct Database Interaction:** Raw SQL queries, by their nature, bypass the abstraction and safety mechanisms often provided by ORMs like TypeORM's QueryBuilder and Repository methods. They give developers direct control over the SQL executed against the database.
*   **String Concatenation/Interpolation:** The primary vulnerability vector is the use of string concatenation or interpolation to build SQL queries. When user input is directly inserted into these strings, it becomes part of the SQL command itself, rather than being treated as data.
*   **Lack of Input Separation:**  Without proper parameterization, the database has no way to distinguish between SQL code intended by the developer and user-provided input that might contain malicious SQL code.

**TypeORM's Role:**

TypeORM provides the `query()` and `createQueryRunner().query()` methods specifically to allow developers to execute raw SQL queries. While this flexibility is sometimes necessary for complex or database-specific operations, it also introduces the risk of SQL injection if not handled carefully. TypeORM itself does not inherently introduce the vulnerability; it is the *misuse* of these raw query methods that creates the attack surface.

**Example Breakdown:**

In the provided example:

```typescript
const userId = req.params.id; // User-provided input
const rawQuery = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`; // Vulnerable concatenation
const user = await connection.query(rawQuery);
```

If `req.params.id` is `'1 OR 1=1--'`, the resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1--
```

*   `OR 1=1` always evaluates to true, effectively bypassing the `WHERE id = 1` condition.
*   `--` is a SQL comment, ignoring the rest of the original query (if any).

This simple injection allows an attacker to retrieve *all* users from the database, regardless of the intended user ID. More sophisticated injections can have far more severe consequences.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Beyond the basic example, attackers can leverage SQL injection via raw queries for various malicious purposes:

*   **Data Exfiltration (Data Breach):**
    *   **`UNION SELECT` Injection:** Attackers can use `UNION SELECT` to append their own queries to the original query, retrieving data from other tables or columns.
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM admin_users --
        ```
        This could expose sensitive data like usernames, passwords, or other confidential information.
    *   **Out-of-band Data Exfiltration:** In some cases, attackers can use database-specific functions to exfiltrate data to external servers, even if direct output is limited.

*   **Data Manipulation (Modification, Deletion):**
    *   **`UPDATE` Injection:** Attackers can modify data in the database.
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = 1; --
        ```
        This could elevate privileges or alter critical application data.
    *   **`DELETE` Injection:** Attackers can delete data.
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; DELETE FROM users; --
        ```
        This could lead to data loss and denial of service.
    *   **`INSERT` Injection:** Attackers can insert new data, potentially creating backdoors or injecting malicious content.

*   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**
    *   **Bypassing Login Forms:** SQL injection can be used to bypass authentication mechanisms.
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${userInputUsername}' AND password = '${userInputPassword}'
        ```
        An attacker could inject `' OR '1'='1'` into the username or password field to bypass authentication.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Malicious queries can be crafted to consume excessive database resources, leading to performance degradation or server crashes.
    *   **Data Deletion (as mentioned above).**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**
    *   By manipulating data or executing stored procedures, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges within the application or database system.

*   **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   Even when direct output is not visible, attackers can use blind SQL injection techniques (boolean-based or time-based) to infer information about the database structure and data by observing application behavior or response times.

#### 4.3. Technical Details of Exploitation

Exploiting SQL injection often involves a process of reconnaissance and refinement:

1.  **Detection and Confirmation:** Attackers first attempt to identify potential SQL injection points. This can be done through:
    *   **Error-based Injection:** Triggering database errors by injecting special characters (e.g., single quotes, double quotes) and observing error messages.
    *   **Boolean-based Blind Injection:** Injecting conditions that should result in different application behavior (e.g., different responses, content, or response times) based on whether the condition is true or false.
    *   **Time-based Blind Injection:** Injecting SQL commands that introduce delays (e.g., `SLEEP()` in MySQL, `pg_sleep()` in PostgreSQL) and measuring response times to infer information.

2.  **Database Fingerprinting:** Once an injection point is confirmed, attackers may try to identify the database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL) and version to tailor their attacks, as SQL syntax and functions vary.

3.  **Payload Crafting:** Attackers craft specific SQL injection payloads to achieve their objectives (data exfiltration, manipulation, etc.). This often involves:
    *   **Understanding the Query Structure:**  Inferring the structure of the vulnerable SQL query to inject payloads effectively.
    *   **Using SQL Injection Techniques:** Employing techniques like `UNION SELECT`, stacked queries, subqueries, and database-specific functions.
    *   **Encoding and Escaping Bypass:**  Using encoding techniques (e.g., URL encoding, Unicode encoding) or database-specific escaping bypasses to circumvent basic input validation or WAF rules.

4.  **Automation:**  Attackers often use automated tools to scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities and automate the exploitation process, especially for blind SQL injection.

**Database-Specific Nuances:**

SQL injection syntax and available functions can differ across database systems. Attackers need to adapt their payloads accordingly. For example:

*   **String Concatenation:**  MySQL uses `CONCAT()`, PostgreSQL uses `||`, MSSQL uses `+`.
*   **Comments:** MySQL and MSSQL use `-- `, PostgreSQL uses `--`.
*   **System Functions:** Functions for retrieving database names, users, versions, etc., are database-specific.

#### 4.4. Potential Weaknesses in Existing Mitigations (and Expansion)

While the provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point, they can be strengthened and expanded upon:

*   **Prioritize `QueryBuilder` and Repository Methods:**
    *   **Strength:**  TypeORM's QueryBuilder and Repository methods are designed to prevent SQL injection by using parameterization under the hood. They abstract away the direct construction of SQL strings.
    *   **Weakness:** Developers might still fall back to raw queries for perceived flexibility or when facing complex queries they believe are not easily achievable with QueryBuilder.  **Recommendation:**  Provide comprehensive documentation and examples demonstrating how to achieve complex queries using QueryBuilder and Repository methods. Invest in developer training to promote their use.

*   **Parameterize Raw SQL:**
    *   **Strength:** Parameterization is the *most effective* defense against SQL injection. It separates SQL code from user input, treating user input as data, not code. TypeORM supports parameterized queries with `query()` and `createQueryRunner().query()`.
    *   **Weakness:** Developers might forget to parameterize, especially in fast-paced development environments.  **Recommendation:**  Enforce parameterization through code reviews, linters, and static analysis tools. Provide clear and prominent examples of parameterized raw queries in documentation.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strength:** Input validation helps to ensure that user input conforms to expected formats and constraints, reducing the attack surface. Sanitization can attempt to remove or escape potentially malicious characters.
    *   **Weakness:**  **Input validation is NOT a primary defense against SQL injection.** It's a *defense-in-depth* measure. Relying solely on validation or sanitization is dangerous and prone to bypasses. Blacklisting specific characters is particularly ineffective. Whitelisting and proper escaping are better, but parameterization remains paramount.  **Recommendation:**  Use input validation primarily for data integrity and business logic, *not* as a replacement for parameterization. If sanitization is used (e.g., for escaping special characters in dynamic SQL generation in very specific cases - which should be minimized), use robust, context-aware escaping functions provided by the database driver or a well-vetted library, and always combine it with parameterization where possible.

**Expanded and Enhanced Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Grant database users only the minimum necessary privileges required for the application to function. Avoid using database accounts with `root` or `admin` privileges for application connections. This limits the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where raw SQL queries are used. Use code review checklists that include SQL injection prevention.

*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Configure these tools to specifically detect unsafe use of raw SQL queries and lack of parameterization.

*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Use DAST tools and engage in regular penetration testing to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities in running applications. Penetration testing can simulate real-world attacks and uncover vulnerabilities that static analysis might miss.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Deploy a WAF to act as a secondary layer of defense. WAFs can detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns. However, WAFs are not a substitute for secure coding practices and parameterization. They should be considered a safety net, not the primary defense.

*   **Developer Security Training:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Provide comprehensive security training to developers, focusing on secure coding practices, SQL injection prevention, and the proper use of ORMs like TypeORM.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   **Recommendation:** While not directly preventing SQL injection, a well-configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of certain types of data exfiltration or post-exploitation activities by limiting the resources the browser can load and the actions it can perform.

#### 4.5. Tools and Techniques for Detection and Prevention

**Detection Tools and Techniques:**

*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) Tools:**
    *   Examples: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify, Veracode.
    *   **Purpose:** Analyze source code to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by scanning for patterns of unsafe raw query usage and lack of parameterization.
    *   **Benefits:** Early detection in the development lifecycle, can identify vulnerabilities before deployment.
    *   **Limitations:** May produce false positives or false negatives, might not detect all complex injection scenarios.

*   **Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) Tools (SQL Injection Scanners):**
    *   Examples: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix, Netsparker.
    *   **Purpose:**  Scan running web applications by sending malicious requests and analyzing responses to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Benefits:**  Tests the application in a real-world environment, can detect vulnerabilities that static analysis might miss.
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires a running application, coverage depends on test cases, may not find all vulnerabilities.

*   **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) Tools:**
    *   Examples: Contrast Security, Hdiv Security.
    *   **Purpose:** Combines static and dynamic analysis by instrumenting the application to monitor code execution and data flow during testing, providing more accurate vulnerability detection.

*   **Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Manual or automated testing by security professionals to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities, including SQL injection.
    *   **Benefits:**  Comprehensive testing, can identify complex vulnerabilities and business logic flaws, provides a realistic assessment of security posture.
    *   **Limitations:**  Can be expensive and time-consuming, effectiveness depends on the skills of the testers.

*   **Code Reviews:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Manual review of code by developers or security experts to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to secure coding practices.
    *   **Benefits:**  Effective for catching subtle vulnerabilities and improving code quality, promotes knowledge sharing and security awareness within the team.
    *   **Limitations:**  Can be time-consuming, effectiveness depends on the reviewers' expertise, can be subjective.

**Prevention Techniques (Reiterated and Emphasized):**

*   **Parameterization (Prepared Statements):**  **Primary Defense.** Always use parameterized queries for raw SQL.
*   **Avoid Raw SQL Queries When Possible:** Utilize TypeORM's QueryBuilder and Repository methods as much as possible.
*   **Input Validation (for Data Integrity, not Security):** Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats, but do not rely on it as a primary security measure against SQL injection.
*   **Least Privilege Database Access:** Grant minimal necessary privileges to database users.
*   **Regular Security Audits, Code Reviews, and Penetration Testing.**
*   **Developer Security Training.**
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) as a Secondary Defense.**

By implementing these detection and prevention techniques, and by prioritizing secure coding practices, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities in TypeORM applications using raw SQL queries. Remember that **prevention is always better (and cheaper) than remediation.**
