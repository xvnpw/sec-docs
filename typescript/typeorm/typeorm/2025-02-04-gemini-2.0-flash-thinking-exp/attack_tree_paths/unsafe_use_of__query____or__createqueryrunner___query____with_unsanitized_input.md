### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Unsafe use of `query()` or `createQueryRunner().query()` with unsanitized input

#### 4.1. Description: SQL Injection via Raw Queries in TypeORM

TypeORM is an excellent Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides a high level of abstraction for interacting with databases. It typically encourages developers to use its query builder and entity manager, which automatically handle parameterization and prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities in most common scenarios.

However, TypeORM also provides methods like `query()` and `createQueryRunner().query()` that allow developers to execute raw SQL queries directly against the database. While these methods offer flexibility for complex or database-specific operations, they also bypass TypeORM's built-in security mechanisms if used improperly.

**The core vulnerability arises when developers construct raw SQL queries using string concatenation or template literals to embed user-provided input directly into the query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.** This allows malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, potentially leading to severe security breaches.

**Why is this a problem?**

*   **Bypasses ORM Protections:**  Using `query()` and `createQueryRunner().query()` directly circumvents the safety nets provided by TypeORM's query builder and entity manager, which are designed to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Direct Database Interaction:**  These methods execute SQL directly on the database, giving attackers the potential to manipulate data, bypass authentication, and even gain control over the database server in severe cases.
*   **Common Developer Mistake:**  Developers might be tempted to use raw queries for simplicity or familiarity, especially when dealing with complex queries or legacy SQL code, without fully understanding the security implications.

#### 4.2. Technical Details and Code Examples

Let's illustrate the vulnerability with code examples using TypeScript and TypeORM.

**Vulnerable Code Example (String Concatenation):**

```typescript
import { DataSource } from "typeorm";

// Assume dataSource is already initialized

async function findUserByNameVulnerable(dataSource: DataSource, username: string): Promise<any> {
    const rawQuery = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`; // Vulnerable!
    try {
        const result = await dataSource.query(rawQuery);
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error executing query:", error);
        return null;
    }
}

// Example usage with unsanitized input:
const userInput = "'; DROP TABLE users; --"; // Malicious input
findUserByNameVulnerable(dataSource, userInput);
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

In the vulnerable example, the `username` variable, which could come directly from user input (e.g., a web request), is directly embedded into the SQL query string using string concatenation. If a malicious user provides input like `'; DROP TABLE users; --`, the resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; DROP TABLE users; --'
```

This injected SQL code will:

1.  Terminate the original `WHERE` clause with a semicolon `;`.
2.  Execute a `DROP TABLE users;` command, potentially deleting the entire users table.
3.  Comment out the rest of the query with `--`.

**Vulnerable Code Example (`createQueryRunner().query()`):**

```typescript
import { DataSource } from "typeorm";

// Assume dataSource is already initialized

async function findUserByNameVulnerableRunner(dataSource: DataSource, username: string): Promise<any> {
    const queryRunner = dataSource.createQueryRunner();
    try {
        await queryRunner.connect();
        const rawQuery = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`; // Vulnerable!
        const result = await queryRunner.query(rawQuery);
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error executing query:", error);
        return null;
    } finally {
        await queryRunner.release();
    }
}

// Example usage with unsanitized input:
const userInput = "'; DELETE FROM users WHERE 1=1; --"; // Malicious input
findUserByNameVulnerableRunner(dataSource, userInput);
```

This example demonstrates the same vulnerability using `createQueryRunner().query()`. The unsanitized `username` input allows for SQL injection, potentially leading to data deletion in this case.

**Secure Code Example (Parameterized Query):**

```typescript
import { DataSource } from "typeorm";

// Assume dataSource is already initialized

async function findUserByNameSecure(dataSource: DataSource, username: string): Promise<any> {
    const rawQuery = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1`; // Parameterized query
    try {
        const result = await dataSource.query(rawQuery, [username]); // Pass parameters separately
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error executing query:", error);
        return null;
    }
}

// Example usage with sanitized input (though parameterization handles sanitization):
const userInput = "'; DROP TABLE users; --"; // Malicious input, but now safe
findUserByNameSecure(dataSource, userInput);
```

**Explanation of Secure Code:**

In the secure example, we use a **parameterized query**.

*   **Placeholders:**  Instead of directly embedding the `username`, we use a placeholder `$1` in the query string. The placeholder syntax might vary slightly depending on the database system (e.g., `?` for MySQL, PostgreSQL uses `$1`, `$2`, etc.).
*   **Parameter Array:**  The actual value of `username` is passed as a separate parameter in an array to the `dataSource.query()` method.

TypeORM and the underlying database driver handle the **parameterization process**, ensuring that the input is treated as data and not as executable SQL code. Even if the `userInput` contains malicious SQL syntax, it will be escaped and treated as a literal string value for the `username` parameter, preventing SQL injection.

#### 4.3. Impact of the Vulnerability

Successful exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities through unsafe use of `query()` or `createQueryRunner().query()` can have severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Breach (Confidentiality Loss):** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary business data.
*   **Data Modification (Integrity Loss):** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption, business disruption, and loss of trust.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to application features and data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute queries that consume excessive database resources, leading to performance degradation or complete system unavailability.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers can escalate their privileges within the database system, potentially gaining administrative control over the entire database server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (in extreme cases):** Depending on the database system and configuration, SQL Injection can sometimes be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the database server, leading to complete system compromise.

The severity of the impact depends on the sensitivity of the data stored in the database, the application's functionality, and the attacker's objectives.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of SQL Injection vulnerabilities arising from unsafe use of raw queries in TypeORM, implement the following strategies:

*   **Minimize Raw SQL Usage:**
    *   **Prefer TypeORM's ORM Features:**  Whenever possible, utilize TypeORM's query builder, entity manager, and repository methods. These features are designed to handle data interaction securely and automatically prevent SQL injection in most common scenarios.
    *   **Evaluate Necessity:** Before resorting to raw SQL, carefully consider if the desired functionality can be achieved using TypeORM's built-in ORM capabilities. Often, complex queries can be constructed using the query builder with sufficient flexibility.

*   **Always Use Parameterized Queries for Raw SQL:**
    *   **Mandatory Parameterization:** If raw SQL queries are absolutely necessary (e.g., for database-specific functions or highly optimized queries), **always** use parameterized queries.
    *   **Placeholder Syntax:** Utilize the correct placeholder syntax for your database system (e.g., `$1`, `$2`, `?`) within the raw SQL query string.
    *   **Pass Parameters Separately:** Provide the actual parameter values as a separate array argument to the `dataSource.query()` or `queryRunner.query()` method.
    *   **Avoid String Concatenation/Template Literals:** Never embed user input directly into the raw SQL query string using string concatenation or template literals.

*   **Rigorous Code Review:**
    *   **Dedicated Review Process:** Implement a mandatory code review process for all code changes, especially those involving database interactions and raw SQL queries.
    *   **Security Focus:** Train developers to specifically look for potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities during code reviews, particularly in areas where raw queries are used.
    *   **Automated Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools that can automatically scan code for potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities, including those related to raw query usage.

*   **Input Validation (Secondary Defense):**
    *   **Validate User Input:** While parameterization is the primary defense, implement input validation as a secondary layer of security.
    *   **Data Type and Format Validation:** Validate that user input conforms to expected data types, formats, and lengths before using it in any database query (even parameterized ones).
    *   **Sanitization (with Caution):**  Sanitization should be used with extreme caution and only as a supplementary measure, as it can be easily bypassed if not implemented correctly. Parameterization is always preferred over sanitization for SQL Injection prevention.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Database User Permissions:** Configure database user accounts used by the application with the principle of least privilege. Grant only the necessary permissions required for the application to function correctly. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if SQL Injection is successfully exploited.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Deploy a WAF:** Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the application. A WAF can help detect and block common SQL Injection attacks, providing an additional layer of defense.

*   **Developer Education and Training:**
    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Provide regular security awareness training to developers, focusing on common web application vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, and secure coding practices.
    *   **TypeORM Security Best Practices:** Educate developers on TypeORM's security features and best practices for secure database interaction, emphasizing the importance of parameterization and minimizing raw SQL usage.

#### 4.5. Detection and Remediation

**Detection:**

*   **Static Code Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., linters, SAST tools) to scan the codebase for instances of `query()` and `createQueryRunner().query()` where user input might be directly embedded in the query string without parameterization.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools and penetration testing techniques to actively test the application for SQL Injection vulnerabilities. This involves sending crafted inputs to application endpoints and observing the application's response and database behavior.
*   **Manual Code Review:** Conduct thorough manual code reviews, specifically focusing on database interaction logic and raw SQL query usage.
*   **Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits of the application to identify and assess potential vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring of database queries and application behavior. Unusual database activity or error messages related to SQL syntax errors might indicate potential SQL Injection attempts.

**Remediation:**

*   **Identify Vulnerable Code:** Locate all instances of unsafe `query()` or `createQueryRunner().query()` usage identified through detection methods.
*   **Implement Parameterization:**  Modify the vulnerable code to use parameterized queries as demonstrated in the secure code example above. Replace direct string concatenation/template literals with placeholders and pass parameters separately.
*   **Retest and Verify:** After implementing remediation, thoroughly retest the application using both static and dynamic testing methods to ensure that the SQL Injection vulnerabilities have been effectively eliminated.
*   **Code Review and Regression Testing:** Conduct code reviews of the remediated code and perform regression testing to ensure that the changes have not introduced any new issues or broken existing functionality.

By diligently implementing these mitigation strategies and following a robust detection and remediation process, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection vulnerabilities arising from the unsafe use of raw queries in TypeORM applications and enhance the overall security posture of their applications.
