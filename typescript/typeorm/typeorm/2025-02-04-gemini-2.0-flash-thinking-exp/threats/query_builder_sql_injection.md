### 4. Deep Analysis of Query Builder SQL Injection

#### 4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability

SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits security vulnerabilities in an application's database layer. In the context of TypeORM Query Builder, this vulnerability arises when developers construct SQL queries dynamically by directly embedding unsanitized user input into query strings.

TypeORM's Query Builder is designed to abstract away raw SQL and provide a more developer-friendly way to interact with databases. However, if used incorrectly, it can still be susceptible to SQL Injection. The core issue is **string concatenation or interpolation** of user-provided data directly into the `where()`, `andWhere()`, `orWhere()`, or similar methods without proper parameterization.

When user input is directly embedded as strings, an attacker can manipulate this input to inject malicious SQL code. This injected code can then alter the intended query logic, allowing the attacker to:

*   **Bypass authentication and authorization:** Access data they are not supposed to see.
*   **Extract sensitive data:** Retrieve confidential information from the database.
*   **Modify or delete data:** Alter or remove critical data within the database.
*   **Execute arbitrary commands:** In some cases, gain control over the database server itself.

#### 4.2 Vulnerable Code Example

Let's consider a scenario where we want to fetch users based on their username. A *vulnerable* implementation using TypeORM Query Builder might look like this:

```typescript
import { AppDataSource } from "./data-source";
import { User } from "./entity/User";

AppDataSource.initialize().then(async () => {

    const username = process.argv[2]; // Assume username is passed as command line argument

    if (!username) {
        console.log("Please provide a username.");
        return;
    }

    try {
        const userRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(User);
        const user = await userRepository.createQueryBuilder("user")
            .where(`user.username = '${username}'`) // Vulnerable: Direct string interpolation
            .getOne();

        if (user) {
            console.log("User found:", user);
        } else {
            console.log("User not found.");
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    }

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

In this example, the `username` variable, which is assumed to be user input, is directly interpolated into the `where()` clause using template literals (backticks). This is a **major security flaw**.

#### 4.3 Attack Scenario

Let's demonstrate how an attacker can exploit the vulnerable code above. Assume the attacker provides the following input for `username`:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

When this input is used in the vulnerable query, the resulting SQL query becomes (simplified for demonstration):

```sql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE user.username = ''' OR 1=1 --'
```

After SQL parsing and execution, the `--` comment will comment out the rest of the query after `1=1`. The condition `1=1` is always true. Therefore, the `WHERE` clause effectively becomes `WHERE user.username = '' OR 1=1`, which simplifies to `WHERE TRUE`.

This means the query will return **all users** from the `user` table, regardless of their username.  The attacker has successfully bypassed the intended query logic and potentially gained access to sensitive data of all users.

More sophisticated attacks could involve:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Injecting queries to extract data from other tables or columns.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Using `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements to modify or remove data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  In some database configurations, potentially executing stored procedures or system commands.

#### 4.4 Secure Code Example (Using Parameters)

The secure way to construct the query is to use **parameterized queries**. TypeORM Query Builder provides the `setParameter()` or `setParameters()` methods for this purpose.

Here's the corrected, secure version of the code:

```typescript
import { AppDataSource } from "./data-source";
import { User } from "./entity/User";

AppDataSource.initialize().then(async () => {

    const username = process.argv[2]; // Assume username is passed as command line argument

    if (!username) {
        console.log("Please provide a username.");
        return;
    }

    try {
        const userRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(User);
        const user = await userRepository.createQueryBuilder("user")
            .where("user.username = :username", { username: username }) // Secure: Parameterized query
            .getOne();

        if (user) {
            console.log("User found:", user);
        } else {
            console.log("User not found.");
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    }

}).catch(error => console.log(error));
```

**Key changes in the secure example:**

*   **Parameter Placeholder:**  Instead of directly embedding the `username` variable, we use a placeholder `:username` in the `where()` clause.
*   **Parameter Binding:** The actual value of `username` is passed as an object in the second argument of the `where()` method: `{ username: username }`. TypeORM handles the parameter binding securely.

When using parameterized queries, TypeORM (or the underlying database driver) will automatically handle the escaping and quoting of the parameter values. This prevents the attacker's input from being interpreted as SQL code, effectively neutralizing the SQL Injection vulnerability.

If the attacker tries to input `' OR 1=1 --` in the secure example, TypeORM will treat it as a literal string value for the `username` parameter. The resulting SQL query (conceptually) will be something like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE user.username = ?
```

And the parameter will be bound as:

```
Parameter 1: "' OR 1=1 --"
```

The database will search for a user with the *literal* username `' OR 1=1 --`, which is highly unlikely to exist, and will not execute the injected SQL code.

#### 4.5 Detailed Impact Assessment

A successful Query Builder SQL Injection attack can have severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Breach (Confidentiality Impact - High):**
    *   Attackers can bypass intended data access controls and retrieve sensitive information such as user credentials, personal details, financial records, proprietary business data, and more.
    *   This can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and loss of customer trust.

*   **Data Manipulation (Integrity Impact - High):**
    *   Attackers can modify or delete critical data within the database.
    *   This can lead to data corruption, loss of data integrity, disruption of business operations, and incorrect application behavior.
    *   In extreme cases, attackers could wipe out entire databases or plant backdoors for persistent access.

*   **Authorization Bypass (Confidentiality and Integrity Impact - High):**
    *   Attackers can circumvent authorization checks and perform actions they are not authorized to perform, such as accessing administrative functionalities, modifying user permissions, or escalating their privileges.
    *   This can lead to unauthorized access to critical system resources and further compromise of the application and its data.

*   **Denial of Service (Availability Impact - Medium to High):**
    *   While less common with basic SQL Injection, sophisticated attacks could potentially overload the database server with resource-intensive queries, leading to denial of service.
    *   In some cases, attackers might be able to execute commands that crash the database server.

*   **Account Takeover (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact - High):**
    *   By manipulating queries related to authentication, attackers could potentially bypass login mechanisms or reset passwords, leading to account takeover and unauthorized access to user accounts.

The **Risk Severity** of Query Builder SQL Injection is **High** due to the potential for significant impact across confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

#### 4.6 In-depth Mitigation Strategies and Best Practices

To effectively mitigate Query Builder SQL Injection vulnerabilities in TypeORM applications, implement the following strategies:

1.  **Always Use Parameters in Query Builder:**
    *   **Principle:**  Parameterization is the primary and most effective defense against SQL Injection.
    *   **Implementation:**  Whenever you are building dynamic queries with user input in TypeORM Query Builder, **always** use parameter placeholders (`:paramName`) and bind the actual values using the `setParameter()` or `setParameters()` methods.
    *   **Example:**
        ```typescript
        // Secure: Using parameters
        await userRepository.createQueryBuilder("user")
            .where("user.email = :email", { email: userEmail })
            .andWhere("user.isActive = :isActive", { isActive: true })
            .getOne();
        ```

2.  **Avoid String Interpolation in Query Builder Conditions:**
    *   **Principle:**  Direct string interpolation or concatenation of user input into query strings is inherently dangerous and should be strictly avoided.
    *   **Implementation:**  Never use template literals (backticks) or string concatenation to embed user input directly into `where()`, `andWhere()`, `orWhere()`, or similar methods.
    *   **Example (Avoid this):**
        ```typescript
        // Vulnerable: String interpolation - DO NOT DO THIS
        await userRepository.createQueryBuilder("user")
            .where(`user.email = '${userEmail}' AND user.isActive = true`)
            .getOne();
        ```

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Principle:** While parameterization is crucial, input validation and sanitization provide an additional layer of defense.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Validation:** Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats, lengths, and character sets *before* using it in queries. Reject invalid input.
        *   **Sanitization (Contextual Escaping):**  While TypeORM handles escaping for parameterized queries, consider sanitizing input for other purposes (e.g., display in UI) to prevent other types of injection vulnerabilities (like Cross-Site Scripting - XSS). However, **do not rely on sanitization as the primary defense against SQL Injection in Query Builder**. Parameterization is the key.
    *   **Example (Validation):**
        ```typescript
        if (!isValidEmailFormat(userEmail)) {
            return res.status(400).send("Invalid email format.");
        }
        // ... then use userEmail in parameterized query ...
        ```

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Database Permissions):**
    *   **Principle:**  Grant database users and application database connections only the minimum necessary privileges required for their operations.
    *   **Implementation:**  Avoid using database accounts with `root` or `admin` privileges for application connections. Create dedicated database users with restricted permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` only on specific tables).
    *   **Benefit:**  If a SQL Injection attack occurs despite other mitigations, the attacker's capabilities will be limited by the restricted permissions of the database user.

5.  **Code Reviews and Security Testing:**
    *   **Principle:**  Regular code reviews and security testing are essential for identifying and preventing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on Query Builder usage and ensuring parameterization is consistently applied. Train developers to recognize and avoid vulnerable patterns.
        *   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can automatically scan code for potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities, including improper Query Builder usage.
        *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Perform DAST to test the running application for SQL Injection vulnerabilities by simulating attacks and observing the application's behavior.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, in a controlled environment.

6.  **Stay Updated with TypeORM Security Advisories:**
    *   **Principle:**  Keep TypeORM and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
    *   **Implementation:**  Regularly monitor TypeORM's release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities and apply necessary updates promptly.

#### 4.7 Code Review Guidance

When reviewing code for Query Builder SQL Injection vulnerabilities, focus on the following:

*   **Search for `createQueryBuilder()` usage:** Identify all instances where `createQueryBuilder()` is used.
*   **Inspect `where()`, `andWhere()`, `orWhere()` calls:** Examine the conditions passed to these methods.
*   **Check for string interpolation/concatenation:**  Look for template literals (backticks) or string concatenation (`+`) within the conditions. This is a strong indicator of potential vulnerability.
*   **Verify parameterization:** Ensure that parameters (`:paramName`) are used in the conditions and that corresponding parameters are set using `setParameter()` or `setParameters()`.
*   **Trace user input:**  Track the flow of user input to ensure it is not directly embedded in query strings without parameterization.
*   **Look for dynamic query construction:** Pay close attention to code that dynamically builds query conditions based on user input, as this is where vulnerabilities are most likely to occur.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

Query Builder SQL Injection is a serious threat in TypeORM applications that can lead to significant security breaches.  **Directly embedding user input into Query Builder conditions without parameterization is a critical vulnerability that must be avoided at all costs.**

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

*   **Mandatory Parameterization:**  Establish a strict policy that **all** dynamic queries constructed using TypeORM Query Builder must utilize parameterization.
*   **Developer Training:**  Provide comprehensive training to developers on SQL Injection vulnerabilities in TypeORM and secure Query Builder usage. Emphasize the importance of parameterization and the dangers of string interpolation.
*   **Code Review Process:**  Integrate security-focused code reviews into the development workflow, specifically targeting Query Builder usage and SQL Injection prevention.
*   **Automated Security Testing:** Implement SAST and DAST tools to automatically detect potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities during development and testing.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities in the application.
*   **Promote Secure Coding Practices:** Foster a security-conscious development culture that prioritizes secure coding practices and continuous learning about security threats and mitigations.

By diligently implementing these mitigation strategies and adhering to secure coding practices, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of Query Builder SQL Injection and build more secure TypeORM applications.
