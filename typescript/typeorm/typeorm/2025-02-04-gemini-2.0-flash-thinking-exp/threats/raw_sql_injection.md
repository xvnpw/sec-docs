### 4. Deep Analysis of Raw SQL Injection Threat

#### 4.1. Detailed Threat Description

Raw SQL Injection in TypeORM arises when developers use the `query()` or `createQueryRunner().query()` methods and directly embed user-controlled input into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization. These methods in TypeORM are designed for executing arbitrary SQL queries, offering flexibility but also introducing security risks if not handled carefully.

**How it works:**

1.  **Vulnerable Code:**  A developer might construct a SQL query string by concatenating user input directly into the query. For example, consider a function to retrieve user data by username:

    ```typescript
    import { getConnection } from "typeorm";

    async function getUserByUsernameRaw(username: string): Promise<any> {
        const connection = getConnection();
        const rawQuery = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`; // Vulnerable!
        try {
            const result = await connection.query(rawQuery);
            return result[0];
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
            return null;
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Malicious Input:** An attacker can provide malicious input for the `username` parameter. Instead of a legitimate username, they could input something like:

    ```
    ' OR '1'='1
    ```

3.  **Injected SQL:** When this malicious input is concatenated into the raw query, it becomes:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'
    ```

    The injected SQL `OR '1'='1'` is always true. This bypasses the intended `username` condition and will return all rows from the `users` table, potentially exposing sensitive data.

4.  **Exploitation:**  Attackers can craft more sophisticated injections to:
    *   **Retrieve data from other tables:** `'; SELECT * FROM sensitive_data --`
    *   **Modify data:** `'; UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE username = 'victim' --`
    *   **Delete data:** `'; DROP TABLE users --`
    *   **Execute database commands:** Depending on database permissions, attackers might be able to execute system commands or stored procedures.

**Key Vulnerable Methods:**

*   **`Connection.query(query: string, parameters?: any[]): Promise<any>`:** Executes a raw SQL query on the default database connection.
*   **`QueryRunner.query(query: string, parameters?: any[]): Promise<any>`:** Executes a raw SQL query using a specific QueryRunner instance, often used within transactions or for more granular control.

While both methods *can* accept parameters, the vulnerability arises when developers fail to utilize parameterization and instead directly embed user input into the `query` string.

#### 4.2. Impact Analysis (Detailed)

A successful Raw SQL Injection attack can have severe consequences for the application and the organization. Expanding on the initial impact points:

*   **Data Breach (Confidentiality Compromise):**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker injects SQL to bypass authentication or authorization checks, gaining access to sensitive data like user credentials, personal information (PII), financial records, or proprietary business data.
    *   **Consequences:**  Reputational damage, legal and regulatory penalties (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), financial losses due to fines and compensation, loss of customer trust, competitive disadvantage.
    *   **Example:** Injecting SQL to retrieve all user records including passwords (if poorly hashed or not hashed at all) or accessing confidential customer order details.

*   **Data Manipulation (Integrity Compromise):**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker injects SQL to modify or delete critical data, leading to data corruption, business disruption, and inaccurate information.
    *   **Consequences:**  Loss of data integrity, incorrect business decisions based on corrupted data, system malfunctions, operational disruptions, financial losses due to data recovery efforts and business downtime.
    *   **Example:** Injecting SQL to modify product prices, alter inventory levels, change user roles and permissions, or delete critical transaction records.

*   **Account Takeover (Authentication Bypass):**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker injects SQL to bypass authentication mechanisms, gain access to administrator accounts, or modify user credentials, leading to unauthorized control over the application and its data.
    *   **Consequences:**  Complete system compromise, ability to perform any action within the application, further data breaches and manipulation, denial of service, reputational damage.
    *   **Example:** Injecting SQL to bypass login forms, reset passwords, or grant administrative privileges to attacker-controlled accounts.

*   **Denial of Service (Availability Compromise):**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker injects resource-intensive SQL queries that overload the database server, causing performance degradation, service disruptions, or complete system crashes.
    *   **Consequences:**  Application unavailability, business downtime, loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction, damage to service level agreements (SLAs).
    *   **Example:** Injecting SQL queries that perform full table scans, infinite loops, or consume excessive database resources, effectively bringing the database server to its knees.

Beyond these direct impacts, Raw SQL Injection can also be a stepping stone for further attacks, such as:

*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromising the database server can allow attackers to move laterally within the network and target other systems.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Exploiting database vulnerabilities can lead to gaining higher privileges within the database system or even the underlying operating system.

#### 4.3. TypeORM Component Analysis

The vulnerability specifically resides in the usage of `QueryRunner.query()` and `Connection.query()` when used **incorrectly**.  It's crucial to understand *why* these methods are risky in certain contexts and how they differ from safer TypeORM approaches.

*   **`QueryRunner.query()` and `Connection.query()`: Direct SQL Execution:** These methods are designed to execute raw SQL queries directly against the database. They provide maximum flexibility, allowing developers to perform complex or database-specific operations that might not be easily achievable through TypeORM's Query Builder or Repository methods. However, this flexibility comes with the responsibility of ensuring query security.

*   **Risk Factor: Developer Responsibility:** The primary risk is that developers are directly responsible for constructing the SQL query string. If they fail to properly sanitize or parameterize user inputs when building these strings, they introduce the SQL Injection vulnerability.

*   **Contrast with TypeORM's Safer Alternatives:**

    *   **Query Builder:** TypeORM's Query Builder provides a programmatic and type-safe way to construct SQL queries. It automatically handles parameterization, significantly reducing the risk of SQL Injection.  Developers build queries using methods like `where()`, `andWhere()`, `setParameter()`, etc., rather than directly writing SQL strings.

    *   **Repository Methods:** TypeORM Repositories offer pre-built methods for common database operations like `find()`, `findOne()`, `save()`, `remove()`. These methods are also parameterized and generally safer than raw SQL for standard CRUD operations.

    *   **Example - Using Query Builder (Safe):**

        ```typescript
        import { getConnection } from "typeorm";

        async function getUserByUsernameSafe(username: string): Promise<any> {
            const connection = getConnection();
            try {
                const user = await connection.createQueryBuilder()
                    .select("user")
                    .from("User", "user")
                    .where("user.username = :username", { username: username }) // Parameterized!
                    .getOne();
                return user;
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
                return null;
            }
        }
        ```

        In this safe example, the `username` is passed as a parameter using the `:username` placeholder and the `{ username: username }` parameter object. TypeORM handles the parameterization, preventing SQL Injection.

**In summary:** `QueryRunner.query()` and `Connection.query()` are not inherently vulnerable, but their misuse, specifically the direct embedding of unsanitized user input into the query string, creates the Raw SQL Injection vulnerability. TypeORM provides safer alternatives like Query Builder and Repository methods that should be preferred whenever possible.

#### 4.4. Vulnerability Exploitation Scenario

Let's illustrate a step-by-step scenario of exploiting the vulnerable `getUserByUsernameRaw` function from section 4.1:

**Scenario: Attacker attempts to retrieve all usernames from the `users` table.**

1.  **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies an application using TypeORM and finds a feature that uses raw SQL queries, specifically the `getUserByUsernameRaw` function. They analyze the application's requests and responses to understand how user input is processed.

2.  **Vulnerability Confirmation (Username Field):** The attacker suspects the `username` field in the `getUserByUsernameRaw` function is vulnerable to SQL Injection. They try a simple injection payload in the `username` parameter: `' OR '1'='1`.

3.  **Request Construction:** The attacker crafts a request to the application's endpoint that calls `getUserByUsernameRaw` with the malicious username:

    ```
    // Example HTTP Request (assuming a REST API)
    GET /api/users?username=' OR '1'='1
    ```

4.  **Server-Side Processing (Vulnerable Code Execution):** The application's backend receives the request. The `getUserByUsernameRaw` function is called with the malicious username. The vulnerable raw SQL query is constructed:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'
    ```

5.  **Database Query Execution:** TypeORM executes this injected SQL query against the database. Due to the `OR '1'='1'` condition, the query returns all rows from the `users` table.

6.  **Data Exfiltration:** The application, expecting to return a single user, might inadvertently return a list of all users (depending on how the application handles the result of `connection.query()`). The attacker receives this data in the response, potentially revealing usernames and other user information.

7.  **Further Exploitation (Data Breach):**  The attacker now has a list of usernames. They can try more sophisticated injections to:
    *   Retrieve password hashes (if stored in the same table).
    *   Access other sensitive user data.
    *   Attempt to log in using the retrieved usernames (if passwords were also compromised or if password complexity is weak).

8.  **Escalation (Account Takeover, etc.):**  Depending on the application's logic and database permissions, the attacker can escalate the attack to modify data, delete data, or even gain administrative access.

This scenario demonstrates how a simple Raw SQL Injection vulnerability can be exploited to achieve data breach and potentially lead to further, more severe attacks.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategy Analysis (Detailed)

Let's analyze each proposed mitigation strategy in detail:

*   **4.5.1. Avoid Raw SQL:**

    *   **Description:** The most effective mitigation is to minimize or eliminate the use of `query()` and `createQueryRunner().query()` methods altogether.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Completely removes the primary attack vector for Raw SQL Injection when using TypeORM. By relying on Query Builder and Repository methods, developers leverage TypeORM's built-in parameterization and security features.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Code Review:**  Identify all instances of `query()` and `createQueryRunner().query()` in the codebase.
        *   **Refactoring:**  Replace raw SQL queries with equivalent Query Builder or Repository method implementations. This might require restructuring queries, but the security benefits are significant.
        *   **Example Refactoring:**  The vulnerable `getUserByUsernameRaw` function can be refactored to use Query Builder as shown in section 4.3, completely eliminating the raw SQL and the injection risk.
    *   **Limitations:**  In rare cases, very complex or database-specific queries might be difficult or inefficient to implement using Query Builder alone. However, these cases should be carefully scrutinized and justified.
    *   **Importance:** **Highest Priority.** This is the most proactive and effective mitigation strategy.

*   **4.5.2. Parameterization for Raw SQL (if unavoidable):**

    *   **Description:** If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, always use parameterized queries. This involves using placeholders in the SQL query string and passing user inputs as separate parameters.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Prevents SQL Injection by ensuring that user inputs are treated as data values, not as executable SQL code. The database driver handles the parameterization, safely escaping and quoting the parameters.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Use Placeholders:**  Replace direct concatenation of user inputs with placeholders like `?` (positional) or named placeholders like `:paramName`.
        *   **Pass Parameters Array/Object:**  Provide user inputs as an array (for positional placeholders) or an object (for named placeholders) as the second argument to `query()` or `createQueryRunner().query()`.
        *   **Example Parameterization:**

            ```typescript
            import { getConnection } from "typeorm";

            async function getUserByUsernameParameterized(username: string): Promise<any> {
                const connection = getConnection();
                const rawQuery = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?`; // Parameterized query
                try {
                    const result = await connection.query(rawQuery, [username]); // Parameters array
                    return result[0];
                } catch (error) {
                    console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
                    return null;
                }
            }
            ```
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires developers to be diligent and consistently use parameterization for *every* user input used in raw SQL queries. Mistakes can still lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Importance:** **High Priority (if raw SQL is used).** Essential if raw SQL cannot be completely avoided.

*   **4.5.3. Input Validation and Sanitization:**

    *   **Description:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in any queries, even parameterized ones. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Reduces the attack surface by preventing obviously malicious inputs from reaching the database query logic. Can help mitigate certain types of injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Define strict validation rules for each input field (e.g., data type, length, allowed characters, format). Reject invalid inputs before they are used in queries.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Context-Specific):**  Sanitize inputs based on the context where they will be used. For SQL Injection, this might involve escaping special characters that could be interpreted as SQL syntax. However, **parameterization is the primary defense, not sanitization for SQL Injection.** Sanitization is more relevant for preventing other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
        *   **Example Validation:**

            ```typescript
            function validateUsername(username: string): boolean {
                // Example: Allow only alphanumeric characters and underscores, max length 50
                const usernameRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,50}$/;
                return usernameRegex.test(username);
            }

            async function getUserByUsernameValidated(username: string): Promise<any> {
                if (!validateUsername(username)) {
                    console.error("Invalid username format.");
                    return null; // Or throw an error
                }
                // ... (Use parameterized query here as well) ...
            }
            ```
    *   **Limitations:**  Sanitization can be complex and error-prone. It's difficult to anticipate all possible injection vectors. **Sanitization should not be relied upon as the primary defense against SQL Injection.** Parameterization is far more robust.
    *   **Importance:** **Medium Priority (Defense-in-depth).**  Valuable as an additional layer of security, but not a replacement for parameterization or avoiding raw SQL.

*   **4.5.4. Code Reviews:**

    *   **Description:** Conduct thorough code reviews by security-conscious developers to identify and eliminate instances of raw SQL usage and ensure proper parameterization where raw SQL is used.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Catches vulnerabilities that might be missed during development. Promotes knowledge sharing and improves overall code quality and security awareness within the team.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Integrate code reviews into the development process.
        *   **Security Focus:**  Specifically look for raw SQL queries and verify proper parameterization.
        *   **Automated Static Analysis Tools:**  Utilize static analysis tools that can detect potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities in code (although these tools might have limitations with dynamic query construction).
    *   **Limitations:**  Code reviews are manual and depend on the expertise of the reviewers. They might not catch all vulnerabilities, especially in complex codebases.
    *   **Importance:** **High Priority.**  Crucial for identifying and correcting vulnerabilities before they reach production.

#### 4.6. Best Practices and Recommendations

Beyond the specific mitigation strategies, here are broader best practices to prevent Raw SQL Injection in TypeORM applications:

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users:**  Grant database users used by the application only the necessary permissions. Avoid using highly privileged accounts (like `root` or `db_owner`). This limits the impact of a successful SQL Injection attack.

2.  **Prepared Statements (Parameterization):**  Understand and consistently use parameterized queries (prepared statements) whenever interacting with the database, especially when user input is involved. TypeORM's Query Builder and Repository methods inherently use parameterization.

3.  **ORM Features First:**  Prioritize using TypeORM's ORM features (Query Builder, Repository methods) over raw SQL whenever possible. These features are designed to be secure and efficient for common database operations.

4.  **Secure Coding Training:**  Provide developers with security awareness training, specifically focusing on SQL Injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices for database interactions.

5.  **Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST):**  Integrate SAST and DAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the codebase and running application.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application, including SQL Injection.

7.  **Keep TypeORM and Database Drivers Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update TypeORM and database drivers to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.

8.  **Escape Output (Context-Aware):** While not directly related to SQL Injection prevention, ensure proper output encoding and escaping to prevent other vulnerabilities like XSS when displaying data retrieved from the database.

### 5. Conclusion

Raw SQL Injection is a critical threat in TypeORM applications that can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, data manipulation, account takeover, and denial of service. While TypeORM provides powerful tools like `query()` and `createQueryRunner().query()`, their misuse by directly embedding unsanitized user input into SQL strings creates this vulnerability.

**The primary and most effective mitigation strategy is to avoid raw SQL whenever possible and leverage TypeORM's Query Builder and Repository methods.** When raw SQL is unavoidable, **strict parameterization is mandatory.** Input validation and sanitization, code reviews, and security testing provide valuable defense-in-depth layers.

By understanding the mechanics of Raw SQL Injection, adopting secure coding practices, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this critical vulnerability in their TypeORM applications and protect sensitive data and systems.
