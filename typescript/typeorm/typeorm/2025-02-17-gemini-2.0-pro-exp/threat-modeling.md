# Threat Model Analysis for typeorm/typeorm

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Raw Queries](./threats/sql_injection_via_raw_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used in a raw SQL query executed by TypeORM, alters the query's logic to perform unauthorized actions.  This bypasses TypeORM's usual parameterization. The attacker might inject SQL code to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute operating system commands if the database user has sufficient privileges.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach (reading sensitive data).
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Database server compromise.
    *   Potential for complete system takeover.
*   **TypeORM Component Affected:** `EntityManager.query()`, `Repository.query()`, `QueryBuilder.execute()` (when used with raw SQL).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Raw Queries:** Prefer TypeORM's QueryBuilder or entity manager methods, which automatically use parameterized queries.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** If raw queries are *absolutely necessary*, rigorously validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied input *before* it's included in the query. Use a dedicated sanitization library, not just simple string escaping.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User):** Ensure the database user TypeORM connects with has the absolute minimum necessary privileges.  Do *not* use a superuser or database owner account.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block SQL injection attempts, providing an additional layer of defense (although this is a more general mitigation, it's relevant here).

## Threat: [SQL Injection via `find*` Options Misuse](./threats/sql_injection_via__find__options_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Although less likely than with raw queries, an attacker might attempt to inject SQL code through improperly sanitized user input used within TypeORM's `find*` methods (e.g., `findOne`, `find`, `findBy`). This could involve manipulating the `where`, `order`, `join`, or other options. The attacker aims to alter the query's logic to access unauthorized data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach (reading sensitive data).
    *   Data modification (less likely, but possible depending on the vulnerability).
*   **TypeORM Component Affected:** `EntityManager.find*()`, `Repository.find*()`, `QueryBuilder` (when used with user-supplied input in `where`, `orderBy`, `leftJoinAndSelect`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user input used in `find*` options, even though TypeORM handles parameterization. This adds a crucial layer of defense-in-depth.
    *   **Whitelisting:** If possible, use whitelisting to restrict the allowed values for `find*` options, rather than trying to blacklist potentially harmful input.
    *   **Type Safety:** Leverage TypeScript's strong typing to ensure that only expected data types are passed to `find*` options.

## Threat: [Bypassing Entity Validation](./threats/bypassing_entity_validation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker finds a way to bypass TypeORM's entity validation (decorators or custom validators). This allows them to insert or update data that violates the defined constraints, potentially leading to data corruption or security vulnerabilities. This could be due to missing validation rules, improperly configured validators, or vulnerabilities in the validation logic itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data corruption.
    *   Data integrity violations.
    *   Potential for security vulnerabilities (e.g., if validation is used for access control).
*   **TypeORM Component Affected:** Entity definitions (classes with TypeORM decorators), validation decorators (e.g., `@IsEmail`, `@Length`, `@Validate`), custom validators.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Comprehensive Validation:** Ensure that *all* relevant entity fields have appropriate validation rules. Don't rely solely on client-side validation.
    *   **Strict Type Checking:** Use TypeScript's strong typing to prevent incorrect data types from being passed to TypeORM.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Focus on entity definitions and validation logic during code reviews.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Before TypeORM):** Sanitize input *before* it reaches TypeORM, even if validation is in place.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Inefficient Queries](./threats/denial_of_service_via_inefficient_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts requests that trigger TypeORM to execute highly inefficient database queries. This could involve complex joins, lack of proper indexing, or requesting excessively large datasets. The goal is to overload the database server, causing slowdowns or making the application unavailable.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application slowdown or unavailability.
    *   Database server overload.
    *   Resource exhaustion.
*   **TypeORM Component Affected:** All TypeORM methods that interact with the database (e.g., `find*`, `save`, `update`, `delete`, `QueryBuilder`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Optimization:** Use TypeORM's features to generate efficient queries. Analyze query performance using database profiling tools (e.g., `EXPLAIN` in PostgreSQL).
    *   **Database Indexing:** Ensure that database tables have appropriate indexes to speed up queries.
    *   **Pagination:** Implement pagination for any operations that might return large datasets.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application level to prevent attackers from making an excessive number of requests.
    *   **Timeout Configuration:** Set appropriate timeouts for database operations to prevent long-running queries from blocking resources.

## Threat: [Vulnerable TypeORM Version](./threats/vulnerable_typeorm_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated or vulnerable version of TypeORM that contains known security flaws. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (could range from data breaches to complete system takeover).
*   **TypeORM Component Affected:** The entire TypeORM library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a known vulnerability exists)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep TypeORM Updated:** Regularly update TypeORM to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes. Use dependency management tools (e.g., npm, yarn) to manage updates.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to TypeORM and its dependencies.
