# Project Design Document: TypeORM

## BUSINESS POSTURE

TypeORM is an open-source Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for TypeScript and JavaScript. It supports various databases and provides a way to interact with databases using object-oriented principles. The primary business goal is to simplify database interactions for developers, allowing them to focus on application logic rather than database-specific queries. It aims to increase developer productivity and reduce the risk of common database-related errors.

Business Priorities:

*   Developer Productivity: Enable rapid application development by abstracting database complexities.
*   Maintainability: Provide a clean and maintainable way to interact with databases.
*   Flexibility: Support multiple database systems and allow easy switching between them.
*   Reliability: Ensure data integrity and consistency.
*   Community Support: Foster a strong community to maintain and improve the project.

Business Risks:

*   Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in databases.
*   Data Corruption: Accidental or malicious modification or deletion of data.
*   SQL Injection: Exploitation of vulnerabilities to execute malicious SQL code.
*   Denial of Service: Attacks that make the database unavailable to legitimate users.
*   Performance Bottlenecks: Inefficient database queries that slow down the application.
*   Dependency Vulnerabilities: Security flaws in TypeORM itself or its dependencies.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Parameterized Queries: TypeORM uses parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Implemented in TypeORM's query builder and entity manager.
*   security control: ORM Abstraction: The ORM layer itself provides a level of abstraction that reduces the risk of direct SQL injection, as developers primarily interact with objects and methods rather than raw SQL. Implemented throughout TypeORM's API.
*   security control: Community Auditing: Being open-source, TypeORM benefits from community scrutiny, which can help identify and address security vulnerabilities. Described in the project's GitHub repository and community forums.
*   security control: Regular Updates: The TypeORM team and community regularly release updates, including security patches. Described in the project's release notes and changelog.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Third-Party Database Drivers: TypeORM relies on third-party database drivers, which may have their own security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Misconfiguration: Incorrect configuration of TypeORM or the database can lead to security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Unknown vulnerabilities in TypeORM or its dependencies may exist.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Input Validation: Implement strict input validation on all data before it is used in database queries, even with the ORM abstraction.
*   security control: Least Privilege: Ensure that database users have only the minimum necessary permissions.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the application code and database configuration.
*   security control: Dependency Monitoring: Continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
*   security control: Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to TypeORM, as it relies on the database's authentication mechanisms. However, applications using TypeORM should implement strong authentication.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to TypeORM, as it relies on the database's authorization mechanisms. However, applications using TypeORM should implement proper authorization to control access to data.
*   Input Validation: All data used in database queries, even through the ORM, must be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks and other data-related vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography: Sensitive data should be encrypted at rest and in transit. TypeORM should be configured to use secure connections (e.g., TLS/SSL) to the database.

### BUILD

The build process for applications using TypeORM typically involves the following steps, with a focus on security:

1.  Developer writes code: Developers write application code, including TypeORM entities and database interactions.
2.  Code Commit: Code is committed to a version control system (e.g., Git).
3.  CI/CD Pipeline Trigger: A commit triggers a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
4.  Dependency Installation: The pipeline installs project dependencies, including TypeORM and database drivers.
5.  Security Scanning:
    *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Tools like SonarQube or ESLint are used to scan the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Dependency Scanning: Tools like npm audit or Snyk are used to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
6.  Compilation/Transpilation: TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript.
7.  Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, and potentially end-to-end tests are executed.
8.  Artifact Creation: A deployable artifact (e.g., a Docker image) is created.
9.  Artifact Registry: The artifact is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Data Access and Management: Ensuring authorized access to and proper management of data stored in the database.
*   Application Functionality: Maintaining the availability and correct operation of the application that relies on TypeORM.

Data Sensitivity:

*   The sensitivity of the data depends on the specific application using TypeORM. It can range from non-sensitive data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. TypeORM itself doesn't define the data sensitivity; it's the responsibility of the application using it.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific database systems will be used with TypeORM?
*   What is the expected scale and load on the application?
*   What are the specific data sensitivity levels for the applications using TypeORM?
*   Are there any existing security policies or compliance requirements that need to be considered?
*   What is the team's experience level with secure coding practices and database security?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The development team prioritizes security and follows secure coding practices.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The database will be properly configured with strong passwords, least privilege access, and regular security updates.
*   DESIGN: The application using TypeORM will implement appropriate input validation and other security measures. The deployment environment will be secured according to best practices. The build process will include security checks.
