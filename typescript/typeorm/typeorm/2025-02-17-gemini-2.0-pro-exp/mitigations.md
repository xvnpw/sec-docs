## Mitigation Strategy: [Prioritize TypeORM's Query Builder and Parameterized Queries](./mitigation_strategies/prioritize_typeorm's_query_builder_and_parameterized_queries.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Prioritize TypeORM's Query Builder and Parameterized Queries

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all database interaction points:** Review the codebase to find all instances where the application interacts with the database using TypeORM.
    2.  **Favor Query Builder:** For all `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations, use TypeORM's Query Builder methods (`createQueryBuilder`, `.find()`, `.findOne()`, `.save()`, `.update()`, `.delete()`, etc.) whenever possible. These methods automatically handle parameterization and escaping, preventing SQL injection.
    3.  **Parameterized Raw Queries (Rare Cases):** If raw SQL queries are absolutely unavoidable (which should be extremely rare and well-justified), *never* concatenate user input directly into the SQL string. Use TypeORM's parameterized query mechanism:
        *   Use placeholders (e.g., `?` or named parameters like `:paramName`) in the SQL string.
        *   Pass user input as an array of values (for `?` placeholders) or an object (for named parameters) as the second argument to `manager.query` or `queryRunner.query`.
    4.  **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on database interactions, to ensure that all queries are properly parameterized.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical):**  The primary threat.  Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to bypass authentication, access unauthorized data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   **Data Exposure (High):**  Indirectly mitigated by preventing unauthorized data access through SQL injection.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):**  Some SQL injection attacks can lead to DoS by causing resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Very Low (almost eliminated if implemented correctly).
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk partially reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:**  `src/controllers/UserController.ts` uses `createQueryBuilder` for all user retrieval operations.
    *   **Example:** `src/repositories/ProductRepository.ts` uses parameterized queries for the `searchProducts` method, which takes user input.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:**  `src/services/ReportService.ts` uses a raw SQL query in the `generateCustomReport` function without parameterization.  This needs to be refactored to use the Query Builder or parameterized raw queries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Column Selection and `select: false`](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_column_selection_and__select_false_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Explicit Column Selection and `select: false`

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Entity Review:** Examine all TypeORM entity definitions (`@Entity()`).
    2.  **`select: false` for Sensitive Columns:** For columns containing highly sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personally identifiable information (PII) that should *never* be retrieved by default), add the `{ select: false }` option to the `@Column` decorator.
    3.  **Explicit `select` in Queries:** In all queries (using `find`, `findOne`, `createQueryBuilder`), explicitly specify the columns to be retrieved using the `select` option.  *Never* rely on implicit `SELECT *` behavior.
    4. **Code Review:** Ensure that all queries and data handling logic adhere to these principles within TypeORM usage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (High):**  The primary threat.  Prevents accidental retrieval and exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Information Leakage (Medium):**  Reduces the risk of leaking information about the database schema or internal data structures.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:**  The `User` entity has `passwordHash` marked with `select: false`.
    *   **Example:**  `src/controllers/ProductController.ts` uses explicit `select` in the `getProductDetails` method.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:**  `src/controllers/OrderController.ts` retrieves all columns from the `Order` entity, potentially exposing internal order IDs or other sensitive information.  This needs to be updated to use explicit `select`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pagination and Timeouts using TypeORM Features](./mitigation_strategies/pagination_and_timeouts_using_typeorm_features.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Pagination and Timeouts using TypeORM Features

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Large Result Sets:** Analyze queries that could potentially return a large number of rows.
    2.  **Implement Pagination (TypeORM):** For these queries, use TypeORM's `skip` and `take` options in the query builder to implement pagination.  Provide `page` and `pageSize` parameters to the API endpoints, and use these to calculate `skip` and `take`.
    3.  **Set Query Timeouts (TypeORM):** Configure database connection timeouts *within TypeORM's connection options*. This is crucial for controlling how long TypeORM will wait for a query to complete.  A reasonable timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) should be chosen.
    4.  **Connection Pooling (TypeORM):** Ensure that TypeORM is configured to use a connection pool.  This is usually the default, but verify the settings within the TypeORM configuration.  Adjust the pool size (maximum number of connections).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):**  The primary threat.  Prevents resource exhaustion caused by large queries or excessive requests.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium):**  Improves application performance and responsiveness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:**  Connection pooling is enabled in the TypeORM configuration (`ormconfig.ts`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:**  Pagination is not implemented for the `getAllProducts` endpoint in `src/controllers/ProductController.ts`. The TypeORM `skip` and `take` options are not used.
    *   **Example:**  Query timeouts are not explicitly configured *within TypeORM's connection options*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable `synchronize: true` in Production and Use TypeORM Migrations](./mitigation_strategies/disable__synchronize_true__in_production_and_use_typeorm_migrations.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Disable `synchronize: true` in Production and Use TypeORM Migrations

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configuration Review:**  Check the TypeORM connection configuration (e.g., `ormconfig.ts`, `ormconfig.js`, or environment variables).
    2.  **`synchronize: false` in Production:** Ensure that `synchronize: true` is *never* used in the production environment.  Explicitly set `synchronize: false` in the production configuration within the TypeORM setup.
    3.  **Migrations (TypeORM):**  Use TypeORM's migration system for all schema changes.
        *   Generate migrations using the TypeORM CLI (`typeorm migration:generate`).
        *   Review and modify generated migrations to ensure correctness.
        *   Run migrations using the TypeORM CLI (`typeorm migration:run`).
        *   Revert migrations if necessary using the TypeORM CLI (`typeorm migration:revert`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss (Critical):**  Prevents accidental data loss or schema corruption due to automatic schema synchronization.
    *   **Schema Corruption (Critical):**  Ensures that schema changes are applied in a controlled and versioned manner.
    *   **Downtime (High):** Reduces the risk of unexpected downtime caused by schema synchronization issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss:** Risk eliminated (Critical to None).
    *   **Schema Corruption:** Risk eliminated (Critical to None).
    *   **Downtime:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:**  `ormconfig.ts` has `synchronize: false` for the production environment.
    *   **Example:**  A `migrations` directory exists, and migrations are being generated and run.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** No missing implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strategic use of TypeORM Relations and Query Caching](./mitigation_strategies/strategic_use_of_typeorm_relations_and_query_caching.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strategic use of TypeORM Relations and Query Caching

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Data Access Patterns:** Identify how data is accessed and which entities are frequently retrieved together.
    2.  **Optimize Relations (TypeORM):**
        *   Use **eager loading** (`eager: true` in relation options within TypeORM entity definitions) for relationships that are *always* needed together.
        *   Use **lazy loading** (`lazy: true` in relation options within TypeORM entity definitions) for relationships that are only occasionally needed.
        *   Carefully choose the type of relationship (`@OneToOne`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`) to accurately reflect the data model within TypeORM.
    3.  **Query Caching (TypeORM):**
        *   Identify frequently executed queries that return relatively static data.
        *   Enable query caching for these queries using TypeORM's caching mechanism (e.g., using Redis or another caching provider, configured through TypeORM). Configure appropriate cache expiration times.
    4.  **Avoid N+1 Problem (TypeORM):** Use `leftJoinAndSelect` or `innerJoinAndSelect` within TypeORM's query builder to fetch related entities in a single query, avoiding the N+1 problem.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium):** Improves application performance by reducing database load and latency.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low):** Indirectly mitigates DoS by reducing the likelihood of resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk slightly reduced (Low to Very Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Some relations are configured with `eager: true` or `lazy: true` in TypeORM entity definitions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Query caching is not implemented using TypeORM's caching features.
    *   **Example:** A systematic analysis of data access patterns and relation optimization within TypeORM has not been performed.
