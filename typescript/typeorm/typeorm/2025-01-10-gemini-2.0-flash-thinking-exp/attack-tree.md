## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Database Interaction Vulnerabilities -> SQL Injection -> Through Unsanitized Input in Find/Query Options](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_database_interaction_vulnerabilities_-_sql_injection_-_through_unsanitized_in_dd97135e.md)

* Attack Vector: Inject malicious SQL through input fields used in `find` or `query` methods due to lack of sanitization.
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Mitigation: Implement strict input validation and sanitization, use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Database Interaction Vulnerabilities -> Insecure Query Options -> Data Exfiltration through Pagination Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_database_interaction_vulnerabilities_-_insecure_query_options_-_data_exfiltra_cd72532a.md)

* Attack Vector: Bypass intended pagination limits using `skip` and `take` options to access more data than authorized.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Mitigation: Implement strict server-side pagination with enforced limits and validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Weaknesses -> Insecure Database Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_configuration_weaknesses_-_insecure_database_credentials.md)

* Attack Vector: Access the database using hardcoded or easily compromised credentials found in configuration files, environment variables, or code.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Novice
    * Detection Difficulty: Very Difficult
    * Mitigation: Securely store database credentials using environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions. Avoid hardcoding.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities -> Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_code_execution_vulnerabilities_-_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit known vulnerabilities in TypeORM's dependencies to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium to Critical
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy to Medium
    * Mitigation: Regularly audit and update dependencies, use vulnerability scanning tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Logic Flaws in TypeORM Usage -> Insecure Data Filtering](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_logic_flaws_in_typeorm_usage_-_insecure_data_filtering.md)

* Attack Vector: Bypass intended access controls by manipulating query parameters due to insufficient server-side filtering.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium to High
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Difficult
    * Mitigation: Implement robust server-side filtering and authorization checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application by Exploiting TypeORM Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_by_exploiting_typeorm_weaknesses.md)

* Description: The ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful exploitation of any high-risk path leads to this.
    * Mitigation: Focus on mitigating all underlying vulnerabilities in the high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Database Interaction Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_database_interaction_vulnerabilities.md)

* Description: A broad category encompassing highly critical vulnerabilities that directly interact with the database.
    * Mitigation: Prioritize secure database interaction practices, including input validation, parameterized queries, and secure configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_sql_injection.md)

* Description: A classic web application vulnerability that can have devastating consequences.
    * Mitigation: Implement strong input validation, use parameterized queries, avoid dynamic query building with user input, and be cautious with raw SQL.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

* Description: Improper configuration can expose sensitive information and create easy attack vectors.
    * Mitigation: Implement secure configuration management practices, avoid hardcoding credentials, and disable debug settings in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_code_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

* Description: Allows attackers to run arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete compromise.
    * Mitigation: Regularly update dependencies, be cautious with prototype pollution, and avoid deserializing untrusted data.
