## Deep Dive Analysis: SQL Injection via Raw Queries in TypeORM

This analysis provides a comprehensive look at the identified SQL Injection threat when using raw queries in a TypeORM application. We will delve into the technical details, potential attack scenarios, and provide actionable insights for the development team.

**1. Deeper Understanding of the Vulnerability:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into SQL strings executed by TypeORM's `query()` method. Unlike ORM-generated queries which typically use parameterized statements by default, raw queries offer a low-level interface, granting developers full control over the SQL being executed. However, this power comes with the responsibility of ensuring proper input handling.

When user input is directly embedded without proper sanitization or parameterization, an attacker can manipulate the intended query structure. The database server interprets the attacker's injected SQL code as part of the original query, leading to unintended actions.

**Think of it like this:**  Imagine a template where you fill in blanks. Parameterized queries provide pre-defined blanks that only accept specific types of data. Raw queries are like a free-form text field where an attacker can write anything they want, potentially changing the entire meaning of the "template."

**2. Expanding on Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

Let's explore specific scenarios where this vulnerability can be exploited:

* **Login Bypass:**
    * **Vulnerable Code:**
      ```typescript
      const username = req.body.username;
      const password = req.body.password;
      const user = await connection.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`);
      ```
    * **Attack:** An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` in the username field. The resulting query becomes:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'somepassword'
      ```
      The `OR '1'='1'` condition is always true, bypassing the password check and potentially returning the first user in the table.

* **Data Exfiltration (Reading Sensitive Information):**
    * **Vulnerable Code:**
      ```typescript
      const productId = req.params.id;
      const product = await connection.query(`SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ${productId}`);
      ```
    * **Attack:** An attacker could provide an ID like `1 UNION SELECT credit_card FROM sensitive_data --`. The resulting query becomes:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT credit_card FROM sensitive_data --
      ```
      This would combine the results of the original query with the credit card data from another table. The `--` comments out the rest of the original query, preventing errors.

* **Data Manipulation (Modifying or Deleting Data):**
    * **Vulnerable Code:**
      ```typescript
      const userId = req.params.id;
      const newStatus = req.body.status;
      await connection.query(`UPDATE users SET status = '${newStatus}' WHERE id = ${userId}`);
      ```
    * **Attack:** An attacker could provide a `newStatus` like `'deleted'; DELETE FROM users WHERE is_admin = true; --`. The resulting query becomes:
      ```sql
      UPDATE users SET status = 'deleted'; DELETE FROM users WHERE is_admin = true; --' WHERE id = 5
      ```
      This would first update the user's status and then, disastrously, delete all admin users.

* **Privilege Escalation (Database Level):**
    * **Vulnerable Code (Less Common but Possible):**  If the application allows execution of more complex raw queries based on user input (e.g., through a custom reporting feature).
    * **Attack:**  An attacker with sufficient knowledge of the database structure and permissions could inject commands to grant themselves administrative privileges within the database itself. This is highly dependent on the database configuration and the application's functionality.

**3. TypeORM Component Focus: `QueryRunner` and the `query()` Method:**

The `QueryRunner` is the core component responsible for executing database queries in TypeORM. The `query()` method, specifically within the `QueryRunner` interface, provides the direct entry point for executing raw SQL.

**Key takeaways regarding `QueryRunner.query()`:**

* **Flexibility vs. Risk:** It offers maximum flexibility for complex queries but requires developers to be highly vigilant about security.
* **Parameter Binding Support:** While vulnerable to direct injection, `query()` *does* support parameter binding, which is the primary recommended mitigation. This means the capability to prevent SQL injection is present, but developers must actively utilize it.
* **No Automatic Sanitization:** TypeORM does not automatically sanitize or escape user input passed directly to `query()`. This is by design, as it's intended for raw SQL where the developer is expected to handle security.

**4. Detailed Impact Analysis:**

The initial impact description is accurate, but let's elaborate:

* **Data Breach (Confidentiality Loss):**  Attackers can steal sensitive customer data, financial records, intellectual property, and other confidential information. This can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions (e.g., GDPR violations).
* **Data Manipulation (Integrity Loss):**  Attackers can alter critical data, leading to incorrect business decisions, system malfunctions, and loss of trust. This can range from subtle changes that are hard to detect to widespread data corruption.
* **Data Deletion (Availability Loss):**  Attackers can delete crucial data, rendering the application unusable and disrupting business operations. Recovery from such attacks can be costly and time-consuming.
* **Privilege Escalation on the Database:** This is a severe impact where attackers gain control over the database server itself. They can then create new accounts, modify permissions, install malware, or even take down the entire database infrastructure.
* **Compliance Violations:** Many regulatory frameworks (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) have strict requirements regarding the security of sensitive data. Successful SQL injection attacks can lead to significant fines and penalties for non-compliance.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Public disclosure of a successful SQL injection attack can severely damage an organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

**5. Elaborating on Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Never Directly Embed User Input:** This is the golden rule. Treat user input as potentially malicious and avoid directly inserting it into SQL strings. Think of user input as untrusted data that needs to be handled with extreme caution.
* **Always Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**
    * **How it Works:** Parameterized queries use placeholders (e.g., `?` for PostgreSQL, `$1` for MySQL) in the SQL string. User-provided values are then passed separately as parameters. The database driver handles the proper escaping and quoting of these parameters, preventing them from being interpreted as SQL code.
    * **TypeORM Implementation:**
      ```typescript
      const username = req.body.username;
      const password = req.body.password;
      const user = await connection.query(
          `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?`,
          [username, password]
      );
      ```
    * **Benefits:** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection. It separates the SQL structure from the data, making it impossible for attackers to inject malicious code.
* **Sanitize and Validate User Input (Defense in Depth):**
    * **Purpose:** While parameterized queries are the primary defense, input validation adds an extra layer of security. It helps to prevent unexpected or malformed data from reaching the database, even if there's a flaw in the parameterization logic.
    * **Techniques:**
        * **Whitelisting:** Only allow specific, expected characters or patterns. For example, if expecting a numeric ID, only allow digits.
        * **Blacklisting:** Disallow specific characters or patterns known to be used in SQL injection attacks (e.g., single quotes, semicolons, `OR`, `UNION`). However, blacklisting is generally less effective as attackers can often find ways to bypass the blacklist.
        * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure the input matches the expected data type (e.g., check if a number is actually a number).
        * **Encoding/Escaping:**  While less critical with parameterized queries, encoding or escaping special characters can be helpful in other contexts.
    * **Placement:** Perform validation on the application layer *before* using the input in database queries.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its tasks. Avoid using a highly privileged user account, as this limits the potential damage if an attacker gains access.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Periodically review the codebase, especially sections involving raw queries, to identify potential vulnerabilities. Automated static analysis tools can also help in detecting potential SQL injection flaws.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns before they reach the application. This provides an additional layer of defense.
* **Database Activity Monitoring:** Monitor database logs for suspicious activity, such as unusual queries or attempts to access sensitive data. This can help in detecting and responding to attacks in progress.

**6. Code Examples Illustrating the Threat and Mitigation:**

**Vulnerable Code (Direct Embedding):**

```typescript
import { createConnection } from "typeorm";

async function getUserByIdVulnerable(userId: string) {
  const connection = await createConnection();
  try {
    const result = await connection.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    return null;
  } finally {
    await connection.close();
  }
}

// Example usage with a malicious ID
getUserByIdVulnerable("1; DELETE FROM users; --").then(console.log);
```

**Secure Code (Parameterized Query):**

```typescript
import { createConnection } from "typeorm";

async function getUserByIdSecure(userId: number) {
  const connection = await createConnection();
  try {
    const result = await connection.query(
      `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?`,
      [userId]
    );
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    return null;
  } finally {
    await connection.close();
  }
}

// Example usage with a valid ID
getUserByIdSecure(1).then(console.log);
```

**7. Defense in Depth Considerations:**

It's crucial to understand that relying solely on one mitigation strategy is risky. A layered approach, known as "defense in depth," is essential. This involves implementing multiple security controls to protect against various attack vectors and to provide redundancy in case one control fails.

For SQL injection, this means:

* **Primary Defense:** Parameterized queries are the primary and most effective defense.
* **Secondary Defenses:** Input validation, least privilege, regular audits, and WAFs act as additional layers of protection.

**8. Detection and Monitoring:**

Even with robust mitigation strategies, it's important to have mechanisms in place to detect and respond to potential attacks:

* **Database Logs:** Regularly review database logs for suspicious queries, failed login attempts, or unusual data access patterns.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** These systems can monitor network traffic and database activity for malicious patterns.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** SIEM tools can collect and analyze security logs from various sources, including the application and database, to identify potential threats.
* **Application Monitoring:** Monitor application logs for errors related to database queries, which might indicate an attempted SQL injection.

**9. Conclusion and Recommendations for the Development Team:**

SQL Injection via raw queries is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences. The development team must prioritize the following:

* **Adopt a strict policy of using parameterized queries for all raw SQL interactions.**
* **Educate developers on the risks of SQL injection and the importance of secure coding practices.**
* **Implement robust input validation on the application layer as a defense in depth measure.**
* **Conduct regular code reviews and security audits, specifically focusing on areas where raw queries are used.**
* **Utilize static analysis tools to automatically identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.**
* **Implement database activity monitoring to detect and respond to potential attacks.**

By understanding the intricacies of this threat and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection and build a more secure application. Remember, security is an ongoing process, and continuous vigilance is key.
