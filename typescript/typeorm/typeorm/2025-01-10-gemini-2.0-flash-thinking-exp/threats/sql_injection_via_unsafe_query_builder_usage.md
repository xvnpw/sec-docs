## Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Unsafe Query Builder Usage in TypeORM

This document provides a deep analysis of the "SQL Injection via Unsafe Query Builder Usage" threat within the context of an application utilizing the TypeORM library. This analysis aims to equip the development team with a comprehensive understanding of the threat, its potential impact, and effective mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Deep Dive:**

This threat exploits a fundamental weakness in how SQL databases process queries. Instead of treating user-provided data as mere data, a vulnerability arises when this data is directly incorporated into the structure of the SQL query itself. TypeORM's Query Builder, while providing a convenient and often safer alternative to raw SQL, can still be misused, leading to classic SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Key Mechanisms of Exploitation:**

* **Direct String Concatenation in `where`, `andWhere`, `orWhere`, `orderBy`, etc.:** The most common and direct way this vulnerability manifests is by directly embedding user input into the string arguments of these methods. For example:

   ```typescript
   // Vulnerable Code
   const username = req.query.username;
   const users = await dataSource.getRepository(User)
       .createQueryBuilder("user")
       .where(`user.username = '${username}'`) // Direct embedding of user input
       .getMany();
   ```

   In this scenario, if an attacker provides an input like `' OR 1=1 --`, the resulting SQL query becomes:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM user WHERE user.username = '' OR 1=1 --'
   ```

   The `--` comments out the rest of the query, and `OR 1=1` always evaluates to true, effectively bypassing the intended filtering and potentially returning all users.

* **Unsafe Usage with Dynamic Query Building:**  Applications often need to build queries dynamically based on various user-provided criteria. If not handled carefully, this can introduce vulnerabilities. Consider a scenario where the sort order is determined by user input:

   ```typescript
   // Vulnerable Code
   const sortBy = req.query.sortBy;
   const users = await dataSource.getRepository(User)
       .createQueryBuilder("user")
       .orderBy(`user.${sortBy}`, 'ASC') // Directly using user input for column name
       .getMany();
   ```

   An attacker could provide `sortBy` as `id; DELETE FROM user; --`, leading to the execution of a destructive SQL command.

* **Misunderstanding Parameterization:**  Developers might think they are using parameterization correctly but make subtle mistakes. For instance, using parameter binding for the *value* but not the *column name* in a dynamic query.

   ```typescript
   // Still Vulnerable (Column name not parameterized)
   const columnName = req.query.column;
   const value = req.query.value;
   const users = await dataSource.getRepository(User)
       .createQueryBuilder("user")
       .where(`user.${columnName} = :value`, { value })
       .getMany();
   ```

   Here, while `:value` is parameterized, `columnName` is still directly embedded, allowing for manipulation of the query structure.

**2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

* **Authentication Bypass:** As seen in the `username` example, attackers can manipulate conditions to bypass authentication checks.
* **Data Exfiltration:** By injecting `UNION SELECT` statements, attackers can retrieve data from other tables within the database.
* **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Malicious SQL commands like `UPDATE` or `DELETE` can be injected to alter or remove sensitive data.
* **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While direct privilege escalation within the database might be less common through this vector, attackers could manipulate data related to user roles or permissions within the application's tables, effectively achieving privilege escalation within the application's context.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Resource-intensive queries can be injected to overload the database server, leading to a denial of service.

**3. Impact Assessment (Expanded):**

The "High" risk severity is justified due to the potentially catastrophic consequences:

* **Data Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive customer data, financial records, intellectual property, etc., leading to significant financial and reputational damage, legal liabilities (e.g., GDPR fines), and loss of customer trust.
* **Data Manipulation:**  Altering critical data can lead to incorrect business decisions, financial losses, and operational disruptions.
* **Data Deletion:**  Permanent loss of valuable data can be devastating for business continuity and regulatory compliance.
* **Reputational Damage:**  News of a successful SQL injection attack can severely damage the organization's reputation, leading to loss of customers and business opportunities.
* **Financial Losses:**  Direct costs associated with incident response, data breach notifications, legal fees, regulatory fines, and loss of business.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Failure to protect sensitive data can result in significant penalties and legal action.
* **Business Disruption:**  Recovery from a successful attack can be time-consuming and costly, leading to significant business disruption.

**4. Affected TypeORM Component: QueryBuilder - Deeper Look:**

The `QueryBuilder` is designed to provide a type-safe and convenient way to construct SQL queries. However, its flexibility can be a double-edged sword. The methods mentioned in the threat description (`where`, `andWhere`, `orWhere`, `orderBy`, `setParameter`) are the primary points of interaction where user input can be mishandled.

* **`where`, `andWhere`, `orWhere`:** These methods accept string arguments for specifying conditions. Directly embedding user input into these strings is the root cause of the vulnerability.
* **`orderBy`:** Similar to `where`, directly embedding user input for the column name or order direction is dangerous.
* **`setParameter`:** This method is part of the *solution*, not the problem. It allows for safe parameterization of values within the query. The issue arises when developers *don't* use it when they should.

**5. Mitigation Strategies - Detailed Implementation Guidance:**

* **Prioritize Parameter Binding:** This is the most effective defense. Instead of embedding user input directly, use placeholders and the `setParameter()` method or pass an object as the condition.

   ```typescript
   // Secure Code - Using parameter binding with setParameter()
   const username = req.query.username;
   const users = await dataSource.getRepository(User)
       .createQueryBuilder("user")
       .where("user.username = :username", { username })
       .getMany();

   // Secure Code - Using an object as the condition
   const userId = req.query.userId;
   const users = await dataSource.getRepository(User)
       .createQueryBuilder("user")
       .where({ id: userId })
       .getMany();
   ```

   TypeORM will automatically handle the proper escaping and quoting of the parameters, preventing SQL injection.

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** While parameter binding is the primary defense, sanitizing and validating user input adds an extra layer of security.

    * **Validation:** Ensure the input conforms to the expected format, data type, and length. For example, if expecting an integer ID, validate that the input is indeed an integer.
    * **Sanitization (with caution):**  Be extremely careful with sanitization techniques like blacklisting or whitelisting characters. Blacklists are often incomplete and can be bypassed. Whitelisting specific allowed characters or patterns is generally safer. **However, do not rely on sanitization as the sole defense against SQL injection. Parameter binding is crucial.**

* **Be Extremely Cautious with Dynamic Query Building:** If dynamic query construction is necessary, carefully consider the potential attack surface.

    * **Whitelisting Allowed Columns/Sort Orders:** If the dynamic part involves selecting columns or sorting, maintain a strict whitelist of allowed values and only use those.

      ```typescript
      const allowedSortColumns = ['id', 'username', 'email'];
      const sortBy = req.query.sortBy;
      if (allowedSortColumns.includes(sortBy)) {
          const users = await dataSource.getRepository(User)
              .createQueryBuilder("user")
              .orderBy(`user.${sortBy}`, 'ASC')
              .getMany();
      } else {
          // Handle invalid input appropriately (e.g., return an error)
      }
      ```

    * **Abstract Query Construction Logic:**  Consider creating functions or modules that encapsulate the logic for building dynamic queries securely, ensuring parameterization is always used.

* **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access:**  The database user used by the application should have only the necessary permissions to perform its required operations. This limits the potential damage if an SQL injection attack is successful.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where user input is used in database queries. Tools like static analysis security testing (SAST) can help identify potential vulnerabilities.

* **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might have been missed during development.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application. However, WAFs should be considered a supplementary defense and not a replacement for secure coding practices.

* **Stay Updated with TypeORM Security Best Practices:**  Keep up-to-date with the latest security recommendations and best practices for using TypeORM. Review the official documentation and community resources.

**6. Prevention Best Practices for the Development Team:**

* **Security Awareness Training:**  Ensure the development team receives adequate training on common web application security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, and secure coding practices.
* **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC):**  Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
* **Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory code reviews, with a focus on security aspects, before merging code changes.
* **Automated Security Testing:**  Integrate automated security testing tools (SAST, DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
* **Dependency Management:**  Keep TypeORM and other dependencies up-to-date to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Adopt a "Secure by Default" Mindset:**  Encourage developers to think about security implications from the outset and prioritize secure coding practices.

**7. Detection Strategies During Development and Testing:**

* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Tools can analyze the codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by identifying patterns of unsafe Query Builder usage.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Tools can simulate attacks against the running application to identify vulnerabilities. This includes testing various inputs to trigger potential SQL injection flaws.
* **Manual Code Reviews:**  Careful manual review of the code, especially around database interactions, is crucial. Look for instances of direct string concatenation in Query Builder methods.
* **Unit and Integration Tests:** While not directly focused on security, well-designed tests can sometimes reveal unexpected behavior that might indicate a vulnerability.
* **Security Testing as Part of QA:**  Integrate security testing as a standard part of the quality assurance process.

**Conclusion:**

SQL Injection via unsafe Query Builder usage is a serious threat that can have severe consequences for applications using TypeORM. While TypeORM provides tools for secure query building, developers must be vigilant and adhere to secure coding practices. Prioritizing parameter binding, validating user input, being cautious with dynamic queries, and implementing comprehensive security testing are crucial steps to mitigate this risk. By understanding the mechanics of this threat and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the attack surface and build more secure applications. Continuous learning and a proactive approach to security are essential to stay ahead of potential threats.
