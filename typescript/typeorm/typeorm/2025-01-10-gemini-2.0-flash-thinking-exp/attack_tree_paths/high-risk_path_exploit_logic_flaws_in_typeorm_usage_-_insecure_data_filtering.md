## Deep Analysis: Insecure Data Filtering in TypeORM Applications

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Insecure Data Filtering" attack tree path within a TypeORM application, as requested. We will break down the attack vector, explore its implications, delve into potential exploitation scenarios, and offer concrete mitigation strategies for the development team.

**Attack Tree Path:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Logic Flaws in TypeORM Usage -> Insecure Data Filtering**

* **Attack Vector:** Bypass intended access controls by manipulating query parameters due to insufficient server-side filtering.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium to High
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust server-side filtering and authorization checks.

**Detailed Analysis:**

This attack path highlights a critical vulnerability arising from a failure to properly validate and sanitize user-provided data before using it in database queries within a TypeORM application. Essentially, the application trusts the client (or an attacker manipulating the client-side requests) to provide only valid and authorized data.

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

TypeORM, while providing a robust ORM layer, doesn't inherently enforce authorization or data filtering. It's the developer's responsibility to implement these crucial security measures. "Insecure Data Filtering" occurs when the application directly uses user-supplied data (e.g., from query parameters, request bodies, headers) to construct database queries without sufficient validation and sanitization on the server-side.

**How the Attack Works:**

An attacker can manipulate query parameters or request bodies to inject unintended values or conditions into database queries. This can lead to various security breaches, including:

* **Data Leakage:** Accessing data that the user is not authorized to view. For example, manipulating a `userId` parameter to retrieve information of other users.
* **Data Modification:**  Modifying or deleting data that the user should not have access to. For instance, changing the status of another user's order by manipulating an `orderId` parameter.
* **Circumventing Business Logic:** Bypassing intended application logic by manipulating parameters that control data retrieval or processing.
* **Potential for SQL Injection (if not using parameterized queries correctly):** While TypeORM encourages parameterized queries, improper usage or reliance on raw SQL can still open the door to SQL injection if input is not escaped.

**Specific Scenarios in a TypeORM Application:**

Let's consider some concrete examples of how this attack could manifest in a TypeORM application using different TypeORM features:

1. **Directly Using Query Parameters in `find` Options:**

   ```typescript
   // Vulnerable Code
   @Get('/users')
   async getUsers(@Query('role') role: string): Promise<User[]> {
       return await this.userRepository.find({ where: { role } });
   }
   ```

   **Attack:** An attacker could send a request like `/users?role=admin`. If the application doesn't verify the user's authorization to view admin users, they can potentially access sensitive information.

2. **Insufficient Filtering in Complex Queries:**

   ```typescript
   // Vulnerable Code
   @Get('/products')
   async getProducts(@Query('category') category: string, @Query('minPrice') minPrice: number): Promise<Product[]> {
       return await this.productRepository.find({
           where: {
               category,
               price: MoreThanOrEqual(minPrice),
           },
       });
   }
   ```

   **Attack:** An attacker could send `/products?category=Electronics&minPrice=-100`. While seemingly harmless, if the application doesn't validate `minPrice` to be non-negative, it could lead to unexpected results or expose more data than intended.

3. **Manipulating Relations in Queries:**

   ```typescript
   // Vulnerable Code (assuming a User has many Orders)
   @Get('/orders')
   async getOrders(@Query('userId') userId: number): Promise<Order[]> {
       const user = await this.userRepository.findOne({ where: { id: userId }, relations: ['orders'] });
       return user ? user.orders : [];
   }
   ```

   **Attack:** An attacker could try to access orders of other users by changing the `userId` parameter. Proper authorization checks are crucial here.

4. **Abuse of Dynamic Filtering:**

   While dynamic filtering can be useful, it needs careful implementation:

   ```typescript
   // Potentially Vulnerable if not properly implemented
   @Get('/search')
   async search(@Query() filters: any): Promise<User[]> {
       return await this.userRepository.find({ where: filters });
   }
   ```

   **Attack:** An attacker could inject arbitrary fields and values into the `filters` object, potentially bypassing intended access controls or querying for sensitive data they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of this vulnerability can range from **Medium to High**, depending on the sensitivity of the data being accessed and the capabilities exposed:

* **Medium Impact:**  Unauthorized access to non-critical data, information disclosure that could aid in further attacks.
* **High Impact:**  Access to sensitive personal information, financial data, or critical business data. Ability to modify or delete data, leading to data corruption or service disruption.

**Root Causes:**

* **Lack of Server-Side Validation:**  Relying solely on client-side validation, which can be easily bypassed.
* **Direct Use of User Input in Queries:**  Constructing queries by directly concatenating user-provided data.
* **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**  Failing to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested data.
* **Misunderstanding TypeORM Features:**  Not fully understanding how TypeORM handles data filtering and authorization.
* **Over-Trusting Client Input:**  Assuming that user-provided data is always valid and authorized.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

The mitigation strategy outlined in the attack tree path is crucial: **Implement robust server-side filtering and authorization checks.**  Here's a detailed breakdown of how to achieve this in a TypeORM application:

1. **Strong Server-Side Input Validation:**

   * **Define Expected Data Structures:** Clearly define the expected data types, formats, and ranges for all input parameters.
   * **Use Validation Libraries:** Employ libraries like `class-validator` (often used with NestJS, a common framework with TypeORM) or `joi` to define and enforce validation rules on incoming data.
   * **Sanitize Input:**  Cleanse input data to remove potentially harmful characters or scripts. Be cautious with over-sanitization, as it might unintentionally break valid data.

2. **Parameterized Queries (Best Practice in TypeORM):**

   * **Always use parameterized queries with TypeORM's `find`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` methods.** This prevents SQL injection by treating user input as data, not executable code.
   * **Avoid raw SQL queries whenever possible.** If raw SQL is necessary, ensure you use parameterized queries provided by your database driver.

3. **Implement Robust Authorization Checks:**

   * **Identify and Define Roles and Permissions:** Clearly define the different roles within your application and the permissions associated with each role.
   * **Implement Authorization Middleware/Guards:** Use middleware or guards (especially in frameworks like NestJS) to intercept requests and verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource or perform the intended action.
   * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
   * **Check Authorization at the Data Level:**  Ensure that queries only return data that the authenticated user is authorized to view. For example, when fetching orders, ensure the `userId` matches the currently logged-in user's ID.

4. **Secure Data Filtering Techniques:**

   * **Whitelist Allowed Values:** Instead of trying to blacklist malicious inputs, explicitly define the allowed values for parameters.
   * **Transform Input Data:**  Convert user input into the expected data type before using it in queries.
   * **Use TypeORM's Query Builder for Complex Scenarios:** The query builder provides more control over query construction and allows for safer filtering and conditional logic.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

   * **Conduct regular code reviews:**  Have other developers review the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
   * **Perform penetration testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks to identify weaknesses in the application's security.

6. **Security Awareness Training for Developers:**

   * Educate developers about common web application security vulnerabilities, including insecure data filtering and SQL injection.
   * Promote secure coding practices and the importance of input validation and authorization.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

Detecting insecure data filtering can be challenging, as it often manifests as logical errors rather than explicit security alerts. However, consider these strategies:

* **Logging and Monitoring of Database Queries:** Log database queries along with the user who initiated them. Unusual or unauthorized queries can be a sign of an attack.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor for unusual patterns in data access or modification.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can help detect and block malicious requests that attempt to manipulate query parameters.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**  Aggregate logs from various sources to identify potential security incidents.

**Developer Best Practices:**

* **"Trust No One":** Never trust user-provided data. Always validate and sanitize it on the server-side.
* **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary access and permissions.
* **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update TypeORM and other dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Implement Security Early in the Development Lifecycle:**  Consider security requirements from the beginning of the project.

**Conclusion:**

The "Insecure Data Filtering" attack path represents a significant risk to TypeORM applications. By diligently implementing robust server-side validation, authorization checks, and adhering to secure coding practices, development teams can effectively mitigate this vulnerability and protect sensitive data. Regular security assessments and ongoing vigilance are crucial to maintaining a secure application. This detailed analysis should provide the development team with the necessary insights and actionable steps to address this critical security concern.
