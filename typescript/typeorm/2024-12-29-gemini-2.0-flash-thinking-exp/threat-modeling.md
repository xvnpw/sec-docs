*   **Threat:** Raw SQL Injection via `query()` method
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating input that is directly incorporated into a raw SQL query executed using the `query()` method. This involves crafting input strings that, when concatenated into the SQL query, alter the query's intended logic.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. An attacker might be able to bypass authentication, extract sensitive information, or even execute arbitrary database commands.
    *   **Affected TypeORM Component:** `QueryRunner.query()` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using the `query()` method with user-provided input whenever possible.
        *   If using `query()` is unavoidable, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Pass user input as parameters rather than directly embedding it into the SQL string.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before using it in SQL queries.

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via insecure use of Query Builder methods
    *   **Description:** While TypeORM's Query Builder aims to prevent SQL injection, developers might inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities by directly embedding unsanitized user input into Query Builder methods like `where`, `andWhere`, or `orWhere` using string interpolation or concatenation instead of parameter binding.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to raw SQL injection, successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Attackers could manipulate query conditions to retrieve or modify data they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Affected TypeORM Component:** Query Builder methods (e.g., `where`, `andWhere`, `orWhere`, `setParameter`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameter binding when adding conditions to Query Builder queries. Utilize the `setParameter()` method or the object notation for parameters within the condition string.
        *   Avoid string interpolation or concatenation of user input directly into Query Builder method arguments.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on user-provided data before using it in Query Builder methods.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization of Database Results leading to potential code execution
    *   **Description:** If the database contains malicious or unexpected data in columns that are mapped to specific data types or custom objects in TypeORM entities, the deserialization process might trigger vulnerabilities. This is more likely if custom transformers or serialization logic are used without proper security considerations. An attacker might manipulate database records to inject payloads that are executed during the object hydration process.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the application's logic and the nature of the injected payload, this could lead to remote code execution on the server, denial of service, or other unexpected and harmful behavior.
    *   **Affected TypeORM Component:** Entity mapping, result transformation, custom transformers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation on data retrieved from the database, even if it's expected to be in a specific format.
        *   Be extremely cautious when using custom transformers or serialization/deserialization logic. Ensure they are designed to handle potentially malicious input safely.
        *   Follow secure deserialization best practices. Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources without thorough validation.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Migrations leading to database compromise
    *   **Description:** If the process of creating and applying database migrations is not properly controlled, an attacker with sufficient access could introduce malicious migrations that alter the database schema in harmful ways. This could involve adding backdoors, modifying data, or disrupting database functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, introduction of vulnerabilities, or complete database compromise.
    *   **Affected TypeORM Component:** Migrations feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a secure migration process with code reviews and proper authorization for creating and applying migrations.
        *   Use version control for migration files and track changes carefully.
        *   Restrict access to the migration execution environment.
        *   Regularly audit migration scripts for suspicious or unauthorized changes.
