# Attack Surface Analysis for nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Applications built with `angular-seed-advanced` rely on numerous npm packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited by attackers.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** The seed project *predefines* a substantial set of dependencies in `package.json`. This curated list, while providing a starting point, can become a source of vulnerabilities if not actively maintained.  The seed's choice of initial dependencies directly influences the application's initial attack surface.  Outdated dependencies within the seed's initial configuration directly contribute to the risk.
*   **Example:** The `angular-seed-advanced` seed project includes an older version of a key Angular framework dependency or a third-party library with a known remote code execution vulnerability. Applications built using this seed inherit this vulnerable dependency.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can range from information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), to denial of service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**, depending on the specific vulnerability and its exploitability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly audit dependencies:** Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` *immediately* upon project creation and continuously throughout development.
    *   **Keep dependencies updated:** Update npm packages to their latest versions regularly, especially for security patches. Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
    *   **Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerabilities before deployment.
    *   **Use a dependency management tool:** Employ tools like `Dependabot` or `Snyk` to automate dependency updates and vulnerability monitoring.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process and Tooling Misconfiguration (Seed Defaults)](./attack_surfaces/build_process_and_tooling_misconfiguration__seed_defaults_.md)

*   **Description:** `angular-seed-advanced` uses Angular CLI and Webpack for building the application. Insecure default configurations provided by the seed can introduce security weaknesses.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** The seed project *provides default configurations* for Angular CLI and Webpack. If these defaults prioritize development convenience over production security, they can introduce vulnerabilities.  Developers might unknowingly deploy applications with these insecure default configurations.
*   **Example:** The default Webpack configuration in `angular-seed-advanced` might enable source maps in production builds (`devtool: 'source-map'`). This exposes the application's source code in browser developer tools, potentially revealing sensitive logic or vulnerabilities to attackers.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (source code, API keys, internal logic), increased ease for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities revealed by source code analysis.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High**, depending on the information exposed and the complexity of the application.  While technically *medium* in direct impact, the *ease of exploitation* due to exposed source code can elevate the practical risk to **High** in many scenarios.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review Webpack and Angular CLI configurations provided by the seed:** Thoroughly examine the default configurations and understand their security implications.
    *   **Harden build configurations for production:**  Specifically modify and optimize Webpack and Angular CLI configurations for production security. Disable source maps in production builds (`devtool: false` or similar), minimize bundle size, and ensure proper asset handling.
    *   **Implement configuration linting/security scanning:** Integrate tools to automatically check build configurations for security best practices and potential misconfigurations.

## Attack Surface: [Build Scripts and Custom Scripts Vulnerabilities (Seed Provided Scripts)](./attack_surfaces/build_scripts_and_custom_scripts_vulnerabilities__seed_provided_scripts_.md)

*   **Description:** `angular-seed-advanced` includes custom scripts in `package.json` for various tasks. Vulnerabilities or malicious code in these *seed-provided scripts* can compromise the development environment or the built application.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** The seed project *provides a set of default scripts* that developers are expected to use and potentially extend. If these scripts are not carefully vetted or if they rely on vulnerable dependencies, they can introduce security risks.  Developers might trust and use these seed-provided scripts without thorough security scrutiny.
*   **Example:** A script provided by `angular-seed-advanced` to automate deployment might have a vulnerability that allows for command injection or insecure handling of credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the deployment environment or modify the deployed application.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain attacks, compromised development/deployment environment, malware injection into the application, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**, as it can lead to significant compromise and is often difficult to detect.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review and understand all scripts provided by the seed:** Carefully examine all scripts in `package.json` that are part of the `angular-seed-advanced` project and understand their functionality and dependencies.
    *   **Minimize modifications to seed scripts:**  Avoid unnecessary modifications to the seed-provided scripts unless absolutely necessary. If modifications are needed, ensure they are done with security in mind.
    *   **Implement script integrity checks (if modifying):** If you modify seed scripts, consider implementing integrity checks to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
    *   **Secure development environment:**  Maintain a secure development environment to reduce the risk of script compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Management Issues (Seed Structure & Examples)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_management_issues__seed_structure_&_examples_.md)

*   **Description:** `angular-seed-advanced` provides a structure for configuration management using environment variables and configuration files.  Insecure examples or guidance within the seed project can lead to information disclosure.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** The seed project *suggests a configuration structure* and might provide *example configuration files*. If these examples demonstrate insecure practices (e.g., committing configuration files with secrets, exposing environment variables client-side), developers following these examples will inherit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** The `angular-seed-advanced` seed might include an example configuration file (`config/env.ts`) that is intended for development but is mistakenly committed to version control with placeholder API keys. Developers might then deploy the application with these placeholder keys still present, or accidentally commit their *actual* keys following the example structure.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data (API keys, credentials, internal URLs), unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**, depending on the sensitivity of the exposed information.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review configuration management examples in the seed for security best practices:** Critically evaluate the configuration examples provided by `angular-seed-advanced` and identify any potential security weaknesses.
    *   **Implement secure environment variable management:**  Use secure environment variable management practices (e.g., using `.env` files and ensuring they are *never* committed to version control).
    *   **Never commit sensitive data to version control:**  Reinforce the practice of excluding configuration files containing sensitive data from version control using `.gitignore`.
    *   **Educate developers on secure configuration practices:** Ensure developers understand secure configuration management principles and avoid common pitfalls.
