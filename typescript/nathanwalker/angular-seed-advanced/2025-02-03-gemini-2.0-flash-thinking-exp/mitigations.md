## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Dependency Vulnerability Management (Angular Seed Advanced Dependencies)](./mitigation_strategies/1__dependency_vulnerability_management__angular_seed_advanced_dependencies_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  **Automated Dependency Vulnerability Scanning and Regular Updates for Angular Seed Advanced Dependencies**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Focus on Angular Seed Advanced Dependencies:** Recognize that `angular-seed-advanced` comes with a pre-defined set of dependencies in its `package.json`. These are the initial dependencies you inherit.
    2.  **Choose a vulnerability scanning tool:** Select a tool like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check to scan the dependencies *defined by angular-seed-advanced*.
    3.  **Integrate into CI/CD pipeline (for your project based on Angular Seed Advanced):** Add a step in *your project's* CI/CD pipeline (built upon `angular-seed-advanced`) to run the vulnerability scanning tool after dependency installation (`npm install` or `yarn install`). This ensures vulnerabilities introduced by the seed project's initial dependencies and any added later are caught.
    4.  **Configure tool for failure on high severity vulnerabilities:** Set up the tool to fail the build process if vulnerabilities of high severity are detected in the dependencies inherited from `angular-seed-advanced` or added later.
    5.  **Establish a schedule for dependency updates:** Define a regular schedule to review and update dependencies, starting with the base dependencies from `angular-seed-advanced`.
    6.  **Prioritize updates based on vulnerability reports:** When updates are available, prioritize those that address reported vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by your application, starting with those initially provided by `angular-seed-advanced`.
    7.  **Test after updates:** After updating dependencies, run thorough tests to ensure no regressions or breaking changes were introduced in *your application built using angular-seed-advanced*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies *initially included in angular-seed-advanced* or added later.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in dependencies *from angular-seed-advanced* can lead to data breaches.
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium to High Severity):** Some vulnerabilities in dependencies *used by angular-seed-advanced* can be exploited for DoS attacks.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Certain vulnerabilities in dependencies *within the angular-seed-advanced ecosystem* might enable account takeover.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches:** High Reduction
    *   **Denial of Service:** Medium to High Reduction

    *   **Missing (in projects using Angular Seed Advanced):** Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD, automated build failure on vulnerabilities, scheduled dependency updates, and a documented process for handling vulnerability reports are likely missing in projects *built upon* `angular-seed-advanced`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration (in your project):** Needs to be integrated into *your project's* CI/CD setup.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning Tool Configuration (for your project):** Requires configuration of a chosen tool to fail builds on high severity vulnerabilities in *your project*.
