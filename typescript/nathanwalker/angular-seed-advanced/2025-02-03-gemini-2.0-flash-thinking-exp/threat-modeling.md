# Threat Model Analysis for nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced

## Threat: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in SSR](./threats/server-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_ssr.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Server-Side Rendering (SSR) implementation provided or configured by `angular-seed-advanced`. If the seed's SSR setup doesn't properly sanitize data before rendering, attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute when the server renders the page and sends it to users.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (access to cookies, session tokens), session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application, potentially server-side compromise depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** `angular-seed-advanced`'s Server-Side Rendering (SSR) module, templating engine configuration within the seed, SSR data handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test the SSR implementation provided by `angular-seed-advanced` for XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure strict output encoding and sanitization is applied in the SSR rendering process, especially for user-provided data.
*   Utilize secure templating practices within the SSR context as recommended by Angular and Node.js security guidelines.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromised Build Dependencies Introduced by Seed](./threats/compromised_build_dependencies_introduced_by_seed.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise a build dependency that is specifically included or recommended by `angular-seed-advanced` (e.g., a specific version of a build tool or utility library used in the seed's build process). Malicious code injected into this dependency gets incorporated into applications built using the seed.

**Impact:** Backdoors in applications built with the seed, potential for malware distribution to users, data theft, supply chain compromise affecting all projects using the compromised seed dependency.

**Affected Component:** `angular-seed-advanced`'s `package.json` and dependency specifications, build process configuration, potentially custom build scripts that rely on specific dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use dependency scanning tools to specifically audit dependencies listed in `angular-seed-advanced`'s `package.json` and used in its build process.
*   Regularly update dependencies, but carefully review updates for unexpected changes, especially for seed-specific dependencies.
*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) focusing on the seed's dependency footprint.
*   Use dependency pinning and lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) as recommended by the seed to ensure consistent dependency versions.
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies, especially those unique to or emphasized by the seed.

## Threat: [Malicious Build Scripts Provided by Seed](./threats/malicious_build_scripts_provided_by_seed.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise or inject malicious code into the build scripts that are part of the `angular-seed-advanced` project itself (e.g., npm scripts, Webpack configuration files provided by the seed). This malicious code executes during the application build process.

**Impact:** Code injection into the built application, manipulation of the build process leading to compromised artifacts, deployment of a vulnerable or malicious application, potential for supply chain attacks if developers unknowingly use a compromised seed.

**Affected Component:** Build scripts within `angular-seed-advanced` (e.g., scripts in `package.json`, Webpack configuration files, custom build scripts included in the seed).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and understand all build scripts provided directly within the `angular-seed-advanced` project before using the seed.
*   Avoid modifying seed build scripts unless absolutely necessary and fully understand the security implications of any changes.
*   Use static analysis tools to scan the seed's build scripts for potential vulnerabilities or suspicious code.
*   Implement a secure build pipeline and integrate code review for any modifications to the seed's build scripts.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Pre-built Seed Components with Security Flaws](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_pre-built_seed_components_with_security_flaws.md)

**Description:** `angular-seed-advanced` includes pre-built components, services, or modules (if any) that contain inherent security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection flaws, authentication bypasses). Applications using these seed-provided components directly inherit these vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Application vulnerabilities stemming from the use of insecure seed components, potential for exploitation through these components, compromising the security of applications built with the seed.

**Affected Component:** Pre-built components, services, or modules distributed as part of `angular-seed-advanced` that are intended for direct use in applications (e.g., UI components, utility services, authentication modules if provided).

**Risk Severity:** High (if vulnerabilities are critical or easily exploitable)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly audit and security test all pre-built components and services provided by `angular-seed-advanced` before using them in production applications.
*   Keep seed components updated if the seed project provides updates or patches for its components.
*   Consider replacing or modifying vulnerable seed components with more secure alternatives or developing custom, security-reviewed components.
*   Treat seed-provided components as external, potentially untrusted code and apply rigorous security scrutiny.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Security Configurations in Seed](./threats/insecure_default_security_configurations_in_seed.md)

**Description:** `angular-seed-advanced` provides default configurations for security-related features (e.g., security headers, authentication settings, default user accounts) that are insecure out-of-the-box. Developers using the seed might unknowingly deploy applications with these weak default configurations.

**Impact:** Weakened security posture of applications built with the seed, increased attack surface due to misconfigurations, potential for exploitation due to insecure defaults, non-compliance with security best practices.

**Affected Component:** Default configuration files within `angular-seed-advanced` related to security (e.g., server configuration, security header settings, authentication setup, default user credentials if any).

**Risk Severity:** High (if defaults are critically insecure, like default credentials or missing essential security headers)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review all default security configurations provided by `angular-seed-advanced` and assess their security implications.
*   Override and customize default security configurations to align with security best practices and the specific security requirements of your application.
*   Use security linters and configuration scanners to identify potential insecure configurations inherited from the seed.
*   Implement security hardening guidelines for application and server configurations, ensuring defaults are overridden with secure settings.

## Threat: [Insecure Secret Storage Guidance in Seed Examples](./threats/insecure_secret_storage_guidance_in_seed_examples.md)

**Description:** `angular-seed-advanced`'s examples or documentation might demonstrate or suggest insecure practices for managing secrets (e.g., storing API keys or credentials directly in configuration files or environment variables committed to version control). Developers following these examples could inadvertently expose sensitive information.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive secrets (API keys, database credentials, etc.), unauthorized access to backend resources, compromise of backend systems, data breaches due to leaked credentials.

**Affected Component:** Documentation, example code, configuration examples within `angular-seed-advanced` that relate to secret management or configuration handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Critically evaluate and disregard any insecure secret management examples or recommendations within `angular-seed-advanced`'s documentation or example code.
*   Implement secure secret management practices using dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., vault systems, cloud provider secret managers, properly configured environment variables *not* committed to version control).
*   Ensure the seed's documentation and examples are updated to promote secure secret management and explicitly warn against insecure practices.
*   Educate developers using the seed on secure secret handling and enforce secure secret management policies within the development team.
