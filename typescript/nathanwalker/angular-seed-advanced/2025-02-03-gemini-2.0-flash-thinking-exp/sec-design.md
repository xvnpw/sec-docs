# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the 'angular-seed-advanced' GitHub repository, aims to provide a robust and feature-rich starter kit for developing Angular applications. It is designed to accelerate the development process by offering a pre-configured and well-structured foundation with advanced features and best practices already integrated.

Business Priorities and Goals:

- Accelerate Angular application development: The primary goal is to provide developers with a ready-to-use starting point, reducing setup time and allowing them to focus on application-specific logic.
- Promote best practices in Angular development: The seed project likely incorporates recommended architectural patterns, coding standards, and tooling configurations, guiding developers towards building maintainable and scalable applications.
- Enhance application quality and consistency: By providing a standardized base, the project aims to improve the consistency and quality of applications built using it.
- Reduce development costs: Faster development cycles and reduced setup effort can lead to lower overall development costs.
- Facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration: A well-defined seed project can serve as a common platform for development teams, improving collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Most Important Business Risks:

- Security vulnerabilities in applications built using the seed: If the seed project itself contains security flaws or promotes insecure practices, all applications built upon it will inherit these vulnerabilities. This is a critical risk, especially if the seed is widely adopted.
- Maintainability and upgrade challenges: If the seed project is not well-maintained or becomes outdated, applications built on it may face maintainability issues and challenges in upgrading to newer Angular versions or incorporating security patches.
- Vendor lock-in or dependency risks: Over-reliance on a specific seed project could create vendor lock-in or dependency risks if the project is abandoned or its direction changes in a way that is not aligned with business needs.
- Misuse or misconfiguration leading to insecure applications: Even with a secure seed project, developers might misconfigure or misuse it, introducing security vulnerabilities in the final applications.
- Compliance and regulatory risks: Applications built using the seed must still comply with relevant security and data privacy regulations. If the seed does not adequately address these concerns, it could lead to compliance risks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) - Assumed to be in place at the organization level, guiding development practices, although not explicitly defined within the seed project itself. Location: Organizational policy and development guidelines.
- security control: Code Reviews - Assumed to be part of the development process for applications built using the seed, to identify potential security flaws and ensure code quality. Location: Development team practices.
- security control: Dependency Management -  Likely implemented through package managers (npm/yarn) and potentially lock files to manage project dependencies. Location: package.json and lock files in the repository.
- security control: Build Automation -  Likely uses Angular CLI and Node.js for building the application. Location: package.json scripts and build configurations.
- security control: Version Control - Git is used for version control, providing traceability and history of code changes. Location: GitHub repository.

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party dependencies - The project depends on numerous npm packages, which introduces a supply chain risk. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could affect applications built using the seed. Mitigation: Dependency scanning and updates.
- accepted risk: Configuration vulnerabilities - Misconfigurations in the seed project or in applications built using it could lead to security weaknesses. Mitigation: Security hardening guidelines and configuration management.
- accepted risk: Developer security awareness - The security of applications built using the seed heavily relies on the security awareness and practices of the developers using it. Mitigation: Security training and secure coding guidelines.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the build pipeline to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning - Implement automated scanning of project dependencies for known vulnerabilities, using tools like npm audit or dedicated dependency scanning services.
- security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) -  Use SCA tools to gain visibility into all components of the application, including dependencies, and identify potential security and licensing risks.
- security control: Security Code Reviews - Conduct dedicated security-focused code reviews, in addition to general code reviews, to specifically look for security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Penetration Testing - Perform regular penetration testing on applications built using the seed to identify and address security weaknesses in a live environment.
- security control: Security Training for Developers - Provide developers with regular security training to enhance their awareness of secure coding practices and common web application vulnerabilities.
- security control: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Scanning - If IaC is used for deployment, scan IaC configurations for security misconfigurations.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Applications built using the seed should support secure authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
    - Details: Consider OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or SAML for authentication. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where appropriate.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Applications must implement robust authorization controls to manage user access to resources and functionalities based on roles and permissions.
    - Details: Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC). Enforce the principle of least privilege.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, command injection).
    - Details: Implement input validation on both client-side and server-side. Use parameterized queries or ORM for database interactions. Sanitize user inputs before rendering in the UI.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit must be protected using strong encryption.
    - Details: Use HTTPS for all communication. Encrypt sensitive data in databases and local storage. Properly manage encryption keys.
- Session Management:
    - Requirement: Implement secure session management to protect user sessions from hijacking and unauthorized access.
    - Details: Use secure session IDs, set appropriate session timeouts, and regenerate session IDs after authentication.
- Error Handling and Logging:
    - Requirement: Implement secure error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Implement comprehensive security logging for auditing and incident response.
    - Details: Log security-relevant events, such as authentication attempts, authorization failures, and input validation errors. Mask sensitive data in logs.
- Security Headers:
    - Requirement: Applications should utilize security headers to enhance protection against common web attacks.
    - Details: Implement headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, and Referrer-Policy.
