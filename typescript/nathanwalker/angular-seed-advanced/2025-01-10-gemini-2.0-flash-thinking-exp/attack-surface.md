# Attack Surface Analysis for nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The application relies on third-party libraries (npm packages) that may contain known security vulnerabilities.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** The `package.json` file in the seed project defines a set of initial dependencies. If these dependencies are outdated or contain vulnerabilities, projects built upon this seed inherit that risk from the outset. The inclusion of specific, potentially less common, "advanced" dependencies can also increase the likelihood of encountering vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A specific version of a UI component library included in the seed has a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code through a user input field that is rendered using this component.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting attacks, data breaches, denial of service, or other security compromises depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
    *   Utilize vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk) during development and in the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Implement a dependency management policy and track dependency versions.
    *   Consider using a dependency lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Build Artifacts](./attack_surfaces/exposed_build_artifacts.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information or development-related files are unintentionally included in the production build and are accessible to attackers.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** The build configuration within the seed project determines what files are included in the final build output. If not configured correctly by the seed, or if developers don't adjust it, it might inadvertently include source maps, `.env` files containing secrets, or other sensitive artifacts.
*   **Example:** The `.env` file containing API keys is mistakenly included in the production build due to a default configuration in the seed. An attacker can access this file and retrieve the API keys, potentially gaining unauthorized access to backend services.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, intellectual property, or internal application logic, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure the build process (potentially overriding seed defaults) to exclude unnecessary files and directories.
    *   Utilize `.gitignore` and `.npmignore` files effectively.
    *   Employ environment variables securely and avoid hardcoding secrets in configuration files.
    *   Verify the contents of the production build before deployment.
    *   Disable source maps in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Build Scripts](./attack_surfaces/insecure_build_scripts.md)

**Description:** Custom build scripts within the `package.json` or other build-related files contain vulnerabilities or insecure practices.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** The seed project provides a set of default build scripts. If these scripts contain vulnerabilities or insecure practices by default, or if developers extend them insecurely based on the seed's initial structure, it introduces risk.
*   **Example:** A default build script in the seed downloads external resources over HTTP instead of HTTPS, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks where malicious code could be injected during the download.
*   **Impact:** Code injection, arbitrary command execution during the build process, potentially compromising the build environment or the final application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and understand the functionality of all build scripts, especially those provided by the seed.
    *   Avoid executing untrusted code or downloading resources from unverified sources in build scripts.
    *   Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for downloading resources.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization within build scripts if they handle external input.
    *   Regularly audit and update build tool dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes server-side rendering (a feature often included in "advanced" seeds), vulnerabilities in the SSR setup or its dependencies can be exploited.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** The seed project might include a pre-configured SSR setup using Node.js and related libraries. Vulnerabilities in these pre-selected components or the default SSR implementation directly impact applications built on the seed.
*   **Example:** An SSR dependency included by default in the seed has a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can craft a malicious request that exploits this vulnerability on the server, allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Node.js environment and its dependencies (used for SSR) up to date.
    *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization on the server-side rendering component.
    *   Follow secure coding practices for Node.js development.
    *   Regularly audit the SSR implementation and its dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider security hardening measures for the server environment.

## Attack Surface: [Internationalization (i18n) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/internationalization__i18n__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the application uses internationalization (i18n), vulnerabilities can arise from improperly handled translation strings.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** The seed project might include i18n libraries and a basic setup. If the default configuration or examples within the seed don't emphasize secure i18n practices (like sanitization), it can lead to vulnerabilities in applications built using it.
*   **Example:** A translation string within the seed's default i18n setup contains malicious JavaScript code. When this string is rendered on the page, the JavaScript code is executed in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting attacks, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize translation strings sourced from user input or external sources.
    *   Use parameterized translation strings to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   Regularly review and audit translation files for potential malicious content.
