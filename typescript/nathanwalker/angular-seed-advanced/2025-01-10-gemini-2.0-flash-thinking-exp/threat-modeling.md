# Threat Model Analysis for nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced

## Threat: [Malicious Dependencies](./threats/malicious_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** The `angular-seed-advanced` project's `package.json` specifies numerous dependencies. If any of these dependencies are compromised by attackers (e.g., through account takeovers of maintainers or by injecting malicious code), the malicious code will be included when projects based on this seed are built. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code within the application context.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, unauthorized access to user accounts, redirection to phishing sites, or complete compromise of the application and its users' systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

*   **Description:** If a project using `angular-seed-advanced` introduces private dependencies, an attacker could publish a malicious package with the same name on a public registry. Due to misconfiguration or default behavior of package managers, the build process might inadvertently pull the attacker's malicious public package instead of the intended private one, injecting malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the build, potentially leading to the same impacts as malicious dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Outdated Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/outdated_dependencies_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The `angular-seed-advanced` project itself relies on specific versions of Angular and other libraries. If these versions have known security vulnerabilities, any application built upon this seed will inherit those vulnerabilities until the seed's dependencies are updated. Attackers can then exploit these known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Various security breaches depending on the exploited vulnerability, including cross-site scripting (XSS), arbitrary code execution, and data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** The `angular-seed-advanced` project might include default configuration files (e.g., within the `environments` folder) that contain placeholder values or examples. If developers fail to properly secure these files and replace placeholder values with secure, production-ready configurations, sensitive information like API keys or backend service URLs could be inadvertently exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to backend systems or services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Reliance on Potentially Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries within the Seed](./threats/reliance_on_potentially_vulnerable_third-party_libraries_within_the_seed.md)

*   **Description:** The `angular-seed-advanced` project incorporates specific versions of third-party libraries beyond core Angular dependencies. If these specific versions have known vulnerabilities, applications built using this seed will inherit those vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in included libraries, potentially leading to various security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
