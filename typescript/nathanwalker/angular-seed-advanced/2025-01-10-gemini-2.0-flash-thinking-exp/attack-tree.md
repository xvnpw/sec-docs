## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__high-risk__critical_.md)

* **Exploit Known Node.js Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL):**
    * Attack Vector: Attackers target publicly known vulnerabilities in Node.js dependencies used by the SSR server (e.g., Express.js, other middleware). These vulnerabilities can often be exploited to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or gain unauthorized access to the server and its data.
    * Potential Impact: Full server compromise, data breaches, ability to manipulate application logic and serve malicious content.
* **Inject Malicious Code via SSR Input (HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL):**
    * Attack Vector: Attackers manipulate user input or data that is processed by the SSR server and directly embedded into the rendered HTML without proper sanitization. This can lead to Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (SS-XSS) or even Remote Code Execution if the server-side templating engine is vulnerable.
    * Potential Impact: Execution of arbitrary code on the server, defacement of the application, session hijacking, and redirection of users to malicious sites.
* **Access Sensitive Server-Side Configuration (HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL):**
    * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit insecure storage or access controls for sensitive server-side configuration data such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets. This could involve accessing improperly secured configuration files, environment variables, or configuration management systems.
    * Potential Impact: Complete compromise of the application and its associated services, unauthorized access to databases and external APIs, and the ability to perform actions with elevated privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate the Build Process (HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_the_build_process__high-risk__critical_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code during Build (HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL):**
    * **Compromise Development Dependencies (HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL):**
        * Attack Vector: Attackers compromise one of the development dependencies (e.g., npm packages) used during the build process. This can be achieved through supply chain attacks, where malicious code is injected into a legitimate package, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the dependency's installation process.
        * Potential Impact: Introduction of backdoors or malicious payloads into the final application build, affecting all deployments and potentially leading to widespread compromise.
    * **Modify Build Scripts to Inject Backdoors or Malicious Payloads (HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL):**
        * Attack Vector: Attackers gain unauthorized access to the project's build scripts (e.g., `package.json` scripts, Webpack configuration files) and modify them to inject malicious code or download and execute external payloads during the build process.
        * Potential Impact: Insertion of persistent backdoors into the application, allowing for remote access and control, or the injection of code to steal sensitive information.
* **Access Environment Variables or Configuration Files Containing Secrets (during build) (HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL):**
    * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the build environment to access environment variables or configuration files that contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets.
    * Potential Impact: Exposure of critical secrets, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to backend services, databases, and other resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses__critical_.md)

* **Access Sensitive Client-Side Configuration (HIGH-RISK):**
    * **Retrieve API Keys or Tokens Stored Insecurely in Client-Side Code (HIGH-RISK):**
        * Attack Vector: Attackers directly retrieve API keys, authentication tokens, or other sensitive information that is mistakenly stored directly in the client-side codebase (e.g., within JavaScript files, environment files accessible to the client, or hardcoded in the HTML).
        * Potential Impact: Unauthorized access to backend APIs and services, impersonation of legitimate users, and the ability to perform actions on their behalf.
