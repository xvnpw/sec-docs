## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker's Goal: Gain Unauthorized Access/Disrupt Service (Critical)](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal_gain_unauthorized_accessdisrupt_service__critical_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** High (This is the ultimate goal of many attackers).
*   **Impact:** High (Complete system compromise, data theft, service disruption).
*   **Effort:** Variable (Depends on the specific attack path).
*   **Skill Level:** Variable (Ranges from low to high, depending on the attack).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable (Some attacks are stealthy, others are noisy).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build/Deployment Process (High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_builddeployment_process__high_risk_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires access to build tools or configuration, but these are often less protected than production systems).
*   **Impact:** High (Can lead to persistent compromise of the application).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of the build process and potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in CI/CD systems).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (Requires knowledge of build tools, scripting, and potentially CI/CD exploitation).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Build logs and version control history can reveal tampering, but sophisticated attackers can cover their tracks).

    *   **Tamper with Build Config (High Risk):**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires access to source code or build server).
        *   **Impact:** High (Can inject malicious code into the application).
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of build configuration files).
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Requires knowledge of build tools and scripting).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Changes to configuration files can be detected through version control and code reviews, but subtle changes might be missed).

        *   **Modify Webpack Config Files (High Risk):**
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires access to the build configuration).
            *   **Impact:** High (Can inject malicious code, modify build output, or expose sensitive information).
            *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of Webpack configuration).
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (Requires knowledge of Webpack and JavaScript).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Requires careful review of Webpack configuration changes and monitoring of build output).
            *   **Modify Webpack to Serve Malicious Code:** This is a specific, high-impact scenario. The attacker could modify the Webpack configuration to include a malicious loader or plugin that injects malicious code into the application bundle. This code could then be executed in the user's browser, leading to XSS, data theft, or other attacks.

        *   **Modify NPM Scripts (High Risk):**
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires access to `package.json` or other build scripts).
            *   **Impact:** High (Can execute arbitrary commands during the build process).
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires basic scripting knowledge).
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Depending on the complexity of the malicious script).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Changes to `package.json` can be detected through version control, but the execution of malicious scripts might be harder to detect).
            *   **Modify NPM Scripts to Execute Malicious Code:** The attacker could add a preinstall, postinstall, or other script that downloads and executes a malicious payload. This could be used to install backdoors, steal credentials, or perform other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Runtime Dependencies/Architecture (Critical)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_runtime_dependenciesarchitecture__critical_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** High (Applications often have many dependencies, increasing the attack surface).
*   **Impact:** High (Can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system).
*   **Effort:** Low to High (Varies greatly depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Skill Level:** Low to High (Ranges from script kiddies using known exploits to sophisticated attackers developing zero-days).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Requires vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection systems, and potentially manual code review).

    *   **Dependency Vulnerability (High Risk):**
        *   **Likelihood:** High (Given the number of dependencies, the probability of one having a vulnerability is high).
        *   **Impact:** High (Can range from minor information disclosure to complete system compromise).
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploiting known vulnerabilities is often easy; finding new ones is harder).
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to High (Exploiting known vulnerabilities requires minimal skill; finding new ones requires advanced skills).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Vulnerability scanners can detect known vulnerabilities, but zero-days are harder to detect).
            *   **Old Dependency:** Using an outdated version with known vulnerabilities.  Likelihood: Medium-High, Impact: High, Effort: Low, Skill: Low, Detection: Medium.
            *   **Transitive Dependency Vulnerability:** A vulnerability in a dependency's dependency. Likelihood: High, Impact: High, Effort: Low-Medium, Skill: Low-Medium, Detection: Medium-High.
            *   **Typosquatting Dependency:**  Installing a malicious package with a similar name. Likelihood: Low-Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill: Medium, Detection: Medium.

    *   **Ngrx Store Vulnerability (High Risk):** (If Ngrx is used)
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the complexity of the state management and how well it's secured).
        *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to unauthorized access to data and functionality).
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of Ngrx and the application's state management logic).
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (Requires knowledge of Ngrx and potentially advanced JavaScript skills).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to detect without specific monitoring of state changes and action dispatching).
            *   **State Manipulation:** Directly modifying the store's state. Likelihood: Low-Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium-High, Skill: High, Detection: High.
            *   **Action Hijacking:** Intercepting or modifying dispatched actions. Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill: Medium-High, Detection: High.

    *   **Electron Vulnerability (High Risk):** (If Electron is used)
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Electron has a history of vulnerabilities, but many are patched quickly).
        *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine).
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of Electron's security model and potential vulnerabilities).
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (Requires knowledge of Electron and potentially native code exploitation).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Requires monitoring of system calls and network traffic).
            *   **IPC Abuse:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in inter-process communication. Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium-High, Skill: High, Detection: High.
            *   **File Access:** Gaining unauthorized access to files on the user's system. Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill: Medium, Detection: Medium.

    *   **NativeScript Vulnerability (High Risk):** (If NativeScript is used)
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Similar to Electron, NativeScript has its own set of potential vulnerabilities).
        *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's device).
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of NativeScript's security model and potential vulnerabilities).
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High (Requires knowledge of NativeScript and potentially native code exploitation).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Requires monitoring of system calls and network traffic).
            *   **Plugin Vulnerability:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party plugins. Likelihood: Medium-High, Impact: High, Effort: Low-Medium, Skill: Low-Medium, Detection: Medium.
            *   **Code Injection:** Injecting malicious code into the NativeScript runtime. Likelihood: Low-Medium, Impact: High, Effort: High, Skill: High, Detection: High.
