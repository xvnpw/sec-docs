# Attack Surface Analysis for nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced

## Attack Surface: [1. Outdated Angular Framework & Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/1__outdated_angular_framework_&_dependencies.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities in the Angular framework or its associated libraries (e.g., `@angular/*` packages, RxJS, third-party UI components) that are part of the seed's dependency tree.
*How angular-seed-advanced Contributes:* The seed *directly* defines a specific set of dependencies, including a particular Angular version. The seed's complexity can make updates more challenging, increasing the likelihood of running outdated versions.
*Example:* A known vulnerability in an older version of `@angular/core` (specified by the seed) allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE) via crafted template expressions.
*Impact:* Complete application compromise, data theft, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (if a known RCE exists in the specified version), **High** (for other significant vulnerabilities in the specified versions).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update all dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`. Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities. Pin dependencies to specific *patch* versions only after thorough testing. Subscribe to Angular security announcements. Consider using automated dependency update tools (e.g., Dependabot). Prioritize updating the Angular framework itself.

## Attack Surface: [2. Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries (Included in the Seed)](./attack_surfaces/2__vulnerable_third-party_libraries__included_in_the_seed_.md)

*Description:* Security flaws in external Angular libraries that are *directly included* as dependencies in the `angular-seed-advanced` project (not just libraries that *could* be used).
*How angular-seed-advanced Contributes:* The seed *directly* includes specific third-party libraries (e.g., ngrx, potentially UI component libraries). The vulnerability of these *included* libraries is a direct consequence of the seed's choices.
*Example:* The seed includes a specific version of a UI component library that has a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*Impact:* Data theft, session hijacking, defacement, phishing attacks.
*Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (depending on the included library and the specific vulnerability).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update all third-party libraries that are *part of the seed* to their latest secure versions. Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit`. Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool. If a vulnerable library is included and no update is available, consider *removing* it from the seed and finding a secure alternative.

## Attack Surface: [3. ngrx State Management Issues (Due to Seed's Architecture)](./attack_surfaces/3__ngrx_state_management_issues__due_to_seed's_architecture_.md)

*Description:* Logic errors or vulnerabilities related to the *specific implementation* of ngrx/store and ngrx/effects within the `angular-seed-advanced` architecture.
*How angular-seed-advanced Contributes:* The seed's architecture *heavily relies* on ngrx and provides a specific structure for its use. Flaws in *this specific structure* are directly attributable to the seed.
*Example:* The seed's default ngrx setup allows for an action to be dispatched that bypasses security checks defined in the seed's example code, leading to unauthorized state modification.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access to data or functionality, application instability.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (if sensitive data or critical functionality is managed by the seed's ngrx implementation).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Thoroughly review and understand the seed's ngrx implementation. Ensure that the seed's example code and structure adhere to ngrx best practices. Test all actions, reducers, and effects *as implemented by the seed*, including edge cases and malicious input. Use the Redux DevTools to monitor state changes. If modifying the seed's ngrx structure, ensure the changes maintain security.

## Attack Surface: [4. Build Process Exposure (Specific to Seed's Configuration)](./attack_surfaces/4__build_process_exposure__specific_to_seed's_configuration_.md)

*Description:* Sensitive information (API keys, environment variables) leaked due to misconfigurations in the *specific* Webpack and build configuration provided by `angular-seed-advanced`.
*How angular-seed-advanced Contributes:* The seed provides a *pre-configured* Webpack setup. Any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in *this specific setup* are directly attributable to the seed.
*Example:* The seed's default Webpack configuration accidentally includes a `.env` file or hardcoded API key in the production bundle.
*Impact:* Compromise of backend services, data theft.
*Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (depending on the exposed information).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Carefully review the *entire* Webpack configuration provided by the seed. Ensure that the seed's configuration does *not* include any sensitive information in the production bundle. Verify that the seed's `.gitignore` file correctly excludes sensitive files. Use `source-map-explorer` to inspect the production bundle generated by the seed's configuration. If modifying the seed's build process, ensure the changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities.
