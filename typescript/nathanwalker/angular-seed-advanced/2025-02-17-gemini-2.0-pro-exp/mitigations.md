# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Auditing and Updates (Focused on Seed Dependencies)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_auditing_and_updates__focused_on_seed_dependencies_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Integrate Audit Tool:** Add a dependency auditing tool (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to the CI/CD pipeline.  This is done by adding a script to the `package.json` (e.g., `"audit": "npm audit --audit-level=high"`) and configuring the CI/CD system (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.) to run this script on every build/push. *Focus specifically on the dependencies listed in the seed project's `package.json`*.
2.  **Configure Thresholds:** Set severity thresholds for the audit tool. Configure `npm audit` to fail the build if vulnerabilities with a severity of "high" or "critical" are found *within the seed's dependencies*.
3.  **Automated Updates (Optional, Seed-Specific):** Consider using Dependabot or similar tools, configured to *only* target the dependencies defined in the `angular-seed-advanced` `package.json`. Carefully review these PRs.
4.  **Manual Updates (Seed-Specific):** Establish a schedule (e.g., monthly) for manually reviewing and updating *only the seed project's dependencies*, even if no vulnerabilities are reported. Use `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated`, focusing on the packages listed in the seed's `package.json`.
5.  **Testing:** After any dependency update *related to the seed*, run thorough automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure no regressions were introduced.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Seed Dependencies (High Severity):** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the specific libraries included in `angular-seed-advanced` (Angular, RxJS, ngrx, etc.) can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, etc.
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Seed Dependencies (High Severity):** Zero-day vulnerabilities in the seed's core dependencies pose a significant risk.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Seed Dependencies (Medium Severity):** Attackers might target the specific dependencies used by the seed project.

**Impact:**
*   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: High (directly addresses vulnerabilities in the seed's dependencies).
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: Medium (reduces the window of exposure for seed-specific dependencies).
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk reduction: Medium (increases the chance of early detection for attacks on seed dependencies).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially. `angular-seed-advanced` includes a `package-lock.json`, which helps with reproducible builds.  However, it does *not* include automated auditing or update mechanisms specifically targeting its own dependencies.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Automated auditing tools are not integrated, and no scripts are present to specifically audit the seed's dependencies.
*   No scheduled manual update process focused on the seed's dependencies is defined.
*   No automated update mechanisms are configured to target only the seed's dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure ngrx State Management (Seed-Specific Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ngrx_state_management__seed-specific_usage_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Minimize Sensitive Data (in Seed's State Structure):**  Review the *specific* state structure defined within the `angular-seed-advanced` project (if any example state is provided) and ensure no sensitive data is stored there by default.  Provide clear documentation and examples *within the seed project* on how to avoid storing sensitive data in the ngrx store.
2.  **JWT Handling (Guidance within Seed):**  If the seed project includes any authentication examples, provide *explicit* guidance and example code *within the seed* on how to securely handle JWTs (preferably using HTTP-only cookies).  If local storage is demonstrated, show how to use a secure storage mechanism.
3.  **State Sanitization (Example in Seed):**  Include examples *within the seed project* demonstrating how to use Angular's `DomSanitizer` to sanitize data retrieved from the ngrx store before displaying it in the UI.
4.  **State Change Logging (Optional, Seed-Specific):**  If the seed project includes any complex state interactions, consider adding an example of ngrx middleware or a custom effect to log state changes for debugging and auditing purposes.
5.  **Disable Devtools in Production (Explicit in Seed):**  *Explicitly* demonstrate and document *within the seed project* how to conditionally include `StoreDevtoolsModule` only in development builds using Angular's environment configuration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Leakage from Seed's Example State (Medium Severity):** If the seed project includes example state that stores sensitive data insecurely, developers might copy this pattern.
*   **State Manipulation (in Seed's Context) (Medium Severity):** Attackers could try to manipulate the state structure defined or demonstrated within the seed project.
*   **XSS via Seed's State (Medium Severity):** If the seed's example state includes unsanitized data, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduction: High (if the seed project provides secure examples and guidance).
*   **State Manipulation:** Risk reduction: Medium (secure examples and logging make manipulation harder).
*   **XSS via State:** Risk reduction: High (sanitization examples prevent XSS).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially. `angular-seed-advanced` uses ngrx, but the level of security guidance and examples provided within the seed project itself may vary.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Explicit guidance and examples within the seed project on secure JWT handling may be missing.
*   State sanitization examples may not be included.
*   State change logging examples are likely not present.
*   The conditional disabling of `StoreDevtoolsModule` needs to be explicitly demonstrated and documented *within the seed*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Webpack Build Process (Seed's Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_webpack_build_process__seed's_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Webpack Configuration Review (Seed's `webpack.config.js`):**  Thoroughly review the `webpack.config.js` file (and any related configuration files) *provided by the `angular-seed-advanced` project* for security best practices. Ensure that:
    *   Code splitting is used effectively (as provided by the seed).
    *   No sensitive data is hardcoded in the seed's configuration.
    *   Source maps are disabled or configured securely for production builds *in the seed's configuration*.
2.  **Plugin Vetting (Seed's Plugins):**  Carefully review any Webpack plugins *included by default in the `angular-seed-advanced` project*. Ensure they are from reputable sources and are actively maintained.
3.  **CSP Implementation (Example in Seed):**  Provide an example *within the seed project* of how to implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) using the `<meta>` tag or HTTP headers.
4.  **SRI Implementation (Example in Seed):** Provide an example and instructions *within the seed project* on how to generate and use Subresource Integrity (SRI) tags for externally loaded scripts and stylesheets. This could involve adding a script to the seed's build process.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Build-Time Code Injection (via Seed's Configuration) (Medium Severity):** Vulnerabilities in the Webpack configuration or plugins *included in the seed* could allow code injection.
*   **Dependency Tampering (of Seed's Dependencies) (Medium Severity):** Attackers could compromise a dependency used by the seed. SRI helps.
*   **XSS via Seed's Build Process (Low Severity):** Misconfigurations in the seed's build process could introduce XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   **Build-Time Code Injection:** Risk reduction: Medium (reviewing the seed's configuration and vetting its plugins reduces risk).
*   **Dependency Tampering:** Risk reduction: High (SRI, if implemented in the seed, prevents execution of tampered files).
*   **XSS via Build Process:** Risk reduction: Low (CSP and secure configuration in the seed provide some protection).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially. `angular-seed-advanced` provides a Webpack configuration, but it may not include security features like CSP or SRI by default.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A default CSP example is likely not provided within the seed.
*   SRI generation and usage examples are likely not included in the seed.
*   Explicit security review guidance for the seed's Webpack configuration is needed.
