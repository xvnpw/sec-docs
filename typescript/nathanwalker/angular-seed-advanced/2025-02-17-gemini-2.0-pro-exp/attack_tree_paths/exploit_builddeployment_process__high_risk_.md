# Deep Analysis of "Exploit Build/Deployment Process" Attack Tree Path

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the "Exploit Build/Deployment Process" attack path, specifically focusing on the sub-path leading to "Modify Webpack to Serve Malicious Code" and "Modify NPM Scripts to Execute Malicious Code" within the context of an application built using the `angular-seed-advanced` framework.  The goal is to identify specific vulnerabilities, propose concrete mitigation strategies, and enhance the overall security posture of the application's build and deployment pipeline.  We will also assess the feasibility and impact of these attacks, considering the specific tools and configurations used in the `angular-seed-advanced` project.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the following attack path:

**Exploit Build/Deployment Process** -> **Tamper with Build Config** -> **Modify Webpack Config Files** -> **Modify Webpack to Serve Malicious Code**
**Exploit Build/Deployment Process** -> **Tamper with Build Config** -> **Modify NPM Scripts** -> **Modify NPM Scripts to Execute Malicious Code**

We will focus on the following aspects of the `angular-seed-advanced` project:

*   **Webpack Configuration:**  Files like `webpack.config.js`, `webpack.dev.js`, `webpack.prod.js`, and any custom Webpack configurations within the project.
*   **NPM Scripts:**  The `scripts` section within the `package.json` file, and any related scripts called from within.
*   **Build Environment:**  The environment where the build process takes place (e.g., developer machines, CI/CD servers).
*   **Dependencies:**  The npm packages used by the project, particularly those involved in the build process.

We will *not* cover:

*   Attacks targeting the production runtime environment (e.g., server-side vulnerabilities).
*   Attacks that do not involve modifying the build process (e.g., phishing attacks against developers).
*   Attacks on third-party services not directly related to the build process.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the relevant Webpack configuration files and NPM scripts within a representative `angular-seed-advanced` project setup.  We will look for common vulnerabilities and insecure configurations.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Examination of the project's dependencies (using tools like `npm audit`, `snyk`, or similar) to identify known vulnerabilities in build-related packages.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Consideration of various attacker scenarios and their potential impact on the build process.  This includes thinking like an attacker to identify potential entry points and attack vectors.
4.  **Best Practice Review:**  Comparison of the project's build configuration and practices against industry best practices for secure build pipelines.
5.  **Documentation Review:**  Review of the `angular-seed-advanced` documentation to understand the intended build process and security recommendations.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1.  Modify Webpack to Serve Malicious Code

**4.1.1. Attack Scenario:**

An attacker gains access to the project's source code repository (e.g., through a compromised developer account, a misconfigured Git server, or a supply chain attack on a development tool).  They modify the Webpack configuration to inject malicious JavaScript code.  This could be achieved in several ways:

*   **Malicious Loader:**  Adding a custom Webpack loader that transforms legitimate JavaScript files to include malicious code.  For example, a loader could prepend a script tag that loads a remote script from an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Malicious Plugin:**  Creating or modifying a Webpack plugin to inject code during the compilation process.  Plugins have broad access to the compilation lifecycle and can manipulate the output in various ways.
*   **Code Injection in Existing Configuration:**  Subtly modifying existing configuration options, such as `entry` points, `output` paths, or `devServer` settings, to include or load malicious code.  For example, changing the `devServer.contentBase` to point to a directory containing a malicious `index.html`.
*   **Dependency Manipulation:**  Modifying the `package.json` to include a compromised or malicious npm package that acts as a Webpack loader or plugin. This is a supply chain attack.

**4.1.2.  Specific Vulnerabilities in `angular-seed-advanced` (Potential):**

*   **Overly Permissive Loaders:**  If the Webpack configuration uses wildcard patterns for loaders (e.g., `/\.js$/`) without proper sanitization or checks, a malicious loader could be introduced more easily.
*   **Complex Custom Plugins:**  `angular-seed-advanced` might use custom Webpack plugins for advanced features.  These plugins, if not carefully reviewed and secured, could be vulnerable to code injection.
*   **Unpinned Dependencies:**  If the project doesn't use strict version pinning for its dependencies (e.g., using `^` or `~` in `package.json`), it could be vulnerable to dependency confusion attacks, where a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency is installed.
*   **Lack of Code Signing:** Webpack itself doesn't natively support code signing. Without additional measures, it's difficult to verify the integrity of the build output.

**4.1.3. Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strict Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory code reviews for *all* changes to Webpack configuration files.  These reviews should be performed by developers with a strong understanding of Webpack and security best practices.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:**  Ensure that the build process runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running builds as root or with overly broad file system access.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` regularly:**  Scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Pin Dependencies:**  Use exact versions (e.g., `1.2.3` instead of `^1.2.3`) in `package.json` to prevent unexpected updates.  Consider using a `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file to ensure consistent builds.
    *   **Vet Dependencies:**  Carefully review the source code and reputation of any new dependencies, especially those related to the build process.
    *   **Private NPM Registry:** Consider using a private npm registry to host internal packages and reduce the risk of dependency confusion attacks.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP in the application's HTML to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded.  This can mitigate the impact of XSS attacks, even if malicious code is injected into the bundle.
*   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Use SRI attributes on `<script>` tags to ensure that the browser only executes scripts with a specific, known hash.  This can prevent the execution of modified or malicious scripts.  Webpack plugins can automate SRI generation.
*   **Build Integrity Verification:**  Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of the build output before deployment.  This could involve generating a hash of the build artifacts and comparing it to a known good hash.
*   **CI/CD Security:**
    *   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:**  Protect the CI/CD system itself from unauthorized access.  Use strong authentication, access controls, and regular security audits.
    *   **Isolated Build Environments:**  Run builds in isolated environments (e.g., containers) to prevent cross-contamination and limit the impact of compromised builds.
    *   **Automated Security Scanning:**  Integrate security scanning tools (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerabilities.
* **Webpack Configuration Hardening:**
    * **Avoid inline scripts in webpack config:** Use external files for complex logic.
    * **Validate user inputs in webpack config:** If any part of the config is derived from user input (highly unlikely, but good practice), sanitize it thoroughly.
    * **Use `webpack-bundle-analyzer`:** Regularly analyze the bundle to identify any unexpected or large dependencies.

### 4.2. Modify NPM Scripts to Execute Malicious Code

**4.2.1. Attack Scenario:**

An attacker gains access to the project's source code and modifies the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.  They add or modify scripts to execute arbitrary commands during the build process.  Examples:

*   **Preinstall/Postinstall Scripts:**  Adding a `preinstall` or `postinstall` script that downloads and executes a malicious script from a remote server.  These scripts run automatically when `npm install` is executed.
*   **Build Script Modification:**  Modifying the existing `build` script (or other scripts used in the build process) to include malicious commands.  For example, adding a command to exfiltrate environment variables or copy sensitive files.
*   **Dependency-Based Execution:**  Adding a dependency that has a malicious `preinstall` or `postinstall` script. This is another form of supply chain attack.

**4.2.2. Specific Vulnerabilities in `angular-seed-advanced` (Potential):**

*   **Complex Build Scripts:**  `angular-seed-advanced` likely has a complex set of NPM scripts for building, testing, and deploying the application.  The more complex the scripts, the greater the chance of introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Unnecessary Scripts:**  The project might contain unused or unnecessary scripts that could be exploited by an attacker.
*   **Implicit Script Execution:**  Developers might not be fully aware of all the scripts that are executed during the build process, especially those triggered by dependencies.

**4.2.3. Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review all changes to the `package.json` file, paying close attention to the `scripts` section.
*   **Least Privilege:**  Run `npm install` and build scripts with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **`--ignore-scripts` Flag:**  Use the `--ignore-scripts` flag with `npm install` when you don't need to run pre/postinstall scripts (e.g., when installing dependencies in a production environment).  This is a crucial defense against malicious scripts in dependencies.  However, be aware that this might break some legitimate packages that rely on these scripts for setup.
*   **Audit and Review Dependencies:**  As with Webpack, carefully vet all dependencies and use tools like `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Sandboxing:**  Consider running build scripts in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container) to limit their access to the host system.
*   **Script Whitelisting:**  If possible, implement a mechanism to whitelist allowed NPM scripts.  This is a more advanced technique that requires careful configuration.
*   **CI/CD Security:**  The same CI/CD security measures mentioned for Webpack apply here as well.  Secure the CI/CD pipeline and use isolated build environments.
* **Regularly review `package.json`:** Look for any unusual or unexpected scripts.
* **Use a tool like `npm-safe-install`:** This tool can help prevent the execution of malicious `preinstall` and `postinstall` scripts.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Exploit Build/Deployment Process" attack path presents a significant risk to applications built using `angular-seed-advanced`.
