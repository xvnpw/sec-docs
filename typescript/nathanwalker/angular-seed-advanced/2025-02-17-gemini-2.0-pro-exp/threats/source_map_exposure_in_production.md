Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Source Map Exposure in Production" threat for an application built using the `angular-seed-advanced` framework.

## Deep Analysis: Source Map Exposure in Production

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with source map exposure in a production environment for applications built using `angular-seed-advanced`.  We aim to identify the specific mechanisms that could lead to this exposure, assess the potential impact, and refine mitigation strategies beyond the basic recommendations.  We will also consider the specific configurations and tools used within `angular-seed-advanced` that are relevant to this threat.

**Scope:**

This analysis will focus on the following areas:

*   **Build Process:**  Specifically, how Webpack (as used by Angular CLI and configured within `angular-seed-advanced`) handles source map generation and inclusion in the build output.  We'll examine the relevant configuration files (e.g., `webpack.config.js`, `angular.json`, and potentially custom build scripts).
*   **Deployment Process:** How the built artifacts are deployed to the production environment.  This includes the web server configuration (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or cloud-based hosting services) and any deployment scripts or pipelines.
*   **`angular-seed-advanced` Specifics:**  We'll investigate any custom configurations or build processes within `angular-seed-advanced` that might deviate from standard Angular CLI practices and potentially introduce unique vulnerabilities related to source maps.
*   **Client-Side Impact:**  How an attacker would discover and utilize exposed source maps.
*   **Server-Side Impact:** How the exposure of source maps could be used to find server-side vulnerabilities.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the `angular-seed-advanced` codebase, focusing on build-related files and configurations.  We'll look for default settings, potential overrides, and any custom scripts that might affect source map generation.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Analyze the default and recommended configurations for Webpack, Angular CLI, and common web servers (Apache, Nginx) to understand how source maps are handled.
3.  **Experimentation:**  Create a test project using `angular-seed-advanced` and deliberately configure it to expose source maps.  This will allow us to observe the behavior firsthand and test detection and exploitation techniques.
4.  **Documentation Review:**  Consult the official documentation for Angular CLI, Webpack, and `angular-seed-advanced` to identify best practices and potential pitfalls related to source maps.
5.  **Threat Modeling:**  Use the information gathered to refine the threat model and identify specific attack vectors.
6.  **Vulnerability Research:** Check for any known vulnerabilities or common misconfigurations related to source map exposure in Angular applications or the underlying tools.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1.  How Source Maps are Generated and Included (Webpack & Angular CLI)**

*   **Webpack's Role:** Webpack is the core build tool used by Angular CLI.  It bundles JavaScript, CSS, and other assets.  The `devtool` option in the Webpack configuration controls source map generation.  Different values for `devtool` provide varying levels of detail and performance trade-offs.  Common options include:
    *   `source-map`:  Generates full, separate source map files (`.js.map`).  Best for debugging, but should *never* be used in production.
    *   `hidden-source-map`:  Generates source maps but doesn't include a reference comment in the bundled JavaScript file.  This is *still* a risk if the attacker knows to look for `.map` files.
    *   `inline-source-map`:  Embeds the source map as a Data URL within the bundled JavaScript file.  This is also a high risk in production.
    *   `eval-source-map`:  A faster option for development, but still exposes significant information.
    *   `none` (or omitting `devtool`):  Disables source map generation.  This is the recommended setting for production.

*   **Angular CLI's Abstraction:** Angular CLI provides a higher-level abstraction over Webpack.  The `angular.json` file (or older `angular-cli.json`) configures build options, including source maps.  The `--source-map` flag (or the `sourceMap` option in `angular.json`) controls source map generation.  By default, Angular CLI *does* generate source maps for development builds (`ng serve`) but *should not* generate them for production builds (`ng build --prod`).  However, this relies on the correct configuration.

*   **`angular-seed-advanced` Customizations:** This is where the specific risk with `angular-seed-advanced` comes into play.  It's crucial to examine how this seed project modifies the default Angular CLI build process.  Potential areas of concern include:
    *   **Custom Webpack Configurations:**  `angular-seed-advanced` might include custom Webpack configuration files that override the default Angular CLI settings.  These files need to be carefully reviewed for any `devtool` settings that might enable source maps in production.
    *   **Build Scripts:**  The project might have custom build scripts (e.g., in `package.json`) that bypass or modify the standard `ng build` command.  These scripts could inadvertently include source maps.
    *   **Environment-Specific Configurations:**  `angular-seed-advanced` likely has different configurations for development, staging, and production environments.  It's essential to ensure that the production configuration explicitly disables source maps.

**2.2. Deployment and Web Server Configuration**

*   **Deployment Process:**  The deployment process determines how the built files are transferred to the production server.  If source maps are present in the build output, they will be deployed unless explicitly excluded.
*   **Web Server Configuration:**  The web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) serves the files to the client.  By default, web servers will serve any file present in the webroot.  Therefore, if source map files are present, they will be accessible.
    *   **Apache:**  `.htaccess` files or the main Apache configuration can be used to block access to `.map` files.
    *   **Nginx:**  The `nginx.conf` file can be configured to deny access to `.map` files using `location` blocks.
    *   **Cloud Hosting:**  Cloud providers (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) often have their own mechanisms for controlling access to files.  These need to be configured to prevent public access to source maps.

**2.3. Attacker's Perspective**

*   **Discovery:** An attacker can easily discover source maps by:
    *   **Inspecting Network Requests:** Using browser developer tools (Network tab), an attacker can see all files loaded by the application.  `.map` files will be clearly visible.
    *   **Checking for Source Map Comments:**  The bundled JavaScript files might contain a comment like `//# sourceMappingURL=app.js.map` at the end, pointing to the source map file.  Even without this comment, an attacker might try appending `.map` to JavaScript file URLs.
    *   **Automated Tools:**  Tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP can be used to automatically scan for and identify source maps.

*   **Exploitation:** Once an attacker has the source maps, they can:
    *   **Reconstruct the Original Code:**  Source maps allow the attacker to see the original TypeScript code, including comments, variable names, and function logic.  This makes it much easier to understand the application's inner workings.
    *   **Identify Vulnerabilities:**  The original code might reveal vulnerabilities that would be difficult to find in the minified JavaScript.  This could include:
        *   **Logic Flaws:**  Errors in the application's logic that could be exploited.
        *   **Hardcoded Secrets:**  API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information that were mistakenly included in the code.
        *   **Debugging Code:**  Leftover debugging code that could expose internal information or provide attack vectors.
        *   **Third-Party Library Usage:**  The source maps can reveal which third-party libraries are used, and the attacker can then look for known vulnerabilities in those libraries.
    *   **Intellectual Property Theft:**  The attacker can steal the application's source code, potentially using it to create a competing product or to understand proprietary algorithms.

**2.4. Server-Side Implications**

While source maps primarily expose client-side code, this information can be used to indirectly compromise the server:

*   **API Endpoint Discovery:** Source maps can reveal the structure and endpoints of the application's API.  This information can be used to craft targeted attacks against the server.
*   **Understanding Authentication and Authorization:**  The client-side code might reveal how authentication and authorization are handled, potentially exposing weaknesses that can be exploited to bypass security measures.
*   **Identifying Server-Side Technologies:**  The client-side code might provide clues about the server-side technologies used (e.g., specific frameworks, libraries, or database interactions), allowing the attacker to focus their efforts on known vulnerabilities in those technologies.

### 3. Refined Mitigation Strategies

Based on the deep analysis, we can refine the mitigation strategies:

1.  **Ensure Production Builds Disable Source Maps:**
    *   **Verify `angular.json`:**  Confirm that the `production` configuration in `angular.json` has `sourceMap` set to `false` (or the equivalent setting for older Angular CLI versions).
    *   **Check Custom Webpack Configs:**  Thoroughly review any custom Webpack configuration files in `angular-seed-advanced` and ensure that `devtool` is set to `none` (or omitted) for production builds.
    *   **Inspect Build Scripts:**  Examine any custom build scripts in `package.json` or other locations and ensure they don't override the `--source-map=false` flag or introduce other mechanisms for generating source maps.

2.  **Web Server Configuration:**
    *   **Apache:**  Add the following to your `.htaccess` file or Apache configuration:

        ```apache
        <FilesMatch "\.map$">
            Order allow,deny
            Deny from all
        </FilesMatch>
        ```

    *   **Nginx:**  Add the following to your `nginx.conf` file within the relevant `server` block:

        ```nginx
        location ~ /\.map$ {
            deny all;
        }
        ```

    *   **Cloud Hosting:**  Configure your cloud provider's access control settings to deny public access to `.map` files.

3.  **Deployment Process:**
    *   **Exclude Source Maps:**  Modify your deployment scripts or pipelines to explicitly exclude `.map` files from being deployed to the production environment.  This provides an extra layer of defense even if source maps are accidentally generated.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Automated Scanning:**  Use automated security scanning tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or specialized source map scanners) to regularly check your production environment for exposed source maps.
    *   **Manual Inspection:**  Periodically inspect the deployed application using browser developer tools to ensure that source maps are not accessible.

5.  **Code Review and Training:**
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Include source map checks as part of your code review process.  Ensure that developers understand the risks of source map exposure and the importance of disabling them in production.
    *   **Security Training:**  Provide security training to developers that covers source map exposure and other common web application vulnerabilities.

6.  **Consider Obfuscation (as a secondary measure):** While not a replacement for disabling source maps, code obfuscation can make it more difficult for an attacker to understand the decompiled code even if they obtain the source maps. However, obfuscation is not foolproof and can be reversed with enough effort.

7. **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement monitoring and logging to detect unusual access patterns, such as repeated requests for `.map` files, which could indicate an attacker attempting to discover source maps.

By implementing these refined mitigation strategies, you can significantly reduce the risk of source map exposure in your `angular-seed-advanced` application and protect your intellectual property and application security. Remember that security is a layered approach, and combining multiple mitigation techniques provides the best defense.
