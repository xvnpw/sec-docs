# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Audits and Updates (Seed Project Dependencies)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_audits_and_updates__seed_project_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `npm audit` or `yarn audit`:**  `angular-seed-advanced` uses `npm` or `yarn` for dependency management. Regularly run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` commands in the project directory to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies (including transitive dependencies brought in by `angular-seed-advanced`).
    2.  **Review audit reports specific to seed dependencies:** Carefully examine the audit reports, paying close attention to vulnerabilities reported in the dependencies that are part of the `angular-seed-advanced` project's initial setup (e.g., Angular libraries, RxJS, testing frameworks, build tools).
    3.  **Update vulnerable seed dependencies:** Prioritize updating vulnerable dependencies that are directly included or heavily relied upon by `angular-seed-advanced`. Follow standard update procedures, testing changes thoroughly.
    4.  **Monitor for new vulnerabilities in seed dependencies:** Continuously monitor for new vulnerability disclosures affecting the specific set of dependencies used by `angular-seed-advanced` and repeat the audit and update process as needed.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Seed Project Dependencies (High Severity):** `angular-seed-advanced` pre-packages a set of dependencies. If these dependencies become outdated and contain vulnerabilities, applications built upon this seed are directly at risk. Exploitable vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, application compromise, and other security incidents.
    *   **Supply Chain Risks from Seed Project Dependencies (Medium Severity):**  If any of the dependencies included in `angular-seed-advanced` are compromised at their source, applications using the seed could inherit malicious code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Seed Project Dependencies:** High risk reduction. Directly addresses vulnerabilities stemming from the seed's dependency choices.
    *   **Supply Chain Risks from Seed Project Dependencies:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the window of opportunity for exploiting known vulnerabilities in the seed's dependency tree.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. `angular-seed-advanced` uses `npm` or `yarn`, making `npm audit` and `yarn audit` commands usable. However, automated audits and proactive updates are not built-in features of the seed project itself.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated dependency auditing specific to the seed project's dependency set is not configured.
    *   No explicit guidance within `angular-seed-advanced` documentation specifically highlights the importance of regularly auditing and updating the *seed project's* dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Webpack Configuration (Seed Project's Build Tool)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_webpack_configuration__seed_project's_build_tool_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review and Harden Seed Project's Webpack Configuration:** `angular-seed-advanced` relies on Webpack for bundling. Thoroughly review the Webpack configuration files provided by the seed project (likely found in configuration directories or build scripts).
    2.  **Disable Source Maps in Production (Seed Configuration):** Ensure the Webpack configuration for production builds, as set up by `angular-seed-advanced`, explicitly disables or appropriately configures source map generation to prevent accidental exposure in production environments.
    3.  **Verify Production Optimizations (Seed Configuration):** Confirm that the seed project's Webpack configuration enables necessary production optimizations like code minification, tree shaking, and code splitting to reduce bundle size and complexity, making reverse engineering slightly harder.
    4.  **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) via Webpack (Seed Configuration Extension):**  Extend the seed project's Webpack configuration to include a plugin (if not already present) that generates and injects a Content Security Policy (CSP) header. Configure CSP rules appropriate for your application's needs to mitigate XSS risks. This might involve modifying the seed's build scripts or Webpack configuration files.
    5.  **Audit Webpack Loaders and Plugins (Seed Project Defaults):**  Examine the Webpack loaders and plugins pre-configured by `angular-seed-advanced`. Ensure they are from reputable sources and configured securely. Be aware of potential vulnerabilities in Webpack loaders and plugins themselves.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Source Maps (Medium Severity):** If the seed project's default Webpack configuration inadvertently includes source maps in production builds, it can expose application source code.
    *   **Reverse Engineering Facilitation (Low Severity):**  Unoptimized production bundles (if not properly configured by the seed) can make it easier for attackers to understand application logic.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Lack of a Content Security Policy (CSP) in the seed project's default setup (or if not properly configured by developers using the seed) increases the risk of XSS attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Source Maps:** Medium risk reduction. Addresses potential information leakage from the seed project's build setup.
    *   **Reverse Engineering Facilitation:** Low risk reduction. Makes reverse engineering slightly more challenging based on the seed's build output.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Implementing CSP, even as an extension to the seed's configuration, significantly reduces XSS risks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. `angular-seed-advanced` likely includes a basic Webpack configuration for production with some optimizations. However, features like CSP and explicit disabling of source maps in production might not be default or fully emphasized in the seed project's documentation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP) is likely not a default feature in the seed project's Webpack configuration.
    *   Explicit and prominent guidance on hardening the seed project's Webpack configuration for security best practices (beyond basic optimizations) might be lacking in the seed project's documentation.
