## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Broken Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/1___high-risk_path__broken_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** Flaws in the implementation or configuration of authentication and authorization mechanisms. This can include weak default settings, misconfigured Auth0, or vulnerabilities in custom authentication logic.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:** If password policies are weak or rate limiting is absent, attackers can attempt to guess credentials.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** If session management is insecure, attackers can steal or forge session tokens to impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:**  Vulnerabilities in authentication logic might allow attackers to bypass login procedures entirely.
*   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, sensitive data, and application functionalities. Privilege escalation if authorization is also broken.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Review and strengthen default authentication/authorization configurations.
    *   Implement strong password policies and enforce them.
    *   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
    *   Implement robust session management with secure tokens and appropriate expiration times.
    *   Regularly audit authentication and authorization logic for vulnerabilities.
