# Attack Surface Analysis for nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SSR](./attack_surfaces/server-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_ssr.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into server-rendered HTML, leading to script execution in the user's browser.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** `angular-seed-advanced` integrates Angular Universal for Server-Side Rendering (SSR). This setup inherently introduces the risk of server-side XSS if developers fail to properly sanitize data within Angular components that are rendered on the server. The seed project's SSR implementation makes this a direct concern.
*   **Example:** A developer uses SSR to display user-generated content without proper sanitization. An attacker injects a malicious `<script>` tag into a comment. When this comment is rendered server-side and served to other users, the script executes in their browsers.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization on the server-side before rendering dynamic data into HTML within SSR components.
    *   **Angular Security Features:** Leverage Angular's built-in security context and DOM sanitization features within components to automatically handle safe rendering.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Ensure proper encoding of dynamic data based on the output context (HTML, URL, JavaScript) during server-side rendering.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on SSR components and data handling to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Utilizing outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries and packages included in the project.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** `angular-seed-advanced` defines a set of initial dependencies in its `package.json` file. If these dependencies are not regularly audited and updated, the project becomes vulnerable to known security exploits present in outdated versions. The seed project provides the initial dependency baseline, making dependency management a critical security aspect.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of a JavaScript library used by `angular-seed-advanced` (e.g., a library used for a core feature or SSR). If developers do not update this dependency, their application remains vulnerable to exploits targeting this known flaw.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, remote code execution, supply chain attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and report vulnerable dependencies within the project.
    *   **Dependency Updates:**  Proactively update dependencies to the latest secure versions as soon as updates are available, especially for critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Management Tools:** Implement and enforce a robust dependency management strategy, utilizing tools and processes to track, update, and monitor dependencies continuously.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

## Attack Surface: [Default Secret Keys and Credentials (Potential Risk)](./attack_surfaces/default_secret_keys_and_credentials__potential_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Accidentally using default or example credentials that might be present in seed project configurations or documentation.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** While `angular-seed-advanced` itself might not explicitly provide *application* secrets, seed projects *in general* can sometimes include placeholder API keys, database connection strings, or other configuration examples with default, insecure values for demonstration purposes. Developers using the seed might overlook changing these defaults before deploying to production.
*   **Example:** A configuration file within the `angular-seed-advanced` project (or related documentation) contains a placeholder API key for a demonstration service or a default database password. If a developer deploys the application without replacing these placeholder values with secure, unique credentials, attackers could potentially exploit these defaults to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, account takeover, compromised third-party service accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if default credentials provide access to sensitive resources)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Credential Review and Change:** Immediately and thoroughly review all configuration files, documentation, and example code within the `angular-seed-advanced` project for any default or placeholder credentials. Change all such defaults to strong, unique, and production-ready secrets.
    *   **Secure Secret Management:** Implement secure secret management practices from the outset. Utilize environment variables, dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or secure configuration management systems to store and manage sensitive credentials.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Strictly avoid hardcoding any secrets directly within the codebase or configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:**  Utilizing default configurations provided by the seed project that are convenient for development but insecure for production environments.
*   **How angular-seed-advanced contributes:** Like many seed projects designed for rapid development, `angular-seed-advanced` might prioritize ease of setup and development over strict security in its default configurations. Developers must review and harden these defaults for production deployments. Examples include overly permissive CORS policies, enabled debug modes, or verbose logging settings.
*   **Example:** The default CORS configuration in `angular-seed-advanced` might be set to allow requests from any origin (`*`) for development convenience. If this permissive CORS policy is not restricted for production, it could enable Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks or allow malicious websites to interact with the application's API on behalf of users.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), data breaches, information disclosure, denial of service, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration Hardening:** Systematically review and harden all default configurations provided by `angular-seed-advanced` before deploying to production. Consult security best practices and adapt configurations to a secure production posture.
    *   **Restrictive CORS Policy:** Configure a restrictive CORS policy that explicitly allows requests only from trusted and authorized origins.
    *   **Disable Debug Mode:** Ensure debug modes and verbose error logging are completely disabled in production environments.
    *   **Secure Logging Practices:** Implement secure logging practices, carefully avoiding logging sensitive information and ensuring logs are protected.
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:**  Strictly enforce HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
