# Threat Model Analysis for nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection](./threats/server-side_template_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into input fields or URLs that are processed by the server-side rendering engine provided or configured by `angular-seed-advanced`. This code is executed on the server during page rendering, potentially allowing the attacker to read server-side files, execute commands, or gain further server access.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, and severe reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** SSR Rendering Engine (likely within the server-side implementation parts of `angular-seed-advanced`, if SSR is enabled and configured).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data processed by the SSR engine.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases from the server-side rendering logic.
    *   Avoid using string interpolation directly with user-provided data in server-side templates.
    *   Regularly audit server-side rendering code for injection vulnerabilities, especially if you customize the SSR setup from `angular-seed-advanced`.

## Threat: [SSR Resource Exhaustion DoS](./threats/ssr_resource_exhaustion_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or specifically crafted requests that are computationally expensive for the SSR engine (configured by `angular-seed-advanced`) to process. This overwhelms server resources (CPU, memory), leading to slow response times or complete server unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** High. Denial of service, significantly impacting application availability and user experience.
*   **Affected Component:** SSR Middleware/Server (the server-side component of `angular-seed-advanced` responsible for handling SSR requests).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling specifically for SSR endpoints.
    *   Optimize SSR rendering logic for performance, paying attention to any SSR specific configurations within `angular-seed-advanced`.
    *   Implement caching mechanisms for frequently rendered content to reduce SSR load.
    *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes, especially related to SSR processes.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependency Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_dependency_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** `angular-seed-advanced` comes with a pre-defined set of dependencies (Angular libraries, build tools, server-side libraries if applicable) listed in `package.json`. These dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities. An attacker exploits these vulnerabilities in the application, potentially gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing data breaches.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability). Application compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `package.json`, `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`, `node_modules` (all dependencies defined and managed by `angular-seed-advanced`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit dependencies using vulnerability scanning tools (`npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) specifically targeting the dependencies defined in `angular-seed-advanced`.
    *   Keep dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches. Follow the dependency update guidance (if any) provided by `angular-seed-advanced` community.
    *   Implement a process for promptly patching or replacing vulnerable dependencies identified in the seed's dependency tree.

## Threat: [Configuration File Exposure](./threats/configuration_file_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, configuration files for SSR server) containing sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) within the project structure defined by `angular-seed-advanced` are accidentally exposed. This could happen through version control, insecure deployment practices encouraged or not explicitly prevented by the seed, or misconfigured servers. An attacker gains access to these files and extracts sensitive credentials.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full application compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to backend systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config/`, deployment scripts potentially provided or suggested by `angular-seed-advanced`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure secrets management practices (environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools) instead of relying on insecure configuration files directly committed in the project.
    *   Ensure configuration files containing secrets are explicitly excluded from version control (use `.gitignore` and verify it includes sensitive files in the `angular-seed-advanced` project structure).
    *   Securely store and manage configuration files during deployment, following best practices for the deployment environment used with `angular-seed-advanced`.

## Threat: [Build Process Vulnerabilities](./threats/build_process_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The build process defined and implemented by `angular-seed-advanced` (scripts in `package.json`, build tool configurations, custom build scripts) might contain vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the build pipeline, compromising the application artifacts produced by the build process. This could lead to serving compromised application code to users.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. Supply chain compromise, malicious code injection into application, potential full application compromise for users.
*   **Affected Component:** Build scripts (`package.json` scripts, build tool configurations, potentially custom build scripts in `tools/` or similar directories within `angular-seed-advanced`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and secure the entire build pipeline defined by `angular-seed-advanced`. Understand each step and potential security implications.
    *   Use secure and updated build tools and practices. Ensure the build tools recommended or used by `angular-seed-advanced` are up-to-date and secure.
    *   Implement build process integrity checks (e.g., checksum verification of build artifacts) to detect any unauthorized modifications during the build.
    *   Regularly update build tools and dependencies used in the build process as defined by `angular-seed-advanced`.
