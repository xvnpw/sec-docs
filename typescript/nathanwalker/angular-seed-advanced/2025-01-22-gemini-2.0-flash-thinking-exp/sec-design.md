# Project Design Document: Angular Seed Advanced - Threat Modeling (Improved)

## 1. Project Overview

This document details the design of the "Angular Seed Advanced" project, based on the repository: [https://github.com/nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced](https://github.com/nathanwalker/angular-seed-advanced), specifically for the purpose of threat modeling. This project is a comprehensive starter kit for modern Angular web applications, offering a solid foundation with key features:

*   **Angular Frontend Application:** A rich Angular application featuring routing, state management, UI components, and best practices for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Backend API Integration (Conceptual):** While the seed project is frontend-focused, it's architected for seamless integration with a backend API. This document assumes a RESTful API backend using common patterns for data persistence and business logic, crucial for realistic threat modeling.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Framework:** Includes patterns and potentially libraries for implementing robust user authentication and authorization to protect application resources and data.
*   **Reactive State Management:** Employs a reactive state management library (likely NgRx) for predictable and manageable application state, impacting data flow and security considerations.
*   **Comprehensive Testing Strategy:** Integrates testing frameworks for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, important for ensuring security controls are effectively implemented and maintained.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Provides configurations for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines, influencing deployment security and update mechanisms.

This design document emphasizes architectural elements critical for threat modeling. It outlines components, data flows, and technologies, serving as the foundation for identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities within a system built using this seed project.  This document will be used to perform a STRIDE based threat model in a subsequent exercise.

**Diagram Explanation:**

*   **'Angular Application'**: Represents the frontend application running within a user's web browser. It's built with Angular and is responsible for the user interface, user interactions, client-side routing, state management, and communication with the Backend API.
*   **'API Gateway'**: A conceptual central entry point for all API requests originating from the Angular Application. It handles request routing to backend services, and can implement cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting, authentication (initial checks), and request transformation.
*   **'Authentication Service'**: A dedicated, conceptual service responsible for user authentication and authorization. It verifies user credentials, issues and manages access tokens (like JWTs), and potentially handles user registration and password management.  This could be implemented using OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.
*   **'Application Server(s)'**: Conceptual backend server(s) hosting the core business logic of the application. They process requests from the API Gateway, interact with the Database and Caching Layer, enforce authorization rules, and return responses to the frontend.  These servers are likely implemented using Node.js, Java, Python, or similar backend technologies.
*   **'Database'**:  A conceptual persistent data store for the application. It could be a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB), depending on the application's data model and requirements.
*   **'Caching Layer'**: An optional but recommended conceptual layer for improving performance and reducing database load. It can store frequently accessed data in memory (e.g., using Redis or Memcached).

**Note:** The Backend API components are conceptual representations to facilitate threat modeling.  The "angular-seed-advanced" project primarily focuses on the frontend architecture, but understanding the assumed backend is crucial for comprehensive security analysis.

## 4. Data Flow (Detailed)

This section elaborates on the data flow within the application, including specific scenarios and security considerations at each step.

**4.1. User Authentication Flow:**

1.  **Login Request (Angular Application to API Gateway):** User initiates login through the Angular Application. The application sends a `POST /api/auth/login` request to the API Gateway, including user credentials (username/password or potentially OAuth tokens).  **Security Consideration:**  Ensure HTTPS is used for transmitting credentials to protect against eavesdropping.
2.  **Gateway Routing & Initial Checks (API Gateway to Authentication Service):** The API Gateway routes the `/api/auth/login` request to the Authentication Service. It might perform initial checks like rate limiting or basic request validation.
3.  **Credential Verification (Authentication Service):** The Authentication Service receives the credentials and verifies them against the user database. This may involve password hashing and comparison or interaction with an external identity provider. **Security Consideration:** Secure password storage (hashing with salt), protection against brute-force attacks, and secure communication with identity providers.
4.  **Access Token Issuance (Authentication Service to API Gateway):** Upon successful authentication, the Authentication Service generates an access token (e.g., JWT) and potentially a refresh token. It returns these tokens to the API Gateway in the response. **Security Consideration:** Secure token generation, appropriate token expiration times, and secure key management for signing tokens.
5.  **Token Relay to Angular Application (API Gateway to Angular Application):** The API Gateway relays the access token (and refresh token if issued) back to the Angular Application in the HTTP response.
6.  **Token Storage (Angular Application):** The Angular Application securely stores the access token (and refresh token) in browser storage (e.g., `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or in memory). **Security Consideration:**  Protecting tokens from XSS attacks if stored in browser storage. Consider using `sessionStorage` for shorter-lived tokens or secure, in-memory storage if feasible.

**4.2. Protected Resource Access Flow (e.g., Fetching User Profile):**

1.  **API Request with Access Token (Angular Application to API Gateway):** The Angular Application needs to access a protected resource (e.g., user profile). It sends an HTTP request (e.g., `GET /api/users/me`) to the API Gateway, including the access token in the `Authorization` header (Bearer token). **Security Consideration:** Always use HTTPS to transmit access tokens.
2.  **Gateway Routing & Authentication (API Gateway to Application Server):** The API Gateway routes the request to the Application Server.  It may perform initial token validation (e.g., JWT signature verification) or forward the token to the Authentication Service for full validation. **Security Consideration:**  Secure token validation process, protection against token forgery and replay attacks.
3.  **Authorization Check (Application Server):** The Application Server receives the request and the validated access token. It performs authorization checks to determine if the user associated with the token has permission to access the requested resource (`/api/users/me`). This might involve checking user roles or permissions. **Security Consideration:** Robust authorization logic, enforcement of least privilege principle, and protection against authorization bypass vulnerabilities.
4.  **Data Retrieval (Application Server to Database/Cache):** If authorized, the Application Server retrieves the requested data (user profile) from the Database or Caching Layer.
5.  **Data Response (Application Server to API Gateway):** The Application Server sends the retrieved data back to the API Gateway in the HTTP response.
6.  **Response Relay to Angular Application (API Gateway to Angular Application):** The API Gateway relays the response back to the Angular Application.
7.  **UI Update (Angular Application):** The Angular Application processes the response and updates the user interface to display the user profile.
