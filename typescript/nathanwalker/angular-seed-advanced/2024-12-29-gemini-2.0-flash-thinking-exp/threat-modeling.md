Here are the high and critical threats directly involving `angular-seed-advanced`:

*   **Threat:** Outdated Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could identify and exploit known security vulnerabilities present in outdated npm packages used *by* `angular-seed-advanced`. This directly stems from the dependencies the seed project includes and maintains. Exploitation could involve injecting malicious scripts, gaining unauthorized access, or causing denial of service within applications built using the seed.
    *   **Impact:**  Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) or remote code execution (RCE) within applications built using the seed.
    *   **Affected Component:** `angular-seed-advanced`'s `package.json` and the `node_modules` directory within the seed project itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the vulnerability in the seed's dependencies).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   The `angular-seed-advanced` maintainers should regularly update all dependencies within the seed project using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
        *   Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools within the seed project's development workflow (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, or similar).
        *   Monitor security advisories for the seed project's dependencies.
        *   Consider using dependency lock files (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) within the seed project to ensure consistent dependency versions for users.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise one of the direct or transitive dependencies *of* `angular-seed-advanced` and inject malicious code. This directly impacts users of the seed as the malicious code would be included in projects built upon it. This could happen through typosquatting, account takeovers of maintainers of the seed's dependencies, or vulnerabilities in the dependency supply chain. The malicious code could then be executed within applications built using the seed.
    *   **Impact:**  Code injection, data theft, backdoors, supply chain compromise affecting applications built using the seed and potentially their users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `angular-seed-advanced`'s `package.json`, `node_modules`, and the build process defined within the seed project.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   The `angular-seed-advanced` maintainers should carefully review the dependencies listed in the seed's `package.json`.
        *   Utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools within the seed project's development to identify potential malicious or suspicious packages.
        *   Verify the integrity and authenticity of the seed's dependencies (e.g., using checksums or signatures if available).
        *   Monitor dependency updates and be cautious of unexpected changes in the seed's dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Build Script Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the build scripts defined in `angular-seed-advanced`'s `package.json` or other build-related configuration files within the seed project. This could involve injecting malicious commands that are executed when a user builds an application based on the seed, potentially leading to the inclusion of backdoors or the exposure of sensitive information during the user's build process.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromised build artifacts for users of the seed, injection of malicious code into applications built using the seed, exposure of secrets or credentials during the user's build process.
    *   **Affected Component:** `angular-seed-advanced`'s `package.json` scripts, any custom build scripts within the seed project, and the build environment used by users of the seed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   The `angular-seed-advanced` maintainers should thoroughly review and sanitize all build scripts within the seed project.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the seed's build scripts.
        *   Implement input validation for any external inputs used in the seed's build process.
        *   Use secure coding practices for scripting within the seed project.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Build Artifacts (of the Seed)
    *   **Description:** The default build configuration or practices within `angular-seed-advanced` itself might inadvertently lead to the inclusion of sensitive information (e.g., API keys, internal URLs, development secrets of the seed project) in the seed's published artifacts or repository. An attacker could then extract this information. While this doesn't directly compromise user applications, it could compromise the seed project itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the seed project's infrastructure or resources, potential compromise of the seed project's accounts or systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** `angular-seed-advanced`'s build process, output directory (if any), configuration files within the seed project.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   The `angular-seed-advanced` maintainers should utilize environment variables or secure configuration management tools to handle sensitive information within the seed project.
        *   Ensure that sensitive files or directories are excluded from the seed project's build output and repository.
        *   Review the seed project's build output and repository to verify that no sensitive information is included.
        *   Implement proper access controls on the seed project's infrastructure and repositories.
