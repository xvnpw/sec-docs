* **Attack Surface: Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:**  Security flaws present in third-party libraries and packages used by the application.
    * **How angular-seed-advanced Contributes:** The seed project pre-defines a set of dependencies in its `package.json`. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, any application built upon this seed will inherit that risk until dependencies are updated. The larger the dependency tree, the greater the potential attack surface.
    * **Example:** The seed project includes an older version of a UI library with a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Developers, unaware of this, use components from this library in their application, making it susceptible to XSS attacks.
    * **Impact:**  Can range from data breaches and unauthorized access to denial of service and remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update dependencies using `npm audit fix` or `yarn upgrade`.
        * Implement a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to continuously monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        * Review dependency licenses and security advisories before including new packages.
        * Consider using dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments.

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Build Process**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced during the application's build process, potentially leading to compromised build artifacts.
    * **How angular-seed-advanced Contributes:** The seed project provides pre-configured build scripts in `package.json`. If these scripts are not reviewed and secured, they could be exploited. For example, if environment variables containing secrets are not handled correctly during the build.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the project's repository and modifies the build script to inject malicious code into the final JavaScript bundles. This code could then exfiltrate data from users' browsers.
    * **Impact:**  Compromised application code, potential for malware distribution, data breaches, and supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully review and understand all build scripts in `package.json`.
        * Avoid storing sensitive information directly in build scripts or configuration files. Use secure secret management solutions.
        * Implement build pipeline security measures, such as code signing and artifact verification.
        * Restrict access to the build environment and repository.

* **Attack Surface: Electron-Specific Vulnerabilities (If Utilizing Electron Features)**
    * **Description:** Security risks specific to Electron applications, such as Node.js integration vulnerabilities or issues with remote content loading.
    * **How angular-seed-advanced Contributes:** If the "advanced" nature of the seed includes Electron integration, it introduces the attack surface associated with running a web application within a desktop environment with Node.js capabilities. This includes risks like remote code execution if `nodeIntegration` is enabled without proper precautions.
    * **Example:**  With `nodeIntegration` enabled, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that gains access to Node.js APIs, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine.
    * **Impact:**  Remote code execution, file system access, privilege escalation, and other system-level compromises.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully evaluate the need for Node.js integration and minimize its scope.
        * Implement context isolation to separate the renderer process from the Node.js environment.
        * Sanitize and validate all user input before using it in Node.js contexts.
        * Avoid loading remote content directly into the Electron application without strict security measures.
        * Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Electron application.
