## Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes - Compromising Application Using angular-seed-advanced

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise an application using the angular-seed-advanced project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

Compromise Application via angular-seed-advanced Weaknesses
*   OR: ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities Introduced by Seed
    *   AND: [CRITICAL] Exploit Exposed Sensitive Information in Default Configuration
        *   ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Discover and Exploit Default Secret Keys/API Keys
            *   Analyze Configuration Files (e.g., environment.ts) for Hardcoded Secrets
    *   AND: [CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Default Security Settings
        *   ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Misconfigured Content Security Policy (CSP)
            *   Bypass CSP to Inject Malicious Scripts
        *   ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to Missing X-XSS-Protection
    *   AND: Exploit Insecure Default Dependencies or Versions
        *   ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Default Dependencies
            *   Identify and Exploit Vulnerable Libraries Included in the Seed
*   OR: ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Weaknesses in Example Code or Unremoved Features
    *   AND: [CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Example Components or Services
        *   Leverage Unsecured Example Code Left in the Application

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities Introduced by Seed**

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting default or placeholder secret keys and API keys hardcoded in configuration files (e.g., `environment.ts`).
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker analyzes the application's configuration files, often publicly accessible in client-side builds, to find default or placeholder secret keys and API keys.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker unauthorized access to backend services, third-party APIs, or other protected resources, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or financial loss.

*   **Attack Vector:** Bypassing a misconfigured Content Security Policy (CSP) to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker identifies weaknesses or overly permissive rules in the default CSP implemented by the seed project. They then craft and inject malicious JavaScript code that executes within the user's browser.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing the attacker to steal user credentials, session cookies, inject further malicious content, or redirect users to malicious websites.

*   **Attack Vector:** Performing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the absence of the `X-XSS-Protection` header.
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker leverages the lack of the `X-XSS-Protection` header to inject malicious scripts into the application. When a user interacts with the compromised part of the application, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to XSS attacks, enabling the attacker to steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in default dependencies included in the seed project.
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker identifies outdated or vulnerable libraries included as default dependencies in the `angular-seed-advanced` project. They then leverage publicly known exploits targeting these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Potential Impact:** The impact varies depending on the vulnerability, ranging from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the client's browser or potentially the server if SSR is involved.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Weaknesses in Example Code or Unremoved Features**

*   **Attack Vector:** Leveraging unsecured example code left in the application.
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker identifies example components, services, or functionalities that were included in the seed project for demonstration purposes but were not removed before deployment. These examples often lack proper security considerations.
    *   **Potential Impact:** The impact varies depending on the nature of the example code. It could lead to information disclosure, unintended functionality execution, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, or other security flaws.

**Critical Node: Exploit Exposed Sensitive Information in Default Configuration**

*   **Attack Vector:**  This node represents the risk of default or placeholder secrets and API keys being present in the application's configuration.
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker targets configuration files to find hardcoded secrets.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation provides direct access to sensitive resources, potentially leading to significant data breaches or system compromise.

**Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Default Security Settings**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node encompasses various insecure default security settings, primarily focusing on missing or misconfigured security headers and CSP.
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits the absence or weakness of security mechanisms like CSP and security headers.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation opens the door to a range of attacks, most notably Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which can have severe consequences.

**Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Example Components or Services**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node highlights the danger of leaving example code in the production application.
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker seeks out and exploits the vulnerabilities present in the unsecured example code.
    *   **Potential Impact:** The impact is variable but can include information disclosure, XSS, or other vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the example code.
