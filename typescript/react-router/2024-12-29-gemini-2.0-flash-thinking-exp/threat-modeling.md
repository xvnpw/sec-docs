### High and Critical React Router Threats

Here are the high and critical severity threats that directly involve the `react-router` library:

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Redirect Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the URL or application state to force a client-side redirect to an unintended or malicious external website by exploiting how the application uses React Router's navigation features. This involves influencing the destination URL passed to navigation functions or components.
    *   **Impact:** Users can be redirected to phishing sites, malware distribution sites, or other harmful locations, potentially leading to credential theft, malware infection, or reputational damage for the application.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `useNavigate` hook: When the destination argument passed to the `navigate()` function is derived from an untrusted source without proper validation.
        *   `<Navigate>` component: When the `to` prop is dynamically generated from untrusted data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize redirect destinations passed to `useNavigate` or the `to` prop of `<Navigate>` against an allowlist of trusted URLs or patterns.
        *   Avoid constructing redirect URLs directly from user input.
        *   For sensitive redirects, consider using server-side redirects after proper authorization.

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Routing Logic Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker can directly manipulate the browser's address bar or use browser developer tools to modify the URL, bypassing the intended navigation flow managed by React Router and potentially accessing components or functionalities they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features or data, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `<BrowserRouter>`, `<HashRouter>`, `<MemoryRouter>`: The core router components that interpret the URL and render corresponding routes.
        *   `<Route>` component: While not directly manipulated, the defined routes are the target of the bypass.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement server-side authorization checks to verify user access to resources and functionalities, regardless of the client-side route.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side routing for security. Client-side routing is primarily for user experience.
        *   Ensure that any state management influencing routing decisions is secure and cannot be easily manipulated by the user.
