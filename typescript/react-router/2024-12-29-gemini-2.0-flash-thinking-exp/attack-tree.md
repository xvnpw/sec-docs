## Threat Model: React Router Application - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application using React Router by exploiting its weaknesses.

**Attacker Goal:** Gain unauthorized access, manipulate application state, or cause denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities within the React Router library's implementation or usage.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via React Router Exploitation **CRITICAL NODE**
    * Manipulate Navigation Flow **HIGH RISK PATH**
        * Bypass Authentication/Authorization via Route Manipulation **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Direct URL Manipulation to Access Protected Routes **HIGH RISK PATH**
            * Exploit Inconsistent Route Guard Logic **HIGH RISK PATH**
        * Inject Malicious Content via Route Parameters **HIGH RISK PATH** **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Route Parameters **HIGH RISK PATH** **CRITICAL NODE**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via React Router Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation of React Router vulnerabilities leading to this outcome is considered critical.

* **Manipulate Navigation Flow (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * This category of attacks focuses on exploiting the routing mechanism to achieve malicious goals. It's high-risk because successful manipulation can lead to unauthorized access, state corruption, or injection attacks.

* **Bypass Authentication/Authorization via Route Manipulation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is a critical node because successfully bypassing authentication or authorization grants the attacker access to protected resources and functionalities, undermining the core security of the application.

* **Direct URL Manipulation to Access Protected Routes (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts URLs with the intention of directly accessing routes that should be protected by authentication or authorization. They rely on the client-side routing logic failing to properly enforce these security measures, hoping the server-side also lacks sufficient checks.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This is a common and relatively easy attack to attempt. If successful, it provides immediate access to sensitive areas.

* **Exploit Inconsistent Route Guard Logic (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Attackers identify discrepancies or vulnerabilities in the implementation of route guards (the logic that determines if a user can access a specific route). This might involve finding edge cases, logical flaws, or inconsistencies between different parts of the application's routing configuration.
    * **Why High-Risk:**  Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass intended security measures, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionalities. The likelihood increases with the complexity of the application's routing setup.

* **Inject Malicious Content via Route Parameters (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This category is high-risk and critical because it directly enables injection attacks, particularly XSS.

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Route Parameters (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into route parameters. If the application renders these parameters on the page without proper sanitization (encoding or escaping), the browser will execute the injected script.
    * **Why High-Risk and Critical:** XSS is a highly impactful vulnerability. Successful exploitation can lead to:
        * **Account Takeover:** Stealing session cookies or credentials.
        * **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
        * **Malicious Actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
        * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Redirecting users to phishing pages or malware distribution sites.
    * The likelihood is medium because while XSS is a well-known vulnerability, it requires specific conditions (unsanitized rendering of route parameters) to be exploitable in this context. However, the impact is undeniably high.
