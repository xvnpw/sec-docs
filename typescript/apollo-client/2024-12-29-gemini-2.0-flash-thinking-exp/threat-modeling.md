Here's the updated list of high and critical threats directly involving Apollo Client:

*   **Threat:** Client-Side GraphQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate client-side logic (e.g., through a separate vulnerability or by directly modifying the application's JavaScript) to craft malicious GraphQL queries or mutations. They could inject additional fields, arguments, or directives not intended by the developers. This crafted query is then sent to the GraphQL server *using Apollo Client's query or mutation execution methods*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation (if a mutation is crafted), potential denial of service on the GraphQL server if the injected query is resource-intensive.
    *   **Affected Apollo Client Component:** `useQuery` hook, `useMutation` hook, `ApolloClient.query()`, `ApolloClient.mutate()`, potentially the link layer if custom links are involved in query construction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries or the `gql` template literal tag to construct queries safely, avoiding string concatenation of user-provided data directly into the query *when using Apollo Client's methods*.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side to prevent malicious queries from being executed.
        *   Enforce strict schema definitions on the server-side to limit the possible operations and data access.
        *   Regularly review client-side code for potential injection points.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of Authentication Tokens
    *   **Description:** Apollo Client often handles authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs). If these tokens are stored insecurely on the client-side (e.g., in plain text in `localStorage` or session storage without proper precautions), an attacker gaining access to the client's environment could steal these tokens. This directly relates to how *Apollo Client's link layer is configured to handle and store tokens*.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Affected Apollo Client Component:**  The link layer where authentication headers are configured, potentially custom logic for token management within Apollo Client's context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive tokens directly in `localStorage` or session storage.
        *   Consider using secure, HTTP-only cookies for storing authentication tokens, which are less accessible to client-side JavaScript.
        *   If `localStorage` or session storage must be used, implement client-side encryption of the tokens.
        *   Implement short token expiration times and refresh token mechanisms.

*   **Threat:** Token Interception during Network Requests
    *   **Description:** While HTTPS encrypts network traffic, vulnerabilities in the client's environment (e.g., malware, compromised browser extensions) or on a compromised network could potentially allow for the interception of authentication tokens being sent in request headers. This is relevant because *Apollo Client's link layer is responsible for sending these headers*.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Apollo Client Component:** The link layer responsible for sending HTTP requests with authorization headers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce the use of HTTPS for all communication with the GraphQL server.
        *   Educate users about the risks of using untrusted networks and devices.
        *   Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   Use short-lived tokens to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker.

*   **Threat:** Reliance on Client-Side Authorization Logic
    *   **Description:** If authorization decisions are solely based on client-side logic within the Apollo Client application (e.g., hiding UI elements based on cached user roles), an attacker can bypass these checks by manipulating the client-side code or the cached data *managed by Apollo Client*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to features or data, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Apollo Client Component:**  Components using cached data *from Apollo Client's cache* for authorization decisions, potentially custom logic within components or resolvers interacting with the Apollo Client cache.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enforce authorization checks on the server-side. The client-side should only be used for UI guidance, not for security.
        *   Treat client-side authorization logic as a user experience enhancement, not a security measure.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Client-Side Code
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, internal URLs, secrets) directly in the client-side code that uses Apollo Client. This information can be easily discovered by inspecting the JavaScript source code. This is relevant because *Apollo Client configuration often involves API endpoints and potentially authorization details*.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential compromise of other systems if API keys or secrets are exposed.
    *   **Affected Apollo Client Component:** Any component where Apollo Client is initialized or configured, potentially custom link implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in client-side code.
        *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management techniques to handle sensitive data.
        *   Implement code review processes to catch accidental inclusion of sensitive information.
