### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: URI Command Execution via `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command`
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious URI using the `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command` endpoint.
    2. This URI contains an arbitrary command within the query parameters.
    3. The victim user clicks on this malicious URI.
    4. VSCode attempts to open the URI, triggering the CodeLLDB extension.
    5. The extension's `UriLaunchServer` handles the URI and parses the command from the query parameters without proper validation.
    6. The parsed command is then directly executed by the extension as part of a debug launch configuration.
    7. This results in arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
* Impact:
    - Remote Command Execution (RCE).
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine.
    - This can lead to complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly parses and executes the command from the URI without any input validation or sanitization.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the command extracted from the URI.
    - Implement a whitelist of allowed commands or parameters if command execution from URI is a necessary feature.
    - Consider removing the `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command` endpoint altogether if arbitrary command execution is not intended functionality.
* Preconditions:
    - The victim user must have the CodeLLDB extension installed in VSCode.
    - The victim user must click on a malicious URI crafted by the attacker.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/extension/externalLaunch.ts`
    2. Function: `UriLaunchServer.handleUri(uri: Uri)`
    3. Vulnerable code block:
        ```typescript
        else if (uri.path == '/launch/command') {
            let frags = query.split('&');
            let cmdLine = frags.pop();

            let env: Dict<string> = {}
            for (let frag of frags) {
                let pos = frag.indexOf('=');
                if (pos > 0)
                    env[frag.substr(0, pos)] = frag.substr(pos + 1);
            }

            let args = stringArgv(cmdLine);
            let program = args.shift();
            let debugConfig: DebugConfiguration = {
                type: 'lldb',
                request: 'launch',
                name: '',
                program: program,
                args: args,
                env: env,
            };
            debugConfig.name = debugConfig.name || debugConfig.program;
            await debug.startDebugging(undefined, debugConfig);
        }
        ```
    4. Visualization:

        ```
        User Clicks Malicious URI --> VSCode URI Handler --> UriLaunchServer.handleUri()
                                            |
                                            | Extract cmdLine from URI query
                                            |
                                            V
        cmdLine --stringArgv--> program, args  --> Debug Configuration (program, args)
                                            |
                                            V
        debug.startDebugging(debugConfig) --> Command Execution
        ```

    5. The `UriLaunchServer.handleUri` function, specifically when handling the `/launch/command` path, directly processes the `cmdLine` extracted from the URI. It uses `stringArgv` to parse the command line into `program` and `args`, which are then used to construct a `DebugConfiguration`. This configuration is immediately passed to `debug.startDebugging`, leading to the execution of the program specified in the malicious URI without any security checks or sanitization.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Target Environment:** A machine with VSCode and CodeLLDB extension installed.
    2. **Malicious Link Creation:** Create the following malicious link:
        - For Linux/macOS: `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?RUST_LOG=error&/bin/bash -c 'touch /tmp/codelldb_pwned'`
        - For Windows: `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?&cmd.exe /c "echo pwned > %TEMP%/codelldb_pwned.txt"`
    3. **Link Delivery:** Send this link to the target user via any communication channel (e.g., email, chat, website).
    4. **Victim Action:** The victim user clicks on the malicious link.
    5. **Verification (Linux/macOS):** After clicking the link, check if the file `/tmp/codelldb_pwned` has been created on the victim's machine. Run `ls /tmp/codelldb_pwned`. If the file exists, the vulnerability is confirmed.
    6. **Verification (Windows):** After clicking the link, check if the file `%TEMP%/codelldb_pwned.txt` has been created on the victim's machine. Open Command Prompt and run `type %TEMP%/codelldb_pwned.txt`. If the file contains "pwned", the vulnerability is confirmed.

This test case will demonstrate that clicking the crafted URI results in arbitrary command execution, confirming the Remote Command Execution vulnerability.
