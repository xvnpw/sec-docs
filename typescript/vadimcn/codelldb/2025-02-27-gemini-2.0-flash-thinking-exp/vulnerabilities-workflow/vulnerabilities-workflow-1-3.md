### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `lldb.terminalPromptClear` setting
- Description:
    - The `lldb.terminalPromptClear` setting allows users to configure a sequence of strings sent to the terminal to clear the command prompt.
    - This setting is intended to clear the terminal prompt in various shells.
    - However, the configured strings are directly passed to the terminal without proper sanitization or escaping.
    - A malicious user can craft a string that, when interpreted by the terminal, executes arbitrary commands.
    - To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to convince a user to open a workspace with a malicious `lldb.terminalPromptClear` setting. This could be achieved by sharing a project with a crafted `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    - Once the workspace is opened and a debug session starts that involves terminal interaction (e.g., using "integrated" or "external" terminal for debuggee stdio), the malicious command in `lldb.terminalPromptClear` will be executed.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - This can lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The setting is directly used to send commands to the terminal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and escaping of the `lldb.terminalPromptClear` setting.
    - Restricting the characters allowed in the `lldb.terminalPromptClear` setting to only control characters or escape sequences intended for terminal prompt clearing.
    - Display a warning to the user when a workspace with a non-default `lldb.terminalPromptClear` setting is opened.
- Preconditions:
    - User opens a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file with a crafted `lldb.terminalPromptClear` setting.
    - A debug session is started that uses "integrated" or "external" terminal for debuggee stdio.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The file `/code/extension/adapterSettings.ts` shows that `terminalPromptClear` setting is retrieved using `config.get('terminalPromptClear')` in `getAdapterSettings` function.
    - This `AdapterSettings` object is then passed to the debug adapter.
    - In `/code/extension/main.ts`, `AdapterSettings` is created in `createDebugAdapterDescriptor` and passed to `this.startDebugAdapter`.
    - `this.startDebugAdapter` in `/code/extension/main.ts` then calls `adapter.start` from `/code/extension/novsc/adapter.ts`, passing `adapterSettings`.
    - Reviewing `/code/extension/novsc/adapter.ts`, specifically the `getSpawnParams` and `start` functions, it is evident that `adapterSettings` is stringified and passed as `--settings` argument to the debug adapter executable.
    - The vulnerability lies in the debug adapter itself (`codelldb` executable, not provided in PROJECT FILES) which is expected to use `terminalPromptClear` setting to execute commands in the terminal. The extension code is correctly passing the setting value to the adapter. The lack of sanitization is assumed to be in the adapter's handling of this setting.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Create a `.vscode` folder in the workspace root.
    3. Create a `settings.json` file inside `.vscode` folder with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "lldb.terminalPromptClear": ["$(touch /tmp/codelldb_pwned)"]
    }
    ```
    4. Create a simple C++ or Rust project in the workspace. A basic "Hello, World!" program is sufficient.
    5. Create a launch configuration in `launch.json` that uses "integrated" or "external" terminal for stdio, for example:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Launch Program",
        "type": "lldb",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/<path_to_executable>",
        "terminal": "integrated"
    }
    ```
    6. Build the debuggee executable.
    7. Start debugging the program using the created launch configuration.
    8. After the debug session starts and terminal is initialized, check if the file `/tmp/codelldb_pwned` exists. If the file exists, the command injection was successful.

- Vulnerability Name: Unsafe YAML parsing in "launch/config" URI endpoint
- Description:
    - CodeLLDB allows starting debug sessions from outside VSCode using specially formatted URIs, including `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/config?<yaml>`.
    - This endpoint parses the YAML snippet provided in the URI to configure the debug session.
    - If the YAML parser is not configured to prevent unsafe deserialization, a malicious user could craft a YAML payload that, when parsed, executes arbitrary code on the user's machine.
    - To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to create a malicious URI with a YAML payload that exploits a known YAML deserialization vulnerability (e.g., using `!!python/object/new:object:subprocess.Popen`).
    - The attacker would then need to convince the user to open this malicious URI, for example, by sending it in a message or embedding it in a webpage.
    - When VSCode opens the URI, CodeLLDB will parse the YAML payload, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - This can lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Unknown. It's not clear from the provided files if safe YAML parsing is enforced.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Use a safe YAML parsing library or configure the current YAML parser to disable unsafe deserialization features (like `!!python/object/new` in PyYAML).
    - Input validation of the YAML payload to prevent injection of malicious YAML constructs.
- Preconditions:
    - User opens a malicious URI of the format `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/config?<yaml>`.
    - The YAML payload contains malicious code exploiting unsafe YAML deserialization.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The file `/code/extension/externalLaunch.ts` handles the `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb` URI endpoints in the `UriLaunchServer` class, specifically in `handleUri` function.
    - For the path `/launch/config`, the code `Object.assign(debugConfig, YAML.parse(query));` is used.
    - `YAML.parse` from the `yaml` library is used to parse the URI query.
    - By default, `YAML.parse` might not be safe against deserialization vulnerabilities. If the library is used without options to enforce safe loading, it is vulnerable.
    - There is no visible sanitization or validation of the YAML input before parsing.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious YAML payload that executes a simple command (e.g., `touch /tmp/codelldb_yaml_pwned`). A Python-specific payload for PyYAML could be: `!!python/object/new:object:subprocess.Popen ['touch /tmp/codelldb_yaml_pwned', shell=True, close_fds=True]`.  (Note: This payload might need adjustments depending on the actual YAML library used and the environment).
    2. Construct a malicious URI using the crafted YAML payload, properly URI-encoded. For example: `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/config?!!python/object/new:object:subprocess.Popen%20%5B'touch%20/tmp/codelldb_yaml_pwned',%20shell=True,%20close_fds=True%5D`
    3. Open the malicious URI using `code --open-url "<malicious_uri>"`.
    4. Check if the file `/tmp/codelldb_yaml_pwned` exists after VSCode processes the URI. If the file exists, the unsafe YAML parsing vulnerability is confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name:  Potential Command Injection in "launch/command" URI endpoint via Command Line Parsing
- Description:
    - The `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?<env1>=<val1>&<env2>=<val2>&<command-line>` URI endpoint allows users to launch debug sessions with a command line specified in the URI.
    - The `<command-line>` part is split into program name and arguments using "usual shell command-line parsing rules".
    - If these parsing rules are not implemented correctly and securely, especially when handling quotes and special characters, it might be possible to inject additional commands or arguments into the debuggee process.
    - An attacker could craft a malicious URI with a specially crafted `<command-line>` that, when parsed, results in execution of unintended commands or manipulation of debuggee arguments.
    - To trigger this, the attacker needs to convince the user to open a malicious `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command` URI.
- Impact:
    - Potential for arbitrary command execution or unintended debuggee behavior based on the injected commands/arguments.
    - The severity depends on the extent of command injection possible and the privileges of the debuggee process.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Unknown. The security of the command line parsing depends on the implementation details.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure and robust command line parsing implementation that properly handles quotes, escape characters, and special characters to prevent injection.
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `<command-line>` part of the URI.
    - Consider using a safer method for passing command line arguments if possible, instead of relying on shell-like parsing within the extension.
- Preconditions:
    - User opens a malicious URI of the format `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?<env1>=<val1>&<env2>=<val2>&<command-line>`.
    - The `<command-line>` part is crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the command line parsing logic.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The file `/code/extension/externalLaunch.ts` handles the `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb` URI endpoints in the `UriLaunchServer` class, specifically in `handleUri` function.
    - For the path `/launch/command`, the code `let args = stringArgv(cmdLine);` is used to parse the command line.
    - `stringArgv` is used to split the command line into arguments, mimicking shell-like parsing.
    - If `stringArgv` has vulnerabilities or is not used carefully, it can lead to command injection.
    - After parsing, the code extracts the program and arguments and creates a debug configuration.
    - There is no explicit sanitization of the `cmdLine` input before parsing with `stringArgv`.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious URI with a crafted `<command-line>` to test for command injection. For example, try to inject a command after the program path using backticks or semicolons, like: `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?/bin/ls%20-l;touch%20/tmp/codelldb_cmd_injection` or `vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?/bin/ls%20-l%60touch%20/tmp/codelldb_cmd_injection%60`.  (URI-encode special characters like spaces, semicolons, backticks, etc.).
    2. Open the malicious URI using `code --open-url "<malicious_uri>"`.
    3. Check if the file `/tmp/codelldb_cmd_injection` exists after VSCode processes the URI. If the file exists, command injection is possible.
    4. Test different injection techniques and special characters to assess the robustness of the command line parsing.

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Download of Platform Package - Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability
- Description:
    - The extension downloads platform-specific packages (VSX files) from a predefined URL during the extension installation or update process.
    - The `download` function in `/code/extension/install.ts` fetches the package over HTTPS, but it **does not perform any integrity checks** on the downloaded file, such as verifying a checksum or digital signature.
    - An attacker capable of performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could intercept the download request and replace the legitimate platform package with a malicious one.
    - If a malicious package is substituted, when VSCode installs the VSIX package, it will install the malicious extension, leading to arbitrary code execution within the VSCode context.
    - To trigger this, an attacker needs to be in a network position to intercept and modify HTTPS traffic between the user's machine and the server hosting the platform packages during the extension's platform package installation phase.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process upon extension installation or update.
    - This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and persistent backdoor creation.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The download process lacks any integrity verification mechanisms.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement integrity checks for downloaded platform packages.
    - The most effective mitigation is to verify a digital signature of the VSIX package before installation. If digital signatures are not feasible, implement checksum verification (e.g., SHA256 hash) of the downloaded file against a known good value.
    - Ensure that the checksum or signature is retrieved over a separate secure channel or is embedded within the extension itself and is verified before proceeding with the installation.
- Preconditions:
    - The user's machine is in a network that is susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
    - The CodeLLDB extension attempts to install or update its platform package.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The file `/code/extension/install.ts` contains the `download` function.
    - `getPlatformPackageUrl` function determines the download URL.
    - `download` function uses `async.https.get(url)` to fetch the package and pipes the response to `fs.createWriteStream(destPath)`.
    - **There is no code in the `download` function or the surrounding installation process that performs any kind of checksum or signature verification of the downloaded VSIX package.**
    - The downloaded file at `destPath` is directly passed to `commands.executeCommand('workbench.extensions.command.installFromVSIX', [Uri.file(downloadTarget)])` for installation.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a Man-in-the-Middle proxy (like mitmproxy or Burp Suite) to intercept HTTPS traffic.
    2. Configure the proxy to intercept requests to the platform package download URL obtained from `getPlatformPackageUrl()` function in `/code/extension/install.ts`.
    3. Create a malicious VSIX package that executes a simple command (e.g., `touch /tmp/codelldb_mitm_pwned`) upon installation.
    4. Configure the MITM proxy to replace the legitimate platform package response with the malicious VSIX package.
    5. Trigger the platform package installation in VSCode (e.g., by installing CodeLLDB extension for the first time or updating it if a new version is available that triggers platform package re-download).
    6. Observe the MITM proxy intercepting and replacing the platform package download.
    7. After VSCode attempts to install the (maliciously replaced) platform package, check if the file `/tmp/codelldb_mitm_pwned` exists. If the file exists, the MITM attack and insecure download vulnerability are confirmed.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `pickProcess` Command via `initCommands` Option
- Description:
    - The `lldb.pickProcess` and `lldb.pickMyProcess` commands, exposed to VSCode's command palette and launch configurations, utilize the `pickProcess` function in `/code/extension/pickProcess.ts` to display a list of processes for users to attach to.
    - The `pickProcess` function accepts an optional `options` argument of type `PickProcessOptions`, which includes an `initCommands` array.
    - The `initCommands` array is intended to allow users to specify LLDB commands to be executed when fetching the process list. However, these commands are executed via `cp.exec` without sufficient sanitization.
    - A malicious user can craft a launch configuration that uses `${command:lldb.pickProcess}` or `${command:lldb.pickMyProcess}` and inject arbitrary LLDB commands through the `initCommands` option. These commands, when executed by `pickProcess`, can lead to arbitrary code execution within the LLDB context, and potentially on the host system.
    - To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to create a malicious launch configuration that leverages `${command:lldb.pickProcess}` or `${command:lldb.pickMyProcess}` with a crafted `initCommands` payload and convince a user to use this launch configuration.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary command execution within the LLDB context, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - Attackers can potentially bypass security restrictions, access sensitive data, or compromise the user's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The `initCommands` are passed to `cp.exec` without sanitization or validation.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Sanitize or strictly validate the `initCommands` passed to `pickProcess` to prevent command injection.
    - Ideally, avoid using `cp.exec` with user-controlled input for executing LLDB commands. If execution of LLDB commands is necessary, use a safer method that does not involve shell execution or carefully sanitize inputs to prevent injection.
    - Consider removing the `initCommands` option altogether if it's not essential and poses a significant security risk.
- Preconditions:
    - User opens a workspace containing a malicious launch configuration that utilizes `${command:lldb.pickProcess}` or `${command:lldb.pickMyProcess}` with a crafted `initCommands` option.
    - User attempts to use the malicious launch configuration, triggering the `pickProcess` command.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - In `/code/extension/pickProcess.ts`, the `pickProcess` function takes `options: PickProcessOptions` as an argument.
    - `PickProcessOptions` interface is defined as `{ initCommands: string[], filter: string }`.
    - Inside `getProcessList` function, `initArgs` is constructed from `options.initCommands`:
      ```typescript
      let initArgs = '';
      if (options && Array.isArray(options.initCommands)) {
          for (let command of options.initCommands) {
              initArgs += ` --one-line "${command}"`;
          }
      }
      ```
    - This `initArgs` is then directly embedded into the `command` string that is executed via `cp.exec`:
      ```typescript
      let command = `${lldbPath} --batch --no-lldbinit ${initArgs} --one-line "${processListCommand}"`;
      let stdout = await new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {
          cp.exec(command, { env: env }, (error, stdout) => { ... });
      });
      ```
    - The code directly uses string concatenation to build the command and passes it to `cp.exec`, making it vulnerable to command injection if `options.initCommands` is attacker-controlled.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Create a `.vscode` folder in the workspace root.
    3. Create a `launch.json` file inside `.vscode` folder with the following content:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "lldb",
                "request": "attach",
                "name": "Attach Malicious Process Picker",
                "pid": "${command:lldb.pickProcess, {\"initCommands\": [\"script import os; os.system('touch /tmp/codelldb_pickprocess_pwned')\"]}}"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    4. Open the Debug view in VSCode and select "Attach Malicious Process Picker" configuration.
    5. Start debugging. VSCode will attempt to resolve the `${command:lldb.pickProcess, ...}`.
    6. Check if the file `/tmp/codelldb_pickprocess_pwned` exists. If the file exists, the command injection via `initCommands` in `pickProcess` is confirmed.
