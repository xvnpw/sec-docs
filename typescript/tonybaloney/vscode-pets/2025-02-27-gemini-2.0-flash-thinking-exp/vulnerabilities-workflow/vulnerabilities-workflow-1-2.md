- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsanitized Webview Message Handling (Webview Command Injection)  
  - **Description:**  
    - The extension’s webview—injected into the pet panel HTML—registers a message event listener that immediately examines the incoming JSON message’s “command” property.  
    - It directly matches the command (e.g., `"throw-with-mouse"`, `"spawn-pet"`, `"reset-pet"`, etc.) and calls corresponding internal functions without any verification of the message origin or embedded authentication tokens.  
    - An attacker capable of injecting messages into the webview (via a malicious workspace file or by compromising the VS Code environment) can send a carefully crafted command to manipulate the extension’s internal state arbitrarily.  
  - **Impact:**  
    - The attacker can force state changes (e.g., resetting, deleting, or spawning pets unexpectedly), which may disrupt the extension’s operation and user experience.  
    - This behavior might pave the way for further attacks within the VS Code environment by altering the trusted state of the extension.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The webview content is served with a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and uses nonces for inline scripts.  
    - Only local resources are loaded using standard VS Code webview APIs.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - No validation of the message’s origin (or sender identity) is performed before processing commands.  
    - There is no per–message authentication token or session–specific verification to check that the message is coming from a trusted source.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The attacker must be able to inject or force an arbitrary message into the webview (for example, by submitting a malicious workspace file or via another compromise in the VS Code environment).  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In the pet panel (for example, in `src/panel/main.ts`), the code registers a listener as follows:  
      ```js
      window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
        const message = event.data;
        switch (message.command) {
          case 'throw-with-mouse': { … break; }
          case 'throw-ball': { … break; }
          case 'spawn-pet': { … break; }
          // ... other cases including 'list-pets', 'roll-call', 'delete-pet', 'reset-pet', etc.
        }
      });
      ```  
    - There is no check on the origin of the event or verification of an authentication token before executing these functions.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Preconditions:**  
       - Install and open the VS Code Pets extension to display the pet panel.  
       - Open the webview’s developer console (for testing only).  
    2. **Test Steps:**  
       - In the developer console, inject a message such as:  
         ```js
         window.postMessage({ command: 'reset-pet' }, '*');
         ```  
       - Verify that the pet panel resets (all pets are removed or its state is altered).  
       - Repeat the test with other commands (for example, `spawn-pet` with arbitrary parameters) to show that each is processed without any authorization checks.  
    3. **Expected Result:**  
       - The extension processes the injected commands, proving that an attacker with webview injection capabilities can control the extension’s state.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prototype Pollution via Pet List Import  
  - **Description:**  
    - The extension provides the command (`vscode-pets.import-pet-list`) to import a pet list from a JSON file.  
    - Upon file selection, the file contents are read, converted to a string, and parsed with `JSON.parse` without any schema validation or filtering of dangerous keys.  
    - An attacker can craft a JSON file containing not only valid pet records but also dangerous keys (such as `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"`) that, when processed, pollute the global object’s prototype.  
    - As the extension iterates over the resulting JSON array to create new pet objects, a malicious key can alter the behavior of built–in object methods or properties.  
  - **Impact:**  
    - Global prototype pollution can alter or override JavaScript’s standard object behavior, leading to logic corruption throughout the extension and potentially the host environment.  
    - This may serve as a precursor for further exploits, including privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution in certain contexts.  
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The extension relies on the built–in `JSON.parse` to convert the selected file’s content without any custom validation.  
    - There is no explicit filtering of dangerous keys during the import process.  
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - The JSON input is not validated against a strict schema that whitelists only the expected fields (e.g., `color`, `type`, `size`, `name`).  
    - Keys like `"__proto__"` or `"constructor"` are not explicitly rejected or sanitized before constructing internal pet objects.  
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The attacker must be able to convince or trick the user into importing a malicious JSON file via the pet list import command.  
    - The malicious JSON file must include prototype pollution payloads (e.g., setting `"__proto__": { "polluted": "yes" }`).  
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - In `src/extension/extension.ts`, when handling the import command, the following operations occur:  
      ```js
      const fileUri = await vscode.window.showOpenDialog(options);
      if (fileUri && fileUri[0]) {
        const fileContents = await vscode.workspace.fs.readFile(fileUri[0]);
        const petsToLoad = JSON.parse(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, Array.from(fileContents)));
        
        // Iterate over the imported pet list and create new PetSpecification objects
        for (let i = 0; i < petsToLoad.length; i++) {
            const pet = petsToLoad[i];
            const petSpec = new PetSpecification(
                normalizeColor(pet.color, pet.type),
                pet.type,
                pet.size,
                pet.name
            );
            collection.push(petSpec);
            if (panel !== undefined) {
                panel.spawnPet(petSpec);
            }
        }
      }
      ```  
    - No sanitization or key filtering is done on the parsed objects; hence, if the JSON includes keys like `"__proto__"`, those may be used to modify the prototype of objects globally.  
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Preconditions:**  
       - Install the VS Code Pets extension.  
       - Prepare a malicious JSON file (e.g., `malicious_pets.json`) with contents similar to:  
         ```json
         [
           {
             "type": "cat",
             "color": "black",
             "size": "small",
             "name": "malicious",
             "__proto__": { "polluted": "yes" }
           }
         ]
         ```  
    2. **Test Steps:**  
       - Run the command `vscode-pets.import-pet-list` in VS Code and select the malicious JSON file.  
       - After the import completes, in a developer console (or via a small test script in the extension context), execute:  
         ```js
         console.log({}.polluted);
         ```  
       - Observe the output.  
    3. **Expected Result:**  
       - The output should be `"yes"`, indicating that the global `Object.prototype` has been polluted.
