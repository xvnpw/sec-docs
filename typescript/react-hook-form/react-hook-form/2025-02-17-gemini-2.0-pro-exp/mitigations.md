# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for react-hook-form/react-hook-form

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Validate `defaultValues` and `reset` Data](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_validate__defaultvalues__and__reset__data.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify all instances where `defaultValues` are used in `useForm` and where the `reset` function is called.
2.  For each instance, determine the source of the data.
3.  If the data comes from *any* untrusted source (URL parameters, local storage, user input, database, etc.), implement strict validation and sanitization *before* passing the data to `useForm` or `reset`.
4.  Sanitization should remove or escape potentially harmful characters or code (e.g., HTML, JavaScript).
5.  Validation should ensure the data conforms to the expected type, format, and range. Use a whitelist approach.
6.  Consider a sanitization library for complex data.
7.  Prefer static, hardcoded `defaultValues` when possible.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):** Malicious JavaScript in `defaultValues` or `reset` data could be executed.
*   **Data Tampering (Medium):** Attackers could pre-populate fields with unexpected values.
*   **Bypass of Client-Side Validation (Medium):** Injecting values that bypass validation.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with effective sanitization).
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Bypass of Client-Side Validation:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:** [Example: `defaultValues` for user profile are sanitized with `src/utils/sanitize.js` before `useForm`.]

**Missing Implementation:** [Example: `reset` in password reset uses local storage data without validation. Needs fixing in `src/components/PasswordResetForm.js`.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit `shouldUnregister` Management for Sensitive Fields](./mitigation_strategies/explicit__shouldunregister__management_for_sensitive_fields.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify all fields handling sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII, etc.).
2.  For each, set `shouldUnregister: true` in the `register` call. This removes the value on unmount.
3.  Consider a helper function or custom hook to automatically apply `shouldUnregister: true` to sensitive fields.
4.  Implement a mechanism to explicitly clear sensitive data (using `setValue` or `reset`) after submission or on unmount, using `useEffect`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Sensitive data could leak if it persists after the field is hidden.
*   **Session Fixation (Low):** Persisting sensitive data could contribute to session fixation.
*   **Replay Attacks (Low):** Unregistered tokens might allow replaying previous requests.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Session Fixation:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
*   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

**Currently Implemented:** [Example: `shouldUnregister: true` is set for password fields in registration/login.]

**Missing Implementation:** [Example: API key field in settings lacks `shouldUnregister`. Add to `src/components/SettingsForm.js`. Clearing on unmount is also missing in several forms.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Test and Review Custom Validation Functions (`validate`)](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_test_and_review_custom_validation_functions___validate__.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify all custom validation functions used with `react-hook-form` (the `validate` option).
2.  Write comprehensive unit tests for each, covering:
    *   Valid inputs.
    *   Invalid inputs (edge cases, boundaries).
    *   Attack vectors (long strings, special characters, unexpected types).
3.  Test regular expressions for ReDoS vulnerabilities. Use a testing tool for this.
4.  Use established validation libraries (like validator.js) within custom functions.
5.  Regularly review and update custom validation functions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Medium):** Poor regex can cause high CPU usage.
*   **Logic Errors in Validation (Medium):** Bugs can allow invalid data.
*   **Bypass of Intended Validation (Medium):** Attackers might exploit weaknesses.

**Impact:**
*   **ReDoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with testing and safe regex).
*   **Logic Errors in Validation:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with unit tests).
*   **Bypass of Intended Validation:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:** [Example: Unit tests for email validation in `src/utils/validation.test.js`, but incomplete.]

**Missing Implementation:** [Example: Postal code validation lacks tests. Add to `src/utils/validation.test.js`.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Display and Handle Form State Errors](./mitigation_strategies/display_and_handle_form_state_errors.md)

**Description:**
1.  Access `formState.errors` from `useForm`.
2.  Check `formState.errors` for each field.
3.  Display clear, user-friendly error messages next to fields with errors.
4.  Use prominent styling (red text, icons).
5.  Ensure accessibility (ARIA attributes).
6.  Implement error handling to prevent crashes or inconsistent states.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Poor User Experience (Low):** Users won't understand submission failures.
*   **Masking of Underlying Issues (Low):** Hidden errors hinder diagnosis.
* **Increased Support Costs (Low):** Users will need more support.

**Impact:**
*   **Poor User Experience:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
*   **Masking of Underlying Issues:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
* **Increased Support Costs:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

**Currently Implemented:** [Example: Basic error messages for required fields, but inconsistent styling and some messages are unclear.]

**Missing Implementation:** [Example: Product creation form lacks error messages for several fields. Add to `src/components/ProductForm.js`.]
