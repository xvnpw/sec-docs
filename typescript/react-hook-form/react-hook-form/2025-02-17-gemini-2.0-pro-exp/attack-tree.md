## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker's Goal: Manipulate Form Data/State](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal_manipulate_form_datastate.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's overarching objective is to control the data submitted by the form or the internal state of the application in a way that benefits them. This could involve submitting invalid data, injecting malicious code, or causing the application to behave unexpectedly.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the root of the entire attack tree and represents the ultimate aim of any malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 1: Bypass Validation](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_1_bypass_validation.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to submit data that *should* be rejected by the form's validation rules, but is not.

## Attack Tree Path: [A1: Override Validation Logic](./attack_tree_paths/a1_override_validation_logic.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker finds a way to circumvent the intended validation checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [(HIGH RISK) A1a: Manipulate Data After Client-Side Validation](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__a1a_manipulate_data_after_client-side_validation.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a timing window or race condition. They modify the form data *after* it has passed client-side validation (performed by `react-hook-form` or a resolver) but *before* it reaches the server for server-side validation (or before it's used if there's no server-side validation).
*   **Example:**
    1.  The user fills out a form, and `react-hook-form` validates the input.
    2.  The application uses `getValues()` to retrieve the validated data.
    3.  *Before* the data is sent to the server, the attacker intercepts the data (e.g., using browser developer tools or a malicious browser extension) and modifies it.
    4.  The modified, invalid data is then sent to the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [(HIGH RISK) A1b: Disable JavaScript](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__a1b_disable_javascript.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker disables JavaScript in their browser. This completely bypasses any client-side validation performed by `react-hook-form` (or any JavaScript-based validation).
*   **Example:** The attacker simply turns off JavaScript in their browser settings before interacting with the form.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Server-side validation *must* detect this)

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 2: Inject Malicious Data](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_2_inject_malicious_data.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to submit data that, while potentially passing validation, causes harm, typically through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [B1: XSS via Uncontrolled Input](./attack_tree_paths/b1_xss_via_uncontrolled_input.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a form field.  If the application then renders this data *without proper sanitization*, the attacker's code will execute in the context of other users' browsers.  `react-hook-form` manages the form data, but the vulnerability lies in how the application *uses* that data after retrieval.
*   **Example:**
    1.  The attacker enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a form field.
    2.  `react-hook-form` processes the input.
    3.  The application retrieves the data (e.g., using `getValues()`) and, *without sanitizing it*, displays it on a page (e.g., in a user profile, comment section, or error message).
    4.  When another user views that page, the attacker's script executes in their browser.
*   **Why Critical:** XSS is a very serious vulnerability that can lead to a wide range of attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, and website defacement. The "Uncontrolled Input" is the critical point of failure.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
