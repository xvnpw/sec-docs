# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, react-hook-form, is a library designed to simplify and optimize form handling in React applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a performant and developer-friendly way to manage forms in React.
  - Reduce boilerplate code associated with traditional React form handling.
  - Improve the user experience of web applications by ensuring efficient form interactions.
  - Achieve wide adoption within the React developer community as the go-to form library.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in react-hook-form could be exploited in numerous applications using the library, leading to widespread data breaches or application malfunctions.
  - Poor performance or bugs could lead to negative developer perception and hinder adoption.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could make the library unreliable and risky to use in production applications.
  - Legal and compliance risks if the library mishandles user data or introduces vulnerabilities that violate data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source - The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Community Contributions - Active community involvement in identifying and fixing bugs and potential security issues. Implemented in: GitHub community, pull requests, issue tracking.
  - security control: Unit Tests -  The project likely includes unit tests to ensure the functionality and robustness of the form handling logic. Implemented in: Project codebase, testing framework.
  - security control: TypeScript - Usage of TypeScript adds type safety, potentially reducing certain classes of errors and vulnerabilities. Implemented in: Project codebase, language choice.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Audits - Security is primarily reliant on community review rather than dedicated security audits.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by react-hook-form.
  - accepted risk: Lack of Formal Security Training for Contributors - Contributors may not have formal security training, potentially leading to unintentional security flaws.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Implement automated SAST tools in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Integrate dependency scanning tools to monitor and alert on known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
  - security control: Security Focused Code Reviews - Encourage security-focused code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions from new developers.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to allow security researchers to report issues responsibly.
  - security control: Regular Security Audits - Consider periodic security audits by external security experts, especially before major releases or when significant new features are added.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a front-end form library. Authentication is handled by the backend application consuming data from forms.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a front-end form library. Authorization is handled by the backend application based on the submitted form data and user context.
  - Input Validation:
    - security requirement: react-hook-form must provide robust and flexible input validation mechanisms to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection if form data is directly used in backend queries).
    - security requirement: Validation should be configurable and extensible to handle various data types and validation rules.
    - security requirement: Error messages should be clear and informative to guide developers in implementing secure validation.
  - Cryptography:
    - security requirement: While react-hook-form itself may not directly implement cryptography, it should not hinder or prevent developers from implementing encryption for sensitive data within forms if needed (e.g., using HTTPS for transmission, or client-side encryption before submission).
    - security requirement: If the library handles sensitive data internally (e.g., in memory), ensure secure handling and prevent unintended exposure.

## DEPLOYMENT

react-hook-form is a JavaScript library, and its deployment is primarily about making it available to developers for use in their React applications. The library itself doesn't have a deployment infrastructure in the traditional sense. It's published to package registries. The applications using it are then deployed in various ways.

Here we will describe the deployment of react-hook-form library to npm registry.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure form data handling in web applications built using react-hook-form.
  - Maintaining developer trust and adoption of react-hook-form as a reliable and secure library.
  - Ensuring the integrity and availability of the react-hook-form package in the npm registry.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of react-hook-form: Confidentiality and integrity are important to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of potential vulnerabilities. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on the impact of a breach).
  - npm package of react-hook-form: Integrity and availability are crucial to ensure developers can reliably use the library. Sensitivity: High (as compromised package can affect many applications).
  - User input data handled by forms in applications using react-hook-form: Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the application and the type of data collected (e.g., personal information, financial data, etc.). Sensitivity: Low to High (application dependent).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the risk appetite of the target audience for applications using react-hook-form (e.g., startups, Fortune 500 companies)? This will influence the required level of security rigor.
  - Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that applications using react-hook-form need to adhere to?
  - What types of data are typically handled by forms built with react-hook-form in the intended use cases? (e.g., mostly public data, or sensitive personal/financial data?)
  - Are there any known past security incidents or vulnerabilities related to react-hook-form or similar form libraries?

- Assumptions:
  - react-hook-form is primarily used in client-side React applications.
  - Security responsibility is shared between the react-hook-form library and the developers using it.
  - The primary security concern is preventing vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited in applications using it, especially related to input validation and data handling.
  - The project aims for wide adoption and developer-friendliness, so security measures should be balanced with usability and performance.
  - The project relies on community contributions and open-source principles for security review and improvements.
