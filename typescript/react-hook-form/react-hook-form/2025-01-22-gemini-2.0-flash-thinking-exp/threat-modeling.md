# Threat Model Analysis for react-hook-form/react-hook-form

## Threat: [Client-Side Validation Bypass](./threats/client-side_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate client-side validation implemented by `react-hook-form` using browser tools or request interception. They submit modified form data directly to the server, bypassing client-side checks enforced by `react-hook-form`.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, backend application errors, potential exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities due to processing invalid data that `react-hook-form` was intended to prevent client-side.
*   **Affected Component:** `useForm` (validation rules, form submission process).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory server-side validation:** Always validate all form inputs on the server, regardless of client-side validation.
    *   **Treat client-side validation as UX only:** Do not rely on `react-hook-form`'s client-side validation for security.
    *   **Server-side validation parity:** Ensure server-side validation is equally or more strict than client-side rules defined in `react-hook-form`.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** `react-hook-form` or its dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if the library and its dependencies are not updated promptly.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for various impacts depending on the vulnerability, ranging from denial of service to more severe exploits. While direct remote code execution via a front-end form library dependency is less common, it remains a software supply chain risk.
*   **Affected Component:** Dependencies of `react-hook-form` (indirectly affects the application using `react-hook-form`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (Severity can become High or Critical depending on the specific dependency vulnerability discovered).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular updates:** Keep `react-hook-form` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    *   **Dependency scanning:** Utilize tools like `npm audit`, `Yarn audit`, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check to monitor and identify dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   **Patching process:** Establish a process to quickly address and patch any identified dependency vulnerabilities.

**Important Note:** While Dependency Vulnerabilities are listed as Medium to High, if a *critical* vulnerability is found in a direct or transitive dependency of `react-hook-form`, the risk severity for applications using the vulnerable version would become *Critical*. Continuous monitoring and timely updates are crucial.
