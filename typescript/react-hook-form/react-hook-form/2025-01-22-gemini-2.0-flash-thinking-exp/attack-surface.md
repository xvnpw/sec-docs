# Attack Surface Analysis for react-hook-form/react-hook-form

## Attack Surface: [Custom Validation Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_validation_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

### Description:
High severity vulnerabilities arising from insecure or flawed custom validation functions implemented using React Hook Form's API, leading to direct exploitation.

### How React Hook Form Contributes:
React Hook Form's `validate` option and custom validation function capabilities allow developers to introduce their own validation logic.  Insecurely implemented custom validation becomes a direct attack vector within the form processing flow managed by React Hook Form.

### Example:
A custom validation function within `react-hook-form` uses a regular expression vulnerable to ReDoS. An attacker crafts input to a form field validated by this function, causing a Denial of Service by overloading the regex engine during form validation triggered by React Hook Form's submission process. Another example is a custom validator that concatenates user input into an error message without proper encoding, leading to XSS when React Hook Form displays this error message.

### Impact:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Critical if it allows account takeover or sensitive data access. Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) - High if it disrupts application availability.

### Risk Severity:
Critical to High

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Security Review of Custom Validators:**  Mandatory security review and testing of all custom validation functions implemented within React Hook Form. Focus on input sanitization, output encoding, and regex complexity.
*   **Utilize Secure Validation Libraries:**  Prefer using well-established and security-audited validation libraries for complex validation rules within custom validators instead of writing from scratch.
*   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding in Validators:**  Strictly sanitize user inputs within custom validation functions and encode any dynamic content included in validation error messages to prevent XSS.
*   **ReDoS Prevention:**  Avoid complex regular expressions in custom validators or thoroughly test them for ReDoS vulnerabilities. Consider using alternative validation methods if regex complexity is unavoidable.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Bugs in Complex Form Handling Leading to Security Bypass](./attack_surfaces/logic_bugs_in_complex_form_handling_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

### Description:
Critical security vulnerabilities arising from logic errors in complex form implementations built with React Hook Form, where these errors directly bypass intended security controls.

### How React Hook Form Contributes:
While React Hook Form simplifies form management, complex forms with conditional logic, dynamic fields, and intricate submission flows, orchestrated using React Hook Form's API, can still contain logic flaws. These flaws, when exploited, can directly undermine security mechanisms within the application's form-driven workflows.

### Example:
A form built with React Hook Form controls user role assignment. Due to a logic error in conditional validation or submission handling within the React Hook Form setup, an attacker manipulates form inputs to bypass role validation checks. This allows them to submit the form and gain elevated privileges they should not possess, directly exploiting a flaw in the form logic managed by React Hook Form.

### Impact:
Privilege Escalation - Critical if attackers gain unauthorized administrative or higher-level access. Authentication Bypass - Critical if form logic flaws circumvent authentication mechanisms. Authorization Bypass - Critical if form logic flaws circumvent authorization checks, leading to unauthorized data access or actions.

### Risk Severity:
Critical

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Rigorous Testing of Complex Forms:**  Extensive and rigorous testing of complex forms built with React Hook Form, specifically focusing on conditional logic, dynamic fields, and submission flows. Include security-focused test cases to identify potential bypasses.
*   **Security-Focused Code Reviews:**  Mandatory security-focused code reviews for all complex form implementations using React Hook Form. Reviews should specifically analyze form logic for potential security vulnerabilities and bypass opportunities.
*   **Formal Verification (Where Applicable):** For highly critical forms controlling sensitive operations, consider formal verification techniques to mathematically prove the correctness and security of the form logic implemented with React Hook Form.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege in Form Design:** Design forms and associated logic following the principle of least privilege. Minimize the impact of potential logic flaws by limiting the actions and data accessible through form interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitable Default Values in Security-Sensitive Contexts](./attack_surfaces/exploitable_default_values_in_security-sensitive_contexts.md)

### Description:
High severity vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of default values within React Hook Form in security-sensitive contexts, leading to unintended actions or unauthorized access due to reliance on exploitable defaults.

### How React Hook Form Contributes:
React Hook Form's `defaultValues` feature allows pre-populating form fields. When used carelessly for security-critical parameters, these defaults can become exploitable if they control access, permissions, or trigger sensitive operations without explicit user awareness or modification.

### Example:
A hidden form field in a React Hook Form, intended to control resource access, is initialized with a default value granting elevated permissions. An attacker understands this default behavior and submits the form without modifying the hidden field, relying on the default value to gain unauthorized access to resources.  The vulnerability stems from using React Hook Form's default value feature in a security-sensitive manner.

### Impact:
Unauthorized Access - High if default values are exploited to bypass access controls. Privilege Escalation - High if default values lead to unintended privilege elevation. Unintended Actions - High if default values trigger sensitive operations without explicit user consent or awareness.

### Risk Severity:
High

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Avoid Default Values for Security-Critical Parameters:**  Do not use React Hook Form's `defaultValues` for form fields that control security-sensitive parameters like access levels, permissions, or critical operational flags.
*   **Explicit User Input for Security Decisions:**  Force explicit user input and validation for all security-related decisions within forms. Do not rely on defaults for authorization or access control.
*   **Principle of Least Default:**  When default values are necessary, adhere to the principle of least default. Ensure defaults are as restrictive and safe as possible, minimizing potential security impact if exploited.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate developers on the security risks associated with using default values in forms, especially within security-sensitive contexts when using libraries like React Hook Form.
