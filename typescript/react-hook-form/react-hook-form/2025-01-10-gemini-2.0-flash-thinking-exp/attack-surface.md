# Attack Surface Analysis for react-hook-form/react-hook-form

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Client-Side Validation](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_client-side_validation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers circumvent the validation rules defined within React Hook Form, submitting invalid or malicious data.
*   **How React Hook Form Contributes:**  Validation logic primarily resides on the client-side, defined and executed by React Hook Form in the browser. This makes it inherently susceptible to manipulation by a determined attacker who can control their browser environment and bypass the `register` function's intended behavior.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses browser developer tools to remove the `required` attribute or modify the validation pattern of an input field managed by `register` before submitting the form.
*   **Impact:**  Submission of invalid data leading to application errors, data corruption, or the introduction of malicious content into the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always implement robust server-side validation:** Never rely solely on client-side validation provided by React Hook Form. Verify all data on the server before processing or storing it.
    *   **Sanitize and validate data on the server:** Use server-side libraries and techniques to sanitize and validate all incoming data, regardless of client-side checks performed by React Hook Form.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection through Default Values from Untrusted Sources](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_through_default_values_from_untrusted_sources.md)

*   **Description:** If default values for form fields managed by React Hook Form are dynamically populated from untrusted sources, attackers can inject malicious data.
*   **How React Hook Form Contributes:** React Hook Form allows setting default values for form fields using the `defaultValue` property within the `register` function's configuration. If these defaults are derived from sources like URL parameters or local storage without proper sanitization *before* being passed to `register`, it creates a vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A form field's default value, managed by `register`, is taken directly from a URL parameter. An attacker crafts a URL with malicious JavaScript in the parameter value, which gets injected into the form when React Hook Form renders the input with the default value.
*   **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the injected data is rendered without proper sanitization, or the submission of malicious data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using untrusted sources for default values:** If unavoidable, sanitize and validate the data from these sources *before* setting it as the `defaultValue` in `register`.
    *   **Explicitly set default values in your code:** Prefer hardcoding default values or fetching them from trusted sources and then providing them to `register`.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `handleSubmit` Callback](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__handlesubmit__callback.md)

*   **Description:**  Security issues within the callback function provided to `handleSubmit` can be exploited.
*   **How React Hook Form Contributes:**  `handleSubmit` executes a user-defined callback function after successful client-side validation managed by React Hook Form. If this callback contains vulnerabilities, React Hook Form facilitates its execution with potentially malicious or unvalidated data that passed the client-side checks.
*   **Example:** The `handleSubmit` callback directly manipulates the DOM using user-provided data obtained from the form (managed by React Hook Form) without sanitization, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability within the callback function, potentially leading to XSS, data manipulation, or other security issues.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure coding practices in `handleSubmit` callback:**  Apply the same security rigor to the `handleSubmit` callback as to any other part of your application. Sanitize user input obtained from the form (managed by React Hook Form) before using it to manipulate the DOM or perform other actions.
    *   **Follow the principle of least privilege:** Ensure the callback function only has the necessary permissions and access to resources.
