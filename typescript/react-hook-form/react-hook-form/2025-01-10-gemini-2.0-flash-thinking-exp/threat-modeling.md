# Threat Model Analysis for react-hook-form/react-hook-form

## Threat: [Data Tampering via `setValue` and `reset`](./threats/data_tampering_via__setvalue__and__reset_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities or unintended logic in the application's code that uses `setValue` or `reset`. For example, if `setValue` is used to populate form fields based on URL parameters without proper sanitization, an attacker could craft a malicious URL to inject arbitrary data into the form. Similarly, if `reset` is used in a way that exposes sensitive default values, an attacker observing network requests could gain access to this information. This directly involves the `setValue` and `reset` methods provided by `react-hook-form`.

**Impact:** Injection of malicious data leading to unexpected application behavior, data corruption, or potential exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities. Exposure of sensitive default values.

**Affected Component:** The `setValue` and `reset` methods provided by the `useForm` hook.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully validate and sanitize any external data used with `setValue`.
* Avoid using `setValue` to directly set values based on untrusted sources without validation.
* Review the logic where `reset` is used to ensure it doesn't inadvertently expose sensitive information.
* Implement proper access controls and authorization to prevent unauthorized modification of form data.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Error Messages](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_error_messages.md)

**Description:** If custom validation logic within `react-hook-form` incorporates user-provided input directly into error messages without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code. This code would then be executed in the victim's browser when the error message is displayed. This directly relates to how `react-hook-form` handles and displays validation errors.

**Impact:**  Execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.

**Affected Component:** The error message rendering logic and potentially custom validation functions integrated with `react-hook-form`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize user-provided input before including it in error messages.
* Utilize secure templating mechanisms or escape HTML entities when displaying error messages.
* Avoid directly embedding user input in error message strings.
