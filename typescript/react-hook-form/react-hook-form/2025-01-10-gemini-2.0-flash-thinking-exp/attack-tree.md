## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Client-Side Bypass leading to XSS](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_client-side_bypass_leading_to_xss.md)

**Bypass Client-Side Validation:**
* **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the client-side environment (e.g., using browser developer tools, intercepting network requests) to bypass the validation rules implemented by `react-hook-form`. This could involve:
    * Removing HTML attributes like `required` or `pattern` from input fields.
    * Submitting the form before asynchronous validation completes.
    * Exploiting logical flaws in custom validation functions.
* **Risk:**  Bypassing client-side validation allows the attacker to submit data that the application is not intended to process, potentially containing malicious payloads.

**Inject Malicious Payloads (Critical Node):**
* **Attack Vector:**  Having bypassed client-side validation, the attacker injects malicious scripts or code into form fields. This could be JavaScript code intended for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **Risk:** Successful injection of malicious payloads can lead to a wide range of attacks, including:
    * Stealing user session cookies and hijacking accounts.
    * Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    * Defacing the application.
    * Injecting malware.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Input Fields (Critical Node):**
* **Attack Vector:** The injected malicious script is not properly sanitized or encoded by the server-side application when it's stored or displayed to other users.
* **Risk:**  XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, leading to:
    * Account compromise.
    * Data theft.
    * Spread of malicious content.

**Store XSS in Application Data via Unsanitized Input:**
* **Attack Vector:** The malicious script injected through the form is stored in the application's database or other persistent storage without proper sanitization. When this data is later retrieved and displayed to other users, the script is executed in their browsers.
* **Risk:** Stored XSS is particularly dangerous as it affects all users who view the compromised data, leading to widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Triggering Server-Side Errors with Unexpected Data](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_triggering_server-side_errors_with_unexpected_data.md)

**Trigger Server-Side Errors or Unexpected Behavior (Critical Node):**
* **Attack Vector:** An attacker submits form data that the server-side application is not prepared to handle. This can occur due to:
    * Lack of server-side validation complementing client-side validation.
    * Insufficient error handling on the server.
    * Sending data in unexpected formats or data types.
* **Risk:** Triggering server-side errors can lead to:
    * Information disclosure through error messages.
    * Denial-of-service (DoS) if the server crashes or becomes overloaded.
    * Unintended application behavior that can be further exploited.

**Send Unexpected Data Types or Formats:**
* **Attack Vector:**  The attacker crafts form submissions with data that deviates from the expected format or data type. For example, sending a string when an integer is expected, or sending a large amount of data to overflow buffers.
* **Risk:**  If the server-side application does not properly validate and handle these unexpected inputs, it can lead to errors, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Misconfigured Validation Schema](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_misconfigured_validation_schema.md)

**Misconfiguration of Validation Schema:**
* **Attack Vector:** Developers define insecure or insufficient validation rules within `react-hook-form` or the associated validation library (e.g., `yup`, `zod`). This can involve:
    * Missing validation rules for certain fields.
    * Using overly permissive regular expressions.
    * Failing to validate data types or lengths.
* **Risk:**  A misconfigured validation schema allows attackers to submit invalid or malicious data that should have been blocked, potentially leading to various vulnerabilities depending on how the data is processed on the server.
