### Combined Vulnerability Report: Malicious Configuration Injection Vulnerability

This report consolidates findings from multiple vulnerability analyses to provide a comprehensive description of a malicious configuration injection vulnerability in the Live Server Web Extension. This vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and security measures when handling user-provided and externally injected configurations, leading to potential Remote Code Execution (via malicious content injection) and Open Redirect.

#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Malicious Configuration Injection Leading to Remote Code Execution and Open Redirect

#### 2. Description:

The Live Server Web Extension is vulnerable to malicious configuration injection through multiple pathways, primarily due to a lack of input validation and sender verification. This can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the extension's behavior, leading to the execution of malicious content and potential open redirect scenarios. The vulnerability can be triggered via the following steps:

##### 2.1. Configuration via Popup UI (Lack of Input Validation):

1.  The extension's popup UI allows users to configure "Actual Server Address" and "Live Server Address".
2.  User-provided URLs in these fields are directly passed to the background script without any validation or sanitization.
3.  The background script stores these URLs in `chrome.storage.local` without any checks.
4.  The `reload.js` script retrieves the "Live Server Address" from storage and establishes a WebSocket connection.
5.  If a user is tricked into entering a malicious WebSocket URL as the "Live Server Address" via the popup, the extension will connect to this attacker-controlled server.
6.  Similarly, if a malicious "Actual Server Address" is configured (either maliciously entered by the user or injected through other means), it can be exploited during reloads.
7.  When the malicious WebSocket server sends a 'reload' or 'refreshcss' message, the extension reloads the current webpage.
8.  If the "Actual Server Address" is also malicious (or a legitimate server compromised or controlled by the attacker), the reloaded page can serve malicious content.
9.  This configuration persists, leading to persistent exposure to malicious content or redirection every time a reload is triggered.

##### 2.2. Configuration Injection via Unauthenticated Messaging:

1.  The extension's background script listens for messages on the `chrome.runtime.onMessage` channel.
2.  It processes messages with `req: 'set-live-server-config'` without verifying the message sender's origin or identity.
3.  An attacker, through a malicious webpage (if `externally_connectable` permission is granted) or a malicious sibling extension, can send a crafted message to the background script.
4.  This message can contain malicious configuration data within the `data` field, including attacker-controlled URLs for `liveServerUrl` and `actualUrl`.
5.  The background script blindly accepts and stores this configuration in `chrome.storage.local`.
6.  The injected configuration is then broadcast to content scripts, including `reload.js`.
7.  `reload.js` uses the attacker-controlled `liveServerUrl` to establish a WebSocket connection to the attacker's server.
8.  Upon receiving a 'reload' or 'refreshcss' message from the malicious WebSocket server, and depending on the configuration (proxy setup and `actualUrl`), the extension may trigger `window.location.reload()`.
9.  If the `actualUrl` is also maliciously configured, or if proxy setup is enabled, this reload can lead to an open redirect to an attacker-controlled domain or the execution of malicious content from the attacker-controlled "Actual Server Address".

#### 3. Impact:

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences:

*   **Remote Code Execution (via Malicious Content Injection):** By controlling the "Actual Server Address", an attacker can serve malicious HTML, JavaScript, or other content. When the extension triggers a reload, the browser loads this malicious content, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS), drive-by downloads, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Open Redirect:**  By manipulating the "Actual Server Address", an attacker can redirect users to arbitrary websites. This can be used for phishing attacks, where users are redirected to fake login pages to steal credentials, or to spread malware by redirecting users to download malicious files.
*   **Denial of Service/User Experience Disruption:**  A malicious WebSocket server can continuously send 'reload' messages, causing the webpage to reload endlessly, disrupting the user's workflow and potentially leading to denial of service.
*   **Compromised Development Environment:** For developers using this extension, a compromised configuration can undermine the security of their development environment, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive information or further attacks.

The overall impact is considered **high** due to the potential for remote code execution and open redirect, which can lead to a wide range of severe security breaches.

#### 4. Vulnerability Rank: High

#### 5. Currently Implemented Mitigations:

None. The extension currently lacks any input validation or sanitization for user-provided URLs in the popup UI or any sender verification for messages received via `chrome.runtime.onMessage`. Configuration values, including URLs, are accepted and processed without any security checks.

#### 6. Missing Mitigations:

To effectively mitigate this vulnerability, the following security measures are essential:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization in Popup UI (`popup/popup.js`):**
    *   Implement robust input validation for "Actual Server Address" and "Live Server Address" in the `submitForm` function within `popup/popup.js` before sending data to the background script.
    *   Validate URL formats to ensure they are well-formed and adhere to expected protocols (e.g., `http://`, `https://`, `ws://`, `wss://`).
    *   Sanitize URLs to prevent injection of malicious characters or code.
*   **Sender Verification for Messages (`background.js`):**
    *   Implement sender verification in the `chrome.runtime.onMessage` listener in `background.js`.
    *   Check the `sender` object to ensure that messages are only processed if they originate from trusted sources within the extension itself.
    *   If external messaging is intended, implement a strict allowlist of allowed origins in the extension manifest or within the background script, and validate the sender's origin against this allowlist.
*   **URL Validation in `reload.js`:**
    *   Validate the `actualUrl` and `liveServerUrl` retrieved from configuration within `reload.js` before using them.
    *   Use secure URL parsing and comparison functions to prevent bypasses due to URL normalization or encoding issues.
    *   Consider restricting allowed protocols for "Actual Server Address" and "Live Server Address" to `http://` and `https://` (for "Actual Server Address") and `http://`, `https://`, `ws://`, `wss://` (for "Live Server Address"), and potentially enforce domain restrictions.
*   **User Warnings:**
    *   Implement warnings in the popup UI to inform users when they are configuring the extension to connect to WebSocket servers on different domains than the current page or outside of `localhost`.
    *   Consider prompting users for confirmation before applying configuration changes that involve non-standard or potentially risky settings.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Review the necessity of external connectivity and messaging. If external messaging is not required, restrict it in the manifest to minimize the attack surface.

#### 7. Preconditions:

The following conditions must be met for successful exploitation:

*   **User Installs Vulnerable Extension:** The target user must have the vulnerable "Live Server Web Extension" installed and enabled in their browser.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:**
    *   **For UI Vector:** The attacker must trick the user into manually entering malicious URLs into the extension's popup UI for "Actual Server Address" or "Live Server Address". Social engineering tactics might be employed for this.
    *   **For Messaging Vector:** The attacker must be able to send messages to the extension's background script. This requires either:
        *   The extension's manifest allows external connections ( `externally_connectable` permission). In this case, a malicious webpage can send messages.
        *   The attacker controls or can install a malicious sibling extension that can use `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to communicate with the vulnerable extension.
*   **Target Page Visit:** The user must be browsing a webpage that will be affected by the malicious configuration. For the open redirect scenario (if proxy setup is disabled), the page URL must start with the malicious "Actual Server Address". If proxy setup is enabled, any page can be affected.
*   **Reload Trigger:** A 'reload' or 'refreshcss' message needs to be sent by the malicious WebSocket server to trigger the vulnerable `reloadWindow` function within the extension. This message is typically initiated by the attacker-controlled WebSocket server after a connection is established.

#### 8. Source Code Analysis:

The vulnerability is evident in the following code sections:

##### 8.1. `popup/popup.js` (Configuration Submission - No Validation):

```javascript
function submitForm() {
    const formData = {
        isEnable: liveReloadCheck.checked,
        proxySetup: !noProxyCheckBox.checked,
        actualUrl: actualServerAddress.value || '',
        liveServerUrl: liveServerAddress.value || ''
    }

    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
        req: 'set-live-server-config',
        data: formData
    });
}
```
**Analysis:** This code directly takes user inputs from `actualServerAddress.value` and `liveServerAddress.value` without any validation and sends them as part of a message to the background script.

##### 8.2. `background.js` (Configuration Storage - No Validation or Sender Check):

```javascript
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((msg, sender, sendResponse) => {
    if (typeof msg !== 'object') return;
    if (msg.req === 'set-live-server-config') {
        storeConfigToLocalStorage(msg.data);
        sendMsgToAllContainPage('live-server-config-updated', msg.data);
    }
    // ... other message handlers
    return true; //Keep the callback(sendResponse) active
});

function storeConfigToLocalStorage(data) {
    return chrome.storage.local.set({ [SETUP_STRING]: data || {} })
}
```
**Analysis:** The `onMessage` listener processes `'set-live-server-config'` messages without any sender verification or validation of `msg.data`. The `storeConfigToLocalStorage` function then directly stores this unvalidated data into `chrome.storage.local`.

##### 8.3. `reload.js` (WebSocket Connection and Reload - Vulnerable URL Usage):

```javascript
function init(data) {
    if (!data.proxySetup) {
        if (data.liveServerUrl.indexOf('http') !== 0)
            data.liveServerUrl = 'http' + data.liveServerUrl;
        if (data.actualUrl.indexOf('http') !== 0)
            data.actualUrl = 'http' + data.actualUrl;
        if (!data.actualUrl.endsWith('/'))
            data.actualUrl = data.actualUrl + '/';

        address = data.liveServerUrl.replace('http', 'ws') + '/ws';
    }
    socket = new WebSocket(address); // Vulnerable WebSocket connection
    socket.onmessage = (msg) => {
        reloadWindow(msg, data)
    };
}

function reloadWindow(msg, data) {
    if (!isActive) return;
    const currentUrl = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host + window.location.pathname;
    if (msg.data == 'reload' || msg.data == 'refreshcss') {
        if (data.proxySetup === true || (data.proxySetup === false && currentUrl.startsWith(data.actualUrl))) {
            window.location.reload(); // Potential Open Redirect/Malicious Content Load
        }
    }
    // ...
};
```
**Analysis:** The `init` function uses the unvalidated `data.liveServerUrl` to create a WebSocket connection. The `reloadWindow` function uses `data.actualUrl` in a `startsWith` check and triggers `window.location.reload()`, creating the potential for open redirect or malicious content loading if these URLs are attacker-controlled.

#### 9. Security Test Case:

This test case demonstrates both configuration methods and their potential impact.

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Install the Live Server Web Extension in a test browser environment (e.g., Chrome with a separate profile).
    *   Set up a malicious WebSocket server using `wscat -l 8080` (or a similar tool). This server will send the message `'reload'` upon connection.
    *   Set up a simple HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` on port 80) serving a malicious HTML page (as described in the initial vulnerability list, with a JavaScript alert). Let's say the malicious server is at `http://malicious.example.com` and the malicious page is served at `/malicious.html`.
2.  **Configuration Injection via Popup UI:**
    *   Open the extension's popup.
    *   Set "Actual Server Address": `http://malicious.example.com`
    *   Set "Live Server Address": `http://localhost:8080` (or `http://<attacker-ip>:8080` if testing remotely)
    *   Ensure "No Proxy Setup" is checked.
    *   Click "Submit".
3.  **Configuration Injection via Messaging (Simulated):**
    *   Open the browser's developer console (for the extension's background page or any webpage if `externally_connectable` is true).
    *   Execute the following JavaScript code to inject malicious configuration via messaging:
        ```javascript
        chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
            req: 'set-live-server-config',
            data: {
              isEnable: true,
              proxySetup: false,
              liveServerUrl: 'http://localhost:8080', // or http://<attacker-ip>:8080
              actualUrl: 'http://malicious.example.com'
            }
        });
        ```
4.  **Trigger Vulnerability:**
    *   Open a new browser tab and navigate to any webpage (for open redirect, navigate to `http://malicious.example.com/somepage` or enable proxy setup and navigate to any site).
    *   Connect to the malicious WebSocket server (from step 1). The server will immediately send `'reload'` messages.
5.  **Observe Malicious Content and/or Redirect:**
    *   Observe that the webpage reloads.
    *   If "Actual Server Address" is set to `http://malicious.example.com` and you navigate to a path under it, upon reload, you should be redirected to `http://malicious.example.com` and the malicious content served from there (e.g., the JavaScript alert) will be executed.
    *   If you navigate to any site with proxy enabled and the "Actual Server Address" is malicious, the reload might still lead to unexpected behavior depending on how the "Actual Server Address" is used when proxy is enabled (this needs further code analysis).

This test case demonstrates that by injecting malicious configurations through either the UI or messaging channels, an attacker can influence the extension's behavior to load malicious content or redirect the user to attacker-controlled websites.
