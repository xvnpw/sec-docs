### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Potential Open Redirect via Malicious Configuration

*   **Description:**
    1.  The Live Server Web Extension allows users to configure the "Actual Server Address" and "Live Server Address" through the extension popup.
    2.  This configuration, including the "Actual Server Address" (`actualUrl`), is stored in the extension's local storage.
    3.  In `reload.js`, when a WebSocket message "reload" or "refreshcss" is received, the extension checks if a reload is necessary.
    4.  If proxy setup is disabled, the extension checks if the current page URL (`currentUrl`) starts with the configured `actualUrl`.
    5.  If this condition is true, or if proxy setup is enabled, the extension performs `window.location.reload()`.
    6.  If an attacker can somehow manipulate the stored `actualUrl` to point to a malicious website, and then trick a user into visiting a page that starts with this malicious URL (or if proxy setup is enabled, which bypasses the URL check), the `window.location.reload()` will effectively redirect the user to the attacker-controlled website.
    7.  While direct external manipulation of extension storage is generally restricted, vulnerabilities in other parts of the browser or extension ecosystem could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious configurations into the extension's storage. This could lead to an open redirect vulnerability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   High. An attacker could potentially redirect users of the extension to a malicious website. This could be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities. By redirecting users to a fake login page or a page that resembles a trusted site, attackers can steal credentials or sensitive information.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:** High

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None in the provided code. The extension relies on user-provided URLs without any input validation or sanitization on the `actualUrl` or `liveServerUrl` in `reload.js` or `popup.js`.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Input validation and sanitization for `actualUrl` and `liveServerUrl` in `popup.js` before storing them.
    *   URL validation in `reload.js` before using `actualUrl` for comparison.  Consider validating the format of the URL and potentially restricting the allowed protocols to `http` and `https`.
    *   Consider using URL parsing and comparison functions to avoid issues with URL normalization and encoding.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The user must have the "Live Server - Web Extension" installed.
    *   An attacker needs to find a way to manipulate the configuration stored in the extension's local storage, specifically the `actualUrl` value. This might be achieved through a separate vulnerability in the browser, another extension, or a compromised website interacting with the extension (though no such interaction is directly apparent in the provided code). For the purpose of demonstrating the vulnerability within the extension's logic, we assume the attacker has managed to set a malicious `actualUrl`.
    *   The user must be browsing a page whose URL starts with the attacker-controlled `actualUrl` (if proxy setup is disabled) or any page if proxy setup is enabled.
    *   The VS Code Live Server extension (or any other mechanism) needs to trigger a "reload" or "refreshcss" WebSocket message.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    1.  **Configuration Storage (`background.js`, `popup/popup.js`):**
        *   `popup/popup.js` captures user input for "Actual Server Address" and "Live Server Address" from the popup UI.
        *   These values are sent to `background.js` via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` with the request `set-live-server-config`.
        *   `background.js` in `storeConfigToLocalStorage` function stores this data in `chrome.storage.local` without any validation or sanitization.

        ```javascript
        // popup/popup.js
        function submitForm() {
            const formData = {
                isEnable: liveReloadCheck.checked,
                proxySetup: !noProxyCheckBox.checked,
                actualUrl: actualServerAddress.value || '',
                liveServerUrl: liveServerAddress.value || ''
            }

            chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
                req: 'set-live-server-config',
                data: formData
            });
        }

        // background.js
        function storeConfigToLocalStorage(data) {
            // return promise
            return chrome.storage.local.set({ [SETUP_STRING]: data || {} })
        }
        ```

    2.  **URL Comparison and Reload (`reload.js`):**
        *   In `reload.js`, the `reloadWindow` function checks the condition for reloading based on `data.proxySetup` and `data.actualUrl`.
        *   If proxy is disabled, it uses `currentUrl.startsWith(data.actualUrl)` to determine if reload should happen.
        *   If the condition is met, `window.location.reload()` is called, which will redirect the page to the URL specified in `actualUrl` if `actualUrl` is a full URL (e.g., `http://malicious.example.com`).

        ```javascript
        // reload.js
        function reloadWindow(msg, data) {
            if (!isActive) return;
            const currentUrl = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host + window.location.pathname;
            if (msg.data == 'reload' || msg.data == 'refreshcss') {
                if (data.proxySetup === true || (data.proxySetup === false && currentUrl.startsWith(data.actualUrl))) {
                    window.location.reload(); // Potential Open Redirect
                }
            }
            // ...
        };
        ```

*   **Security Test Case:**

    1.  Install the "Live Server - Web Extension" in a browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).
    2.  Open the extension's popup UI by clicking on its icon.
    3.  In the popup, uncheck the "No Proxy Setup" checkbox to enable "Actual Server Address" and "Live Server Address" fields.
    4.  In the "Actual Server Address" field, enter a malicious URL, for example: `http://malicious.example.com`. Keep the "Live Server Address" as default or any valid address. Click "Submit".
    5.  Open a new browser tab and navigate to a website whose URL starts with the malicious URL you entered. For example, if you entered `http://malicious.example.com`, you can try to navigate to `http://malicious.example.com/testpage.html` (even if this page doesn't actually exist). Or, for easier testing, you can use a public website that you know will trigger the condition, for example, if you set `actualUrl` to `https://example.com`, navigate to `https://example.com`.
    6.  Trigger a "reload" event. This would typically be done by the VS Code Live Server extension sending a WebSocket message when a file is saved in VS Code. For testing purposes, you might need to simulate this WebSocket message.  (For simpler testing, you can manually trigger the reload by modifying the extension's code to force a reload message).
    7.  Observe that the browser page is redirected to the malicious URL (`http://malicious.example.com`) specified in the "Actual Server Address", even though the original page URL might be different (as long as it starts with the malicious URL or proxy is enabled).

    **Note:** For a real external attacker scenario, step 4 would involve finding a way to programmatically set the `actualUrl` in the extension's local storage, which is not directly possible from a webpage without exploiting another vulnerability. This test case focuses on demonstrating the open redirect logic *within* the extension once a malicious configuration is in place.
