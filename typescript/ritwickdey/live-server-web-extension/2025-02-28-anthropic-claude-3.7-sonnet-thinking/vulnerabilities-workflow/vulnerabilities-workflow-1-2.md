# Updated List of High-Risk Vulnerabilities

## Supply Chain Code Injection via Manipulated Repository

- **Description:**  
  An attacker who controls the repository (or provides a manipulated repository to the victim) can modify core extension files (such as `background.js`, `reload.js`, or `popup.js`) to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. Here's how an attacker can trigger this vulnerability step by step:  
  1. **Preparation:** The attacker crafts a malicious version of the repository by inserting a payload (for example, code that logs sensitive data or triggers an alert) into one or more of the extension's script files.  
  2. **Distribution:** The attacker supplies this manipulated repository (or convinces the victim to clone or install it as an unpacked extension).  
  3. **Installation:** The victim installs the extension from the manipulated repository without any integrity or signature verification.  
  4. **Execution:** When the extension loads (in its background script or via the reload functionality), the injected code executes immediately with the same privileges as the legitimate code.  

- **Impact:**  
  Because the malicious code runs in the context of the browser extension, an attacker could achieve full remote code execution (RCE) within the extension's security context. This could lead to:  
  • Theft or manipulation of sensitive configuration data  
  • Unauthorized control over browser behavior  
  • Potential pivoting to further compromise the host system via extended exploitation chains

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • **Integrity Verification:** None. The project files are loaded and executed as provided without any check for authenticity or integrity.  
  • **Code Signing:** There is no built‑in mechanism within the repository or the extension's loading process that validates code signing.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Implementation of strict code signing and integrity checks for any code loaded as part of the extension  
  • Enforcing installation only from trusted sources (for example, via the official Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add‑ons site, where digital signatures and review processes are present)  
  • Adding a runtime verification step (or build‑time pipeline) that would prevent modified sources from being accepted without review

- **Preconditions:**  
  • The victim must install the extension from the manipulated (i.e. non‑official or unpacked) repository rather than through an officially vetted distribution channel.  
  • The attacker must be able to distribute the modified repository (via social engineering, compromised GitHub links, etc.) so that the victim unwittingly loads the manipulated code.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • The project repository comprises several JavaScript files executed by the extension, including:  
  – **`background.js`:** Handles runtime messaging and sends configuration data to all browser tabs.  
  – **`reload.js`:** Establishes a WebSocket connection based on configuration values and handles reload commands.  
  – **`popup/popup.js`:** Manages the UI for setting and retrieving the configuration from Chrome storage.  
  • **Lack of Integrity Verification:** None of these files perform any self‑validation or signature checking. The files are loaded as received.  
  • **Injection Vector Visualization:**  
  1. **Repository Manipulation:**  
   Attacker modifies source files (e.g. prepends a payload in `background.js`) →  
  2. **Installation:**  
   Victim installs the extension from the manipulated repository →  
  3. **Execution:**  
   Injected payload executes immediately upon extension startup, thereby achieving RCE.  

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Repository Modification:** Take a clone of the project repository and modify one of the script files (for example, insert the following payload at the top of `background.js`):  
     ```js
     // Malicious payload inserted by attacker for testing
     console.log("ALERT: Malicious code executed!");
     // In a real exploit this could be replaced with code to exfiltrate data
     ```  
  2. **Installation:** Load this modified repository as an unpacked extension in a controlled (test) browser environment.  
  3. **Observation:** Verify that upon startup the extension immediately displays evidence of execution (e.g. the console shows "ALERT: Malicious code executed!" or an alert pops up if that payload is used).  
  4. **Result:** Confirm that the extension runs code from the repository without performing any integrity checks, proving the supply chain code injection vulnerability.
