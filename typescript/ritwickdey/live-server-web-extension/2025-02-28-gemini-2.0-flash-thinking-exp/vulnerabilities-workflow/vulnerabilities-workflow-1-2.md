Okay, I understand the instructions.

Based on the provided information:

## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities were found that meet the specified criteria for inclusion.

After a thorough review of the code and functionality, the extension appears to be designed with a focus on user-configured settings and local interactions. The identified potential misconfiguration issues do not qualify as high-rank security vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers without significant user-induced actions, which are outside the scope of this analysis.

Therefore, based on the current project files and the defined criteria, there are no vulnerabilities to list.
