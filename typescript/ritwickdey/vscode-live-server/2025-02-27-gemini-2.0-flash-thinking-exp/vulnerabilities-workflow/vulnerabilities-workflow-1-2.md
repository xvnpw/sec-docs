- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposed Live Server Interface (Unauthorized Access to Local Workspace Files)

  - **Description:**  
    The live server is configured to bind by default to the host address `'0.0.0.0'` (all network interfaces) rather than to the localhost interface (e.g. `127.0.0.1`). This means that when the extension is activated, the underlying static file server (built using the “live‐server” module) listens on all interfaces and is accessible not only locally but also from any device on the same network (or even externally if the network is misconfigured). As a result, an external attacker who can reach the machine via its network IP can browse the directory (using the directory‐listing middleware) and download files from the workspace—even files that may be sensitive or proprietary.

  - **Impact:**  
    - **Confidentiality breach:** An attacker can enumerate directories and retrieve files (source code, configuration, private data) stored in the workspace.  
    - **Unauthorized file disclosure:** Sensitive files may be exposed if the workspace contains credentials, proprietary code, or configuration details.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The extension does offer configuration options (such as setting the `liveServer.settings.host` outside of the default value) so that a user may force the server to bind only to localhost.  
    - An optional HTTP basic authentication mechanism exists via an `htpasswd` file if enabled—but it is not enabled by default.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - The project forces the live server parameters (via helper functions) to use host `"0.0.0.0"` by default.  
    - No default authentication or access control is imposed on the server endpoints.  
    - There is no IP whitelisting or network–level access control for requests to the server.

  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The developer has activated and started the live server extension with its default configuration (without overriding the host to, for example, `127.0.0.1`).  
    - The machine is connected to a network where an attacker (or any unauthorized party) can reach the IP address on which the live server is bound.  
    - The workspace directory being served may include sensitive files.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    1. In the file `lib/live-server/index.js` (used to start the static server), the server startup code begins with:  
       ```js
       var host = options.host || '0.0.0.0';
       ```  
       Since no other code forces the host to `127.0.0.1` when no explicit configuration is provided, the server listens on all network interfaces by default.
    2. In `src/Helper.ts` inside the `generateParams()` function, the parameters object returned to the live server always includes  
       ```js
       host: '0.0.0.0'
       ```  
       meaning that regardless of the developer’s workspace settings, the live server is exposing all network interfaces.
    3. The project further includes middleware (`serve-index`) that provides a listing of directory contents. This case implies that once connected, an attacker can enumerate and download files.

  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure that the live server is running on the target machine with default settings (host being `"0.0.0.0"`) and the developer’s workspace includes identifiable files (such as `README.md`).
    2. From an external machine on the same network, perform a port scan (using tools such as `nmap`) against the target machine’s IP address to detect open listening ports.
    3. Identify a port (e.g. 5500) on which the live server is running.
    4. Open a web browser on the external machine and navigate to:  
       `http://<target_IP>:<port>/`
    5. Observe that a directory listing is displayed (provided by the `serve-index` middleware).  
    6. Click on a file (for example, `README.md`) and verify that its contents are displayed.
    7. The successful enumeration and file download confirm the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Misconfigured Cross‐Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

  - **Description:**  
    The live server instance is set up to include the CORS middleware with a permissive configuration. The code always installs CORS with the options:  
    ```js
    app.use(require("cors")({
      origin: true, // reflecting request origin
      credentials: true // allowing requests with credentials
    }));
    ```  
    This configuration tells the browser to accept requests from any origin and includes credentials. As a result, when the live server is exposed (especially due to the 0.0.0.0 binding noted above), an attacker hosting a malicious webpage on an external domain can send AJAX (or fetch) requests to the live server and read its responses—including the contents of local files served from the workspace.

  - **Impact:**  
    - **Unauthorized data exfiltration:** An attacker can write a malicious script on a remote website that sends cross-origin requests to the live server, retrieving file contents that might reveal sensitive information from the workspace.  
    - **Bypass of same-origin restrictions:** The permissive CORS policy undermines browser security by allowing any origin with credentials to access files served by the extension.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - There is no additional check on the allowed origins. The CORS middleware is used in its default permissive mode (reflecting incoming Origin headers) with credentials enabled.
    - No default fallback authentication or checks are provided on the served endpoints.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - A stricter CORS policy should be implemented (for example, restricting accepted origins to localhost or trusted domains).  
    - Credentials should not be allowed unless absolutely necessary.  
    - An authentication mechanism should be enabled (or the CORS configuration should be tied to it) to ensure that even if resources are fetched via cross-origin requests, only authorized users can retrieve sensitive content.

  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The live server is running on a network-accessible machine with its default CORS settings as specified above.
    - An attacker is able to host or serve a web page under a domain different from that of the live server.
    - The live server is accessible over the network (for example, through the 0.0.0.0 binding).

  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    1. In the file `lib/live-server/index.js`, within the `LiveServer.start()` function, the code checks for a CORS flag and, if set, installs the middleware:  
       ```js
       if (cors) {
         app.use(require("cors")({
           origin: true,
           credentials: true
         }));
       }
       ```
    2. The `cors` option is derived from parameters passed in from the helper function (`generateParams()` in `src/Helper.ts`), meaning that by default CORS is enabled.
    3. Because `origin: true` reflects the incoming request’s origin and credentials are always allowed, any external site can send cross-origin requests to the server and access its responses.

  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Precondition:** Start the live server on the target machine (using the default settings with host set to `"0.0.0.0"`) so that it is reachable on the network.
    2. From an attacker-controlled machine, host a simple HTML page on a different domain (or using a local web server running on a non–localhost domain). The page should contain a script that sends an HTTP request (using `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`) to:  
       `http://<target_IP>:<port>/README.md`
    3. In the script, log the response status and data, and output the response text to verify its contents.
    4. Open the attacker's HTML page in a browser and observe that the script is able to successfully receive the file contents from the live server.
    5. The ability of the attacker's page to bypass normal same-origin restrictions and read the file content confirms the vulnerability.
