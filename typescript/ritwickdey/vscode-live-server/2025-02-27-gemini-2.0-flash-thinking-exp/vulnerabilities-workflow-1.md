#### Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Proxy Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can trick a user into configuring the `liveServer.settings.proxy.proxyUri` setting in VS Code.
    2. The user then starts the Live Server extension.
    3. When the Live Server receives a request matching the `baseUri` configured in the proxy settings, it will forward this request to the URL specified in `proxyUri`.
    4. If the attacker controlled the `proxyUri` configuration, they can make the Live Server act as a proxy to any URL they specify.
    5. This allows the attacker to potentially access internal network resources or external resources that the user's machine has access to.

- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can use the Live Server extension as a proxy to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.
    - This can lead to unauthorized access to internal network resources, sensitive data exposure, or further exploitation of internal systems if the user's VS Code environment has network access to internal resources.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension directly uses the configured `proxyUri` without validation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `proxyUri` setting.
    - Implement a whitelist or blacklist for allowed proxy destinations.
    - Warn users about the security risks of using proxy configurations, especially when using untrusted `proxyUri` values.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to trick a user into configuring the `liveServer.settings.proxy.proxyUri` setting with a URL controlled by the attacker or pointing to an internal resource.
    - The user must have the Live Server extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - The user needs to start the Live Server.
    - The user's machine must have network access to the target resource specified in the malicious `proxyUri`.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. File: `/code/src/Config.ts`
        - The `Config.getProxy()` function retrieves the proxy settings from VS Code configuration without any validation:
        ```typescript
        public static get getProxy(): IProxy {
            return Config.getSettings<IProxy>('proxy');
        }
        ```
    2. File: `/code/src/Helper.ts`
        - The `Helper.getProxySetup()` function reads the proxy configuration from `Config.getProxy()`:
        ```typescript
        static getProxySetup() {
            const proxySetup = Config.getProxy;
            let proxy = [[]];
            if (proxySetup.enable === true) {
                proxy[0].push(proxySetup.baseUri, proxySetup.proxyUri);
            }
            else {
                proxy = null; // required to change the type [[]] to black array [].
            }

            return proxy;
        }
        ```
    3. File: `/code/lib/live-server/index.js`
        - In `LiveServer.start()`, the proxy configuration is retrieved from `Helper.generateParams()` and then used to configure the `proxy-middleware`:
        ```javascript
        proxy.forEach(function (proxyRule) {
            var proxyOpts = url.parse(proxyRule[1]); // proxyRule[1] is proxyUri from config
            proxyOpts.via = true;
            proxyOpts.preserveHost = true;
            app.use(proxyRule[0], require('proxy-middleware')(proxyOpts)); // proxyRule[0] is baseUri
            if (LiveServer.logLevel >= 1)
                console.log('Mapping %s to "%s"', proxyRule[0], proxyRule[1]);
        });
        ```
        - The `proxyUri` from user configuration is directly passed to `url.parse()` and `proxy-middleware` without any validation or sanitization.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.
    2. Open a workspace folder in VS Code.
    3. Create a file named `.vscode/settings.json` in the workspace root.
    4. Add the following configuration to `.vscode/settings.json` to set up a malicious proxy. Replace `http://internal.example.com/sensitive-data` with a URL pointing to an internal resource or a URL you control for testing purposes:
        ```json
        {
            "liveServer.settings.proxy": {
                "enable": true,
                "baseUri": "/api",
                "proxyUri": "http://internal.example.com/sensitive-data"
            }
        }
        ```
    5. Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in the workspace root. The content of the HTML file is not important for this test.
    6. Start the Live Server by clicking "Go Live" in the status bar or using any other start method.
    7. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>/api` (replace `<port>` with the port Live Server is running on, usually 5500).
    8. Observe the response in the browser. If the SSRF is successful, you will see the content from `http://internal.example.com/sensitive-data` (or your test URL) displayed in the browser, served through the Live Server proxy.
    9. To further verify, you can set `proxyUri` to a requestbin or webhook.site URL and observe the incoming request, confirming that the Live Server is making a request to the specified external URL.

#### Vulnerability Name: Exposed Live Server Interface (Unauthorized Access to Local Workspace Files)

- **Description:**
    The live server is configured to bind by default to the host address `'0.0.0.0'` (all network interfaces) rather than to the localhost interface (e.g. `127.0.0.1`). This means that when the extension is activated, the underlying static file server (built using the “live‐server” module) listens on all interfaces and is accessible not only locally but also from any device on the same network (or even externally if the network is misconfigured). As a result, an external attacker who can reach the machine via its network IP can browse the directory (using the directory‐listing middleware) and download files from the workspace—even files that may be sensitive or proprietary.

- **Impact:**
    - **Confidentiality breach:** An attacker can enumerate directories and retrieve files (source code, configuration, private data) stored in the workspace.
    - **Unauthorized file disclosure:** Sensitive files may be exposed if the workspace contains credentials, proprietary code, or configuration details.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension does offer configuration options (such as setting the `liveServer.settings.host` outside of the default value) so that a user may force the server to bind only to localhost.
    - An optional HTTP basic authentication mechanism exists via an `htpasswd` file if enabled—but it is not enabled by default.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The project forces the live server parameters (via helper functions) to use host `"0.0.0.0"` by default.
    - No default authentication or access control is imposed on the server endpoints.
    - There is no IP whitelisting or network–level access control for requests to the server.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The developer has activated and started the live server extension with its default configuration (without overriding the host to, for example, `127.0.0.1`).
    - The machine is connected to a network where an attacker (or any unauthorized party) can reach the IP address on which the live server is bound.
    - The workspace directory being served may include sensitive files.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In the file `lib/live-server/index.js` (used to start the static server), the server startup code begins with:
       ```js
       var host = options.host || '0.0.0.0';
       ```
       Since no other code forces the host to `127.0.0.1` when no explicit configuration is provided, the server listens on all network interfaces by default.
    2. In `src/Helper.ts` inside the `generateParams()` function, the parameters object returned to the live server always includes
       ```js
       host: '0.0.0.0'
       ```
       meaning that regardless of the developer’s workspace settings, the live server is exposing all network interfaces.
    3. The project further includes middleware (`serve-index`) that provides a listing of directory contents. This case implies that once connected, an attacker can enumerate and download files.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure that the live server is running on the target machine with default settings (host being `"0.0.0.0"`) and the developer’s workspace includes identifiable files (such as `README.md`).
    2. From an external machine on the same network, perform a port scan (using tools such as `nmap`) against the target machine’s IP address to detect open listening ports.
    3. Identify a port (e.g. 5500) on which the live server is running.
    4. Open a web browser on the external machine and navigate to:
       `http://<target_IP>:<port>/`
    5. Observe that a directory listing is displayed (provided by the `serve-index` middleware).
    6. Click on a file (for example, `README.md`) and verify that its contents are displayed.
    7. The successful enumeration and file download confirm the vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability Name: Misconfigured Cross‐Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- **Description:**
    The live server instance is set up to include the CORS middleware with a permissive configuration. The code always installs CORS with the options:
    ```js
    app.use(require("cors")({
      origin: true, // reflecting request origin
      credentials: true // allowing requests with credentials
    }));
    ```
    This configuration tells the browser to accept requests from any origin and includes credentials. As a result, when the live server is exposed (especially due to the 0.0.0.0 binding noted above), an attacker hosting a malicious webpage on an external domain can send AJAX (or fetch) requests to the live server and read its responses—including the contents of local files served from the workspace.

- **Impact:**
    - **Unauthorized data exfiltration:** An attacker can write a malicious script on a remote website that sends cross-origin requests to the live server, retrieving file contents that might reveal sensitive information from the workspace.
    - **Bypass of same-origin restrictions:** The permissive CORS policy undermines browser security by allowing any origin with credentials to access files served by the extension.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There is no additional check on the allowed origins. The CORS middleware is used in its default permissive mode (reflecting incoming Origin headers) with credentials enabled.
    - No default fallback authentication or checks are provided on the served endpoints.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - A stricter CORS policy should be implemented (for example, restricting accepted origins to localhost or trusted domains).
    - Credentials should not be allowed unless absolutely necessary.
    - An authentication mechanism should be enabled (or the CORS configuration should be tied to it) to ensure that even if resources are fetched via cross-origin requests, only authorized users can retrieve sensitive content.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The live server is running on a network-accessible machine with its default CORS settings as specified above.
    - An attacker is able to host or serve a web page under a domain different from that of the live server.
    - The live server is accessible over the network (for example, through the 0.0.0.0 binding).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In the file `lib/live-server/index.js`, within the `LiveServer.start()` function, the code checks for a CORS flag and, if set, installs the middleware:
       ```js
       if (cors) {
         app.use(require("cors")({
           origin: true,
           credentials: true
         }));
       }
       ```
    2. The `cors` option is derived from parameters passed in from the helper function (`generateParams()` in `src/Helper.ts`), meaning that by default CORS is enabled.
    3. Because `origin: true` reflects the incoming request’s origin and credentials are always allowed, any external site can send cross-origin requests to the server and access its responses.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Start the live server on the target machine (using the default settings with host set to `"0.0.0.0"`) so that it is reachable on the network.
    2. From an attacker-controlled machine, host a simple HTML page on a different domain (or using a local web server running on a non–localhost domain). The page should contain a script that sends an HTTP request (using `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`) to:
       `http://<target_IP>:<port>/README.md`
    3. In the script, log the response status and data, and output the response text to verify its contents.
    4. Open the attacker's HTML page in a browser and observe that the script is able to successfully receive the file contents from the live server.
    5. The ability of the attacker's page to bypass normal same-origin restrictions and read the file content confirms the vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability Name: Workspace Mount Path Traversal

- **Description:**
    1. Attacker configures the `liveServer.settings.mount` setting in VSCode settings.json.
    2. Attacker sets the mount path to a directory outside the workspace using relative path like `["/mounted", "../../../"]`.
    3. Attacker starts the Live Server.
    4. Attacker accesses the mounted path using the configured route, e.g., `http://localhost:port/mounted/sensitive_file.txt`.
    5. The server serves files from outside the workspace due to path traversal in mount path.

- **Impact:**
    - High: Attacker can access sensitive files outside the workspace if the user configures a vulnerable mount path. This could lead to information disclosure of sensitive data located on the user's file system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None: The application resolves the mount path relative to the workspace, but it does not prevent using relative paths like `../` to traverse outside the workspace.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Sanitize and validate the mount path in `liveServer.settings.mount` to prevent path traversal. Ensure that the resolved mount path is within the workspace directory or restrict the usage of relative paths in mount configuration. A secure approach would be to resolve the mount path relative to the workspace and then verify that the resolved path is still within the workspace directory using path comparison methods.

- **Preconditions:**
    - User must have VSCode with Live Server extension installed.
    - Attacker needs to convince the user to add a malicious configuration to their VSCode settings.json, or have access to modify the user's VSCode settings.json directly.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `src/Helper.ts`, the `generateParams` function processes the `liveServer.settings.mount` configuration:
    ```typescript
    mount.forEach((mountRule: Array<any>) => {
        if (mountRule.length === 2 && mountRule[1]) {
            mountRule[1] = path.resolve(workspacePath, mountRule[1]); // Resolves mount path relative to workspacePath
        }
    });
    ```
    - `path.resolve(workspacePath, mountRule[1])` resolves the mount path relative to the workspace path. This allows relative paths like `../` within `mountRule[1]` to traverse directories outside of the intended workspace.
    - In `lib/live-server/index.js`, this resolved `mountPath` is then used to serve static files:
    ```javascript
    app.use(mountRule[0], staticServer(mountPath, staticServer, onTagMissedCallback));
    ```
    - Because the mount path resolution doesn't restrict paths to stay within the workspace, it leads to a path traversal vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open VSCode with any workspace directory.
    2. Create a sensitive file named `sensitive.txt` outside the workspace directory, for example in your user's home directory. Add content like "This is sensitive data." to the file.
    3. Open VSCode settings (settings.json) for the workspace.
    4. Add the following configuration to `settings.json`:
       ```json
       {
           "liveServer.settings.mount": [
               ["/mounted", "../../../../"]
           ]
       }
       ```
       Adjust the number of `../` to correctly point to the directory containing `sensitive.txt` from your workspace location. For instance, if your workspace is in `/home/user/project` and `sensitive.txt` is in `/home/user/`, use `["/mounted", "../../"]`.
    5. Create or open any HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) within your workspace.
    6. Start Live Server by clicking "Go Live" from the status bar or using the command palette.
    7. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5500/mounted/sensitive.txt`. If port `5500` is in use, use the actual port Live Server is running on.
    8. Observe that the content of `sensitive.txt`, "This is sensitive data.", is displayed in the browser. This confirms that you have successfully accessed a file outside the workspace through the mounted path, demonstrating the path traversal vulnerability.
