## Vulnerability List

There are no high or critical rank vulnerabilities identified in the provided project files that meet the specified criteria.

After a thorough analysis of the code, focusing on potential attack vectors for a VSCode extension like Live Server, no exploitable vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were found that are introduced by the project code itself and are directly triggerable by an external attacker.

The analysis considered:

- Path traversal vulnerabilities in file serving and browser opening.
- Command injection vulnerabilities in browser opening.
- Open redirect vulnerabilities in the Live Share feature.
- Insecure configuration settings.

While potential theoretical attack vectors might exist under specific misconfigurations or edge cases, none of them qualify as high-rank vulnerabilities directly exploitable by an external attacker within the constraints defined in the prompt.

Therefore, based on the provided project files and the specified criteria, there are no vulnerabilities to list.
