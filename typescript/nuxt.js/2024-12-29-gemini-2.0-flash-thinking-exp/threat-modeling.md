### High and Critical Nuxt.js Specific Threats

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the server-rendered HTML. This can happen when user-provided data or data from untrusted sources is directly included in the HTML by Nuxt.js without proper sanitization. When a user visits the page, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting them to malicious sites.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the website.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuxt.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR) engine, specifically within Vue components rendering dynamic content using `v-html` or direct string interpolation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before rendering it on the server within Nuxt.js components.
        *   Utilize Nuxt's built-in escaping mechanisms and Vue.js template directives that automatically escape HTML (e.g., `v-text`, `{{ }}`).
        *   Consider using a dedicated HTML sanitization library for more complex scenarios within Nuxt.js applications.

*   **Threat:** Information Leakage via Server-Rendered HTML
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information, intended only for client-side use or internal purposes, is inadvertently included in the server-rendered HTML source code by Nuxt.js. An attacker can view the page source and extract this information. This might include API keys, internal IDs, or other confidential data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential for unauthorized access to internal systems or services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuxt.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR) engine, particularly when accessing environment variables or internal data directly within Vue components rendered on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid embedding sensitive information directly in Vue components within Nuxt.js applications.
        *   Utilize environment variables securely and ensure they are only accessed on the client-side when necessary within the Nuxt.js context.
        *   Implement proper access controls and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data within the application.
        *   Review the rendered HTML source code in development and production environments to identify potential leaks generated by Nuxt.js.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Data Fetching
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user input that is used to construct URLs for server-side data fetching within Nuxt.js (e.g., using `asyncData` or `fetch`). This allows the attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external resources, potentially accessing internal services, reading local files, or launching attacks against other systems.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuxt.js `asyncData` and `fetch` hooks within pages and components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input used to construct external URLs within Nuxt.js data fetching methods.
        *   Implement allow-lists for allowed domains and protocols for server-side requests initiated by Nuxt.js.
        *   Consider using a proxy server for outbound requests made by the Nuxt.js application to add an extra layer of security and control.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs without validation in Nuxt.js data fetching.

*   **Threat:** Middleware Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Custom middleware functions in Nuxt.js, if not implemented securely, can introduce vulnerabilities. This includes authentication/authorization bypasses, injection flaws (e.g., command injection if middleware interacts with the operating system), or denial-of-service vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypasses, unauthorized access, application instability, potential for server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuxt.js middleware system, specifically custom middleware functions defined in the `middleware` directory.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom middleware functions within the Nuxt.js application for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices and avoid common pitfalls like insecure session management or improper error handling in Nuxt.js middleware.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within Nuxt.js middleware functions.
        *   Ensure middleware functions are designed to handle unexpected input gracefully within the Nuxt.js application.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Nuxt.js Modules
    *   **Description:** Malicious actors compromise third-party Nuxt.js modules or their dependencies, injecting malicious code that gets included in the application build. This can happen through compromised maintainer accounts, typosquatting, or vulnerabilities in the module's dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data theft, backdoors, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuxt.js module system and the `node_modules` directory.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet all third-party modules before installation in your Nuxt.js project, checking their popularity, maintenance status, and security history.
        *   Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` within your Nuxt.js project.
        *   Consider using dependency pinning to lock down specific versions of modules in your Nuxt.js application.
        *   Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies in your Nuxt.js project.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Nuxt.js Core or Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the Nuxt.js framework itself or its underlying dependencies (e.g., Vue.js, webpack). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application is running an outdated version.
    *   **Impact:** Various security issues depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, XSS, or other attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuxt.js core framework and its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Nuxt.js and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for Nuxt.js and its dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for quickly patching vulnerabilities when they are disclosed in the Nuxt.js framework or its dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Build Artifacts
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys or secrets, is accidentally included in the client-side bundle during the Nuxt.js build process. This can happen due to misconfiguration of environment variables or improper handling of secrets within the Nuxt.js configuration. Attackers can inspect the client-side code and extract this information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potential for unauthorized access to external services or data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nuxt.js build process and generated client-side bundles.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid embedding sensitive information directly in the code of your Nuxt.js application.
        *   Utilize environment variables securely and ensure they are not exposed in the client-side bundle generated by Nuxt.js.
        *   Use `.env` files and proper build configurations within your Nuxt.js project to manage environment variables.
        *   Consider using a secrets management solution for more sensitive data in your Nuxt.js application.
