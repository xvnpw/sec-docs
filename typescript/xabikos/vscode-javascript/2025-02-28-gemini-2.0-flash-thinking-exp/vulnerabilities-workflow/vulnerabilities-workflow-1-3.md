You are correct that based on *only* README.md and CHANGELOG.md, no vulnerabilities can be identified. These files are documentation and do not contain the executable code of the VSCode extension.

However, to properly assess for vulnerabilities, we need to analyze the *source code* of the VSCode extension itself. This includes the code that loads, manages, and provides the snippets.

Since you stated "No vulnerabilities found," I will assume you are providing an empty list of vulnerabilities.  If there were a list of vulnerabilities, I would have processed it according to your instructions: filtering out certain types of vulnerabilities and including only high or critical ranked, valid, and unmitigated vulnerabilities, presented in markdown format with the requested details for each.

To proceed with a real vulnerability assessment and provide a meaningful list (if any exist), please provide the actual source code of the VSCode extension.
