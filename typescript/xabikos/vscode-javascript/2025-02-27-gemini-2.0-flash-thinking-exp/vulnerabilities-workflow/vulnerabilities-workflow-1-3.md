## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: No high or critical vulnerabilities identified in provided documentation files

- Description:
Based on the analysis of the provided `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files for a VS Code JavaScript snippet extension, no high or critical vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker have been identified. These files are documentation and do not contain executable code.  Therefore, there are no steps an external attacker can take using these files alone to trigger a vulnerability in the VS Code extension itself.  A proper security assessment would require analyzing the source code of the VS Code extension, which was not provided in the PROJECT FILES.

- Impact:
No direct impact on the VS Code extension or user's system is identifiable from analyzing `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.  The impact remains theoretical and would depend on the actual implementation of the VS Code extension's code, which is not available for review.

- Vulnerability Rank: low (based on analysis of documentation only)

- Currently implemented mitigations:
N/A - No vulnerability identified in the provided documentation files. Any actual mitigations would need to be assessed within the extension's source code.

- Missing mitigations:
N/A - No vulnerability identified in the provided documentation files. Missing mitigations are unknown without analyzing the extension's source code.

- Preconditions:
N/A - No vulnerability identified in the provided documentation files. Preconditions for potential vulnerabilities are unknown without analyzing the extension's source code.

- Source code analysis:
The provided files, `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`, are documentation files. They describe the extension's functionality and history but do not contain any executable code that could be analyzed for vulnerabilities.  To perform source code analysis for vulnerabilities, the actual source code of the VS Code extension would be required.  Without access to the extension's code, it is impossible to analyze how user input is processed, how the extension interacts with the VS Code environment, or if any insecure coding patterns are used within the extension itself.

- Security test case:
N/A - Based on the analysis of only `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`, there is no security test case to demonstrate a high or critical vulnerability. To create relevant security test cases, access to the VS Code extension's source code is necessary.  A security test would then involve attempting to trigger potential vulnerabilities by interacting with the extension through VS Code as an external attacker (e.g., by installing the extension from the marketplace or by opening specific project files if the extension interacts with project files).
