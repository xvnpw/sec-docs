## Vulnerability List:

Based on the provided project files (README.md and CHANGELOG.md), no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were identified in the VSCode JavaScript (ES6) snippets extension itself.

**Reasoning:**

The provided files are documentation files (README and CHANGELOG) for a VSCode extension that provides JavaScript code snippets. These files describe the functionality of the extension and its version history. They do not contain the source code of the extension itself.

Code snippets, by their nature, are static text templates. They are not executable code within the extension's context.  The extension's role is to provide these snippets for users to insert into their code editor.  Therefore, vulnerabilities stemming from insecure code patterns introduced by users when *using* these snippets in their own projects are explicitly excluded as per the instructions ("vulnerabilities that are caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES").

Without access to the actual source code of the VSCode extension, it is impossible to perform a meaningful source code analysis to identify vulnerabilities introduced by the extension itself that could be triggered by an external attacker.  Documentation files do not contain information about potential code-level vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided documentation files alone, there are no identifiable vulnerabilities of high or critical rank in the VSCode JavaScript (ES6) snippets extension that meet the specified inclusion criteria for external attackers targeting the extension itself.

**Detailed Vulnerability Analysis (No High/Critical Vulnerabilities Found Based on Provided Documentation):**

Since no source code was provided, and only documentation files (README.md and CHANGELOG.md) were available, a detailed vulnerability analysis as requested cannot be performed for the VSCode extension itself.  The documentation does not describe any features or functionalities that could be exploited by an external attacker to cause high or critical impact within the extension's context.

**To perform a proper vulnerability assessment according to the instructions, access to the source code of the VSCode extension is required.**  Without the source code, it is impossible to:

* Identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
* Conduct source code analysis.
* Develop security test cases to validate vulnerabilities.
* Determine specific mitigations.

**Therefore, based solely on the provided README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, the vulnerability list remains empty for high and critical vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker targeting the VSCode JavaScript (ES6) snippets extension itself.**
