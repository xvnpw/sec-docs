### Vulnerability: Path Traversal in Workspace Proxy Server

- Description:
    An attacker could potentially access files outside the intended workspace directory by crafting a malicious URL request to the workspace proxy server. This is possible because the proxy server, when resolving file paths, might not sufficiently sanitize or validate the requested path against the workspace root. By manipulating the URL path (e.g., using `..` sequences), an attacker could bypass intended access restrictions and read arbitrary files on the user's file system within the VSCode context, assuming the workspace trust allows file system access.

- Impact:
    High. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files within the user's workspace or even potentially sensitive files outside the workspace if VS Code's workspace trust settings and file access permissions allow. This could lead to information disclosure, including source code, configuration files, or other sensitive data accessible within the VSCode environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    The code in `/code/src/workspace-proxy-server.ts` attempts to join the requested URL path with the workspace folder URI using `Uri.joinPath`. VS Code's `Uri.joinPath` is designed to prevent path traversal by normalizing paths and ensuring that the resulting path stays within the base URI's scope. However, the effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the correct usage and any potential bypasses in path normalization or URI handling.

    - File: `/code/src/workspace-proxy-server.ts`
    - Location: Line 33: `path: Uri.joinPath(workspaceFolder.uri, url.pathname).path,`
    - Mitigation Description: Using `Uri.joinPath` to join workspace URI and requested path, aiming to prevent traversal outside the workspace.

- Missing Mitigations:
    While `Uri.joinPath` provides some level of protection, it might not be sufficient in all scenarios. Additional validation and sanitization of the `url.pathname` before using `Uri.joinPath` would enhance security. Specifically, explicitly checking for and rejecting URL paths containing `..` sequences or other path traversal patterns before they are processed by `Uri.joinPath` would add a defense-in-depth layer.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must open a workspace in VSCode.
    - The Marp for VS Code extension must be active and used to export a Marp Markdown document as PDF, PPTX, PNG, or JPEG, which triggers the workspace proxy server when `markdown.marp.strictPathResolutionDuringExport` is enabled or under certain workspace configurations (e.g., virtual workspaces).
    - The attacker must be able to influence the URL requested by the Marp CLI during the export process. While direct external influence on the URL might be limited, if there are vulnerabilities in how resources are referenced within Marp Markdown or themes, it could be indirectly exploitable.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/workspace-proxy-server.ts`
    ```typescript
    30  const vscodeUri = workspaceFolder.uri.with({
    31    fragment: url.hash,
    32    path: Uri.joinPath(workspaceFolder.uri, url.pathname).path,
    33    query: url.search,
    34  })
    ```
    - The code constructs `vscodeUri` by joining `workspaceFolder.uri` and `url.pathname`.
    - It relies on `Uri.joinPath` for path normalization and traversal prevention.
    - There is no explicit validation of `url.pathname` to prevent path traversal sequences before `Uri.joinPath` is called.
    - If `url.pathname` is crafted to include path traversal sequences like `..`, `Uri.joinPath` *should* normalize it to stay within the workspace. However, deeper analysis or testing is needed to confirm this behavior under all circumstances and VS Code versions.
    - The test case `/code/src/workspace-proxy-server.test.ts` primarily tests the server's basic functionality (serving files, 404 errors) but does not include specific tests for path traversal vulnerabilities.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a Marp Markdown document within a VSCode workspace.
    2. Create a file named `sensitive.txt` at the workspace root with some sensitive content (e.g., "This is sensitive data.").
    3. In the Marp Markdown document, include an image or resource link with a path traversal attempt. For example, if your workspace folder is `/workspace`, use `![alt](http://127.0.0.1:{proxy_port}/../sensitive.txt)` where `{proxy_port}` is the port number of the workspace proxy server (you'd need to determine this port, possibly by monitoring network traffic during export or through debugging). A simpler test within the workspace could be `![alt](http://127.0.0.1:{proxy_port}/subdir/../../sensitive.txt)` assuming there's a `subdir` within the workspace.
    4. Enable `markdown.marp.strictPathResolutionDuringExport` setting in VSCode settings.
    5. Export the Marp Markdown document to PDF (or any format that triggers the proxy server).
    6. Examine the exported output (e.g., PDF). If the path traversal is successful, the content of `sensitive.txt` might be embedded or linked in the output, or you might observe network requests in the proxy server logs showing access to `sensitive.txt` or similar paths.
    7. Alternatively, monitor the requests hitting the proxy server (by logging requests in `src/workspace-proxy-server.ts` or using network monitoring tools) during export to see if requests for paths like `/../sensitive.txt` are made and served with a 200 status code.
