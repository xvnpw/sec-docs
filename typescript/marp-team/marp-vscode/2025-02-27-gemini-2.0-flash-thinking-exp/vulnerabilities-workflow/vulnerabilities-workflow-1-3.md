### Vulnerability List:

* **Vulnerability Name:** Workspace File Disclosure via Proxy Server Directory Traversal
* **Description:**
    1. The VS Code extension starts a local proxy server to serve files from the workspace for preview and export functionalities.
    2. The proxy server uses `express` to handle requests and constructs file paths based on the requested URL path by joining the workspace folder URI with the URL path.
    3. There is insufficient sanitization or validation of the URL path before joining it with the workspace URI.
    4. An attacker could craft a malicious URL with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..`) to access files outside of the intended workspace directory.
* **Impact:**
    - **High:** An external attacker, by crafting a specific URL, can potentially read arbitrary files from the user's workspace directory, including sensitive information like source code, configuration files, or credentials stored within the workspace. This is a significant information disclosure vulnerability.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** High
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None identified in the provided code. The code directly joins the requested path with the workspace URI without any sanitization.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization and validation of the URL path in `src/workspace-proxy-server.ts` to prevent directory traversal. This should include:
        - Validating that the normalized path still starts within the workspace folder's path.
        - Potentially using a safe path joining mechanism that prevents traversal outside the base directory.
* **Preconditions:**
    - The VS Code extension must be active and the workspace proxy server must be running. This is typically active when a Marp Markdown file is opened and being previewed or exported in a trusted workspace.
    - The attacker needs to know or guess the port number of the proxy server. While the port is randomly selected, it is within a predictable range (8192 + random(10000)) and could potentially be discovered or brute-forced in specific scenarios.
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/workspace-proxy-server.ts
    import express from 'express'
    import { Uri, workspace, WorkspaceFolder } from 'vscode'

    export const createWorkspaceProxyServer = async (
      workspaceFolder: WorkspaceFolder,
    ): Promise<WorkspaceProxyServer> => {
      // ...
      const app = express().get('*', async (req, res) => {
        const url = new URL(req.url, `http://${req.headers.host}`)
        const vscodeUri = workspaceFolder.uri.with({
          path: Uri.joinPath(workspaceFolder.uri, url.pathname).path, // Vulnerable line
          query: url.search,
        })
        // ...
      })
      // ...
    }
    ```
    - The vulnerable line is `Uri.joinPath(workspaceFolder.uri, url.pathname).path`.
    - `url.pathname` comes directly from the request URL, which is controlled by the attacker.
    - `Uri.joinPath` does not inherently prevent directory traversal. If `url.pathname` contains sequences like `../../`, it will be joined, potentially leading to a path outside the workspace folder.

    ```
    Visualization:

    Workspace Folder URI: /path/to/workspace
    Attacker Request URL Path: ../../../sensitive_file.txt

    Uri.joinPath(/path/to/workspace, ../../../sensitive_file.txt)

    Resulting Path (potentially): /sensitive_file.txt  (Outside workspace!)
    ```

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open a VS Code workspace containing a Marp Markdown file in a **trusted workspace**.
    2. Start the Marp preview for the Markdown file to activate the workspace proxy server.
    3. Identify the port number used by the workspace proxy server. This might require inspecting network connections or logs if the port is not readily exposed. (In a real attack scenario, port scanning or other techniques might be used to find the open port).
    4. Craft a malicious URL to access a file outside the workspace. For example, if your workspace is `/home/user/project` and you want to access `/etc/passwd`, the malicious URL path would be `../../../etc/passwd`.
    5. Send a GET request to the proxy server with the crafted URL. Example using `curl`:
       ```bash
       curl http://127.0.0.1:<proxy_port>/../../../etc/passwd
       ```
    6. If the vulnerability exists, the response will contain the content of `/etc/passwd` (or any other file accessible with directory traversal), confirming the file disclosure vulnerability. If you expect to access a file within the workspace, replace `../../../etc/passwd` with a path to a file inside the workspace to verify normal operation. For example, if you have `test.txt` in your workspace root, use `curl http://127.0.0.1:<proxy_port>/test.txt`.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass workspace trust and access files they should not be able to access through the VSCode extension's proxy server. It's crucial to implement path sanitization to mitigate this risk.
