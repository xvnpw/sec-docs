## Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability Name: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Python Parsing Logic

### Description:
The python-indent extension uses a regular expression in the `startingWhitespaceLength` function in `/code/src/indent.ts` to determine the number of whitespace characters at the beginning of a line. This regular expression `/\S/.exec(line)` is vulnerable to ReDoS when processing specially crafted strings containing a large number of spaces or tabs followed by no non-whitespace character. An attacker can provide a long line with only whitespace characters, causing the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU time and potentially leading to a denial of service. While this is not a full system DoS, it can significantly degrade the performance of the VSCode editor when editing Python files, making it unresponsive.

### Impact:
An attacker can cause the VSCode editor to become unresponsive or slow down significantly when editing Python files. This is achieved by inserting a specially crafted long line of whitespace in a Python file. While not a complete denial of service of the entire system, it degrades the user experience of VSCode when using this extension.

### Vulnerability Rank: high

### Currently Implemented Mitigations:
None. The code uses the vulnerable regex directly without any input validation or safeguards.

### Missing Mitigations:
Input validation should be implemented to limit the length of the input string processed by the regular expression, or a more efficient and ReDoS-safe approach should be used to calculate the starting whitespace length. A timeout for regex execution could also be considered, but might lead to unexpected behavior.

### Preconditions:
The attacker needs to be able to edit a Python file in VSCode with the python-indent extension installed. This is a common scenario as the extension is designed to work when editing Python code.

### Source Code Analysis:
1.  **File:** `/code/src/indent.ts`
2.  **Function:** `startingWhitespaceLength(line: string)`
3.  **Code:**
    ```typescript
    export function startingWhitespaceLength(line: string): number {
        return /\S/.exec(line)?.index ?? 0;
    }
    ```
4.  **Vulnerability:** The regular expression `/\S/.exec(line)` attempts to find the first non-whitespace character (`\S`) in the input `line`. If the input `line` consists of only whitespace characters or is a very long string of whitespace followed by nothing, the regex engine will backtrack extensively trying to find a non-whitespace character that does not exist. This can lead to exponential time complexity in the worst case and cause a ReDoS.

    **Visualization:**

    Imagine the regex engine trying to match `/\S/` against a very long string of spaces "          ...          " (e.g., 100,000 spaces).

    *   The regex engine starts at the beginning of the string.
    *   It checks the first character: is it a non-whitespace character? No (it's a space).
    *   It moves to the second character: is it a non-whitespace character? No (it's a space).
    *   ... and so on, for all 100,000 spaces.
    *   Finally, it reaches the end of the string and concludes that there is no non-whitespace character.

    This linear scan for a potentially very long string, combined with regex engine's backtracking behavior in certain scenarios, can be inefficient and exploitable. While this specific regex `/\S/` is relatively simple, the issue arises with the unbounded input length provided to it.

    The `startingWhitespaceLength` function is used in `editsToMake` function, which is called by `newlineAndIndent` command that is triggered by pressing Enter key. Every time user press Enter, this vulnerable regex might be executed on the current line or lines parsed by the extension.

### Security Test Case:
1.  Open VSCode with the python-indent extension installed.
2.  Create a new Python file or open an existing one.
3.  Insert a very long line consisting of only whitespace characters (e.g., copy and paste spaces or tabs until the line is extremely long, at least tens of thousands of characters).
4.  Place the cursor at the end of this long whitespace line.
5.  Press the Enter key.
6.  Observe the VSCode editor's responsiveness. If the vulnerability is triggered, VSCode will become unresponsive or very slow for a noticeable period as the regex engine struggles to process the long whitespace string. You might see high CPU usage from the VSCode process.
7.  Repeat steps 3-6 with progressively longer whitespace lines to confirm the degradation of performance increases with input length.
