### Vulnerability: Malicious Python File Exploiting Faulty Dedentation Logic Causing Accidental Code Deletion

- **Description:**
  An attacker can craft a Python file with deceptive indentation cues (for example, misleading colon placements, mixed bracket usage, and irregular whitespace patterns) that confuses the extension’s dedentation logic. When a user opens such a file in VSCode and presses Enter (which automatically triggers the extension’s newline-and-indent logic), the extension may compute an incorrect deletion range. As a result, extra characters (or even entire parts of the line) may be removed unintentionally—corrupting or deleting legitimate source code.

  *Step by step how to trigger this:*
  - An attacker creates a Python file where block‐initiating constructs (e.g. headers ending with a colon) and subsequent lines are intentionally misaligned. For example, the file might mix extra leading spaces in a way that the parser’s functions (like `currentLineDedentation` and `editsToMake`) miscalculate the proper deletion length.
  - The attacker places this file in a repository or distributes it so that a victim (using the Python Indent extension) opens it in VSCode.
  - When the victim presses Enter in a context where the extension is meant to auto‐format the code, the extension computes the dedent amount based on the misleading indentation cues.
  - Because the deletion range is computed solely from the parser output without additional sanity checks, the extension deletes more text than intended, thereby removing valid code.

- **Impact:**
  - **Data Integrity Loss:** Valid portions of the user’s source code may be deleted or misformatted without explicit user confirmation.
  - **Operational Disruption:** The unintended deletion of code can lead to compilation/runtime errors and potentially force a developer into a time‑consuming manual recovery process.
  - **Increased Risk of Further Exploitation:** Loss of code integrity may pave the way for additional accidental vulnerabilities or disruptive behavior if critical code is removed.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The extension places its indentation logic inside a try/finally block so that if an error occurs, a fallback (simple newline insertion) is performed.
  - Basic boundary checks (like using `Math.max()` when reducing the indentation level) exist to prevent gross miscalculations in “normal” scenarios.
  - A set of unit tests covers many typical indentation scenarios to catch common misbehaviors.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - **Robust Sanity Checking:** There is no additional verification that the deletion ranges computed (especially in dedentation via `currentLineDedentation` and subsequent use in `editsToMake`) lie within safe and expected bounds relative to the current document.
  - **Handling Adversarial Inputs:** The current parser output is trusted without further cross‑checking. Extra validation (or even a sanity prompt for very large deletion ranges) could help ensure that adversarially crafted files do not yield destructive edits.
  - **User Confirmation or Rollback:** No mechanism exists for users to review or undo large automatic deletions triggered by the auto‑indentation command.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The extension is active and applied in a workspace where Python files are being edited.
  - The attacker provides a maliciously crafted Python file (with deceptive block indicators and inconsistent whitespace) that is then opened by a victim unaware of the content manipulation.
  - The user triggers the auto‑indentation (for example, by pressing Enter) in a context where the misleading indentation cues cause the logic to compute an overly aggressive deletion range.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the file `src/indent.ts` the function `editsToMake` is responsible for computing the text to insert and ranges to delete.
    - It first checks for trailing whitespace to remove via the helper function `startingWhitespaceLength()`.
    - The function then calls `currentLineDedentation()`, which bases its calculation on the trimmed current line (especially if the line ends with a colon) and compares the current indentation with that of a “matching” earlier line (using values from the parser’s output obtained via `parse_lines` in the WASM‑based parser).
    - Because the algorithm trusts the output from `parseOut.last_seen_indenters` (and other parser–derived values) without verifying that the computed deletion range is “reasonable,” a file with adversarial indentation constructs could force a miscalculation.
    - The resulting deletion range is pushed to the list of edits without further bounds checking, so when the edit is applied, more text than intended may be removed.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:** Create a Python file with carefully crafted indentation. For example:
     ```
     def vulnerable_function():
         # Legitimate block starting
         if condition:
             do_something()  # valid code here
          else:  # Note the misleading indentation (one extra space before else)
             do_something_else()
     ```
  2. **Execution:**
     - Open the Python file in VSCode with the Python Indent extension enabled.
     - Place the cursor on the line containing the misaligned `else:` (or at a position where the parser might misinterpret the intended dedentation).
     - Press Enter to trigger the auto‑indentation logic.
  3. **Observation:**
     - Check that the inserted text and computed deletion ranges cause more characters than expected to be removed from the current line.
     - Verify that the valid code (for example, part of the comment or code preceding the misaligned colon) is deleted inadvertently.
  4. **Outcome:**
     - If the extension deletes beyond the intended whitespace (or even removes segments of the legitimate code), the vulnerability is confirmed.
     - Restoration of the file (and subsequent consistent misbehavior on repeated tests) proves that the dedentation logic is exploitable under adversarial formatting conditions.
