Okay, I understand the instructions.

Based on your statement:

> There are no high-rank vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that meet the specified criteria.

and the filtering criteria you provided, it seems there are no vulnerabilities to list.

Therefore, based on the information you've given, the updated vulnerability list is empty, as no vulnerabilities meeting the "high rank" and other inclusion criteria were found.

Here's the markdown formatted output reflecting this:

```markdown
## Vulnerability List

**No high-rank vulnerabilities found that meet the specified criteria.**

Based on the analysis, no vulnerabilities with a rank of 'high' or 'critical' were identified in the project files that are valid, not mitigated, and exploitable by an external attacker in a VSCode extension context, while also excluding those caused by insecure code patterns in project files, missing documentation, or being denial-of-service vulnerabilities.
