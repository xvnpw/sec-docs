# Vulnerability Assessment

After analyzing the provided information about the VS Code Python indentation extension, I can confirm that no high-severity vulnerabilities in the categories of Remote Code Execution (RCE), Command Injection, or Code Injection were identified.

The security analysis indicates that:

- The extension processes Python file content using safe string operations, regular expressions, and whitespace calculations
- All input handling is performed through memory-safe operations
- The WebAssembly parser implemented in Rust provides additional memory safety guarantees
- No dynamic evaluation of content occurs anywhere in the codebase
- No external commands or processes are spawned based on file content
- Snippet insertion uses only constant strings and computed whitespace values

Even if a threat actor provides a malicious repository with manipulated Python files, the extension's design prevents any execution paths that could lead to code execution, command injection, or similar high-severity vulnerabilities.

A thorough review of the text processing logic, indentation calculation, and extension command implementation confirms that file content is treated strictly as data for formatting purposes, with no opportunities for execution or injection.
