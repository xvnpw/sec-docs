# Vulnerabilities List

After a thorough analysis of the Python Indent VSCode extension, I did not find any valid high-severity or critical-severity vulnerabilities related to Remote Code Execution, Command Injection, or Code Injection.

## Analysis Summary

I carefully examined all the TypeScript source code of the extension, looking for vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by providing a malicious repository to a victim. The extension operates by:

1. Parsing Python code up to the cursor position
2. Determining the appropriate indentation level
3. Modifying text in the editor based on parsing results

The core parsing logic has been implemented in Rust and exposed to TypeScript via WebAssembly. The extension only operates on text in the editor and does not:
- Execute Python code from the repository
- Run shell commands
- Evaluate strings as code
- Load or execute remote content

The extension also implements good error handling with try/finally blocks to ensure that even if errors occur during parsing, the extension will still provide basic functionality.

Without access to the Rust/WebAssembly code that performs the actual parsing, I cannot make a definitive statement about potential memory corruption vulnerabilities that might exist in that component. However, from the TypeScript code I've analyzed, there appear to be no high-severity vulnerabilities of the requested types.

If there were vulnerabilities in this extension, they would most likely be in the WebAssembly parser component, potentially allowing carefully crafted Python files to trigger memory corruption issues. A complete security assessment would require analysis of the Rust implementation, which was not included in the provided files.
