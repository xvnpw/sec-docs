# Threat Model Analysis for apollographql/apollo-client

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage from Cache Storage](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_from_cache_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Apollo Client's cache, especially when persisted using features like `persistCache`, stores GraphQL response data in client-side storage (e.g., LocalStorage, IndexedDB). An attacker gaining access to the user's browser environment (e.g., via XSS, malicious browser extension, or physical access) can read directly from this storage and extract sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, personal information, authentication tokens (if inadvertently cached), application secrets, or business-critical information stored within GraphQL responses. This can lead to identity theft, unauthorized access, and privacy violations.
*   **Affected Apollo Client Component:** `InMemoryCache`, `persistCache` (if used), browser storage APIs (LocalStorage, IndexedDB)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid caching highly sensitive data on the client-side whenever possible.
    *   If caching sensitive data is necessary, encrypt the persisted cache data using browser-native crypto APIs or secure libraries before storing it.
    *   Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks, which are a primary vector for accessing client-side storage.
    *   Educate users about the risks of malicious browser extensions and encourage them to use reputable extensions.
    *   Regularly review and minimize the amount of sensitive data transferred and cached on the client.

## Threat: [Insecure Client-Side Storage of Authentication Tokens](./threats/insecure_client-side_storage_of_authentication_tokens.md)

*   **Description:** Apollo Client often manages authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) for GraphQL API authorization, typically handled through `ApolloClient`'s `headers` configuration in `HttpLink` or through context. If these tokens are stored insecurely in client-side storage (e.g., plain text in LocalStorage or cookies without `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags), they are vulnerable to theft via XSS or other client-side attacks.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application functionalities, potential data breaches, and impersonation of legitimate users.
*   **Affected Apollo Client Component:** `HttpLink` (header management), `ApolloClient` configuration, browser storage APIs (LocalStorage, Cookies)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store authentication tokens securely using `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookies whenever possible. This prevents client-side JavaScript access and ensures transmission only over HTTPS.
    *   If using LocalStorage or similar client-side storage is unavoidable, consider encrypting the tokens before storing them. However, secure key management in the browser is challenging.
    *   Implement short-lived access tokens and refresh token mechanisms to minimize the window of opportunity if a token is compromised.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly within authentication tokens themselves.
    *   Educate developers on secure client-side authentication practices and token management.

## Threat: [Client-Side Authorization Bypass](./threats/client-side_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might implement client-side authorization checks using Apollo Client, for example, by conditionally rendering UI elements based on user roles fetched via GraphQL queries. However, these client-side checks are easily bypassed by a determined attacker who can manipulate client-side code or intercept and modify network requests.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features and data, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and security violations.
*   **Affected Apollo Client Component:** `useQuery` (fetching authorization data), application logic (conditional rendering, access control based on client-side data)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never rely solely on client-side authorization for security.**
    *   Implement robust server-side authorization checks for all GraphQL operations (queries and mutations).
    *   Use client-side authorization only for user experience enhancements (e.g., hiding UI elements or providing contextual information) and not as a security control.
    *   Ensure that all sensitive operations and data access are protected by server-side authorization rules enforced at the GraphQL API level.

## Threat: [Client-Side Code Vulnerabilities in Query Construction or Response Handling](./threats/client-side_code_vulnerabilities_in_query_construction_or_response_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might introduce vulnerabilities in client-side code when using Apollo Client APIs. This could include improper input sanitization when dynamically constructing GraphQL queries (though Apollo Client's parameterized queries mitigate some injection risks), or insecure handling of data received from the GraphQL server, potentially leading to client-side XSS or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Client-side vulnerabilities can lead to XSS attacks, client-side injection attacks, data breaches, account compromise, malicious script execution within the user's browser context, and other security issues.
*   **Affected Apollo Client Component:** `useQuery`, `useMutation`, application code using Apollo Client APIs, data handling logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when using Apollo Client APIs.
    *   Sanitize and validate user inputs before incorporating them into GraphQL queries, even when using parameterized queries, to prevent unexpected behavior or injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Carefully handle data received from the GraphQL server and avoid introducing client-side vulnerabilities (like XSS) when processing and displaying responses.
    *   Implement proper output encoding and sanitization when rendering data received from the GraphQL server in the UI.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews and security testing of client-side code, including static analysis and dynamic testing.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Apollo Client Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_apollo_client_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Apollo Client relies on numerous third-party libraries and dependencies. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect the security of applications using Apollo Client. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and other security issues depending on the nature and severity of the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Affected Apollo Client Component:** Apollo Client library itself, underlying dependencies (e.g., `graphql`, `zen-observable-ts`, etc.)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Apollo Client and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, yarn audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and monitor for vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    *   Implement a dependency management strategy to track and manage project dependencies effectively.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to JavaScript and Node.js ecosystems to stay informed about potential threats.
    *   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automate dependency vulnerability scanning and management.
