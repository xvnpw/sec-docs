# Attack Surface Analysis for apollographql/apollo-client

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Query/Mutation Injection](./attack_surfaces/graphql_querymutation_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious GraphQL syntax or manipulating query variables to gain unauthorized access, modify data, or cause denial of service.
*   **Apollo Client Contribution:** Apollo Client facilitates sending GraphQL queries and mutations. If developers dynamically construct queries using unsanitized user input *before* passing them to Apollo Client, it directly enables this attack vector.
*   **Example:** A filtering feature where user input is directly concatenated into a GraphQL query string. An attacker could inject malicious GraphQL operators or fields into the input via Apollo Client to bypass filters, access restricted data, or craft resource-intensive queries.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Use Parameterized Queries:**  Always utilize Apollo Client's `variables` feature for dynamic values in queries and mutations. This prevents direct string concatenation and isolates user input from the query structure.
    *   **Server-Side Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the GraphQL server within resolvers to further mitigate injection attempts, even if client-side is bypassed.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Caching Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/client-side_caching_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to sensitive data being stored in Apollo Client's cache (in-memory or persisted), potentially leading to unauthorized access or data leakage.
*   **Apollo Client Contribution:** Apollo Client's built-in caching mechanisms, designed for performance optimization, can inadvertently store sensitive data in browser storage. This becomes an attack surface if not handled securely.
*   **Example:** Caching user authentication tokens, API keys, or personal identifiable information (PII) in Apollo Client's persistent cache (e.g., `localStorage`). An attacker gaining access to the user's browser or through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) could extract this cached sensitive information via Apollo Client's cache access.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, identity theft, privacy violations, unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Caching Highly Sensitive Data:**  Refrain from caching extremely sensitive data if possible. Carefully evaluate what data is necessary to cache for performance and exclude sensitive information.
    *   **Implement Secure Storage for Sensitive Data (Alternative to Cache):** If sensitive data needs client-side persistence, use secure browser storage mechanisms with encryption and access control, *outside* of Apollo Client's default caching if necessary.
    *   **Vigilant XSS Prevention:**  Aggressively prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, as XSS is a primary attack vector to exploit client-side cache vulnerabilities and access data managed by Apollo Client.

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional Data Over-fetching due to Client-Driven Queries](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_data_over-fetching_due_to_client-driven_queries.md)

*   **Description:**  While not a direct Apollo Client vulnerability *per se*, the ease of constructing flexible GraphQL queries with Apollo Client can lead to developers inadvertently requesting and receiving more data than necessary, increasing potential data exposure if server-side authorization is weak.
*   **Apollo Client Contribution:** Apollo Client empowers developers to easily construct and execute complex GraphQL queries. This flexibility, if not coupled with careful query design and strong server-side controls, can contribute to unintentional over-fetching and data exposure.
*   **Example:** A developer using Apollo Client to fetch user profiles might construct a query that requests all available fields, including sensitive fields like email addresses and phone numbers, even if the application UI only displays usernames. If the GraphQL server lacks field-level authorization, Apollo Client will retrieve and cache this excessive sensitive data client-side.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, information disclosure, increased attack surface for subsequent vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Query Design:**  Design client-side GraphQL queries using Apollo Client to request *only* the data strictly necessary for the application's functionality.
    *   **Implement Field-Level Authorization (GraphQL Server):** Enforce robust authorization at the GraphQL server level, specifically at the field level, to ensure users can only access data they are explicitly authorized to view, regardless of client-side query structure.
    *   **Regular Schema and Query Review:** Periodically review the GraphQL schema and client-side queries using Apollo Client to identify and minimize potential data over-fetching and unnecessary data exposure.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Complex Queries](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_complex_queries.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by sending resource-intensive GraphQL queries that overwhelm the server, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Apollo Client Contribution:** Apollo Client simplifies the process of sending complex GraphQL queries. Attackers can leverage Apollo Client to easily craft and dispatch malicious, resource-intensive queries to the GraphQL server.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses Apollo Client to send deeply nested queries or queries with a large number of fields, causing the GraphQL server to exhaust CPU, memory, or database connections, rendering it unresponsive to legitimate requests.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, unavailability of the application, business disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **GraphQL Query Complexity Analysis and Limits (Server-Side):** Implement query complexity analysis on the GraphQL server to calculate the computational cost of incoming queries and reject those exceeding predefined complexity thresholds.
    *   **Query Depth Limiting (Server-Side):** Limit the maximum depth of GraphQL queries to prevent excessively nested queries from consuming excessive server resources.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Request Throttling (Server-Side):** Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the GraphQL server to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a given timeframe, mitigating DoS attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Apollo Client and its Ecosystem](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_apollo_client_and_its_ecosystem.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities present in third-party dependencies used by Apollo Client or its related packages, potentially leading to various security breaches.
*   **Apollo Client Contribution:** Apollo Client, being a JavaScript library, relies on numerous dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly compromise applications using Apollo Client if not properly managed.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a dependency used by `apollo-link-http` that allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE). Applications using Apollo Client and this vulnerable dependency become susceptible to RCE attacks.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service, and other impacts depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Dependency Management:** Regularly update Apollo Client and *all* its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Integrate dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) into the development pipeline to automatically identify and alert on vulnerabilities in the project's dependency tree.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Patching:** Continuously monitor security advisories for Apollo Client and its ecosystem and apply necessary patches and updates as soon as they are released.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side State Manipulation for Security Bypass (State Management with Apollo Client)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_state_manipulation_for_security_bypass__state_management_with_apollo_client_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by directly manipulating client-side state managed by Apollo Client (when used for state management), potentially bypassing client-side security controls or gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Apollo Client Contribution:** If Apollo Client is utilized for client-side state management (using `@client` directives or local resolvers), it becomes responsible for managing application state that might include security-sensitive information or control application logic. Direct manipulation of this state becomes a potential attack vector.
*   **Example:** An application uses Apollo Client to manage client-side authentication state. An attacker, using browser developer tools or malicious scripts, directly modifies the Apollo Client cache or state to alter the authentication status, bypassing client-side authentication checks and gaining unauthorized access to protected features.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, bypassing client-side security controls, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Sole Reliance on Client-Side State for Security:** Do not depend solely on client-side state managed by Apollo Client for critical security decisions or authorization. Always enforce security controls and authorization on the server-side.
    *   **Secure State Update Mechanisms:** Ensure that state updates managed by Apollo Client are performed through controlled and validated mechanisms, avoiding direct manipulation from untrusted sources.
    *   **Treat Client-Side State as Potentially Compromised:** Design the application with the assumption that client-side state can be manipulated. Implement server-side validation and authorization for all sensitive operations, regardless of client-side state.
