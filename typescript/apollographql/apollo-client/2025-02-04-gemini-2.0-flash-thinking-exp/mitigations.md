# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apollographql/apollo-client

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterize GraphQL Variables](./mitigation_strategies/parameterize_graphql_variables.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Inputs in Client Code:** Locate all instances in your Apollo Client code where user-provided data is being used to construct GraphQL queries or mutations.
    2.  **Use GraphQL Variables:**  Instead of string interpolation or concatenation, rewrite queries and mutations to use GraphQL variables (`$variableName`).
    3.  **Pass Variables in Apollo Client Calls:** When using `client.query` or `client.mutate`, provide user input data as an object in the `variables` option. Ensure the keys in this object match the variable names defined in your GraphQL query.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **GraphQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents client-side construction of malicious GraphQL queries by separating user input from the query structure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **GraphQL Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk of client-side GraphQL injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:** Throughout the codebase where Apollo Client is used for data fetching.  Variable usage is a standard practice in modern Apollo Client applications.
    *   **Example:** Most components fetching data using Apollo Client should be using variables for dynamic parts of queries.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:**  Potentially in older code sections or newly added code where developers might inadvertently use string interpolation instead of variables. Requires code review to ensure consistent variable usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sensitive Data Caching Considerations & Fetch Policies](./mitigation_strategies/sensitive_data_caching_considerations_&_fetch_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Queries:** Determine which GraphQL queries fetch sensitive data that should not be cached client-side or needs careful cache management.
    2.  **Apply `no-cache` or `network-only` Fetch Policies:** For these sensitive queries, explicitly set the `fetchPolicy` option in `client.query` to either `'no-cache'` or `'network-only'`.  `'no-cache'` bypasses the cache for reads and writes. `'network-only'` bypasses the cache for reads but still updates the cache on write. Choose the policy that best suits the data sensitivity and update frequency.
    3.  **Review Default Cache Policies:**  Understand the default cache policies in your Apollo Client configuration and adjust them if necessary to be more restrictive for sensitive data.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Data Exposure through Caching (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data from being unintentionally stored in the Apollo Client cache, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if the client-side storage is compromised.
    *   **Serving Stale and Outdated Sensitive Data (Medium Severity):** Ensures that sensitive data is always fetched fresh from the server, preventing the display of outdated or incorrect information due to caching.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side Data Exposure through Caching:** Moderately to Significantly reduces the risk for specific sensitive queries by preventing or limiting caching.
    *   **Serving Stale and Outdated Sensitive Data:** Moderately reduces the risk by ensuring data freshness for critical information.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:**  Specific `client.query` calls where sensitive data is fetched.  Fetch policies are configured on a per-query basis within the Apollo Client code.
    *   **Example:** Using `fetchPolicy: 'network-only'` for queries retrieving user profile details or financial transactions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:** Inconsistent application of `fetchPolicy` across all sensitive data queries.  Potentially relying on default caching behavior for sensitive information without explicit consideration. Requires a review of all data fetching operations to ensure appropriate fetch policies are applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side Output Encoding](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_output_encoding.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Frameworks with Automatic Encoding:** Utilize front-end frameworks (like React, Angular, Vue.js) that provide automatic output encoding by default in their templating mechanisms (JSX, template binding, etc.).
    2.  **Sanitize Raw HTML (If Necessary):** If you must render raw HTML received from the GraphQL server, use a client-side sanitization library (like DOMPurify) to sanitize the HTML content *before* rendering it in the UI.  Avoid directly rendering unsanitized HTML from GraphQL responses.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via GraphQL Responses (High Severity):** Prevents client-side execution of malicious scripts that might be present in GraphQL responses, especially in user-generated content.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via GraphQL Responses:** Significantly reduces the risk of client-side XSS vulnerabilities arising from GraphQL data rendering.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:** Front-end UI components using modern frameworks.  Automatic encoding is often a built-in feature of these frameworks.
    *   **Example:** React components using JSX for rendering, which automatically encodes strings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:**  Cases where raw HTML is rendered without sanitization, or in legacy code not using frameworks with automatic encoding. Requires review of UI rendering logic, particularly for user-generated content or rich text data from the GraphQL API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Apollo Client and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_apollo_client_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Dependency Auditing Tools:**  Incorporate dependency auditing tools (like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`) into your development workflow and CI/CD pipeline to regularly scan your project's dependencies, including Apollo Client libraries.
    2.  **Update Apollo Client Libraries:** Keep `@apollo/client`, `graphql`, and related Apollo Client dependencies updated to the latest stable versions. Follow semantic versioning and test updates thoroughly.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Severity varies):** Addresses known security vulnerabilities within Apollo Client libraries and their dependencies, protecting against potential exploits.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in Apollo Client and its ecosystem.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:** Development process and CI/CD. Dependency auditing can be automated.  Regular updates are part of good software maintenance practices.
    *   **Example:** Using `npm audit` in CI/CD and having a process for reviewing and applying dependency updates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:**  Infrequent dependency updates, lack of automated auditing, or delayed response to security advisories related to Apollo Client. Needs to be a consistent and proactive part of the development lifecycle.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure `Authorization` Header using Apollo Link](./mitigation_strategies/configure__authorization__header_using_apollo_link.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `ApolloLink` for Header Management:** Utilize Apollo Client's `ApolloLink` mechanism to intercept all outgoing GraphQL requests.
    2.  **Implement `setContext` Link:** Create an `ApolloLink` using `setContext` to modify the request context.
    3.  **Add `Authorization` Header:** Within the `setContext` link, access your authentication token from secure storage (e.g., cookies, sessionStorage) and add it to the `Authorization` header of the request.
    4.  **Apply Link to Apollo Client:** Ensure this `ApolloLink` is included in the chain of links when creating your `ApolloClient` instance.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Ensures that authentication tokens are consistently sent with requests requiring authorization, preventing unauthorized access to protected GraphQL resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by enforcing authentication at the Apollo Client level.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:** Apollo Client initialization code.  `ApolloLink` is the standard way to handle request headers and middleware in Apollo Client.
    *   **Example:** Using `createHttpLink` and `setContext` to construct the link chain for Apollo Client, including the `Authorization` header logic.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:**  Not consistently adding the `Authorization` header to all authenticated requests, or manually adding headers in individual `client.query` calls instead of using `ApolloLink` for centralized management.  Requires ensuring `ApolloLink` is correctly configured and applied to all requests needing authentication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize Client-Side Error Handling in Apollo Client](./mitigation_strategies/customize_client-side_error_handling_in_apollo_client.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement `onError` Link:** Use Apollo Client's `onError` link (part of `ApolloLink`) to intercept GraphQL errors returned from the server.
    2.  **Generic Error Messages:** Within the `onError` link, implement logic to display generic, user-friendly error messages to the user. Avoid showing detailed server error responses or stack traces directly in the UI.
    3.  **Error Logging (Client-Side):**  Optionally, within the `onError` link, log error details (without sensitive information) to a client-side logging service for debugging and monitoring purposes.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Error Messages (Low to Medium Severity):** Prevents the client-side UI from displaying overly detailed server error messages that could reveal sensitive information about the server or application internals.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Error Messages:** Moderately reduces the risk of information leakage via client-side error displays.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:** Apollo Client setup using `ApolloLink`.  `onError` is a standard way to handle errors globally in Apollo Client.
    *   **Example:** Using `onError` link to display a generic "Something went wrong" message and log error details to a console or a client-side error tracking service.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:**  Default error handling that directly displays server error responses in the UI, potentially exposing sensitive information. Requires implementing a custom `onError` link to control error display and logging.
