    - security requirement: Mechanisms should be in place to prevent tokens from being exposed in client-side code or logs unintentionally.
    - security requirement:  Consider supporting secure storage of authentication tokens in the browser (e.g., using HttpOnly cookies or secure local storage).
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Apollo Client should correctly process and enforce authorization decisions returned by the GraphQL API.
    - security requirement:  Applications using Apollo Client should implement proper authorization logic based on the data and operations exposed by the GraphQL API.
    - security requirement:  Apollo Client should not bypass or weaken authorization mechanisms implemented on the GraphQL server.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Apollo Client should sanitize and validate GraphQL queries and variables before sending them to the server to prevent injection attacks.
    - security requirement:  The library should handle potentially malicious or malformed GraphQL responses gracefully without causing application crashes or vulnerabilities.
    - security requirement:  Applications using Apollo Client should also perform input validation on data received from the GraphQL API to prevent client-side vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: All communication between Apollo Client and the GraphQL server must be encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.
    - security requirement:  If Apollo Client stores sensitive data locally (e.g., in cache), consider using encryption to protect this data at rest.
    - security requirement:  Ensure that any cryptographic operations performed by Apollo Client are implemented using secure and well-vetted cryptographic libraries.

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code for Apollo Client on their local workstations.
2.  Code is committed and pushed to the Apollo Client GitHub repository, leveraging Git for version control.
3.  GitHub Actions or a similar CI/CD system is triggered by code changes in the repository.
4.  The CI/CD pipeline executes a series of automated steps:
    -   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is performed to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
    -   Dependency scanning is conducted to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
    -   Linters are used to enforce code style and quality standards.
    -   Automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) are executed to ensure code functionality and stability.
5.  If all checks pass, the CI/CD pipeline builds the distributable artifacts, such as npm packages and CDN files.
6.  The build artifacts are published to package registries like npm and potentially CDNs for distribution to developers and applications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Distribution of Apollo Client library to developers.
- Functionality and reliability of Apollo Client library for applications using it.
- Community trust and adoption of Apollo Client.
- Development and maintenance of Apollo Client library.

Data Sensitivity:
- Source code of Apollo Client: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
- User data handled by applications using Apollo Client: Sensitivity depends on the application context. Apollo Client itself does not store user data persistently, but it handles data fetched from GraphQL APIs which can be highly sensitive. The sensitivity is inherited from the applications using Apollo Client and the GraphQL APIs they interact with.
- Build artifacts (npm packages, CDN files): Medium sensitivity. Integrity is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific SAST and dependency scanning tools are currently used in the Apollo Client CI/CD pipeline?
- Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure policy in place for Apollo Client?
- Are regular security audits or penetration testing conducted for Apollo Client?
- What security training is provided to developers contributing to Apollo Client?
- Are there specific guidelines or documentation for developers on how to use Apollo Client securely?
- What is the process for handling and patching security vulnerabilities discovered in Apollo Client?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a widely adopted and trusted GraphQL client library for JavaScript developers. Security, performance, and ease of use are key priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Standard open-source development security practices are generally followed, but there is room for improvement in implementing more proactive security controls like automated security scanning and formal security audits. HTTPS is assumed for communication with GraphQL APIs.
- DESIGN: The design is based on a typical client-side JavaScript library architecture, with core library, caching, networking, and developer tooling components. Deployment is primarily focused on web browsers and mobile applications, distributed via package managers and CDNs. The build process involves standard CI/CD practices with potential for enhanced security checks.
