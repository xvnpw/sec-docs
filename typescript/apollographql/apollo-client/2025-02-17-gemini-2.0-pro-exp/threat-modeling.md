# Threat Model Analysis for apollographql/apollo-client

## Threat: [Over-fetching Leading to Data Exposure](./threats/over-fetching_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker passively observes network traffic or inspects the browser's developer tools. They notice that GraphQL queries made by *Apollo Client* are requesting more data fields than are actually displayed or used by the application. The attacker identifies sensitive data within these over-fetched responses. This is a direct consequence of how queries are constructed *within* the Apollo Client usage.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, internal system information, or proprietary data not intended for client-side access. This can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, or competitive disadvantage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ApolloClient` instance (specifically, the query execution logic), `Query` component (or equivalent hooks like `useQuery`), and any custom link implementations that handle query execution.  The core issue is how queries are defined and executed *by* Apollo Client.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Precise Queries:** Developers must write GraphQL queries that request *only* the fields needed by the UI component. Avoid wildcard selections (`...`) and unnecessary field requests. This is a direct mitigation within the Apollo Client code.
        *   **Fragment Usage:** Utilize GraphQL fragments to define reusable sets of fields, promoting consistency and minimizing over-fetching. This is a best practice *within* Apollo Client usage.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for all GraphQL queries, with a focus on data minimization. This directly targets the code using Apollo Client.
        *   **(Defense in Depth) Backend Validation:** Implement server-side validation and authorization. While server-side, this is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Client-Side Cache Poisoning](./threats/client-side_cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (like XSS, though the XSS itself isn't the *direct* Apollo Client threat) to inject malicious data *into the Apollo Client cache*.  The attacker crafts data that mimics legitimate responses but contains incorrect or harmful information. The vulnerability lies in the fact that Apollo Client *has* a cache that can be manipulated.
    *   **Impact:** The application displays incorrect data, potentially leading to incorrect decisions by the user, execution of malicious logic (if the cached data influences application behavior), or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `InMemoryCache` (or any custom cache implementation used with `ApolloClient`). Specifically, the `writeQuery`, `writeFragment`, and `readQuery` methods of the cache. These are *direct* Apollo Client components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Defense in Depth) Strict HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS. While a general best practice, it directly impacts the security of data fetched and cached by Apollo Client.
        *   **(Defense in Depth) XSS Prevention:** Implement robust XSS prevention. While not Apollo-specific, XSS is a common vector for cache poisoning.
        *   **Cache Key Hardening:** Ensure cache keys are derived from data that is difficult for an attacker to control. This is a direct configuration aspect of `InMemoryCache`.
        *   **Input Validation (Post-Cache):** Validate data retrieved from the *Apollo Client cache* as if it were coming directly from the network. Don't assume cached data is safe. This is a crucial step in using the cache.
        *   **Cache Invalidation:** Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies (e.g., time-based expiry, mutation-triggered invalidation). These are direct configurations of the `InMemoryCache`.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Authentication Tokens](./threats/insecure_handling_of_authentication_tokens.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to an authentication token (e.g., JWT) *used by Apollo Client* to authorize requests. This could occur through insecure storage (e.g., `localStorage` without proper protection) facilitated by how the token is managed *within the Apollo Client setup*. The vulnerability is in how Apollo Client is *configured* to handle the token.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, impersonation of legitimate users, potential for data modification or deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ApolloClient` instance (specifically, the configuration related to setting HTTP headers), custom links that handle authentication (e.g., `authLink`), and any code responsible for storing and retrieving the authentication token *within the Apollo Client context*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Token Storage:** Use HTTP-only cookies or secure browser storage APIs with appropriate security attributes (e.g., `SameSite`, `Secure`). This is about *how* the token is stored, often influenced by the Apollo Client setup.
        *   **(Defense in Depth) HTTPS Enforcement:** Always use HTTPS. Directly impacts the security of tokens used by Apollo Client.
        *   **Token Invalidation:** Implement robust token invalidation on the server-side upon logout or session expiry. The client-side (Apollo Client) should also clear the token.
        *   **Short-Lived Tokens:** Use short-lived access tokens and implement a secure refresh token mechanism. This often involves configuring Apollo Client to handle refresh tokens.

## Threat: [Bypassing Client-Side Authorization Checks](./threats/bypassing_client-side_authorization_checks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the client-side JavaScript code to bypass authorization checks implemented *within Apollo Client-related logic* or React components that use Apollo Client data.  The vulnerability is that client-side checks *exist* and are relied upon, often within components using Apollo Client hooks.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential for data modification or deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any component that uses Apollo Client data or performs client-side authorization checks (e.g., `Query`, `Mutation`, `useQuery`, `useMutation`, custom hooks). This is a direct threat to the logic *surrounding* Apollo Client usage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Primary Mitigation) Server-Side Authorization:** *Always* enforce authorization on the GraphQL *server*. Client-side checks are for usability and should never be the sole security mechanism. This is the fundamental mitigation.
        *   **Code Obfuscation (Limited Benefit):** While not a strong security measure, it can make it slightly harder.
