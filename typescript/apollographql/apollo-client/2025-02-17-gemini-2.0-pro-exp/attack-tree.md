## Attack Tree Path: [[[2. Manipulate GraphQL Operations]]](./attack_tree_paths/__2__manipulate_graphql_operations__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the central critical node. The attacker aims to directly interact with the GraphQL server in an unauthorized way, bypassing intended application logic and security controls. This is achieved through vulnerabilities in how the application constructs and handles GraphQL queries and mutations.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on server-side authorization and input validation)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Can lead to unauthorized data access or modification)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of application logic and potentially exploiting server-side vulnerabilities)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring server logs and potentially analyzing application behavior)

## Attack Tree Path: [==[[2.1 Query Injection]]==](./attack_tree_paths/==__2_1_query_injection__==.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious GraphQL code into a query, similar to SQL injection. This allows them to request data they shouldn't have access to or potentially even modify data if the injected code includes mutations. This is possible if user input is directly incorporated into GraphQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **How:** The attacker crafts input that, when concatenated into the GraphQL query string, alters the query's structure and intent. For example, they might add fields to retrieve sensitive data or use fragments to bypass access controls.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (If GraphQL variables are used correctly; higher if not)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Can lead to unauthorized data access or modification)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding of GraphQL syntax and application logic)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring GraphQL queries and server logs)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use GraphQL Variables:** *Always* use GraphQL variables for user-supplied data. Never directly embed user input into the query string. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Schema Validation:** Ensure the GraphQL server enforces strict schema validation. This prevents attackers from requesting unauthorized fields.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Defense-in-Depth):** While variables are the primary defense, consider input sanitization as an additional layer.
    *   **Query Whitelisting/Complexity Limits:** Consider limiting the complexity of allowed queries or using a whitelist of pre-approved queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [==[[2.2 Mutation Abuse]]==](./attack_tree_paths/==__2_2_mutation_abuse__==.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's mutation logic to perform unauthorized actions. This could involve creating, modifying, or deleting data without proper authorization. This often stems from insufficient server-side validation and authorization checks within the mutation resolvers.
*   **How:** The attacker sends crafted mutations with unexpected or malicious input values. They might exploit flaws in the server-side logic that handles the mutations, bypassing intended security checks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on server-side authorization and input validation)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Can lead to unauthorized data modification, deletion, or other actions)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of application logic and potentially exploiting server-side vulnerabilities)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring server logs and potentially analyzing application behavior)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Authorization:** Implement robust authorization checks *on the server* within the resolvers for *each* mutation. Do *not* rely on client-side checks.
    *   **Input Validation (Server-Side):** Thoroughly validate *all* input to mutations on the server. Check data types, ranges, allowed values, and any other relevant constraints.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure users only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their intended actions.
    *   **Transaction Management:** Use database transactions to ensure that mutations are atomic and that partial failures don't leave the system in an inconsistent state.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all mutation operations, including the user who performed the action, the input values, and the result.
