## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Script Injection (Indirectly via other vulnerabilities) - High-Risk Path & Critical Node:](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_script_injection__indirectly_via_other_vulnerabilities__-_high-risk_path_&_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a separate vulnerability in the application (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) to inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** The injected script can then intercept and modify GraphQL operations performed by the Apollo Client. This allows the attacker to:
    *   Change the destination of GraphQL requests.
    *   Modify query parameters and variables to access unauthorized data or trigger unintended actions.
    *   Send malicious mutations to manipulate application state.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (dependent on the presence of XSS vulnerabilities).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (if XSS is present, exploiting it to manipulate GraphQL is relatively straightforward).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (requires understanding of JavaScript and GraphQL).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires monitoring for unusual script behavior and network requests).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Variable Handling - High-Risk Path & Critical Node:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_variable_handling_-_high-risk_path_&_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate variables used in GraphQL queries and mutations on the server-side. An attacker can manipulate these variables on the client-side (or intercept and modify them) to inject malicious values.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breaches:** Accessing sensitive data that the user should not have permission to view.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Performing actions with higher privileges by manipulating user IDs or role parameters.
    *   **Application Errors:** Injecting unexpected data types or values that cause the server-side application to crash or behave unpredictably.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if server-side validation is weak or missing).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on the complexity of the GraphQL schema and variables).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (requires understanding of GraphQL and server-side logic).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires logging and analysis of GraphQL requests and server-side error logs).

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of Authentication Tokens - High-Risk Path & Critical Node:](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_authentication_tokens_-_high-risk_path_&_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** The Apollo Client stores authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) in an insecure manner on the client-side, such as in local storage without proper encryption or protection.
*   **Impact:** If an attacker can gain access to the stored tokens (e.g., through XSS, malware, or physical access to the device), they can impersonate the legitimate user. This allows them to:
    *   Access the user's account and sensitive data.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user, including making purchases, changing settings, or deleting data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (a common developer mistake).
*   **Effort:** Low (once the storage location is identified, accessing local storage is trivial).
*   **Skill Level:** Low (basic understanding of browser developer tools).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (reviewing client-side code or examining local storage).

## Attack Tree Path: [Apollo Client Stores Authentication Tokens Insecurely (e.g., local storage without proper protection) - Critical Node:](./attack_tree_paths/apollo_client_stores_authentication_tokens_insecurely__e_g___local_storage_without_proper_protection_c322972d.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the specific point of failure within the "Insecure Handling of Authentication Tokens" path. The Apollo Client's configuration or implementation directly leads to the insecure storage of sensitive authentication credentials.
*   **Impact:** This directly enables the attacker to gain access to the authentication token, which is the key to impersonating the user.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (dependent on development practices).
*   **Effort:** Low (requires a simple implementation flaw).
*   **Skill Level:** Low (a basic oversight in security).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (code review can easily identify this).

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via GraphQL Operations - High-Risk Path:](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__via_graphql_operations_-_high-risk_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** The Apollo Client is not configured to include CSRF protection tokens in state-changing GraphQL requests (e.g., mutations). An attacker can then craft a malicious web page or email that, when visited or opened by an authenticated user, forces their browser to make unintended GraphQL requests to the application's server.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can trick the user into performing actions they did not intend, such as:
    *   Changing their account settings.
    *   Making purchases.
    *   Transferring funds.
    *   Deleting data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if CSRF protection is not implemented).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (crafting a CSRF attack is relatively straightforward).
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (reviewing request headers for missing CSRF tokens).
