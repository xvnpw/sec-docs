# Attack Surface Analysis for apollographql/apollo-client

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Request Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/graphql_request_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** GraphQL Request Manipulation
    *   **How Apollo Client Contributes:** Apollo Client is the mechanism through which GraphQL requests are constructed and sent. If application logic allows manipulation of query variables or the query structure *before* Apollo Client sends it, attackers can craft malicious requests. Apollo Client's API for constructing queries and variables is the direct interface for this manipulation.
    *   **Example:**  Developer uses client-side logic to build a query based on user input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious variables that Apollo Client then sends to the server.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification of data belonging to other users, execution of unintended mutations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly validate and sanitize all client-provided inputs *before* incorporating them into GraphQL queries or variables used by Apollo Client.**
        *   **Favor parameterized queries and variables** when using Apollo Client to avoid direct string concatenation of user input into queries.
        *   While server-side validation is crucial, ensure client-side logic interacting with Apollo Client doesn't create opportunities for request manipulation.

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Response Manipulation/Injection (Client-Side)](./attack_surfaces/graphql_response_manipulationinjection__client-side_.md)

*   **Description:** GraphQL Response Manipulation/Injection (Client-Side)
    *   **How Apollo Client Contributes:** Apollo Client's core functionality is to parse and process responses from the GraphQL server. Vulnerabilities in Apollo Client's response parsing logic itself, or in how the application handles the data *returned* by Apollo Client, can be exploited by malicious servers sending crafted responses.
    *   **Example:** A compromised server sends a response with specially crafted data that exploits a vulnerability in Apollo Client's JSON parsing, leading to a client-side crash. Alternatively, if the application blindly renders data returned by Apollo Client without sanitization, a malicious server could inject JavaScript that executes in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side crashes, denial-of-service, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) if the manipulated data processed by Apollo Client is rendered in the UI without proper escaping.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure the GraphQL server is secured and trusted.** This is the primary defense.
        *   **Keep Apollo Client and its dependencies updated** to benefit from security patches addressing vulnerabilities in response parsing.
        *   **Sanitize and validate data *received from Apollo Client*** before rendering it in the UI to prevent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Apollo Client Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/apollo_client_cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** Apollo Client Cache Poisoning
    *   **How Apollo Client Contributes:** Apollo Client's built-in caching mechanism stores GraphQL responses. If an attacker can manipulate a response *before* Apollo Client caches it, this malicious data will be served to subsequent requests. The vulnerability lies in the trust Apollo Client implicitly places in the received response.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a response and modifies the data before it reaches Apollo Client. Apollo Client then caches this altered data, causing incorrect information to be displayed to other users who subsequently request the same data.
    *   **Impact:** Displaying incorrect or malicious data to users, potentially leading to financial loss, misinformation, or client-side script execution if the poisoned data is rendered without sanitization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS** to protect communication and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that enable response manipulation before caching.
        *   **Implement robust cache invalidation strategies** to minimize the duration of potentially poisoned data in the cache.
        *   **Consider the security implications of caching sensitive data** and potentially disable caching for highly sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in GraphQL Requests](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_graphql_requests.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in GraphQL Requests
    *   **How Apollo Client Contributes:** Developers might directly embed sensitive information into the GraphQL queries or variables they construct and send using Apollo Client's API. This makes the exposure directly tied to how Apollo Client is used.
    *   **Example:** An API key is hardcoded as a variable within a mutation defined using Apollo Client's `gql` tag or when constructing variables programmatically. This key is then sent in the request.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to backend services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in client-side code where Apollo Client is used.**
        *   **Utilize secure methods for handling authentication and authorization** that don't involve directly embedding secrets in the request body (e.g., using HTTP headers).
        *   **Review code where Apollo Client is used to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently included in queries or variables.**

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Apollo Client Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_apollo_client_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Apollo Client Dependencies
    *   **How Apollo Client Contributes:** Apollo Client relies on a set of third-party libraries for its functionality. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, applications using Apollo Client are indirectly vulnerable. This is a standard supply chain security risk associated with using any library.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a networking library used by Apollo Client could allow an attacker to intercept or manipulate network traffic.
    *   **Impact:** A wide range of potential vulnerabilities depending on the specific dependency and the nature of the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial-of-service, or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Apollo Client and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions** to benefit from security patches.
        *   **Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities** using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   **Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies and their potential vulnerabilities.**
