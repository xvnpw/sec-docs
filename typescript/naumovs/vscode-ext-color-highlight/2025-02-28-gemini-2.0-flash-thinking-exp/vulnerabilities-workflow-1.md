### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via SCSS/SASS Import Path Traversal

- **Description:**

    - The extension is designed to highlight colors defined in SCSS/SASS variables, including those imported from external files via the `@import` directive.
    - The `findScssVars` function, located in `/code/src/strategies/scss-vars.js`, is responsible for identifying these variables. It utilizes the `parseImports` function from `../lib/sass-importer` to handle the resolution and reading of files specified in `@import` statements.
    - The `parseImports` function relies on `importerOptions`, which crucially includes `includePaths` sourced directly from the extension's configuration (`viewConfig.sass.includePaths`).
    - A critical vulnerability arises if the `parseImports` function lacks proper sanitization or validation of both the `includePaths` and the import paths within SCSS/SASS files. This oversight could allow a malicious actor to craft a specific SCSS/SASS file that, when opened within VSCode, could enable the reading of arbitrary files from the user's file system.
    - Attackers can exploit this by manipulating the `includePaths` configuration setting of the extension. Alternatively, insecure default configurations could also be exploited. By crafting a malicious `@import` statement, they can attempt to traverse directories outside the intended workspace, potentially accessing sensitive files using paths like `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.
    - When a user opens a SCSS/SASS file containing such a maliciously crafted `@import` statement while the extension is active in VSCode, the `findScssVars` function is triggered.
    - Subsequently, the `parseImports` function attempts to resolve the malicious import path. If path traversal is not adequately prevented, this could lead to the unintended disclosure of contents from arbitrary files on the user's system.

- **Impact:**

    - **High**. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read any file on the user's system that the user has access to. This includes sensitive data such as configuration files, source code, credentials, and personal documents, significantly compromising confidentiality and potentially leading to further attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**

    - **high**

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**

    - **None apparent from the provided code.**  The code analysis reveals that `includePaths` from the extension's configuration is directly passed to the `parseImports` function without any visible sanitization or validation in `findScssVars.js`. Although a `try-catch` block surrounds the `parseImports` call, it only serves to handle errors during the import loading process and gracefully falls back to local variable parsing. Critically, it does not prevent the path traversal attempt itself, meaning the vulnerability remains unmitigated.

- **Missing Mitigations:**

    - **Input sanitization and validation for `includePaths` configuration.** The extension must implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `includePaths` configuration setting. This should involve verifying that paths are restricted to a safe set of directories, ideally relative to the workspace root. Absolute paths or relative paths that could traverse outside the workspace should be disallowed or strictly controlled.
    - **Input sanitization and validation for import paths within SCSS/SASS files.**  The `parseImports` function itself must be enhanced to sanitize and validate the import paths specified in `@import` statements. This should prevent traversal beyond allowed directories (e.g., workspace and explicitly defined `includePaths`). Techniques such as canonicalization and path comparison should be employed to ensure import paths remain within permitted boundaries.

- **Preconditions:**

    - The "color-highlight" VSCode extension must be installed and active.
    - The user must open a file with either `.scss` or `.sass` extension in VSCode.
    - The extension's configuration `sass.includePaths` must be set to a directory that, when combined with a malicious import path, facilitates path traversal. Alternatively, the vulnerability may be exploitable even with default settings if the default path resolution logic is flawed.
    - The opened SCSS/SASS file must contain a specifically crafted `@import` statement that includes a path traversal sequence (e.g., using `../` to move up directory levels).

- **Source Code Analysis:**

    - `/code/src/strategies/scss-vars.js`:

        ```javascript
        import { parseImports } from '../lib/sass-importer';

        export async function findScssVars(text, importerOptions) {
          let textWithImports = text;

          try {
            textWithImports = await parseImports(importerOptions); // [!] Potential Vulnerability: User-controlled importerOptions.includePaths passed directly to parseImports
          } catch(err) {
            console.log('Error during imports loading, falling back to local variables parsing');
          }

          // ... rest of the code
        }
        ```
        - The `findScssVars` function is responsible for extracting SCSS/SASS variables. It calls the `parseImports` function, passing it an `importerOptions` object.
        - The critical point is that `importerOptions` includes `includePaths`, which is derived directly from the user-configurable extension settings.

    - `/code/src/color-highlight.js`:

        ```javascript
        case 'sass':
        case 'scss':
          this.strategies.push(text => findScssVars(text, {
            data: text,
            cwd: dirname(document.uri.fsPath),
            extensions: ['.scss', '.sass'],
            includePaths: viewConfig.sass.includePaths || [] // [!] User-defined includePaths from configuration
          }));
          break;
        ```
        - Within the `DocumentHighlight` class, for 'sass' and 'scss' file types, the `findScssVars` strategy is added.
        - The `importerOptions` object is constructed here, and `includePaths` is populated with `viewConfig.sass.includePaths || []`. This `viewConfig.sass.includePaths` directly reflects the user's configuration settings for the extension.

    - `/code/src/lib/sass-importer.js` (Not Provided):
        - The `parseImports` function, residing in `sass-importer.js`, is assumed to handle the logic for resolving `@import` statements.
        - The vulnerability likely stems from the *absence* of sanitization within `parseImports`. It is hypothesized that `parseImports` utilizes the provided `includePaths` to search for and resolve import paths without properly validating or sanitizing these paths against path traversal attacks.

    graph LR
        A[User opens SCSS/SASS file] --> B(VSCode activates extension);
        B --> C(DocumentHighlight instance created);
        C --> D{Configuration read (sass.includePaths)};
        D --> E(findScssVars strategy);
        E --> F{parseImports(importerOptions)};
        F --> G{File system access based on import path and includePaths};
        G -- Path Traversal --> H[Arbitrary File Read];
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**

    1. **Setup:**
        - Install the "vscode-ext-color-highlight" extension in VSCode.
        - Create a new folder and open it as a VSCode workspace.
        - Inside the workspace, create a new file named `test.scss`.
        - Populate `test.scss` with the following malicious SCSS code designed to trigger path traversal:
           ```scss
           @import "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"; // Attempt to read /etc/passwd
           $test-color: blue;
           div {
               color: $test-color;
           }
           ```
        - Open VSCode settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings on macOS).
        - Search for "color-highlight.sass.includePaths".
        - Add the current workspace folder path to the "color-highlight.sass.includePaths" setting. This step ensures that the importer considers paths relative to the workspace, although the vulnerability could exist even without this setting if default resolution is flawed.
        - Save the settings and close the settings editor.

    2. **Execution:**
        - Open the `test.scss` file within the VSCode workspace.

    3. **Observation and Verification:**
        - Monitor for any signs that the extension attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file. Direct observation of file content within the editor is unlikely due to VSCode's extension sandboxing.
        - **Indirect Verification via Error Messages:** Check the VSCode developer console (Help > Toggle Developer Tools) for error messages. Errors related to file access or parsing failures when attempting to process `/etc/passwd` could indicate a path traversal attempt. For instance, file system permission errors or file not found errors (if `/etc/passwd` doesn't exist or is not readable) might appear if the extension tries to access it.
        - **Advanced Verification (Debugging - Requires Extension Code Access):** For more definitive proof, and if you have access to the extension's source code, you could temporarily modify the `parseImports` function (within a development/test environment) to log the file paths it attempts to open. By observing these logs when opening `test.scss`, you can directly confirm if the extension is attempting to access files outside the workspace based on the malicious `@import` path.
        - **Expected Outcome:** A successful path traversal exploit means the extension will attempt to access and process the contents of `/etc/passwd`. While direct content display is unlikely, error messages or debugging logs should reveal attempts to access the target file outside the intended workspace scope, confirming the vulnerability.

This security test case demonstrates how an attacker, acting externally and with only access to a publicly available instance of an application (in this case, a VSCode workspace opened with the vulnerable extension), could attempt to exploit the path traversal vulnerability. The crafted `test.scss` file and manipulation of `sass.includePaths` simulate the actions an attacker might take to read arbitrary files on a user's system.
