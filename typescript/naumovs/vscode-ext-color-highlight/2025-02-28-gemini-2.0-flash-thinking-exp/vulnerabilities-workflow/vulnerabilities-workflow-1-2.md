## Vulnerability List for vscode-ext-color-highlight

### 1. Path Traversal in Sass/SCSS Import Handling

- **Description**:
    1. The extension supports highlighting colors defined in Sass/SCSS variables, including variables imported from other files using `@import` statements.
    2. The extension allows users to configure `sass.includePaths` in the settings, which specifies directories to look for imported files.
    3. The `findScssVars` function in `src/strategies/scss-vars.js` uses `parseImports` with user-configured `includePaths` to resolve `@import` statements.
    4. If `parseImports` doesn't properly sanitize or validate the paths in `includePaths` and the paths in `@import` statements, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the user's system.
    5. An attacker could craft a malicious SCSS/SASS file containing `@import` statements that, when combined with a crafted `sass.includePaths` setting, would cause `parseImports` to read files outside the intended workspace directory.

- **Impact**:
    - High: Arbitrary file read. An attacker can potentially read sensitive files on the user's file system, such as configuration files, source code, or documents.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
    - None apparent from the provided code. The code seems to directly use user-provided `includePaths` without sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - Path sanitization and validation in `parseImports` (inferred from `src/strategies/scss-vars.js`).
    - Restricting paths in `sass.includePaths` configuration to be within the workspace or a set of explicitly allowed directories.
    - Preventing the use of absolute paths or relative paths that traverse outside the workspace in `sass.includePaths` configuration.
    - Input validation for `@import` paths within `parseImports` to prevent traversal attempts.

- **Preconditions**:
    1. The user has enabled Sass/SCSS variable highlighting in the extension settings (default enabled for scss and sass languages).
    2. The user has configured `sass.includePaths` to include a path that allows traversal, or an attacker can trick the user into setting such a path (e.g., by providing workspace configuration).
    3. The user opens a Sass/SCSS file controlled by the attacker (e.g., from a cloned Git repository or a downloaded file).
    4. The malicious Sass/SCSS file contains an `@import` statement that, when resolved using the vulnerable `includePaths`, targets a sensitive file on the user's system.

- **Source Code Analysis**:
    1. `src/strategies/scss-vars.js`:
        ```javascript
        export async function findScssVars(text, importerOptions) {
          let textWithImports = text;

          try {
            textWithImports = await parseImports(importerOptions); // [POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY] parseImports uses importerOptions.includePaths without sanitization.
          } catch(err) {
            console.log('Error during imports loading, falling back to local variables parsing');
          }
          // ... rest of the code
        }
        ```
        - The `findScssVars` function calls `parseImports(importerOptions)`.
        - `importerOptions` is passed directly from the `DocumentHighlight` constructor, which takes it from the extension's configuration (`viewConfig.sass.includePaths`).
        - There is no evident sanitization or validation of `importerOptions.includePaths` before it's used by `parseImports`.
    2. `src/color-highlight.js`:
        ```javascript
        case 'sass':
        case 'scss':
          this.strategies.push(text => findScssVars(text, {
            data: text,
            cwd: dirname(document.uri.fsPath),
            extensions: ['.scss', '.sass'],
            includePaths: viewConfig.sass.includePaths || [] // [CONFIGURATION SOURCE] User-configurable includePaths
          }));
          break;
        ```
        - For Sass/SCSS files, `findScssVars` is added as a strategy, and `viewConfig.sass.includePaths` from the extension's configuration is passed to it.
    3. `src/main.js`:
        ```javascript
        export function activate(context) {
          // ...
          config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('color-highlight'); // [CONFIGURATION LOAD] Load extension configuration
          // ...
        }
        ```
        - The extension configuration is loaded using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('color-highlight')`.

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User Configuration: sass.includePaths] --> B(vscode.workspace.getConfiguration);
        B --> C[config (main.js)];
        C --> D[viewConfig (color-highlight.js)];
        D --> E[importerOptions (scss-vars.js)];
        E --> F[parseImports (sass-importer.js - assumed)];
        F --> G{File System Access};
        G -- Path Traversal --> H[Arbitrary File Read];
    ```

- **Security Test Case**:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Create a VSCode workspace.
        - Install the "vscode-ext-color-highlight" extension.
        - Create a directory named `test-scss` in the workspace root.
        - Inside `test-scss`, create two files:
            - `sensitive.txt` with content: `THIS_IS_SENSITIVE_DATA`.
            - `malicious.scss` with content:
              ```scss
              @import "../sensitive.txt";
              $color: red;
              ```
        - Open VSCode settings (Ctrl+,) and go to "Extensions" -> "Color Highlight".
        - In "Sass â€º Include Paths", add the absolute path to the `test-scss` directory of your workspace.
        - Restart VSCode to ensure settings are applied.
        - Set a breakpoint in `src/strategies/scss-vars.js` inside the `findScssVars` function, right after the `parseImports` call, to inspect the `textWithImports` variable.
    2. **Trigger**:
        - Open the `malicious.scss` file in VSCode.
    3. **Verification**:
        - When the breakpoint is hit, examine the value of `textWithImports`.
        - If the path traversal is successful, `textWithImports` will contain the content of `sensitive.txt` prepended to (or included within) the original content of `malicious.scss`. Specifically, check if `textWithImports` contains the string `THIS_IS_SENSITIVE_DATA`.
        - If `textWithImports` includes the sensitive data, it confirms that `parseImports` has successfully read the file using the relative path from the `@import` statement, based on the configured `includePaths`, thus demonstrating path traversal vulnerability.
