### Vulnerability List

* Vulnerability Name: Directory Traversal via Sass Imports
* Description:
    1. A malicious user can configure the `color-highlight.sass.includePaths` setting to include directories outside of the intended workspace, such as the root directory `/`.
    2. The extension uses the `file-importer` library to handle Sass `@import` statements. This library utilizes the configured `includePaths` to resolve import paths.
    3. By crafting a malicious `@import` statement in a `.scss` or `.sass` file, such as `@import "../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd";`, and opening this file in VSCode, the `file-importer` will attempt to resolve this path relative to the directories specified in `includePaths`, which now includes `/`.
    4. This allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files on the user's system if the VSCode process has sufficient permissions.
* Impact:
    An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the user's system that the VSCode process has access to. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, and user data.
* Vulnerability Rank: high
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    No mitigations are implemented within the provided code to prevent directory traversal via Sass imports. The extension directly passes the user-configured `includePaths` and import paths to the `file-importer` library without sanitization or validation.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `color-highlight.sass.includePaths` configuration setting. The extension should validate that the paths are within allowed directories or resolve to workspace-relative paths.
    - Sanitization of import paths within Sass files before passing them to the `file-importer`. The extension could implement checks to ensure that import paths do not traverse outside the workspace or allowed directories.
    - Consider restricting the file system access scope of the `file-importer` library to only the workspace directory.
* Preconditions:
    - The user has the "vscode-ext-color-highlight" extension installed and activated in VSCode.
    - The user has the "color-highlight.sass.includePaths" setting enabled and is able to modify it (either in workspace or user settings).
    - The user opens a `.scss` or `.sass` file in VSCode within a workspace where the malicious configuration is applied.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. `src/main.js`: The extension's `activate` function is called when VSCode starts or when the extension is activated. It loads the configuration using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('color-highlight')`.
    2. `src/color-highlight.js`: When a `.scss` or `.sass` file is opened, a `DocumentHighlight` instance is created in `findOrCreateInstance` function in `main.js` and `DocumentHighlight` constructor in `color-highlight.js`. For `.scss` and `.sass` files, the `findScssVars` strategy is added to the `strategies` array.
    3. `src/strategies/scss-vars.js`: The `findScssVars` function takes `importerOptions` as an argument, which is constructed in `DocumentHighlight` constructor using `viewConfig.sass.includePaths`. It then calls `parseImports(importerOptions)`.
    4. `src/lib/sass-importer.js`: The `parseImports` function uses the `fileImporter.parse(options, ...)` method. The `options` argument directly includes the `includePaths` from the configuration. The `file-importer` library then uses these paths to resolve `@import` statements in Sass files. If `includePaths` contains malicious paths like `/` and the `@import` statement tries to traverse up using `..`, it can escape the intended workspace directory and access arbitrary files.

    ```
    src/main.js --> DocumentHighlight (src/color-highlight.js) --> findScssVars (src/strategies/scss-vars.js) --> parseImports (src/lib/sass-importer.js) --> fileImporter.parse (file-importer library)
    Configuration 'color-highlight.sass.includePaths' --> importerOptions --> options.includePaths --> fileImporter library
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. Install the "vscode-ext-color-highlight" extension in VSCode.
    2. Create a new workspace in VSCode.
    3. Open the workspace settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings, Workspace tab).
    4. Add the following setting to your workspace settings JSON:
       ```json
       "color-highlight.sass.includePaths": ["/"]
       ```
    5. Create a new file named `poc.scss` in the root of your workspace.
    6. Add the following content to `poc.scss`:
       ```scss
       @import "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd";

       body {
           color: red; /* Dummy color to trigger highlighting */
       }
       ```
    7. Open the `poc.scss` file in VSCode.
    8. Use a system monitoring tool (like `Process Monitor` on Windows, `fs_usage` on macOS, or `strace` on Linux) to monitor file system access by the VSCode process (`code` or `code-oss`).
    9. Filter the monitoring results to observe file access events related to VSCode and look for attempts to read `/etc/passwd` or other sensitive files outside your workspace directory when `poc.scss` is opened or when you edit it.
    10. If the monitoring tool shows that VSCode process attempts to read `/etc/passwd` (or similar files outside the workspace), this confirms the directory traversal vulnerability.
