- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via Unsanitized Sass Importer Configuration

- **Description:**  
  The extension’s SCSS/SASS variable parsing (implemented in the “scss-vars” strategy) calls a third‑party Sass importer without validating user‑provided include paths. In particular, when processing a SASS/SCSS file, the function `findScssVars` (in `/code/src/strategies/scss-vars.js`) constructs an importer options object that directly uses the configuration value `viewConfig.sass.includePaths` without any sanitization. An external attacker who controls the workspace settings (for example via a malicious `.vscode/settings.json`) can supply arbitrary paths (for example, paths to system directories) so that when the importer runs (via the `parseImports` function in `/code/src/lib/sass-importer.js`), it reads files from locations outside the intended workspace.

- **Impact:**  
  An attacker may force the extension to import and disclose the contents of arbitrary files from the user’s file system. This may lead to the leakage of sensitive information (for example, system configuration or other private files) and could directly compromise user confidentiality.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The code simply falls back to local variable parsing if an error occurs during imports (see the try‑catch block in `findScssVars`), but no checks or sanitization of the supplied file paths are performed.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • There is no validation or sanitization of the `includePaths` array provided via the extension configuration.  
  • The extension should enforce a whitelist (or at least a check that the supplied paths reside within the workspace) before passing them to the Sass importer.  
  • Additional access controls should be implemented to ensure that the importer cannot read sensitive or system files.

- **Preconditions:**  
  • The extension is activated in an untrusted workspace.  
  • The attacker is able to control or influence the workspace settings (for example, by supplying a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` that sets `"color-highlight.sass.includePaths"` to one or more arbitrary directories).  
  • A SASS/SCSS file is opened, triggering the execution of the `findScssVars` function.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `/code/src/strategies/scss-vars.js`, the function `findScssVars` constructs an importer options object that includes the property  
  `includePaths: viewConfig.sass.includePaths || []`  
  without validating or constraining its values.  
  • Immediately afterward, it calls `parseImports` (defined in `/code/src/lib/sass-importer.js`), which directly passes these options into the `fileImporter.parse` call.  
  • Since no checks are performed on the content of `viewConfig.sass.includePaths`, an attacker who can set this configuration value to an arbitrary path (for example, `/etc`) may cause the importer to load files from that directory.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:** Create a test workspace that includes a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` with the following (or similar) content:
     -  
       ```json
       {
         "color-highlight": {
           "sass": {
             "includePaths": ["/etc"]
           }
         }
       }
       ```
  2. **Trigger:** Place a valid SASS/SCSS file in the workspace (even one with minimal content) and open it in VSCode.  
  3. **Observation:** Observe that when the extension attempts to parse the SASS file (via the `findScssVars` function), it passes the unsanitized include paths to the Sass importer.  
  4. **Verification:** Monitor the extension’s log output or use file‑system monitoring tools to determine whether files from `/etc` (or the other malicious path) are being read or processed by the importer.  
  5. **Expected Result:** The test should reveal that the importer is indeed attempting to read files from the attacker‑controlled path, thereby confirming the vulnerability.
