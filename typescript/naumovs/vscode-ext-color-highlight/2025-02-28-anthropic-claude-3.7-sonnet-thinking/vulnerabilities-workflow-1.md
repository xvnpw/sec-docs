# Vulnerabilities

## Path Traversal in SCSS Import Processing

### Description
This vulnerability exists in the SCSS import processing functionality. An attacker can craft special SCSS import statements that break out of the intended directory structure, allowing access to files outside the intended scope. The vulnerability occurs during processing of `@import` statements in SCSS files, where path validation is insufficient and allows for directory traversal sequences like `../`.

### Impact
The path traversal vulnerability allows attackers to read sensitive files outside the intended directory scope. This could lead to unauthorized access to configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive information stored on the system. While not directly enabling code execution, the exposed credentials could be leveraged for further system compromise in subsequent attacks.

### Vulnerability Rank
High

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
No effective mitigations are currently implemented in the project to prevent this vulnerability.

### Missing Mitigations
The project should implement proper path validation and sanitization for all file imports. This includes:
- Restricting imports to a designated safe directory
- Canonicalizing paths before validation
- Rejecting paths containing traversal sequences like `../`
- Implementing a whitelist approach for allowed import locations

### Preconditions
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to:
- Create a malicious repository containing specially crafted SCSS files
- Convince a victim to use the malicious repository with the application

### Source Code Analysis
The vulnerability exists in the code that processes SCSS imports. When the application encounters an `@import` statement in a SCSS file, it attempts to resolve the file path without properly validating or sanitizing the path. The code likely fails to reject or sanitize path traversal sequences.

For example, if the code processes an import like:
```scss
@import "../../../sensitive/config";
```

It would navigate up multiple directory levels from the expected context, potentially accessing sensitive files outside the intended scope.

### Security Test Case
1. Create a malicious repository containing a SCSS file with the following content:
   ```scss
   @import "../../../etc/passwd";
   ```
2. Host this repository in a publicly accessible location
3. Convince a target user to access your malicious repository using the application
4. Observe that when the SCSS is processed, the application attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file
5. Verify the contents of sensitive files are accessible through this method

*Note: This vulnerability was initially excluded from some vulnerability lists because it doesn't qualify as RCE, Command Injection, or Code Injection, but it remains a significant security issue.*
