# Attack Surface Analysis for remix-run/react-router

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through URL Parameters](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_url_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into URL parameters and executed in the user's browser when the application renders these parameters without proper sanitization.
    *   **How React Router Contributes:** `react-router` provides mechanisms like `useParams()` to easily access URL parameters. If these parameters are directly used in JSX without escaping, it creates an XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A route `/search/:query` where the `query` parameter is rendered as `<h1>You searched for: {params.query}</h1>`. An attacker could craft a URL like `/search/<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and escape URL parameters: Use appropriate React techniques or libraries (e.g., DOMPurify, `textContent` instead of `innerHTML`) to sanitize and escape user-provided data before rendering it.
        *   Avoid direct rendering of raw parameters: If possible, avoid directly rendering URL parameters. Instead, process and validate them on the server-side or use them indirectly.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Routing Logic Manipulation leading to Unauthorized Access](./attack_surfaces/client-side_routing_logic_manipulation_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the browser's history or use JavaScript to navigate to routes that should be protected by authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    *   **How React Router Contributes:** `react-router`'s client-side navigation using `useNavigate()` or `<Link>` components can be triggered programmatically. If authorization checks are solely implemented on the client-side, they can be bypassed.
    *   **Example:** An admin route `/admin` is only protected by a client-side check. An attacker can use `window.history.pushState('/admin', '', '/admin')` to attempt to access the route directly.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data, functionalities, or administrative areas without proper authorization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement server-side authorization:  Always perform authorization checks on the server-side before serving sensitive data or allowing access to protected functionalities. Client-side checks are for user experience, not security.
        *   Validate navigation requests on the server: If server-side rendering is used, validate the requested route against user permissions before rendering the response.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side route guards: While client-side guards can improve UX, they should not be the primary security mechanism.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Route Parameters or Data Loaders](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_route_parameters_or_data_loaders.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is unintentionally exposed through URL parameters or data fetched based on these parameters without proper access controls.
    *   **How React Router Contributes:** `react-router` facilitates the passing of data through URL parameters and the use of data loaders associated with routes. If not handled carefully, this can lead to information leaks.
    *   **Example:** A route `/user/:userId` where the `userId` is used to fetch and display user details without verifying if the current user has permission to view that specific user's information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive personal data, business secrets, or other confidential information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper authorization checks in data loaders: Ensure that data loaders only fetch and return data that the current user is authorized to access.
        *   Avoid exposing sensitive information in URL parameters:  Consider alternative methods for passing sensitive identifiers, such as using session cookies or server-side session management.
        *   Use secure coding practices for data fetching: Prevent injection vulnerabilities in data fetching logic based on route parameters.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** When using SSR, vulnerabilities can arise if route parameters are directly used in server-side logic (e.g., database queries) without proper sanitization, leading to injection attacks.
    *   **How React Router Contributes:** In SSR environments, `react-router`'s route matching and parameter extraction happen on the server. If these parameters are used unsafely in backend operations, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A route `/product/:id` where the `id` parameter is directly used in a database query like `SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = '${params.id}'`. An attacker could inject SQL code through the `id` parameter.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for SQL injection, command injection, or other server-side vulnerabilities, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate route parameters on the server-side:**  Treat all input from route parameters as untrusted and sanitize/validate it before using it in backend operations.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORM features:** Avoid string concatenation for building database queries. Use parameterized queries or ORM features that handle escaping automatically.
        *   Follow secure coding practices for server-side logic:** Apply general secure coding principles to all server-side code that interacts with route parameters.
