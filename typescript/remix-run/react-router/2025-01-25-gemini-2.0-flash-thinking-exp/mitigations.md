# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for remix-run/react-router

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Redirect Destinations using React-Router Navigation](./mitigation_strategies/validate_redirect_destinations_using_react-router_navigation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all instances where `react-router`'s `Navigate` component or the `navigate` function (obtained via `useNavigate` hook) is used to perform redirects, especially when the destination URL is derived from user input (e.g., query parameters accessed via `useSearchParams`).
    2.  Create a whitelist of allowed redirect origins or paths that are considered safe within your application's context.
    3.  Before executing a redirect with `Navigate` or `navigate`, validate the target URL against this whitelist.
    4.  If the target URL is absolute, parse its origin and compare it against the allowed origins.
    5.  If the target URL is relative, ensure it resolves to a path within your application's domain and is considered safe.
    6.  If the target URL fails validation, prevent the redirect using `react-router`'s navigation control or redirect to a safe, predefined route within your application using `Navigate` or `navigate` with a safe path.
    7.  Log any blocked redirect attempts for security monitoring.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirect (High Severity):** Attackers exploit uncontrolled redirects initiated by `react-router`'s navigation features to send users to malicious external sites.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirect (High Impact):** Significantly reduces open redirect risk by controlling redirect destinations initiated through `react-router`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Input validation for redirect URLs in the login and logout flows using `react-router`'s `useSearchParams` and `navigate` is partially implemented in the `AuthService` module.  A basic whitelist of internal paths is checked.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Validation is missing in components using `react-router` for deep linking or URL sharing where `navigate` might be called based on user-provided URLs.  Specifically, the "share link" functionality in the dashboard and invitation link handling in user management, which utilize `react-router` for navigation, lack robust redirect validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Route-Based Authorization with React-Router Route Components](./mitigation_strategies/implement_route-based_authorization_with_react-router_route_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define access control rules based on `react-router` routes. Determine which routes require authentication and specific user roles or permissions.
    2.  Create route guard components that leverage `react-router`'s `Route` component structure and conditional rendering. These guards will wrap protected `Route` components.
    3.  Within these route guards, use authentication and authorization logic (e.g., checking user session and roles) before rendering the component associated with the `Route`.
    4.  Utilize `react-router`'s component composition to wrap protected routes with these guard components.
    5.  If a user is not authorized, the route guard should use `react-router`'s `Navigate` component to redirect to a login page or display an unauthorized message within the route context.
    6.  Consider using `react-router`'s data loaders (`loader` in newer versions) within `Route` definitions to perform server-side authorization checks before route rendering, leveraging `react-router`'s data fetching capabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Users bypass intended route access controls defined by `react-router` and reach protected components.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Users with insufficient privileges access routes intended for higher privilege levels due to inadequate route-level authorization within `react-router`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Impact):** Effectively prevents unauthorized access to routes defined in `react-router` by enforcing authorization checks at the route level.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Impact):** Reduces privilege escalation risks by ensuring `react-router` routes are protected based on user roles.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Route guards using Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and `react-router`'s `Route` components are implemented for main application routes (dashboard, profile, settings) in `src/components/auth`. These use `react-router`'s component structure to protect routes based on basic authentication.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular role-based authorization within `react-router` route guards is not fully implemented. Current guards only check for authentication, not specific roles within the `react-router` route structure. Admin routes and sensitive settings routes, defined using `react-router`'s `Route` component, still need role-based checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Validate React-Router Route and Query Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_validate_react-router_route_and_query_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all `react-router` routes that utilize route parameters (accessed via `useParams` hook) and query parameters (accessed via `useSearchParams` hook).
    2.  For each parameter obtained through `useParams` and `useSearchParams`, define expected data types, formats, and validation rules.
    3.  Immediately upon accessing parameters using `useParams` or `useSearchParams` within route components, sanitize and validate these inputs.
    4.  Sanitization should involve escaping or removing potentially harmful characters before using parameters in rendering or logic within `react-router` components.
    5.  Validation should ensure parameters conform to expected types and formats before being used in application logic triggered by `react-router` navigation.
    6.  Use type coercion functions to convert parameters obtained from `useParams` and `useSearchParams` to expected data types.
    7.  Implement error handling within route components for invalid parameters obtained via `useParams` or `useSearchParams`. Display error messages or redirect using `react-router`'s `Navigate` component to error routes if validation fails.
    8.  Avoid directly using unsanitized and unvalidated parameters obtained from `react-router` in backend requests or rendering logic within route components.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via URL Parameters (Medium to High Severity):** Malicious scripts injected through URL parameters accessed by `react-router`'s hooks are executed in the user's browser due to lack of sanitization in route components.
    *   **SQL Injection (If parameters are used in backend queries - High Severity):** Unsanitized parameters from `react-router`'s hooks passed to backend queries can lead to SQL injection.
    *   **Parameter Tampering (Medium Severity):** Manipulation of route or query parameters accessed via `react-router`'s hooks leads to unintended application behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via URL Parameters (Medium to High Impact):** Significantly reduces XSS risk by sanitizing URL parameters accessed through `react-router` hooks within route components.
    *   **SQL Injection (If parameters are used in backend queries - High Impact):** Reduces SQL injection risk by validating parameters from `react-router` before backend use.
    *   **Parameter Tampering (Medium Impact):** Reduces parameter tampering impact by validating parameters obtained via `react-router` hooks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic sanitization (HTML entity escaping) is implemented for user names and titles derived from route parameters accessed via `useParams` in profile pages (`/profile/:username`). Partial input validation exists for numeric IDs in product detail pages (`/products/:productId`) using `useParams`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive validation and sanitization are missing for query parameters accessed via `useSearchParams` across the application, especially in search and filtering functionalities within components rendered by `react-router`. Search queries in product listing and filter parameters in user management, both using `react-router` for navigation and parameter access, lack thorough validation. More robust validation (e.g., schema validation) is needed for all route parameters accessed via `useParams`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Handle React-Router Dynamic and Wildcard Routes](./mitigation_strategies/securely_handle_react-router_dynamic_and_wildcard_routes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Design your `react-router` route structure to minimize overly broad wildcard routes (`/*` or `/:param*`).
    2.  When using wildcard routes in `react-router`, carefully scope them to prevent unintended route matching.
    3.  In components rendered by dynamic `react-router` routes (`/:param`), rigorously validate the dynamic segment (`param`) value obtained via `useParams`.
    4.  Prevent path traversal attacks by validating dynamic segments obtained via `useParams` for sequences like `../` or `..%2F` within `react-router` route components.
    5.  If dynamic segments in `react-router` routes are used to load resources, implement access control checks to ensure authorized resource access within route components.
    6.  Avoid directly constructing file paths or URLs using dynamic segments obtained from `react-router` without validation and sanitization in route components.
    7.  For wildcard routes in `react-router`, carefully process captured path segments to prevent unexpected behavior or security issues within route components.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium to High Severity):** Unvalidated dynamic segments in `react-router` routes allow attackers to access files outside intended directories.
    *   **Unauthorized Resource Access (Medium Severity):** Dynamic segments in `react-router` routes used for resource identification, without access control, allow unauthorized resource access.
    *   **Routing Misconfiguration (Low to Medium Severity):** Overly broad wildcard routes in `react-router` lead to unexpected routing behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium to High Impact):** Reduces path traversal risk by validating dynamic segments in `react-router` routes.
    *   **Unauthorized Resource Access (Medium Impact):** Reduces unauthorized resource access by enforcing checks based on validated dynamic segments in `react-router` routes.
    *   **Routing Misconfiguration (Low to Medium Impact):** Improves route structure and reduces misconfigurations in `react-router` routing.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Wildcard routes in `react-router` are used for 404 pages (`/*`) and a blog feature (`/blog/*`). Basic validation prevents rendering components if the dynamic segment in the blog route is empty.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Path traversal validation is missing for dynamic segments in the blog route and other routes using dynamic segments to load resources within `react-router`. No checks prevent `../` sequences in blog post paths defined in `react-router`. Access control based on dynamic segments is not implemented for the blog feature within `react-router`, making all blog posts publicly accessible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update React-Router Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_react-router_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for regularly checking for updates specifically to the `react-router` library.
    2.  Monitor security advisories and release notes specifically for `react-router`.
    3.  Use dependency management tools to update `react-router` versions.
    4.  Test application functionality, especially routing logic defined by `react-router`, after updating the library.
    5.  Prioritize updating to `react-router` versions that include security patches.
    6.  Consider automated dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities specifically in `react-router`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known React-Router Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated `react-router` versions may contain known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known React-Router Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces risk of exploiting known `react-router` vulnerabilities by using updated, patched versions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Manual checks for updates, including `react-router`, are performed every few months using `npm outdated`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated dependency vulnerability scanning specifically for `react-router` is not implemented. No automated alerts for new `react-router` security advisories exist. The update process for `react-router` is not consistently followed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Test React-Router Routing Logic and Security](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_test_react-router_routing_logic_and_security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Integrate security testing into `react-router` routing logic testing.
    2.  Write unit and integration tests specifically for route guards and authorization checks implemented using `react-router` components.
    3.  Test input validation and sanitization for route and query parameters accessed via `react-router` hooks.
    4.  Test redirect handling initiated by `react-router`'s navigation features, especially those influenced by user input.
    5.  Perform penetration testing or security audits focusing on application routing paths defined by `react-router`.
    6.  Use security testing tools to scan for routing-related vulnerabilities in `react-router` configurations and usage.
    7.  Include `react-router` routing security test cases in CI/CD pipelines for continuous security testing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All React-Router Routing-Related Vulnerabilities (Severity Varies):** Testing helps identify and fix vulnerabilities related to `react-router` usage, including open redirects, authorization bypasses, XSS, path traversal, and routing misconfigurations within the `react-router` context.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All React-Router Routing-Related Vulnerabilities (Impact Varies):** Reduces overall risk of `react-router` routing vulnerabilities through proactive testing.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic unit tests exist for some route components to ensure rendering. Integration tests for `react-router` routing logic are limited and lack security focus.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Security-focused `react-router` routing tests are largely missing. No specific tests for route guards, authorization checks, parameter validation, or redirect handling from a security perspective within `react-router` context. Penetration testing or security audits focusing on `react-router` routing have not been conducted. Automated security scanning tools are not used for `react-router` routing vulnerabilities.
