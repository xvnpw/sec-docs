## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Redirect Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_redirect_manipulation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Malicious Redirect Injection
    * **Description:** Attacker manipulates the URL to inject a malicious redirect target into client-side redirect logic. This is especially critical if the redirect URL is dynamically constructed based on user input or URL parameters.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. Identify routes using client-side redirects (e.g., `Navigate` component).
        2. Manipulate the URL to trigger the redirect logic.
        3. Inject a malicious URL (external or internal malicious route) into the redirect target.
        4. User is redirected to the malicious site or route, potentially leading to phishing, malware distribution, or further exploitation within the application.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Avoid client-side redirects based on untrusted input. If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize redirect URLs.
    * **Mitigations:**
        * Prefer server-side redirects where possible.
        * Implement strict validation of redirect URLs against a whitelist of allowed domains/paths.
        * Avoid constructing redirect URLs dynamically from user input. If unavoidable, use robust sanitization and encoding techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side State Manipulation via URL](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_state_manipulation_via_url.md)

**Attack Vector:** Authorization Bypass via URL State Manipulation
    * **Description:** Attacker manipulates URL parameters or hash to alter client-side application state, potentially bypassing authorization checks or accessing unintended functionality if server-side validation is insufficient.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. Analyze the application to identify client-side state management via URL parameters or hash.
        2. Identify vulnerable state parameters that control access or permissions (e.g., user IDs, roles, filters).
        3. Manipulate URL parameters to modify these state values.
        4. Attempt to bypass authorization checks or access unintended functionality based on the manipulated state, exploiting weak or missing server-side validation.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Never rely solely on client-side URL state for security decisions. Always validate and authorize actions server-side.
    * **Mitigations:**
        * Implement robust server-side validation and authorization for all sensitive actions and data access.
        * Use secure session management and server-side session data to manage user authentication and authorization.
        * Avoid storing sensitive data directly in URLs. If necessary, encrypt or encode sensitive data and validate it server-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Loaders](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_loaders.md)

**Attack Vector:** SSRF through Loader URL Manipulation
    * **Description:** Attacker exploits loaders (React Router v6.4+) to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) by manipulating route parameters or application state to control the URLs loaders request.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. Identify loaders that make requests to backend services or external APIs.
        2. Analyze loader logic to understand how request URLs are constructed and parameters are handled.
        3. Manipulate route parameters or application state that influence the loader's request URL.
        4. Force the loader to make requests to internal resources (e.g., internal network services, metadata endpoints) or malicious external sites, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or internal systems.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Carefully control loader request destinations. Validate and sanitize inputs used in loader requests.
    * **Mitigations:**
        * Implement strict input validation in loaders to sanitize and validate any user-controlled input used in URL construction.
        * Use an allowlist of allowed domains or URLs for loader requests.
        * Employ secure API clients and libraries to prevent URL manipulation vulnerabilities.
        * Avoid directly constructing URLs from user input within loaders. Use URL parsing and construction libraries securely.

**Attack Vector:** Backend Data Injection (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.)
    * **Description:** Attacker injects malicious data into inputs processed by loaders or actions (React Router v6.4+), exploiting vulnerabilities in backend systems or application logic.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. Identify loaders or actions that process user-controlled input (via URL parameters, form data, etc.).
        2. Analyze loader/action logic for input handling and data processing on the server-side.
        3. Inject malicious data (e.g., SQL injection payloads, command injection sequences, XSS payloads if backend renders output) into these inputs.
        4. Exploit vulnerabilities in backend systems (databases, operating system commands, etc.) or application logic via the injected data, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or code execution.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Sanitize and validate all inputs processed by loaders and actions on the server-side. Follow secure coding practices for backend logic.
    * **Mitigations:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side for all data processed by loaders and actions.
        * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        * Avoid executing system commands directly from user input. If necessary, use secure libraries and sanitize inputs rigorously.
        * Apply output encoding to prevent XSS if backend logic renders user-controlled data.
        * Use secure frameworks and libraries for backend development that provide built-in security features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource-Intensive Loaders/Actions](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource-intensive_loadersactions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Server-Side Resource Exhaustion via Loaders/Actions
    * **Description:** Attacker crafts URLs or triggers actions that repeatedly invoke resource-intensive loaders or actions, exhausting server-side resources and causing a Denial of Service.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. Identify loaders or actions that perform resource-intensive operations (e.g., complex database queries, heavy computations, slow external API calls).
        2. Craft URLs or trigger actions that invoke these resource-intensive loaders/actions repeatedly.
        3. Exhaust server-side resources (CPU, memory, database connections) or cause application slowdown, leading to a Denial of Service.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Optimize loader and action performance. Implement rate limiting and resource management on the server-side.
    * **Mitigations:**
        * Optimize database queries and backend logic within loaders and actions for performance.
        * Implement caching mechanisms to reduce redundant computations and data fetching.
        * Use asynchronous operations and non-blocking I/O to handle requests efficiently.
        * Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given time frame.
        * Monitor server resources and implement auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reflected XSS via Route Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/reflected_xss_via_route_parameters.md)

**Attack Vector:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in Route Parameters
    * **Description:** Attacker crafts a URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in a route parameter. If the application displays this parameter in the UI without proper encoding, the payload is executed in the user's browser.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. Identify routes that display route parameters in the UI.
        2. Determine if these parameters are displayed without proper output encoding.
        3. Craft a URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in a route parameter.
        4. When a user visits this crafted URL, the payload is executed in their browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Always encode route parameters when displaying them in the UI.
    * **Mitigations:**
        * Implement output encoding for all route parameters displayed in the UI. React's JSX automatically escapes by default, but ensure this behavior is maintained and explicit encoding is used when necessary.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stored XSS via Data Loaded by Loaders/Actions](./attack_tree_paths/stored_xss_via_data_loaded_by_loadersactions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting in Data from Loaders/Actions
    * **Description:** Attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into data stored in the backend. If loaders or actions fetch this data and display it in the UI without proper encoding, the payload is executed in the user's browser whenever the route is rendered.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. Identify loaders/actions that fetch data from the backend and display it in the UI.
        2. Inject a malicious JavaScript payload into data stored in the backend (this might require exploiting other vulnerabilities or compromising backend accounts).
        3. When a user visits a route that uses a loader/action to fetch and display this malicious data, the payload is executed in their browser.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Sanitize data retrieved from the backend before storing it. Encode data when displaying it in the UI.
    * **Mitigations:**
        * Implement input sanitization on the backend to prevent malicious data from being stored.
        * Implement output encoding for all data retrieved from the backend and displayed in the UI.
        * Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Data Injection during SSR](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_data_injection_during_ssr.md)

**Attack Vector:** Server-Side XSS via SSR Data Injection
    * **Description:** Attacker injects malicious data during the Server-Side Rendering (SSR) process. If this data is not properly sanitized and encoded during SSR, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities when the rendered HTML is sent to the client.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. Identify the SSR process where data is injected into the initial HTML or React components.
        2. Analyze the SSR data injection logic for vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized data handling or template injection flaws.
        3. Inject malicious data that gets rendered server-side and then executed client-side as JavaScript when the browser parses the HTML.
        4. Achieve XSS or other server-side injection vulnerabilities, potentially compromising user accounts or the server itself.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Sanitize all data injected during SSR. Treat SSR rendering as a potentially untrusted environment.
    * **Mitigations:**
        * Implement output encoding during SSR to sanitize all data before it is injected into the rendered HTML.
        * Use secure templating practices and avoid using template engines in a way that could lead to injection vulnerabilities.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks, even if they originate from SSR.

    * **Description:** Attacker crafts URLs that trigger resource-intensive route handling logic during Server-Side Rendering (SSR), leading to server-side resource exhaustion and Denial of Service.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. Identify SSR route handling logic that is resource-intensive (e.g., complex data fetching, heavy computations during SSR).
        2. Craft URLs that trigger this resource-intensive SSR route handling.
        3. Send numerous requests with these crafted URLs to exhaust server-side resources (CPU, memory) during SSR, causing application downtime.
    * **Actionable Insight:** Optimize SSR rendering performance. Implement caching and resource management for SSR.
    * **Mitigations:**
        * Optimize SSR rendering performance by improving data fetching efficiency and reducing computational overhead.
        * Implement SSR caching to avoid redundant rendering of the same routes.
        * Set resource limits for SSR processes to prevent them from consuming excessive server resources.
        * Implement load balancing to distribute SSR requests across multiple servers.
