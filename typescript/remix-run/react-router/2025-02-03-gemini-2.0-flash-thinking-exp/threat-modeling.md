# Threat Model Analysis for remix-run/react-router

## Threat: [Client-Side Route Guard Bypass](./threats/client-side_route_guard_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can leverage browser developer tools or manipulate browser history APIs to circumvent client-side route guards implemented within `react-router` components (like `<Route>`'s `element` or custom wrapper components). By directly navigating to routes or manipulating the routing state, they can bypass client-side authorization checks and access protected components or functionalities without proper authentication or authorization. This exploits the client-side nature of `react-router`'s routing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application features, data, or administrative functionalities. Potential data breaches, privilege escalation, and compromise of application integrity due to bypassed client-side access controls.
    *   **React Router Component Affected:** `<Route>`, custom route guarding components, `useNavigate`, `useHistory` (browser history API manipulation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Server-Side Authorization:**  Never rely solely on client-side route guards for security. Implement **mandatory server-side authorization checks** for all sensitive operations and data access. Client-side routing should only enhance user experience, not enforce security.
        *   **Secure Backend APIs:** Secure backend APIs with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Ensure that access is controlled at the server level, regardless of client-side routing decisions.  APIs should validate user permissions before serving data or performing actions.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on client-side routing and authorization bypass vulnerabilities. Verify that server-side authorization is consistently enforced and cannot be bypassed through client-side manipulations.

## Threat: [Client-Side Injection through Route Parameters (XSS)](./threats/client-side_injection_through_route_parameters__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** If route parameters obtained using `react-router`'s `useParams` hook are directly rendered in the user interface without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL. When a user visits this crafted URL, the unsanitized route parameter will be rendered, leading to the execution of the attacker's JavaScript code within the user's browser. This is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability directly arising from how `react-router` exposes route parameters and how they are handled in components.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, enabling session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, website defacement, and other client-side attacks. Attackers can gain control over the user's session and potentially perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **React Router Component Affected:** `useParams`, components rendering route parameters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  **Always sanitize and escape user-provided data**, including route parameters obtained from `useParams`, before rendering them in the DOM. Treat route parameters as untrusted user input.
        *   **Leverage React's JSX Escaping:** React's JSX automatically escapes values rendered within curly braces `{}` which helps prevent basic XSS. Ensure you are rendering route parameters within JSX and not bypassing this escaping mechanism (e.g., avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized route parameters).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of XSS attacks. CSP can restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, limiting the damage an attacker can do even if XSS is exploited.
        *   **DOMPurify or similar libraries:** For more complex scenarios or when dealing with potentially rich text in route parameters (which is generally discouraged), use libraries like DOMPurify to robustly sanitize HTML content before rendering.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Route Parameters in Data Fetching](./threats/data_injection_through_route_parameters_in_data_fetching.md)

*   **Description:** If route parameters obtained from `react-router`'s `useParams` are directly incorporated into backend data fetching requests (e.g., database queries, API calls) without proper validation and sanitization, attackers can manipulate these route parameters to inject malicious payloads. This can lead to data injection vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, NoSQL injection, or command injection. Attackers exploit the direct use of `react-router` parameters in backend interactions to compromise data integrity or system security.
    *   **Impact:** Data injection vulnerabilities, potentially leading to critical consequences including data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or denial of service attacks against backend systems.
    *   **React Router Component Affected:** `useParams`, data fetching logic within components that utilize route parameters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Server-Side Input Validation and Sanitization:** **Always validate and sanitize route parameters on the server-side** before using them in data fetching requests. Treat all route parameters as untrusted input that must be validated and sanitized on the backend.
        *   **Utilize Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** When interacting with databases, **exclusively use parameterized queries or prepared statements**. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks by separating SQL code from user-provided data.
        *   **Secure API Calls:** When making API calls, properly encode and validate route parameters to prevent injection attacks in API requests. Use secure API client libraries that handle parameter encoding correctly.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database and API access with the principle of least privilege. Limit the permissions of database users and API keys to minimize the potential damage from successful injection attacks. Regularly review and restrict access rights.
        *   **Input Validation Libraries:** Employ robust server-side input validation libraries to enforce data type, format, and range constraints on route parameters before using them in backend operations.
