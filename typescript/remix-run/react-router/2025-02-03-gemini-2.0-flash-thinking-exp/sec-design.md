# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a declarative routing library for React applications.
  - Simplify navigation and URL management in React applications.
  - Enable developers to build complex user interfaces with clear and maintainable routing logic.
  - Foster a large and active community around the library for continuous improvement and support.
  - Ensure compatibility with various React environments and browser versions.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in `react-router` could be exploited in applications that depend on it, leading to potential data breaches or application unavailability.
  - Poor performance or bugs in `react-router` could negatively impact the user experience of applications using it.
  - Lack of maintenance or timely updates could lead to the library becoming outdated and insecure.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting `react-router` or its dependencies could introduce malicious code into applications using it.
  - Changes in React or browser standards could break compatibility and require significant rework.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Development - The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing for public code review and community contributions, increasing the likelihood of identifying and addressing security issues. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Dependency Management - The project uses `npm` for dependency management, which includes mechanisms for verifying package integrity and provenance. Implemented in: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, npm registry.
  - security control: Version Control - Git is used for version control, providing a history of changes and enabling rollback in case of issues. Implemented in: Git repository.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Contributions - While open source allows for community review, the project's security posture relies on the vigilance and expertise of community members to identify and report vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - The project depends on third-party libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities that could indirectly affect `react-router`.
  - accepted risk: Time to Patch -  The time it takes to identify, patch, and release fixes for security vulnerabilities depends on the project maintainers and contributors.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dependency Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
  - security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses in the library's design and implementation.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
  - security control: Security Champions - Designate security champions within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to `react-router` itself, as it is a client-side routing library. Authentication is typically handled by the application using `react-router`.
  - Authorization: `react-router` plays a role in client-side authorization by controlling access to different routes based on application logic. Applications using `react-router` should implement authorization checks within route components or higher-order components.
  - Input Validation: `react-router` processes URL paths and parameters. Input validation is important to prevent issues like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if route parameters are dynamically rendered into the DOM without proper sanitization in the application using `react-router`. Applications should ensure proper encoding and sanitization of route parameters.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for `react-router` itself. However, applications using `react-router` will likely use cryptography for secure communication (HTTPS) and potentially for client-side data encryption, which is outside the scope of `react-router`.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Ensuring the availability and integrity of the `react-router` library for developers to build and maintain React applications.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trust in `react-router` as a reliable and secure routing solution.
  - Preventing vulnerabilities in `react-router` from being exploited in downstream applications.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The `react-router` library itself does not directly handle sensitive data. However, vulnerabilities in the library could indirectly lead to the exposure of sensitive data in applications that use it. The sensitivity of data depends on the applications built using `react-router`, which can range from publicly accessible information to highly confidential user data. The primary concern is the potential impact on applications using `react-router` if a vulnerability is exploited.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in `react-router`? Is there a dedicated security team or contact?
  - Are there any specific security testing practices currently in place for `react-router` beyond community contributions and standard open-source development practices?
  - What is the policy regarding dependency updates and vulnerability patching for third-party libraries used by `react-router`?
  - Are there any known past security vulnerabilities in `react-router`, and if so, what lessons were learned and what improvements were implemented?
  - Are there specific guidelines or recommendations for developers using `react-router` to ensure secure routing practices in their applications?
- Assumptions:
  - `react-router` is primarily used in web browser environments and server-side rendering environments for web applications.
  - The main security concerns are related to potential vulnerabilities within the `react-router` library code and its dependencies, which could be exploited by malicious actors targeting applications using the library.
  - Security responsibility is shared between the `react-router` maintainers (for the library itself) and the developers using `react-router` (for the security of their applications).
  - The project benefits from the security review and contributions of the open-source community.
  - The npm registry and CDN are considered generally secure platforms for distributing JavaScript packages and static assets.
