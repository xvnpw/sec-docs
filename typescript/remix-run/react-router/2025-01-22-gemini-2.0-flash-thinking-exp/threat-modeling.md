# Threat Model Analysis for remix-run/react-router

## Threat: [Insecure Route Configuration - Unauthorized Access](./threats/insecure_route_configuration_-_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker attempts to access routes intended for higher privilege users (e.g., admin panels, sensitive data views) due to misconfigured `react-router` routes. This can be achieved by directly navigating to the route URL, even if client-side route guards are in place. The attacker might exploit flaws in route path definitions or lack of server-side authorization checks.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, functionalities, or administrative controls. Potential data breach, data manipulation, or system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `Route`, `Routes`, `BrowserRouter`, `createBrowserRouter` (Route configuration and definition)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust server-side authorization for all sensitive routes and resources.
    *   Carefully review and test all route configurations to ensure they align with access control policies.
    *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) enforced on both client and server.
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side route guards for security; treat them as UX enhancements.

## Threat: [URL Parameter Manipulation - Path Traversal](./threats/url_parameter_manipulation_-_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker manipulates URL parameters (e.g., `:id`, `/:path`) to inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..%2F`) to access files or directories outside the intended scope on the server. This is possible if URL parameters are not properly validated and sanitized before being used to construct file paths on the server.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure, code execution, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `useParams`, `Route` path definitions (URL parameter handling)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all URL parameters on the server-side.
    *   Avoid directly using URL parameters to construct file paths.
    *   Use secure file handling practices and restrict access to sensitive file system areas.
    *   Employ path canonicalization techniques to prevent path traversal attacks.

## Threat: [URL Parameter Manipulation - Server-Side Injection](./threats/url_parameter_manipulation_-_server-side_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious code or commands into URL parameters. If these parameters are used in backend queries (e.g., SQL, NoSQL) or commands without proper sanitization, it can lead to server-side injection vulnerabilities. For example, injecting SQL code into a parameter used in a database query within a `loader` or `action`.
*   **Impact:** Server-side code execution, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, or complete system compromise depending on the injection type and backend system.
*   **Affected Component:** `useParams`, `loader`, `action` (Data retrieval and action functions using URL parameters)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all URL parameters on the server-side.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions within `loader` and `action` functions.
    *   Avoid constructing dynamic queries or commands using unsanitized URL parameters.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database and system access.

## Threat: [URL Parameter Manipulation - Client-Side XSS](./threats/url_parameter_manipulation_-_client-side_xss.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious scripts into URL parameters. If these parameters are rendered directly into the DOM without proper escaping, the injected scripts can execute in the user's browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This is relevant when components using `useParams` render these parameters directly.
*   **Impact:** Client-side code execution, session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `useParams`, components rendering URL parameters (Data rendering in components)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Properly escape and sanitize URL parameters before rendering them in the client-side application.
    *   Use templating engines or libraries that automatically escape output by default.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   Educate developers about XSS prevention techniques.

## Threat: [Data Loader Vulnerabilities - Injection in Data Fetching](./threats/data_loader_vulnerabilities_-_injection_in_data_fetching.md)

*   **Description:** `loader` functions might use URL parameters or other inputs without proper sanitization when interacting with backend systems. This can make them vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection) if these inputs are used to construct backend queries within the `loader` to fetch data.
*   **Impact:** Server-side code execution, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, or complete system compromise depending on the injection type and backend system.
*   **Affected Component:** `loader` (Data fetching function)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all inputs used within `loader` functions, especially URL parameters and request bodies.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases in loaders.
    *   Avoid constructing dynamic queries or commands using unsanitized inputs in loaders.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database and system access within loaders.
