# Threat Model Analysis for remix-run/react-router

## Threat: [URL Parameter Manipulation for Unauthorized Data Access](./threats/url_parameter_manipulation_for_unauthorized_data_access.md)

*   **Threat:** URL Parameter Manipulation for Unauthorized Data Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies URL parameters (e.g., `/user/123` changed to `/user/456`) within a route handled by `react-router` to attempt to access data or resources they are not authorized to view. The attacker directly edits the URL in the browser's address bar or crafts a malicious link, exploiting how `react-router` processes these parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data, bypassing intended access controls.  Could lead to data breaches or privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `useParams` hook, `loader` function (if it uses `params` from `react-router` without proper validation), `Route` component (if the route definition itself is too permissive and handled by `react-router`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if sensitive data is exposed).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Authorization:** Implement robust authorization checks *within the `loader` function* (and on the server, called by the `loader`) to verify that the currently authenticated user has permission to access the resource identified by the URL parameters *as processed by `react-router`*. Do *not* rely solely on client-side checks.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the format and range of URL parameters within the `loader` function *before* using them to fetch data. Use a schema validation library (e.g., Zod) for robust validation, specifically checking the output of `useParams`.
        *   **Opaque Identifiers:** Consider using opaque identifiers (e.g., UUIDs) instead of sequential IDs for resources, making it harder for attackers to guess valid parameter values passed to `react-router`.

## Threat: [Forced Navigation to Unauthorized Routes (Bypassing Client-Side Checks)](./threats/forced_navigation_to_unauthorized_routes__bypassing_client-side_checks_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Forced Navigation to Unauthorized Routes (Bypassing Client-Side Checks)

    *   **Description:** An attacker directly navigates to a protected route (e.g., `/admin`) managed by `react-router` by typing the URL in the browser, even though they are not logged in or lack the necessary permissions. This bypasses any *client-side* checks that `react-router` might be configured to perform.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative interfaces or other protected areas of the application, potentially leading to data modification, deletion, or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Routes` and `Route` configuration within `react-router`, `loader` function (if authorization checks are missing or insufficient, specifically within the context of `react-router`'s routing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if it allows access to administrative functions).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Authentication and Authorization:** Implement authentication and authorization checks *within the `loader` function* (and on the server called by the `loader`) for *every* protected route managed by `react-router`. The server must verify the user's credentials and permissions *before* returning any data or rendering the route, even if `react-router` attempts to load it.
        *   **Route Guards (as a *supplementary* measure):** While server-side checks are paramount, route guards within `react-router` (using custom components or hooks) can provide an *additional* layer of client-side protection. These should redirect to a login/error page if unauthorized, but *never* be the sole defense.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via URL State (Directly in `react-router` Managed URLs)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_url_state__directly_in__react-router__managed_urls_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Information Disclosure via URL State (Directly in `react-router` Managed URLs)

    *   **Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., user IDs, session tokens, internal IDs) is included directly in the URL managed by `react-router`. This information can be exposed through browser history, server logs, or by being shared inadvertently. This is a direct threat because `react-router` is responsible for handling and displaying these URLs.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise or other security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** `useParams`, `useSearchParams`, `Link` (if used to construct URLs with sensitive data within `react-router`), `useNavigate` (if used to pass sensitive data in the URL managed by `react-router`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in URLs:** Never include sensitive information directly in the URL that `react-router` handles. Use POST requests (via `react-router`'s `action` functions and `<Form>`) for submitting sensitive data.
        *   **Use `state`:** Use the `state` option in `react-router`'s `useNavigate` or `<Link>` to pass non-sensitive data between routes that should *not* be visible in the URL. This is `react-router`'s mechanism for avoiding URL exposure.
        *   **Server-Side Session Management:** Use server-side session management to store sensitive data, and only include a session ID (which should be a randomly generated, opaque value) in the URL, if absolutely necessary (and even then, avoid it if possible).

## Threat: [Route Hijacking via Misconfigured Wildcard Routes (within `react-router`)](./threats/route_hijacking_via_misconfigured_wildcard_routes__within__react-router__.md)

* **Threat:** Route Hijacking via Misconfigured Wildcard Routes (within `react-router`)

    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a URL that matches an overly broad wildcard route (e.g., `<Route path="*" element={<MyComponent />} />`) *defined within `react-router`*, causing their malicious component or unintended logic to be executed instead of the intended route. This is a direct threat because it exploits `react-router`'s route matching mechanism.
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code, redirection to malicious sites, or display of unintended content, all controlled through `react-router`'s routing.
    * **Affected Component:** `Routes` and `Route` configuration, specifically the use of wildcard (`*`) paths *within `react-router`*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Precise Route Definitions:** Define routes as precisely as possible within your `react-router` configuration. Avoid using wildcard routes unless absolutely necessary, and if you do, place them at the *end* of your `react-router` route configuration to ensure that more specific routes are matched first.
        * **Route Ordering:** Carefully order your routes within `react-router`, placing more specific routes before less specific ones. `react-router` matches routes in the order they are defined.
        * **Input Validation (for dynamic segments):** If you use dynamic segments in your `react-router` routes (e.g., `<Route path="/users/:userId" ... />`), validate the values of those segments within your `loader` function to ensure they conform to expected patterns, preventing unexpected matches.
