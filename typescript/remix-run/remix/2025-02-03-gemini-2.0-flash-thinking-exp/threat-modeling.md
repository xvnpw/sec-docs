# Threat Model Analysis for remix-run/remix

## Threat: [Server-Side Code Execution in Loaders/Actions](./threats/server-side_code_execution_in_loadersactions.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server if Remix loaders or actions are vulnerable to injection flaws (e.g., command injection, template injection). This can be achieved by injecting malicious input through form data, URL parameters, or headers that are processed by loaders or actions without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data breach, denial of service, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Remix Component:** Loaders, Actions, Server-Side Request Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in all loaders and actions.
    *   Avoid dynamic code execution functions like `eval()` on the server.
    *   Follow secure coding practices for server-side JavaScript.
    *   Regularly audit loaders and actions for injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORM/ODM to prevent SQL injection if database interaction is involved.

## Threat: [Insecure Server-Side Data Fetching (SSRF/IDOR) in Loaders](./threats/insecure_server-side_data_fetching__ssrfidor__in_loaders.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker could perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or access unauthorized data via Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) if Remix loaders use user-controlled input to construct data fetching requests without proper validation and authorization. For SSRF, attacker could make the server access internal resources or external services. For IDOR, attacker could access data belonging to other users by manipulating object identifiers in requests.
*   **Impact:** SSRF can lead to internal network access, data exfiltration, and denial of service. IDOR leads to unauthorized data access and privacy violations.
*   **Affected Remix Component:** Loaders, Data Fetching Logic
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate and sanitize user input used in loaders for constructing URLs or database queries.
    *   Implement authorization checks within loaders to control data access.
    *   Use allowlists for allowed domains and protocols for external API calls in loaders to prevent SSRF.
    *   Avoid directly exposing internal database IDs or object references in URLs.
    *   Implement proper access control mechanisms and authorization checks before fetching data.

## Threat: [CSRF Vulnerabilities in Remix Forms](./threats/csrf_vulnerabilities_in_remix_forms.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker could perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks if CSRF protection is not implemented for Remix forms that perform state-changing operations. An attacker can trick a user's browser into making unauthorized requests to the application while the user is authenticated.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized state changes, data manipulation, actions performed on behalf of the user without their consent.
*   **Affected Remix Component:** Forms, Actions, Server-Side Request Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement CSRF protection for all state-changing Remix forms (POST, PUT, DELETE).
    *   Utilize Remix's recommended patterns for CSRF token generation and validation.
    *   Ensure CSRF tokens are properly synchronized between server and client.
    *   Test CSRF protection thoroughly.
    *   Use `POST` method for state-changing operations as recommended by Remix.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Route-Based Logic Errors](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_route-based_logic_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker could bypass authorization checks and access restricted routes or resources if authorization logic in Remix loaders and actions is incorrectly implemented, especially in nested routes. Developers might make assumptions about authorization inheritance in nested routes that are not valid.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, potential for further attacks.
*   **Affected Remix Component:** Route Modules, Loaders, Actions, Authorization Logic, Nested Routing
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement explicit authorization checks in loaders and actions for each route, including nested routes.
    *   Clearly define authorization policies for each route and resource.
    *   Use a consistent authorization mechanism throughout the application.
    *   Thoroughly test authorization logic for all routes, especially nested routes and different user roles.
    *   Consider using a centralized authorization middleware or service.
