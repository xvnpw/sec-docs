# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify and enhance the development of modern web applications.
  - Improve web application performance and user experience through server-side rendering and progressive enhancement.
  - Provide a robust and flexible framework for building full-stack web applications.
  - Foster a strong developer community and ecosystem around the framework.
- Business Risks:
  - Adoption risk: Developers may prefer other established frameworks or find Remix too complex.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could damage reputation and user trust.
  - Performance issues or scalability limitations could hinder adoption for large-scale applications.
  - Dependency on open-source community for maintenance and feature development.
  - Competition from other web frameworks and evolving web technologies.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open-source project with community review (location: GitHub repository - public visibility and contributions).
  - security control: Dependency management using npm/yarn (location: package.json, yarn.lock/package-lock.json).
  - security control: Standard web security practices applicable to any web application framework are expected to be followed by developers using Remix.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Security of applications built with Remix is ultimately the responsibility of the developers using the framework.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Remix.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the Remix development and release pipeline.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Remix framework.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process for Remix.
  - security control: Provide security guidance and best practices documentation for developers using Remix.
  - security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning and automated updates for Remix dependencies.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Remix itself does not enforce specific authentication mechanisms, but applications built with Remix will require authentication to protect resources and user data. Developers need to implement authentication within their Remix applications.
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is application-specific. Remix applications will need robust authorization mechanisms to control access to different parts of the application and data.
  - Input Validation: Remix applications must implement thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection). This should be applied to all user inputs, both on the client and server side.
  - Cryptography: Remix applications will likely need to use cryptography for securing sensitive data in transit and at rest. This includes HTTPS for communication and encryption for storing sensitive information. Remix should encourage and facilitate the use of secure cryptographic practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and maintenance of the Remix framework itself.
  - Building and deployment of web applications by developers using Remix.
  - End-user access and interaction with web applications built with Remix.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Remix framework code: High sensitivity - compromise could lead to widespread vulnerabilities in applications built with Remix.
  - Developer code using Remix: Sensitivity depends on the application, can range from low to high depending on the data handled.
  - User data in applications built with Remix: Sensitivity depends on the application, can range from low to high (PII, financial data, etc.).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific security testing practices currently employed by the Remix core team?
  - Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure process in place for Remix?
  - What kind of security guidance and documentation is provided to developers using Remix?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements that Remix aims to meet (e.g., OWASP ASVS)?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to promote the adoption and usage of the Remix framework by web developers.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is considered important, but as an open-source project, resources for dedicated security efforts might be limited. Security relies heavily on community contributions and standard open-source security practices.
  - DESIGN: Remix follows modern web development best practices and is designed to be deployed in various cloud environments. The build process is automated and leverages standard JavaScript ecosystem tools.
