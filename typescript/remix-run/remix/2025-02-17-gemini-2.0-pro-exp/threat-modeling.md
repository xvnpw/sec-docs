# Threat Model Analysis for remix-run/remix

## Threat: [Client-Side Loader Data Spoofing](./threats/client-side_loader_data_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the data returned by a Remix `loader` *after* it leaves the server but *before* it's used by the component. They modify the data in the browser's memory using developer tools or a browser extension, bypassing server-side validation *for that specific request*. They might change a price, a user ID, or other critical data.
*   **Impact:** The application renders incorrect or malicious data, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, incorrect calculations, or display of sensitive information intended for other users. The user may be presented with false information, leading to incorrect decisions.
*   **Affected Component:** `loader` function, any component consuming data from a `loader`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Validation (Primary):** Robust server-side validation is the *primary* defense. This threat highlights the importance of *never* trusting client-supplied data.
    *   **Client-Side Data Integrity Checks (Defense-in-Depth):** Within the component, perform basic checks on the *structure* and *type* of the data received from the loader. This is *not* a replacement for server-side validation, but an additional layer of defense. For example, check if an expected `price` field is a number.
    *   **Minimize Client-Side Manipulation:** Reduce the amount of client-side processing of the raw loader data before rendering.
    *   **`ErrorBoundary`:** Use Remix's `ErrorBoundary` to catch unexpected data formats, which could indicate tampering.

## Threat: [Client-Side Action Data Tampering (FormData Manipulation)](./threats/client-side_action_data_tampering__formdata_manipulation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses browser developer tools to modify the `FormData` object *before* it's submitted by a Remix `action`. They add, remove, or change fields, bypassing any visual form constraints. This is distinct from simply manipulating visible form inputs; it targets the underlying data structure.
*   **Impact:** The server receives manipulated data, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data corruption, or bypassing business logic. For example, an attacker could change a product ID to one they are not authorized to purchase.
*   **Affected Component:** `action` function, `<Form>` component (indirectly, as it generates the `FormData`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side `FormData` Validation:** *Always* parse and validate the `FormData` object received on the server using a schema validation library (e.g., Zod, Yup). Define expected fields, types, and constraints. Reject any unexpected fields.
    *   **Hidden Field Scrutiny:** Pay extra attention to hidden fields, as they are easily manipulated. Validate them as rigorously as visible fields.
    *   **Don't Trust Client-Side Validation:** Client-side form validation is for UX, *not* security.

## Threat: [`useFetcher` Data Tampering](./threats/_usefetcher__data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to loader data spoofing, an attacker intercepts and modifies the data returned by a `useFetcher` call *before* it's used by the component. This affects background requests made outside of the initial page load.
*   **Impact:** The application uses manipulated data, potentially leading to incorrect state updates, display of false information, or triggering unintended side effects.
*   **Affected Component:** `useFetcher` hook, components using data from `useFetcher`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Treat `useFetcher` Data Like Loader Data:** Apply the same client-side integrity checks (defense-in-depth) and, most importantly, the same rigorous server-side validation principles as for loader data.
    *   **Consider `fetcher.load` for Critical Operations:** For highly sensitive operations, use `fetcher.load`, which behaves more like a loader and benefits from Remix's error handling.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Error Handling](./threats/information_disclosure_via_error_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Unhandled exceptions or poorly crafted error messages in loaders or actions reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, database structure, or API keys. An attacker triggers an error and examines the response.
*   **Impact:** Attackers gain valuable information that can be used to craft more sophisticated attacks. Exposure of API keys or database credentials can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `loader` function, `action` function, `CatchBoundary`, `ErrorBoundary`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Custom Error Responses:** *Never* return raw error messages from the database or internal services to the client. Create generic, user-friendly error messages.
    *   **`CatchBoundary` and `ErrorBoundary`:** Use these components to handle errors gracefully and prevent sensitive information from leaking.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information in environment variables, *never* hardcoded.

## Threat: [Elevation of Privilege via Improper Authorization in Loaders/Actions](./threats/elevation_of_privilege_via_improper_authorization_in_loadersactions.md)

*   **Description:** A loader or action fails to properly check user permissions *before* returning data or performing an action. An attacker with limited privileges can access data or perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of data, or execution of privileged actions.
*   **Affected Component:** `loader` function, `action` function.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Authorization Checks:** *Always* perform authorization checks within loaders and actions *before* returning data or performing any operation. Verify that the current user (from the session) has the necessary permissions.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a robust RBAC system to manage user permissions.
    *   **Validate Session:** Ensure the user's session is valid and not tampered with.
    *   **Don't Trust Client-Supplied User IDs:** Never trust a user ID provided directly by the client without validating it against the current, authenticated session.

## Threat: [Cookie Tampering (Custom Cookie Management)](./threats/cookie_tampering__custom_cookie_management_.md)

*   **Description:** If you're *not* using Remix's recommended `createCookieSessionStorage` and are instead managing cookies manually, an attacker might tamper with cookie values to gain unauthorized access or impersonate another user.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** Any code that manually sets or reads cookies (outside of `createCookieSessionStorage`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use `createCookieSessionStorage`:** This is the strongly recommended approach. It handles signing and encryption of cookies automatically.
    *   **`httpOnly` and `secure` Flags:** If you *must* manage cookies manually, *always* set the `httpOnly` (prevents JavaScript access) and `secure` (only transmits over HTTPS) flags.
    *   **Cookie Validation:** If storing critical data in cookies (beyond session IDs), add a separate integrity check (e.g., a hash) to detect tampering.
