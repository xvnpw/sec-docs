## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Route-Based Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_route-based_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1. Route Parameter Manipulation [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **1.1.1. Bypass Access Controls [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:* An attacker modifies route parameters (e.g., `/admin/:userId`) to access resources or functionality they shouldn't have access to.  They might change a user ID, role ID, or other identifier to impersonate another user or gain elevated privileges.
        *   *Likelihood:* High
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Low
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Implement robust server-side authorization checks within loaders and actions.  These checks should be independent of the route parameters themselves.  Use session data to determine the user's identity and permissions, not solely URL parameters.  Validate parameter types and ranges to prevent unexpected values.

    *   **1.1.2. Trigger Unexpected Loader/Action Behavior [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:* An attacker injects malicious code or data into route parameters to trigger unintended behavior in the loader or action function.  This could include SQL injection, command injection, or other code injection vulnerabilities.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Medium
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection.  Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all route parameters.  Perform type checking to ensure parameters are of the expected data type.

*   **1.3. Client-Side Route Manipulation**
    *   **1.3.1. Bypassing Client-Side Checks [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:* An attacker manipulates client-side JavaScript code (e.g., using browser developer tools) to bypass client-side checks, such as those related to routing or revalidation (`shouldRevalidate`).  This allows them to trigger server-side actions without meeting the intended client-side conditions.
        *   *Likelihood:* High
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Low
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* High
        *   *Mitigation:* Never rely solely on client-side validation or revalidation logic for security.  Always perform server-side authorization and validation in loaders and actions.  Treat all client-side data as untrusted.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Data Loading (Loader) Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_data_loading__loader__vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1. Data Leakage [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **2.1.1. Returning Sensitive Data Unconditionally [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:* A loader function returns sensitive data without proper authorization checks.  This could expose private user information, internal data, or other confidential information to unauthorized users.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Low
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Implement granular access control within loaders.  Only return the data that is necessary for the current user and context.  Use session data to determine the user's authorization level.

    *   **2.1.2. Error Handling Exposing Sensitive Information [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:* Error messages returned by the loader function expose sensitive information, such as stack traces, database details, or internal implementation details.  This information can be used by an attacker to gain a better understanding of the system and plan further attacks.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Medium
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Low
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Low
        *   *Mitigation:* Implement robust error handling that returns generic error messages to the client.  Log detailed error information server-side for debugging purposes.  Never expose internal implementation details in production environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Action (Form Handling) Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_action__form_handling__vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **3.1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
    *   **3.1.1. Missing or Weak CSRF Protection [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:* The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to trick a user into submitting a malicious request to the server.  This can result in unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user, such as changing their password, making purchases, or deleting data.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Medium
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Use Remix's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., `useNonce` and server-side validation).  Ensure that the CSRF token is included in all non-GET requests.  Verify the token's origin and validity on the server.

*   **3.2. Data Modification Without Authorization [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **3.2.1. Bypassing Server-Side Validation [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:* An attacker manipulates form data before submission (e.g., using browser developer tools) to bypass client-side validation.  If the server does not perform its own validation, this can lead to invalid or malicious data being processed, resulting in data corruption or other security issues.
        *   *Likelihood:* High
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Low
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Always perform server-side validation of all form data in the action function.  Never rely solely on client-side validation.  Use a schema validation library (e.g., Zod, Yup) to define and enforce data constraints.

    *   **3.2.2. Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
        *   *Description:* An attacker submits unexpected or additional form fields that the server-side code does not properly handle.  This can allow the attacker to update fields they shouldn't have access to, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data corruption.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Low
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation:* Explicitly define which fields can be updated in the action function.  Avoid blindly updating database records with all submitted form data.  Use an allowlist (whitelist) or denylist (blacklist) approach to control which fields are processed.
