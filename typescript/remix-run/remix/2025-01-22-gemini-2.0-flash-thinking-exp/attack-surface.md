# Attack Surface Analysis for remix-run/remix

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Handling in Loaders and Actions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_handling_in_loaders_and_actions.md)

Description: Remix loaders and actions are server-side functions crucial for data fetching and mutations. *Remix's architecture centralizes data handling in these functions*, making vulnerabilities here highly impactful. If these functions are not implemented securely, they become critical entry points for attacks.

Remix Contribution: *Remix's core data fetching and mutation model relies on loaders and actions*. This design choice makes these functions a primary and unavoidable attack surface in any Remix application.  The framework encourages developers to place data logic directly within route modules, increasing the potential for exposure if not handled carefully.

Example: A loader function uses `request.url.searchParams.get('productId')` directly in a database query: `db.query(\`SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ${request.url.searchParams.get('productId')}\`). *Remix's URL-centric data loading* makes this pattern common, and if `productId` is not sanitized, it's a direct SQL injection vulnerability.

Impact: Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, server-side code execution, denial of service.

Risk Severity: Critical

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Input Validation and Sanitization within Loaders/Actions: Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* user inputs received via `request` objects within loaders and actions. This is paramount due to Remix's data handling paradigm.
*   Parameterized Queries or ORMs in Loaders/Actions:  Mandatory use of parameterized queries or ORMs within loaders and actions to prevent injection attacks. *Remix's server-side execution of these functions* necessitates this protection.
*   Principle of Least Privilege in Loader Data Fetching: Loaders should *only* fetch the data absolutely necessary for the route. *Remix's server-rendering context* means any data fetched by loaders is potentially exposed in the initial HTML, so minimizing data exposure is crucial.
*   Authorization Checks in Loaders and Actions: Implement robust authorization checks *within loaders and actions* to control data access and modification. *Remix's route-based data loading* requires authorization to be enforced at this level.
*   Rate Limiting on Actions: Implement rate limiting specifically on Remix actions to mitigate abuse and denial-of-service attempts targeting data modification endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Secrets Exposure](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__secrets_exposure.md)

Description: Remix applications are server-rendered. *Remix's SSR approach* means server-side code directly generates the initial HTML.  Accidental inclusion of sensitive information in this rendered HTML exposes it to the client.

Remix Contribution: *Remix's fundamental SSR architecture* inherently creates this attack surface.  The framework's design encourages server-side data fetching and rendering, increasing the risk of inadvertently leaking server-side secrets during the rendering process.

Example: A loader function directly includes an API key in the rendered HTML:  `return <div data-apiKey={process.env.API_KEY}>...</div>`. *Remix's JSX-based rendering within loaders* can easily lead to this mistake if developers are not cautious about what they render.

Impact: Leakage of sensitive credentials (API keys, internal paths, etc.), potentially leading to unauthorized access to external services or internal systems.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Strictly Avoid Embedding Secrets in Rendered HTML:  Never directly embed sensitive information in JSX rendered within Remix loaders or components that are part of the server-rendered output.
*   Environment Variables and Secure Configuration Management:  Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management systems for secrets. *Remix's server-side environment* is the appropriate place to access these, not the rendered output.
*   Clear Separation of Server and Client Logic: Maintain a clear separation between server-side data fetching/processing (loaders, actions) and client-side rendering. Ensure sensitive operations remain exclusively server-side.
*   Code Reviews Focused on SSR Context: Conduct code reviews specifically looking for potential secret leaks in server-rendered components and loader outputs within Remix applications.
