# Threat Model Analysis for remix-run/remix

## Threat: [Server-Side Code Injection via Data Loaders and Actions](./threats/server-side_code_injection_via_data_loaders_and_actions.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Code Injection via Data Loaders and Actions
*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into server-side commands executed within Remix data loaders or actions by providing crafted, unsanitized input. This could lead to execution of arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, denial of service, arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Remix Component Affected:** `loaders`, `actions`
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs received by loaders and actions.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimal necessary permissions for server-side operations.
    *   **Code Review:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential injection points.

## Threat: [Server-Side Data Exposure in Initial HTML (SSR)](./threats/server-side_data_exposure_in_initial_html__ssr_.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Data Exposure in Initial HTML (SSR)
*   **Description:** Sensitive data might be inadvertently included in the server-rendered HTML source code due to Remix's SSR process embedding loader data. This exposed data becomes accessible to anyone viewing the page source.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data (e.g., PII, API keys, internal application details), business logic leaks, information disclosure.
*   **Remix Component Affected:** Server-Side Rendering (`server-side rendering process`, `loaders`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Minimization in SSR:** Avoid including sensitive data in SSR rendered data.
    *   **Careful Data Handling:** Review all data passed from loaders to SSR components.
    *   **Client-Side Rendering for Sensitive Data:** Fetch and render sensitive data client-side if not essential for initial rendering.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit server-rendered HTML for potential data exposure.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Form Actions](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__in_form_actions.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Form Actions
*   **Description:** Attackers could manipulate identifiers in form submissions to access or modify unauthorized resources. Remix form actions using user-provided IDs without authorization checks are vulnerable.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, data breaches.
*   **Remix Component Affected:** `actions`, `forms`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authorization Checks in Actions:** Implement robust authorization checks within form actions.
    *   **Indirect References:** Avoid directly using user-provided IDs for resource access.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize user-provided IDs.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass in Nested Routes](./threats/authorization_bypass_in_nested_routes.md)

*   **Threat:** Authorization Bypass in Nested Routes
*   **Description:** Attackers might bypass authorization checks by manipulating URLs or navigating nested routes unexpectedly. Remix's nested routing can complicate consistent authorization, leading to potential bypasses.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive routes and functionalities, privilege escalation, data breaches.
*   **Remix Component Affected:** `routes`, `layouts`, `authorization logic`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Centralized Authorization:** Implement a centralized authorization mechanism across all routes.
    *   **Route-Level Authorization:** Enforce authorization checks at each route level, including nested routes.
    *   **Consistent Authorization Logic:** Ensure consistent authorization logic across the application.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of route authorization, including nested routes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Remix Framework and Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_remix_framework_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Remix Framework and Dependencies
*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit known security vulnerabilities in the Remix framework or its dependencies if not promptly patched.
*   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, from information disclosure, XSS, to RCE, potentially leading to full server compromise.
*   **Remix Component Affected:** `Remix framework core`, `dependencies`
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Remix and dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories related to Remix.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Implement robust dependency management.
