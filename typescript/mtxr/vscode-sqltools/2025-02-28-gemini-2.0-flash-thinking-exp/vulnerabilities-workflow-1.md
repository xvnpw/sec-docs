## Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization in Connection Settings

*   **Description:**
    1.  The VSCode SQLTools extension allows users to configure database connections.
    2.  The connection settings are stored as JSON in the VSCode settings.json file.
    3.  The extension's code, particularly within driver extensions, might deserialize these settings during connection establishment or other operations.
    4.  If the deserialization process is not properly secured, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the connection settings JSON.
    5.  When the extension deserializes these settings, the malicious code could be executed.
    6.  This can be achieved by crafting a malicious connection configuration and tricking a user into using this configuration within their VSCode workspace.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine. An attacker could gain full control over the user's VSCode environment and potentially their entire system.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:**
    *   **Critical**

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None identified in the provided project files. The code appears to assume that connection settings are always safe and does not include specific deserialization security measures.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   Implement secure deserialization practices for connection settings. This could involve:
        *   Validating the structure and data types of the deserialized settings to ensure they conform to the expected schema.
        *   Using safe deserialization libraries that prevent or mitigate deserialization attacks.
        *   Avoiding deserialization of complex objects from settings if possible; favor simple data structures.
        *   Consider signing or encrypting connection settings to prevent tampering.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Attacker needs to convince a victim to import or manually create a malicious connection configuration within the VSCode SQLTools extension. This could be achieved through social engineering, supply chain attacks, or by compromising a shared workspace configuration.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**

    1.  While the provided files do not explicitly show insecure deserialization code, the general architecture of VSCode extensions and the way settings are handled create a potential risk.
    2.  The `parseBeforeSaveConnection` and `parseBeforeEditConnection` functions in driver extensions (`packages/driver.mssql/src/extension.ts`, `/packages/driver.mysql/src/extension.ts`, `/packages/driver.pg/src/extension.ts`, `/packages/driver.sqlite/src/extension.ts`) are involved in processing connection settings.
    3.  If these functions or related code in the core extension or base driver use insecure deserialization techniques, a vulnerability could be present.
    4.  The `build-tools/webpack.config.js` file indicates the use of `require` for loading modules, and if connection settings processing involves dynamic module loading based on settings data, it could open up deserialization vulnerabilities.
    5.  No specific code snippets in the provided files directly confirm insecure deserialization, but the general context and lack of explicit security measures suggest this as a potential area of concern.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1.  **Setup:**
        *   Attacker sets up a malicious server that can be used as part of a database connection (e.g., a fake MySQL server).
        *   Attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload for a connection setting, embedding code to be executed during deserialization. This payload would be database-driver specific. For example, if the MySQL driver uses `mysql2` library directly and deserializes SSL options, a malicious SSL configuration might be crafted.
        *   Attacker hosts this malicious configuration (e.g., on a public GitHub repository or a website).
    2.  **Victim Action:**
        *   Victim is tricked into importing connection settings from the attacker's malicious source (e.g., by using a "Import Connections" feature if one exists, or manually copying and pasting the malicious JSON into their VSCode settings.json).
        *   Victim attempts to connect to a database using the imported (malicious) connection configuration within VSCode SQLTools.
    3.  **Verification:**
        *   Observe if the malicious code embedded in the connection settings is executed when the extension attempts to establish the database connection.
        *   For example, the malicious code could attempt to write a file to the user's system, open a reverse shell, or exfiltrate data.
        *   Successful execution of malicious code confirms the insecure deserialization vulnerability.

### Vulnerability: SQL Injection Vulnerability in Database Explorer Queries

*   **Description:**
    1. An attacker can manipulate the database explorer queries by controlling parameters such as schema, table, or search terms.
    2. These parameters are directly interpolated into SQL queries executed by the extension without proper sanitization.
    3. By crafting malicious input for these parameters, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code.
    4. This injected SQL code will be executed against the database with the privileges of the connected user.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database by crafting SQL injection queries to extract data beyond the intended scope.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues or denial of service.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** In certain database configurations, an attacker might be able to escalate privileges or perform administrative tasks if the connected user has sufficient permissions.

*   **Vulnerability Rank:**
    *   **Critical**

*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    *   None. The code directly interpolates user-controlled parameters into SQL queries without sanitization.

*   **Missing Mitigations:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** All user-provided parameters used in database explorer queries (schema, table, database names, search terms, etc.) must be properly sanitized and escaped to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Instead of string interpolation, use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the database driver. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not executable code.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user accounts used by the extension have the minimum necessary privileges required for their intended functions. This limits the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

*   **Preconditions:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to a VSCode workspace where the SQLTools extension is installed and configured to connect to a database.
    *   The attacker must be able to interact with the database explorer feature of the SQLTools extension, for example by expanding database/schema/table nodes or using the search functionality.

*   **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/packages/driver.mssql/src/ls/queries.ts` (and similar files in other driver packages like `/code/packages/driver.pg/src/ls/queries.ts`, `/code/packages/driver.mysql/src/ls/queries.ts`, `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts`)
    2. **Vulnerable Code Pattern:** The code uses `queryFactory` from `@sqltools/base-driver/dist/lib/factory` to define database queries.
    3. **Example in `fetchColumns` query:**
        ```typescript
        export const fetchColumns: IBaseQueries['fetchColumns'] = queryFactory`
        SELECT
          C.COLUMN_NAME AS label,
          '${ContextValue.COLUMN}' as "type",
          ...
        WHERE
          C.TABLE_SCHEMA = '${p => p.schema}'
          AND C.TABLE_NAME = '${p => p.label}'
          AND C.TABLE_CATALOG = '${p => p.database}'
          ...
        `;
        ```
    4. **Analysis:**
        - The `queryFactory\`...\`` creates a tagged template literal.
        - The expressions within `${}` are functions that access properties of the parameter `p`.
        - These properties (`p.schema`, `p.label`, `p.database`) are directly inserted into the SQL query string.
        - If the values of `p.schema`, `p.label`, and `p.database` are derived from user input without sanitization, an attacker can inject SQL code.
    5. **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Input (e.g., in database explorer filter) --> Parameter 'p' in queryFactory --> Direct String Interpolation in SQL Query --> SQL Execution
        ```
    6. **Code Walkthrough Example (Triggering SQL Injection via Schema Name):**
        - Assume an attacker wants to exploit the `fetchTables` query.
        - The `fetchTables` query in `packages/driver.mssql/src/ls/queries.ts` is defined as:
          ```typescript
          export const fetchTables: IBaseQueries['fetchTables'] = fetchTablesAndViews(ContextValue.TABLE);
          const fetchTablesAndViews = (type: ContextValue, tableType = 'BASE TABLE'): IBaseQueries['fetchTables'] => queryFactory`
          SELECT ... FROM ${p => p.database ? `${escapeTableName({ database: p.database, schema: "INFORMATION_SCHEMA", label: "TABLES" })}` : 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES'} AS T
          WHERE
            T.TABLE_SCHEMA = '${p => p.schema}'
            AND T.TABLE_CATALOG = '${p => p.database}'
            AND T.TABLE_TYPE = '${tableType}'
          ORDER BY
            T.TABLE_NAME;
          `;
        - When a user expands a database node in the explorer to list schemas, the extension calls `fetchSchemas`.
        - When a user expands a schema node, the extension calls `fetchTables` (or `fetchViews`, etc.).
        - If an attacker can somehow control the `schema` parameter (e.g., by manipulating internal extension state or indirectly through another vulnerability), they could inject SQL code into the `WHERE T.TABLE_SCHEMA = '${p => p.schema}'` clause.
        - For instance, if `p.schema` is crafted as `'schema' UNION SELECT malicious_code --`, the resulting query (simplified) could become:
          ```sql
          SELECT ... FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES AS T
          WHERE
            T.TABLE_SCHEMA = 'schema' UNION SELECT malicious_code --'
            AND T.TABLE_CATALOG = '...'
            AND T.TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'
          ORDER BY
            T.TABLE_NAME;
          ```
        - The injected `UNION SELECT malicious_code --` will be executed, potentially allowing data extraction or manipulation.

*   **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Install the SQLTools extension and the MSSQL driver.
        - Configure a connection to a test MSSQL database instance.
    2. **Steps:**
        - Connect to the test MSSQL database using SQLTools.
        - In the SQLTools explorer, expand the database node.
        - Attempt to expand a schema node (e.g., `dbo`). This action triggers the `fetchTables` query.
        - **Exploitation Attempt:**  There is no direct way for an external attacker to directly control the schema name passed to `fetchTables` through the UI in a simple way. However, if there is another vulnerability that allows manipulation of the internal state or connection parameters, this SQL injection point can be exploited. For a more realistic test case, we would need to identify a way to influence the schema parameter.

        **For demonstration purposes, assume an attacker has found a way to manipulate the schema parameter. This part is hypothetical for this test case but highlights the vulnerability.**

        - **Hypothetical Attack Scenario:**  Imagine an attacker could somehow inject the following malicious schema name when expanding a schema node:
          ```
          'dbo\' UNION SELECT SUSER_SNAME(), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 --
          ```
        - If this malicious schema name is used as the `p.schema` parameter in the `fetchTables` query, the generated SQL would become (simplified):
          ```sql
          SELECT ... FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES AS T
          WHERE
            T.TABLE_SCHEMA = 'dbo\' UNION SELECT SUSER_SNAME(), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 --'
            AND T.TABLE_CATALOG = 'test_db'
            AND T.TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'
          ORDER BY
            T.TABLE_NAME;
          ```
        - **Expected Outcome:** The query execution, instead of just fetching tables for the 'dbo' schema, would now also execute `UNION SELECT SUSER_SNAME(), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 --`. This injected SQL code will return the current user's server name (`SUSER_SNAME()`) along with dummy columns. The results pane in SQLTools would then display the injected data, proving the SQL injection vulnerability.

    3. **Verification:**
        - Examine the query results in SQLTools. If the results contain data injected by the attacker (e.g., the output of `SUSER_SNAME()` in the hypothetical example), the SQL injection vulnerability is confirmed.

**Note:** This test case simplifies the exploitation to demonstrate the vulnerability. A real-world attacker would need to find a way to manipulate the parameters passed to the database explorer queries, which may require chaining this vulnerability with another one. However, the code analysis clearly shows the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to insecure parameter handling in the query construction within the driver code.
