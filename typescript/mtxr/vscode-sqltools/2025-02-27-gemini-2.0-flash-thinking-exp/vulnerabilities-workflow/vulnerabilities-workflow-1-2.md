- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Plugin Code Execution via Unvalidated Plugin Registration  
  **Description:**  
  An attacker who can send a specially crafted language server request may force the extension’s language server to load a plugin from a path of the attacker’s choice. The language server defines a handler for the custom request type `"ls/RegisterPlugin"` that accepts a parameter containing a file path. This path is resolved and then passed directly to Node’s dynamic module loader (using `__non_webpack_require__` or its equivalent). Because there is no validation or allowlisting of the supplied path, an attacker can cause the extension to load and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Remote or user–initiated arbitrary code execution within the extension host process.  
  - Compromise of internal state, configuration details, and enhanced filesystem access.  
  - Full compromise of the VS Code extension’s runtime and capabilities.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - A basic try–catch block exists in the handler to log errors, but no input validation is performed on the plugin path.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validate the supplied plugin path against an allowlist or use sandboxed execution.  
  - Require explicit user confirmation when a plugin is to be loaded from an unrecognized location.  
  - Never pass unsanitized external input directly to dynamic module loaders.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to send a custom `"ls/RegisterPlugin"` request over the established language server channel.  
  - The extension host must permit filesystem access for module loading.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/ls/plugin.ts` (and similar locations in other drivers’ LS registration code), the supplied path is used directly with a dynamic require call such as  
    ```ts
    (__non_webpack_require__ || require)(pluginPath)
    ```  
    without validation.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Create a malicious JavaScript file (e.g., `/tmp/malicious.js`) that performs a benign but detectable action (such as writing a log file).  
  2. Send an `"ls/RegisterPlugin"` request containing the parameter `{ "path": "/tmp/malicious.js" }` over the language server channel.  
  3. Verify that the extension host loads and executes the content of the malicious file (confirm the benign side effect).  
  4. After applying proper input validation/sandboxing, confirm that the request is either rejected or sanitized.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Information Disclosure via Unsanitized Error Messages in Query Responses  
  **Description:**  
  When a query error occurs (for example, from a malformed SQL query), the extension directly returns the raw error message—including potential stack traces, file paths, and connection details—to the client. An attacker who deliberately triggers query errors may force the extension to disclose sensitive internal diagnostic information.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Leakage of internal configuration details, file paths, and stack traces.  
  - The attacker could use the exposed details to plan further targeted attacks.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - Errors are caught and logged; however, no sanitization is applied before the error is returned to the client.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Strip out sensitive internal diagnostic data from error messages before sending them.  
  - Replace detailed error messages with a generic message such as “An unexpected error occurred.”  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to invoke queries (for example, by crafting malformed SQL) that trigger internal errors.  
  - The extension must return raw error messages directly in query responses.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In the connection manager’s language server code, when a query fails the error object’s message (and possibly its stack trace) is used verbatim in the response without sanitization.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Use a SQL client (or simulate one) to send a deliberately malformed query via the extension’s query interface.  
  2. Verify that the returned error message contains sensitive internal details (stack traces, file paths, etc.).  
  3. After mitigation, confirm that the response now only returns a generic error message.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Session File Handling Due to Unsanitized Connection Name  
  **Description:**  
  The Connection Manager plugin computes the path for the session file by passing the connection’s name (via `getSessionBasename(conn.name)`) to a path–resolution function without adequate sanitization. An attacker who supplies a connection name containing directory traversal characters (e.g., `"../../sensitive"`) can force the computed path to reference a file outside the intended directory.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the local filesystem.  
  - Exposure of sensitive files (such as configuration or system files) to an attacker.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No sanitization or allowlisting is applied to connection names during computation of session file paths.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Sanitize the connection name to remove dangerous path traversal sequences.  
  - Enforce that the resolved path remains within a predefined safe directory.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to supply or inject a connection configuration.  
  - The auto–open session file functionality is enabled so that the computed path is used.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/extension.ts`, the session file path is computed as:  
    ```ts
    const sessionFilePath = path.resolve(baseFolder.fsPath, getSessionBasename(conn.name));
    ```  
    Because `getSessionBasename(conn.name)` does not filter directory traversal characters, an attacker can manipulate the session file path.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Configure a connection with the name set to a malicious string (e.g., `"../../secret_config"`).  
  2. Trigger the auto–open session file functionality (for example, by connecting to the database).  
  3. Verify that the extension opens (or attempts to open) a file outside the intended session directory.  
  4. After implementing sanitization, confirm that such path traversal attacks are blocked.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Credential Collision via Insecure Session ID Generation in Authentication Provider  
  **Description:**  
  The authentication provider generates session IDs by concatenating the connection’s *serverName* and *userName* with a forward slash (`/`) without sanitizing these fields. An attacker can supply input that includes additional delimiters (e.g., `"target/admin"`) so that different connections end up with the same session ID, leading to a collision.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Credential confusion or overwriting, where an attacker may override legitimate connection credentials.  
  - Loss of credential isolation between connections, potentially enabling unauthorized access or manipulation of connection data.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The session ID is constructed by simple concatenation without any input validation.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Sanitize and validate the *serverName* and *userName* fields to remove delimiter characters or encode them safely.  
  - Use a robust key–derivation mechanism (e.g., salted hashing) to generate unique session identifiers.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to supply or modify connection configuration data processed by the authentication provider.  
  - The insecure session ID generation is used during creation or retrieval of authentication sessions.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/packages/plugins/authentication-provider/authenticationProvider.ts`, the session ID is generated as:  
    ```ts
    public static sessionId(serverName: string, userName: string): string {
        return `${serverName}/${userName}`;
    }
    ```  
    The lack of sanitization means that crafted input can cause session ID collisions.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Register a benign connection with *serverName* `"target"` and *userName* `"admin"` (yielding session ID `"target/admin"`).  
  2. Register a malicious connection with *serverName* set to `"target/admin"` (or with injected delimiters) so that it produces the same session ID.  
  3. Trigger the authentication process for both connections and confirm that they share the same session ID, causing credential collision.  
  4. Post mitigation, verify that properly sanitized inputs prevent such collisions.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Method Invocation via Unvalidated Command in RunCommandRequest Handler  
  **Description:**  
  Within the Connection Manager plugin’s language–server code, the request handler for `"connection/RunCommandRequest"` takes a `command` parameter from the requester and directly invokes the corresponding method on a connection instance via dynamic property access. Because no validation or allowlisting is imposed on the `command` parameter, an attacker may supply a method name that was never intended for external use, thereby triggering arbitrary method execution on the connection object.  
  **Impact:**  
  - An attacker may force the connection instance to execute sensitive or unintended operations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or corruption of connection state.  
  - The integrity of connection operations is compromised if sensitive methods become inadvertently callable externally.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - Although errors are logged via a try–catch block, the `command` parameter is not validated before being used in dynamic dispatch.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Implement an allowlist of permitted command names and check that the provided `command` matches one of these approved methods.  
  - Alternatively, avoid using raw dynamic property access and use an explicit routing or mapping for allowed commands.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must have access to the language–server communication channel (for example, via a compromised client).  
  - An active connection instance must exist when the request is sent.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/language-server.ts`, the handler is defined as:  
    ```ts
    private runCommandHandler: RequestHandler<typeof RunCommandRequest> = async ({ conn, args, command }) => {
        try {
            const c = await this.getConnectionInstance(conn);
            if (!c) throw 'Connection not found';
            const results: NSDatabase.IResult[] = await c[command](...args);
            await Handlers.QuerySuccess(results);
            return results;
        } catch (e) {
            this.server.notifyError('Execute query error', e);
            throw e;
        }
    };
    ```  
    The supplied `command` is used directly without checking against a safe list.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Use a language–server testing tool to send a `"connection/RunCommandRequest"` with a `command` value corresponding to an internal method (e.g., `"close"`) not meant for external invocation.  
  2. Supply valid arguments as needed.  
  3. Observe that the corresponding method on the connection instance is invoked, causing unintended behavior (such as abrupt connection closure).  
  4. After mitigation, confirm that such requests are rejected or sanitized.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Credential Disclosure via Unprotected GetConnectionPasswordRequest Handler  
  **Description:**  
  The language–server handler for `"connection/GetConnectionPasswordRequest"` fetches the connection’s password by calling `c.getPassword()` and returns it directly. This handler does not verify whether the requester is authorized to receive such sensitive information, nor does it sanitize the output.  
  **Impact:**  
  - An attacker capable of sending a crafted request to the language server can retrieve stored database passwords or other sensitive authentication data.  
  - Exposure of these credentials can lead to unauthorized database access and compromise of sensitive systems.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - Although error handling is present, no access restrictions are applied to the return value of `c.getPassword()`.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Implement proper authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only trusted components can request password data.  
  - Consider using secure authentication tokens or indirect means rather than exposing plaintext credentials.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be capable of sending a `"connection/GetConnectionPasswordRequest"` with a valid connection object over the language server channel.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/language-server.ts`, the handler is implemented as follows:  
    ```ts
    private GetConnectionPasswordRequestHandler: RequestHandler<typeof GetConnectionPasswordRequest> = async ({ conn }): Promise<string> => {
        if (!conn) {
            return undefined;
        }
        const c = await this.getConnectionInstance(conn);
        if (c) {
            return c.getPassword();
        }
        return null;
    };
    ```  
    No authorization check is performed before returning the password.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Using a language–server testing tool, send a `"connection/GetConnectionPasswordRequest"` with a valid connection configuration.  
  2. Verify that the response returns the connection’s raw password.  
  3. After applying access control measures, confirm that such a request is either rejected or sanitized.

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in SQLite Driver Queries via Unsanitized Input  
  **Description:**  
  The SQLite driver constructs SQL queries using ES6–tagged template literals (via a helper called `queryFactory`) that interpolate dynamic values from connection parameters or query options without proper sanitization. Input such as table names or search strings (supplied via properties like `p.label` or `p.search`) is inserted directly into SQL query strings. An attacker able to control these inputs can inject arbitrary SQL into the queries executed against the local SQLite database.  
  **Impact:**  
  - An attacker can modify the intended SQL queries to execute additional or alternate SQL commands.  
  - This could lead to unauthorized data disclosure, data modification, or even deletion of database objects, thereby compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the stored data.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - No input sanitization or parameterized query handling is applied; the code relies solely on simple string interpolation.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of direct interpolation.  
  - Implement proper escaping or validation for all user–supplied data inserted into SQL query strings.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to supply malicious input through connection configuration or via language server query parameters (for example, by providing a crafted table name or search string).  
  - The extension must be configured to use the SQLite driver.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts`, several query templates are defined that interpolate unsanitized values:  
    - The `describeTable` query is built as:  
      ```ts
      const describeTable: IBaseQueries['describeTable'] = queryFactory`
        SELECT C.*
        FROM pragma_table_info('${p => p.label}') AS C
        ORDER BY C.cid ASC
      `;
      ```  
    - The helper function `escapeTableName` is defined as:  
      ```ts
      function escapeTableName(table: Partial<NSDatabase.ITable>) {
        return `"${table.label || table.toString()}"`;
      }
      ```  
      This function simply wraps the table name in double quotes without escaping any embedded quotes or special characters.  
    - Similar unsanitized interpolation is present in the `searchTables` and `searchColumns` queries where `p.search.toLowerCase()` is inserted directly into a LIKE clause.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Configure a connection for the SQLite driver using a malicious table name—for example,  
     ```
     foo"; DROP TABLE users; --
     ```  
     such that when processed by `escapeTableName`, the resulting string becomes:  
     ```
     "foo"; DROP TABLE users; --"
     ```  
  2. Trigger an operation that uses this table name (e.g., a “describe table” or “fetch records” action).  
  3. Verify that the generated SQL query includes the injected SQL command and that the SQLite database executes the unintended command (for example, dropping the `users` table).  
  4. After applying the proper mitigations (such as parameterization or proper escaping), confirm that the malicious input is neutralized and the query executes as intended without any injection.
