## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: **Driver Plugin Code Injection via Plugin Registration**
- Description:
    - An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the VS Code environment by manipulating the plugin registration process.
    - The `packages/language-server/src/server.ts` file handles plugin registration via the `RegisterPlugin` request.
    - The `onRegisterPlugin` handler in `SQLToolsLanguageServer` uses `require` (or `__non_webpack_require__` in webpack context) to load the plugin module from a path provided in the request (`pluginPath`).
    - If an attacker can control or influence the `pluginPath` value, they could point it to a malicious JavaScript file.
    - When the language server processes the `RegisterPlugin` request, it will execute the code in the malicious file within the language server's process, effectively injecting code into the VS Code extension host.
    - This is possible if there is a way for an attacker to trigger the `ls/RegisterPlugin` request with a crafted path. While external attackers cannot directly send requests to the language server, if there's another vulnerability that allows them to control extension behavior indirectly (e.g., via settings, workspace files, or other extension APIs), they might be able to leverage it to trigger this plugin registration and achieve code execution.
- Impact:
    - **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the VS Code extension host process. This can lead to full control over the user's VS Code environment, including access to files, credentials, and further exploitation of the user's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None evident from the provided code. The code directly uses `require` on the provided path without validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The `pluginPath` received in the `RegisterPlugin` request should be strictly validated to ensure it points to a legitimate plugin file within the expected extension directory.  It should not be possible to load arbitrary files from the user's filesystem or external locations.
    - **Path Restriction:**  Restrict the allowed paths for plugin registration to a predefined list or a specific directory within the extension's installation.
    - **Code Signing and Integrity Checks:** Implement code signing for plugins and integrity checks during plugin registration to ensure that only trusted and unmodified plugins are loaded.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The language server process should run with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of code injection. However, in the context of a VS Code extension, this might be limited.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to find a way to trigger the `ls/RegisterPlugin` request and control the `path` parameter. This might require another vulnerability in the extension or VS Code API abuse to indirectly control the request parameters.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - File: `/code/packages/language-server/src/server.ts`
    - Function: `onRegisterPlugin`

    ```typescript
    private onRegisterPlugin: RequestHandler<typeof RegisterPlugin> = async ({ path: pluginPath } = { path: '' }) => {
      log.info('request to register plugin: "%s"', pluginPath);
      try {
        let plugin = (__non_webpack_require__ || require)(pathResolve(pluginPath)); // Vulnerable line: Unvalidated path used in require
        plugin = plugin.default || plugin;
        await this.registerPlugin(plugin);
        log.debug('plugin %s loaded', pluginPath);
      } catch (error) {
        log.error({ error }, 'Error registering plugin: %O', error);
        return Promise.reject(error);
      }
    }
    ```

    - **Vulnerability Flow:**
        1. An external attacker attempts to trigger the `ls/RegisterPlugin` request.
        2. The `onRegisterPlugin` function in `server.ts` is called with a `pluginPath` provided in the request.
        3. The `pathResolve(pluginPath)` resolves the provided path.
        4. `(__non_webpack_require__ || require)(pathResolve(pluginPath))` attempts to load and execute the JavaScript file at the resolved path.
        5. If the attacker can manipulate `pluginPath` to point to a malicious file, the code in that file will be executed within the language server's process.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Assume attacker has a way to send custom requests to the extension (while this is not directly possible for external attacker, assume there is another vulnerability or misconfiguration that allows this for testing purposes. In a real scenario, attacker needs to find such entry point).
        - Create a malicious JavaScript file `malicious_plugin.js` with code that will execute system commands or exfiltrate data. For example:
          ```javascript
          module.exports = {
            register: (server) => {
              const { exec } = require('child_process');
              exec('touch /tmp/pwned', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
                if (error) {
                  console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
                  return;
                }
                console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
                console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
              });
            }
          };
          ```
        - Place `malicious_plugin.js` in a publicly accessible location (e.g., a web server or a location within the user's workspace if that is somehow accessible by the attacker in the context of triggering the request). For this example, let's assume it's placed at `/tmp/malicious_plugin.js` on the victim's machine for simplicity in testing.
    2. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Craft a `ls/RegisterPlugin` request with the `path` parameter set to `/tmp/malicious_plugin.js`.
        - Send this request to the VS Code extension's language server. (In a real attack scenario, attacker needs to find a way to trigger this indirectly, perhaps via extension settings or other extension API interactions).
    3. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Check if the code in `malicious_plugin.js` is executed. In this test case, verify if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created.
        - Examine the extension's output logs or system logs for any signs of malicious activity.

This vulnerability allows for critical impact and requires immediate mitigation by implementing robust path validation and plugin loading security measures.
