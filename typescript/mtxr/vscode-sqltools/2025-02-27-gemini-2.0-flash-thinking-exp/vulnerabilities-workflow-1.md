## Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Log Injection in VS Code Output Channel

- **Description:**
    - The `packages/log` utility uses VS Code's `OutputChannel` to display logs when running within VS Code.
    - Log messages are appended to the output channel without sanitization.
    - If a log message contains ANSI escape codes or Markdown formatting, these will be interpreted by the output channel.
    - An attacker who can control the content of log messages, for example by manipulating data processed by the extension, could inject malicious content into the VS Code Output Channel.
    - This injected content can lead to unexpected behavior or information disclosure within the VS Code Output Channel.

- **Impact:**
    - An attacker could inject arbitrary text and formatting into the VS Code Output Channel. This could be used to:
        - **Phishing:** Display fake error messages or warnings that mislead users into providing sensitive information or performing actions they shouldn't.
        - **Code Execution (Indirect):** While direct code execution is unlikely, carefully crafted ANSI escape codes or Markdown links could potentially trick users into clicking malicious links or executing commands outside of VS Code.
        - **UI Redress/Denial of Information:** Overwrite or obscure legitimate log messages, making it difficult for users to monitor the extension's behavior or diagnose issues.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly appends the log messages to the VS Code Output Channel without any sanitization or encoding.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization or encoding of log messages before writing them to the VS Code Output Channel. This could involve:
        - **Stripping ANSI escape codes:** Remove ANSI escape sequences from log messages to prevent formatting manipulation.
        - **Encoding Markdown:** Encode Markdown special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting.
        - **Using VS Code API for safe text insertion:** Explore if VS Code API provides methods for inserting plain text into Output Channels that automatically handle sanitization.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence the content of log messages generated by the SQLTools extension. This could be achieved by:
        - **Exploiting vulnerabilities in database drivers:** If a database driver has a vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection), an attacker could craft malicious data that, when processed and logged by SQLTools, injects malicious content.
        - **Manipulating extension settings or configurations:** If extension settings are not properly validated and processed, an attacker might be able to inject malicious content through them, which gets logged.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/log/src/lib/vscode.ts`
        ```typescript
        import { Writable } from 'stream';
        import { window } from 'vscode';
        import factory from './factory';

        const outputChannel = window.createOutputChannel(process.env.DISPLAY_NAME || 'SQLTools');

        const writableStream = new Writable({
          write: (chunk, _, done) => {
            outputChannel.append(chunk.toString(chunk.encoding || 'utf8')); // Vulnerable line
            done();
          },
          writev: (chunks, done) => {
            chunks.forEach(i => outputChannel.append(i.chunk.toString(i.encoding || 'utf8'))); // Vulnerable line
            done();
          },
        });

        const logger = factory({}, writableStream);

        logger.clear = outputChannel.clear.bind(outputChannel);
        logger.outputChannel = outputChannel;
        logger.show = () => outputChannel.show();

        export default logger;
        ```
        - The `Writable` stream's `write` and `writev` methods directly use `outputChannel.append()` to write log messages.
        - `outputChannel.append()` in VS Code interprets ANSI escape codes and Markdown formatting.
        - There is no input sanitization or encoding before calling `outputChannel.append()`.
    - **File:** `/code/packages/log/src/index.ts` and other log files
        - These files use the `factory.ts` to create logger instances and eventually call the `vscode.ts` logger in VS Code context.
        - Log messages from various parts of the extension are passed to these logger instances, and any controllable log message can be a potential injection point.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Install SQLTools extension and any driver (e.g., MySQL). Connect to a test database.
    2. **Action:** Craft a malicious SQL query or manipulate extension settings in a way that causes the extension to log a message containing ANSI escape codes or Markdown. For example, try to trigger an error message that includes a crafted string.
        - As a simple example, try to create a connection with a name that contains ANSI escape codes. While connection name itself might not be directly logged to output channel, this is a starting point. More complex scenario would involve manipulating data that ends up in logs.
        - A more direct test would be to modify the extension code (for testing purposes) to directly log a malicious string. In a real attack, the attacker would need to find a way to have the extension log attacker-controlled data through other means (e.g., exploiting a driver vulnerability).
    3. **Expected Result:** Observe the VS Code Output Channel for SQLTools. The injected ANSI escape codes or Markdown formatting should be rendered in the output channel, demonstrating the log injection vulnerability. For example, if you inject a string like `"\x1b[31mMalicious Log\x1b[0m"`, "Malicious Log" should appear in red in the output channel. If you inject `"[Malicious Link](https://malicious.site)"`, a clickable link should appear.
    4. **Pass/Fail:** If the injected formatting is rendered, the test case passes, confirming the vulnerability. If the output is plain text without formatting, the test case fails, indicating mitigation or absence of the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential SQL Injection in PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite Drivers Query Definitions

- **Description:**
    - The PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite drivers use `queryFactory` to construct SQL queries.
    - These queries are defined as template literals in files like `/code/packages/driver.pg/src/ls/queries.ts`, `/code/packages/driver.mysql/src/ls/queries.ts`, and `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts`.
    - Some of these queries include parameter interpolation using `${p => p.property}` syntax.
    - If the values of these properties are derived from user-controlled input and are not properly sanitized or escaped before being embedded into the SQL queries, it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - An attacker could potentially manipulate these parameters to inject malicious SQL code, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
    - Specific vulnerable queries include `describeTable` and `fetchColumns` in SQLite driver using `pragma_table_info('${p => p.label}')` and `searchTables` and `searchColumns` in all drivers using `LIKE '%${p.search}%'` or `ILIKE '%${p.search}%'`.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to:
        - **Data Breach:** Access sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, confidential business information, etc.
        - **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues or denial of service.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gain administrative access to the database server depending on the database configuration and the privileges of the connected user.
        - **Lateral Movement:** If the database server is connected to other systems, the attacker might be able to use the compromised database as a pivot point to attack other internal systems.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code uses `queryFactory` which is designed to help prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries.
    - For PostgreSQL, the drivers implement `escapeTableName` function in `/code/packages/driver.pg/src/escape-table.ts` to escape table and schema names. The `pgCheckEscape` function within `escapeTableName` checks for characters outside `a-z0-9_` and encloses the name in double quotes if found.
    - For MySQL, backticks are used for escaping schema and table names in `escapeTableName` function in `/code/packages/driver.mysql/src/ls/queries.ts`.
    - For SQLite, double quotes are used for escaping table names in `escapeTableName` function in `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Comprehensive Input Sanitization and Validation:** While `escapeTableName` provides basic protection, it's crucial to ensure that all parameters used in SQL queries, especially those derived from user inputs or external sources, are robustly sanitized and validated. Specifically, the current escaping might not handle all edge cases or complex injection attempts. Deeper analysis is needed to confirm the sufficiency of `pgCheckEscape`, MySQL's backtick escaping, and SQLite's double quote escaping in all contexts.
    - **Parameterized Queries Review and Enforcement:** Thoroughly review all SQL queries defined using `queryFactory` to ensure that all user-controlled parameters are correctly parameterized and escaped. The current implementation relies on template literals and parameter functions, which, if misused, could still lead to vulnerabilities. Static analysis tools and manual code reviews focusing on data flow from input to query execution are recommended.
    - **Search Query Sanitization:** The `searchTables` and `searchColumns` queries in `/code/packages/driver.pg/src/ls/queries.ts`, `/code/packages/driver.mysql/src/ls/queries.ts`, and `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts` use `ILIKE '%${p.search}%'` (PostgreSQL), `LIKE '%${p.search}%'` (MySQL and SQLite) which, while using `ILIKE` for case-insensitive search, still embeds the search term directly in the query. While `ILIKE/LIKE` itself doesn't introduce SQL injection, the lack of sanitization of `p.search` before embedding it into the query string is a potential vulnerability. Input validation and potentially more robust escaping for search terms are needed.
    - **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the database user credentials used by the extension have the minimum necessary privileges to perform the required operations, limiting the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to influence parameters used in SQL queries executed by the SQLTools extension. This could be achieved through:
        - **Manipulating search terms in the extension's UI:** If the search functionality uses vulnerable queries.
        - **Exploiting vulnerabilities in other parts of the extension:** If other vulnerabilities allow an attacker to control parameters passed to database query functions.
        - **Indirectly through database driver vulnerabilities:** Although less direct, vulnerabilities in database drivers could potentially be leveraged to influence query parameters.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/driver.pg/src/ls/queries.ts` and `/code/packages/driver.mysql/src/ls/queries.ts` and `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts`
        - **PostgreSQL `escapeTableName` and `pgCheckEscape` Analysis (`/code/packages/driver.pg/src/escape-table.ts`):**
          ```typescript
          export const pgCheckEscape = (w: string | { label: string }) =>
            /[^a-z0-9_]/.test((<any>w).label || w)
              ? `"${(<any>w).label || w}"`
              : (<any>w).label || w;

          function escapeTableName(table: Partial<NSDatabase.ITable> | string) {
            let items: string[] = [];
            let tableObj = typeof table === 'string' ? <NSDatabase.ITable>{ label: table } : table;
            tableObj.database && items.push(pgCheckEscape(tableObj.database));
            tableObj.schema && items.push(pgCheckEscape(tableObj.schema));
            items.push(pgCheckEscape(tableObj.label));
            return items.join('.');
          }
          ```
          - `pgCheckEscape` uses a regex `/[^a-z0-9_]/` to check for disallowed characters in table/schema names. If found, it escapes the name by enclosing it in double quotes. This escaping mechanism aims to prevent basic SQL injection by handling names with spaces or special characters. However, it's important to verify if this is sufficient for all possible injection vectors. For example, does it handle cases where the input string itself contains double quotes or attempts to break out of the quoted context?

        - **MySQL `escapeTableName` Analysis (`/code/packages/driver.mysql/src/ls/queries.ts`):**
          ```typescript
          function escapeTableName(table: Partial<NSDatabase.ITable> | string) {
            let items: string[] = [];
            let tableObj = typeof table === 'string' ? <NSDatabase.ITable>{ label: table } : table;
            tableObj.schema && items.push(`\`${tableObj.schema}\``);
            items.push(`\`${tableObj.label}\``);
            return items.join('.');
          }
          ```
          - MySQL's `escapeTableName` uses backticks for escaping schema and table names. Backticks are the standard identifier quote character in MySQL. Similar to PostgreSQL, the effectiveness of this escaping should be validated against potential injection attacks.

        - **SQLite `escapeTableName` Analysis (`/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts`):**
          ```typescript
          function escapeTableName(table: Partial<NSDatabase.ITable>) {
            return `"${table.label || table.toString()}"`;
          }
          ```
          - SQLite's `escapeTableName` uses double quotes for escaping table names. Double quotes are the standard identifier quote character in SQLite. Similar to PostgreSQL and MySQL, the effectiveness of this escaping should be validated against potential injection attacks.

        - **Search Queries Analysis:**
          - In `/code/packages/driver.pg/src/ls/queries.ts` and `/code/packages/driver.mysql/src/ls/queries.ts`, and `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts`, the `searchTables` and `searchColumns` queries use string interpolation for the `search` parameter:
              - PostgreSQL:  `ILIKE '%${p.search}%'`
              - MySQL: `LIKE '%${p.search}%'`
              - SQLite: `LIKE '%${p.search.toLowerCase()}%'`
          - The `p.search` parameter is directly embedded into the `LIKE` clause without any sanitization or escaping specifically designed to prevent SQL injection within the search term itself. This is a higher risk area for SQL injection because user-provided search terms are directly used in the query construction.
          - In `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts`, the `describeTable` and `fetchColumns` queries use string interpolation for the `p.label` parameter within `pragma_table_info('${p => p.label}')`:
            ```typescript
            const describeTable: IBaseQueries['describeTable'] = queryFactory`
              SELECT C.*
              FROM pragma_table_info('${p => p.label}') AS C
              ORDER BY C.cid ASC
            `;

            const fetchColumns: IBaseQueries['fetchColumns'] = queryFactory`
            SELECT C.name AS label,
              C.*,
              C.type AS dataType,
              C."notnull" AS isNullable,
              C.pk AS isPk,
              '${ContextValue.COLUMN}' as type
            FROM pragma_table_info('${p => p.label}') AS C
            ORDER BY cid ASC
            `;
            ```
            - The `p.label` parameter, which represents the table name, is embedded within single quotes inside the `pragma_table_info` function. This could be vulnerable to SQL injection if `p.label` is not properly sanitized, as single quotes are string delimiters in SQL, and improper escaping could allow an attacker to break out of the string context and inject malicious SQL.

    - **Data Flow Analysis:**
        - Parameters like `p.schema`, `p.database`, `p.label`, and `p.search` are passed to the query functions from the extension's logic. It is crucial to trace how these parameters are populated and if any user-controlled input can reach these parameters without proper validation or sanitization before being used in the queries. For example, user-provided search strings in the UI directly influence the `p.search` parameter in `searchTables` and `searchColumns`. Table and schema names are usually retrieved from database metadata, but if there are any operations that allow users to specify or modify these names which are then used in queries, it could become a vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Install SQLTools extension and PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite driver. Connect to a test database.
    2. **Action:**
        - **Test Case 1 (Table/Schema Name Injection - SQLite):**
            - **Attempt 1.1 (Basic Injection - SQLite `pragma_table_info`):**
                - In SQLite, attempt to browse tables or schemas with names that contain SQL injection payloads. For example, try to create a table with a name like `testtable'`); DROP TABLE users;--` or `testtable'); SELECT * FROM users; --`. The method to create tables with special characters in names depends on the SQLite client you are using.
                - In the SQLTools explorer, try to describe or fetch columns of this maliciously named table. This should trigger the `describeTable` and `fetchColumns` queries that use `pragma_table_info`.

        - **Test Case 2 (Search Injection - Critical):**
            - Use the search functionality in SQLTools to search for tables or columns.
            - **Attempt 2.1 (Basic Search Injection):** Use search terms containing SQL injection payloads. For example, try searching for `%'; DROP TABLE users;--` or `\`%\`; DROP TABLE users;--` (MySQL), `%'; DROP TABLE users;--` (PostgreSQL), or `%'; DROP TABLE users;--` (SQLite).
            - **Attempt 2.2 (Advanced Search Injection):** Explore more sophisticated injection techniques within the search context, such as using comments, stacked queries, or conditional logic within the search term to execute malicious SQL. For example, try search terms like `a' OR 1=1; --` or `a') UNION SELECT ... --`.

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - If SQL injection is possible, you might observe database errors in the logs, unexpected data modifications, or other signs of malicious SQL code execution. In a successful attack, you might be able to retrieve data you shouldn't have access to or modify/delete data. For search injection, successful exploitation might be easier to detect through unexpected query results or errors when using malicious search terms. For table/schema name injection, the attack might be triggered when the extension attempts to query metadata or data from the maliciously named object.
    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        - If the injected SQL code is executed in any of the test cases, the test case passes, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability. If the queries fail safely or the injected code is not executed, the test case fails, indicating mitigation or absence of the vulnerability. It's critical to test **Test Case 2 (Search Injection)** thoroughly as the code analysis indicates a higher likelihood of vulnerability in search queries due to direct string interpolation of the search term. Also, **Test Case 1 (Table/Schema Name Injection - SQLite)** for SQLite specific `pragma_table_info` injection is important.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Node.js Runtime Detection

- **Description:**
    - The extension attempts to detect the Node.js runtime path using the `detectNodePath` function in `/code/packages/extension/src/language-client/detect-node-path.ts`.
    - This function executes shell commands to determine the Node.js executable path.
    - If the shell command construction or execution is vulnerable to injection, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.
    - This is especially concerning because the detected Node.js path is used to run the language server, potentially escalating the impact.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful command injection could allow an attacker to:
        - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This could lead to complete system compromise.
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data from the user's system.
        - **Malware Installation:** Install malware or backdoors on the user's system.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** Gain higher privileges on the system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None apparent in the provided code snippet. The code constructs shell commands and executes them without explicit sanitization of inputs that could be influenced by the environment (although no direct user input is used in the code itself, environment variables or system configurations could potentially be manipulated in advanced attack scenarios).
    - The code attempts to escape backslashes and double quotes on Windows, but this is likely insufficient for robust command injection prevention.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Robust Input Sanitization and Command Construction:** Sanitize all components used in constructing shell commands, including `nodeRuntimeTmpFile` and `shellExitCommand`. The current escaping on Windows is very basic and likely bypassable. A more robust approach would involve using parameterized commands if possible, or very careful and thorough escaping of all special shell characters.
    - **Command Parameterization or Safer APIs:** Explore using safer APIs for command execution that avoid direct shell command construction altogether. Node.js `child_process` offers options like `spawn` with arguments as an array, which can help prevent injection if used correctly. However, for complex shell commands, this might not always be feasible.
    - **Input Validation and Path Validation:** Validate the detected Node.js path to ensure it is a valid executable and located in an expected directory. Check if the detected path is within a safe and expected location to mitigate against malicious executables being injected.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the extension and language server with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection attack.
    - **Security Review of `getShellExitCommand()`:** The `getShellExitCommand()` function in `/code/packages/vscode/utils/get-shell-exit-cmd.ts` is used to append an exit command to the executed shell script. This function needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure it doesn't introduce any injection vulnerabilities itself. The function currently checks for PowerShell and pwsh shells and constructs exit commands accordingly. While it doesn't directly introduce new injection points, it's part of the command execution flow and its logic should be verified for robustness.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered during the extension activation, specifically when the extension attempts to detect the Node.js runtime path if `sqltools.useNodeRuntime` is enabled.
    - An attacker needs to find a way to influence the shell command execution environment. This could potentially be achieved through manipulation of environment variables or other system configurations, although this is a more advanced attack scenario.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/extension/src/language-client/detect-node-path.ts`
        ```typescript
        import { getDataPath } from "@sqltools/util/path";
        import { commands, window } from 'vscode';
        import fs from "fs";
        import getShellExitCommand from "@sqltools/vscode/utils/get-shell-exit-cmd";

        const nodeRuntimeTmpFile = getDataPath(".node-runtime");


        const detectNodePath = async (): Promise<string | null> => {
          const failureMessageTimer = setTimeout(() => { /* ... */ }, 15_000);
          try {
            const terminal = window.createTerminal({ name: "detect node runtime" });
            const shellExitCommand = await getShellExitCommand();
            await new Promise<void>(async (resolve) => {
              window.onDidCloseTerminal((e => e.processId === terminal.processId && resolve()));
              const nodeCmd = `require("fs").writeFileSync("${nodeRuntimeTmpFile}", process.execPath)`;
              if (process.platform === 'win32') {
                // Massage the command so it works with Command Prompt, Git bash, PowerShell or Windows PowerShell as the user's default terminal profile
                const nodeCmdWindows = nodeCmd.replace(/\\/g, '\\\\\\\\').replace(/\"/g, '\'');
                terminal.sendText(`node -e "${nodeCmdWindows}" ${shellExitCommand}`);
              } else {
                terminal.sendText(`node -e '${nodeCmd}' ${shellExitCommand}`);
              }
            })
            return fs.readFileSync(nodeRuntimeTmpFile).toString();
          } catch (error) { /* ... */ } finally { clearTimeout(failureMessageTimer); }
        }

        export default detectNodePath;
        ```
        - **Vulnerable Command Construction:** The code constructs shell commands using template literals and `terminal.sendText`. The command is designed to execute a Node.js script that writes the Node.js executable path to a temporary file (`nodeRuntimeTmpFile`).
        - **Windows Specific Escaping (Insufficient):** On Windows, the code attempts to "massage" the command using `.replace(/\\/g, '\\\\\\\\').replace(/\"/g, '\'')`. This is a very basic escaping attempt to handle backslashes and double quotes, but it's highly likely insufficient to prevent command injection in various Windows shells (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Git Bash, etc.). Robust shell escaping on Windows is complex and requires careful consideration of different shell behaviors.
        - **Dependency on `getShellExitCommand()`:** The `shellExitCommand` variable, obtained from `getShellExitCommand()`, from `/code/packages/vscode/utils/get-shell-exit-cmd.ts`, is appended to the command. While `getShellExitCommand()` is intended to provide a safe way to terminate the terminal session, it's still an external component whose security needs to be verified to ensure it doesn't introduce injection vulnerabilities. The function in `/code/packages/vscode/utils/get-shell-exit-cmd.ts` determines the shell from `env.shell` and returns an exit command string. It handles PowerShell and pwsh specifically but relies on string matching which might be bypassable or have edge cases.

    - **Data Flow Analysis:**
        - `getDataPath()`: Review the implementation of `getDataPath()` to understand how the base data path is determined. If it's influenced by user-controlled environment variables or configuration settings, it could become a potential injection vector, albeit indirectly.
        - `getShellExitCommand()`: Analyze the code of `getShellExitCommand()` in `/code/packages/vscode/utils/get-shell-exit-cmd.ts` to ensure it's secure and doesn't return malicious commands based on user-controlled input or environment. Currently, it relies on `env.shell` and string matching to determine the shell type and construct an exit command. While it doesn't seem to directly introduce vulnerabilities, its logic should be reviewed for robustness and potential edge cases or bypasses.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Install SQLTools extension. Enable `sqltools.useNodeRuntime` in settings.
    2. **Action:**
        - **Test Case 1 (Basic Injection - Windows):**
            - On a Windows system, attempt to exploit the command injection vulnerability by manipulating environment variables or other system configurations that might influence the command execution. For example, try to set an environment variable that is used in path resolution or command execution in a way that injects a malicious command. Then, trigger the Node.js runtime detection (e.g., by restarting VS Code with `sqltools.useNodeRuntime` enabled).
            - More specifically, try to craft a value for `nodeRuntimeTmpFile` or `shellExitCommand` that, when expanded in the shell, executes an arbitrary command. Direct manipulation of `nodeRuntimeTmpFile` might be harder, so focus on `shellExitCommand` or environment variables that could influence path resolution within the command.

        - **Test Case 2 (Advanced Injection - Windows):**
            - Explore bypasses for the basic Windows escaping applied in `detectNodePath`. Experiment with different shell characters, quoting styles, and command separators that might not be correctly handled by the simple `.replace()` escaping. Try payloads that exploit differences in how Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Git Bash parse and execute commands.

        - **Test Case 3 (Linux/macOS - Less Likely but Check):**
            - Although Windows is explicitly targeted for escaping, briefly test on Linux/macOS as well to ensure there are no unexpected command injection vulnerabilities on these platforms, even though they don't have the same escaping attempt.

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - If command injection is successful, you should observe arbitrary code execution. This could manifest as:
            - Unexpected file system modifications (e.g., creation of files in arbitrary locations).
            - Network connections to external servers initiated by the VS Code process.
            - Execution of arbitrary commands (e.g., opening calculator, displaying a message box - for testing purposes).
            - Error messages or crashes if the injected commands interfere with the extension's normal operation.

    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        - If arbitrary commands are executed, the test case passes, confirming the command injection vulnerability. If the test fails to execute malicious commands and the Node.js path detection works as expected, the test case fails, indicating mitigation or absence of the vulnerability. Given the simplistic escaping on Windows, **Test Case 1 and Test Case 2 are critical to investigate on Windows**.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Object Drop Injection

- **Description:**
    - The `ObjectDropProvider` plugin allows users to drag and drop database objects from the Connection Explorer into a text editor.
    - The `parseData` function in `/code/packages/plugins/objectdrop-provider/extension.ts` processes the dropped data.
    - It iterates through the dropped items and concatenates their `value` properties with newline characters.
    - This concatenated string is then inserted into the text editor as a `DocumentDropEdit`.
    - If the `value` property of a dropped object is not properly sanitized, it could contain malicious content that gets injected into the editor.
    - For example, an attacker could craft a malicious database object name containing ANSI escape codes or Markdown formatting.
    - When a user drops this object into the editor, the malicious content will be rendered, potentially leading to phishing or UI manipulation.

- **Impact:**
    - An attacker could inject arbitrary text and formatting into the VS Code editor by crafting malicious database object names. This could be used to:
        - **Phishing:** Display fake messages or warnings in the editor to mislead users.
        - **UI Redress:** Alter the editor's appearance in unexpected ways using ANSI escape codes.
        - **Information Disclosure (Limited):** While less likely, if the injected content includes links or paths that resemble internal resources, it could potentially trick users into revealing information.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The `parseData` function directly concatenates the `value` properties of dropped items without any sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization or encoding of the `item.value` in the `parseData` function before inserting it into the editor. This could involve:
        - **Stripping ANSI escape codes:** Remove ANSI escape sequences from the `item.value` to prevent formatting manipulation.
        - **Encoding Markdown:** Encode Markdown special characters in `item.value` to prevent them from being interpreted as formatting.
        - **Contextual Output Encoding:** Depending on how the `DocumentDropEdit` and editor handle content, consider using context-aware encoding methods if available in the VS Code API to ensure safe text insertion.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to create or modify database object names (e.g., table names, column names, schema names) to include malicious content.
    - A user must drag and drop this malicious database object from the Connection Explorer into a text editor.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/plugins/objectdrop-provider/extension.ts`
        ```typescript
        import { languages, CancellationToken, DataTransfer, DocumentDropEdit, DocumentDropEditProvider, Position, TextDocument } from "vscode";
        import { IExtensionPlugin, IExtension, ContextValue } from '@sqltools/types';
        import Context from '@sqltools/vscode/context';
        import { SidebarTreeItem } from "../connection-manager/explorer";

        class ObjectDropProvider implements DocumentDropEditProvider {
            private ELIGIBLE_CONTEXT_TYPES: ContextValue[] = [ContextValue.DATABASE, ContextValue.SCHEMA, ContextValue.TABLE, ContextValue.VIEW, ContextValue.COLUMN, ContextValue.FUNCTION];

            async provideDocumentDropEdits(
                _document: TextDocument
                , _position: Position
                , dataTransfer: DataTransfer
                , _token: CancellationToken
            ): Promise<DocumentDropEdit | undefined> {
                const dataTransferItem = await dataTransfer.get('application/vnd.code.tree.connectionExplorer');
                if (!dataTransferItem) {
                    return undefined;
                }
                const val: SidebarTreeItem[] = JSON.parse(await dataTransferItem.value);
                const snippet: DocumentDropEdit = new DocumentDropEdit(this.parseData(val));
                return snippet;
            }

            private parseData = (items: Array<SidebarTreeItem>): string|undefined => {
                return items.map(item=>{
                    if (this.ELIGIBLE_CONTEXT_TYPES.indexOf(item.contextValue) === -1 ){
                        return undefined;
                    }
                    else {
                        return item.value; // Vulnerable line: item.value is directly used without sanitization
                    }
                }).join("\n"); // Concatenation with newline without sanitization
            }
        }

        // ... rest of the file ...
        ```
        - The `parseData` function processes the dropped data. It extracts `item.value` from each `SidebarTreeItem` and concatenates them with newlines.
        - **No Sanitization:** Critically, `item.value` is used directly without any sanitization before being inserted into the text editor via `DocumentDropEdit`. This makes it vulnerable to injection if `item.value` can be manipulated.

    - **Data Flow Analysis:**
        - `SidebarTreeItem` and `item.value` source: The `SidebarTreeItem` objects are part of the Connection Explorer tree. Their `value` property is derived from database object metadata (names of tables, schemas, columns, etc.). If an attacker can influence these database object names (e.g., by creating objects with malicious names, or through SQL injection that modifies object names if that's possible in the application's context), they can control the `item.value` that gets inserted into the editor.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Install SQLTools extension and any driver (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). Connect to a test database.
    2. **Action:**
        - **Scenario 1 (ANSI Escape Codes):**
            - Create a database object (e.g., a table) with a name that includes ANSI escape codes, such as `\x1b[31mMaliciousTable\x1b[0m`. The method to achieve this depends on the specific database system. For example, in PostgreSQL, you might be able to create a table with such a name directly using SQL.
            - In the SQLTools Connection Explorer, locate this maliciously named object.
            - Drag and drop the object from the Connection Explorer into a text editor.
        - **Scenario 2 (Markdown Injection):**
            - Create a database object with a name that includes Markdown formatting, such as `[MaliciousLink](https://malicious.site)Table`.
            - Drag and drop this object into a text editor.
        - **Scenario 3 (HTML Injection - if applicable):**
            - Investigate if VS Code text editor or `DocumentDropEdit` can interpret HTML. If so, try to inject HTML code through database object names (e.g., `<img src="https://malicious.site/xss.jpg">`).

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - **Scenario 1 (ANSI Escape Codes):** In the text editor, the dropped object name "MaliciousTable" should be rendered in red (or the color defined by the ANSI escape code), demonstrating ANSI escape code injection.
        - **Scenario 2 (Markdown Injection):** In the text editor, the dropped object name should be rendered as a clickable link "MaliciousLink" pointing to `https://malicious.site`, demonstrating Markdown injection.
        - **Scenario 3 (HTML Injection):** If HTML injection is possible, the injected HTML code should be interpreted by the editor. For example, if you injected `<img src="https://malicious.site/xss.jpg">`, the editor might attempt to load the image from `https://malicious.site/xss.jpg` or display a broken image icon, depending on how HTML is handled.

    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        - If the injected formatting (ANSI escape codes, Markdown, or HTML if applicable) is rendered in the editor, the test case passes, confirming the Object Drop Injection vulnerability. If the output is plain text without formatting, the test case fails, indicating mitigation or absence of the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Dependency Installation

- **Description:**
    - The Dependency Manager plugin in `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/dependency-manager/extension.ts` is responsible for installing necessary Node.js dependencies for database drivers.
    - The `requestToInstall` function constructs and executes shell commands to perform these installations using `terminal.sendText`.
    - If the dependency names or versions are not properly sanitized before being incorporated into the shell command, an attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands.
    - This is a critical vulnerability as it could allow an attacker to execute code on the user's machine when the extension attempts to install dependencies.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful command injection during dependency installation could allow an attacker to:
        - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This could lead to complete system compromise.
        - **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data from the user's system.
        - **Malware Installation:** Install malware or backdoors on the user's system.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** Gain higher privileges on the system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None apparent in the provided code snippet. The code constructs shell commands using template literals and includes dependency names and versions directly without sanitization.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Robust Input Sanitization:** Sanitize dependency names, versions, and any other parameters used in constructing the shell command. This must include thorough escaping of shell-sensitive characters to prevent command injection. Simple escaping might be insufficient; consider using parameterized commands or safer command construction methods.
    - **Command Parameterization (if applicable):** Explore if the package manager used (npm, yarn, etc.) supports command parameterization or safer APIs to install dependencies that avoid direct shell command construction. If possible, use `child_process.spawn` with arguments array instead of `terminal.sendText` with a shell string.
    - **Input Validation and Whitelisting:** Validate dependency names and versions against a strict whitelist or regular expression to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters or injection payloads.
    - **Dependency Source Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of dependencies being installed. This might involve checking checksums or using signed packages to prevent malicious dependency replacements.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the dependency installation process with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection attack.
    - **User Confirmation and Security Warning:** Before executing dependency installation commands, display a clear and prominent security warning to the user, explaining the potential risks of installing external dependencies. Prompt for explicit user confirmation before proceeding with the installation. This is crucial as dependency installation involves executing code from external sources.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The vulnerability can be triggered when the extension attempts to install or upgrade Node.js dependencies for a database driver, typically when a user tries to connect to a database requiring dependencies that are not yet installed or need to be upgraded.
    - An attacker needs to find a way to influence the dependency installation process to inject malicious commands. Potential attack vectors include:
        - **Man-in-the-middle attacks (unlikely but possible):** If dependency information is fetched over insecure HTTP, an attacker could intercept and modify the response.
        - **Compromised update channels (unlikely but possible):** If the extension relies on insecure update channels for dependency information.
        - **Supply chain attacks/Compromised package registries (external, but relevant in threat model):** If the npm or yarn registry is compromised, or if malicious packages are uploaded with names similar to legitimate dependencies, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/dependency-manager/extension.ts`
        ```typescript
        import { window as Win, window, ProgressLocation, commands } from 'vscode';
        import { openExternal } from '@sqltools/vscode/utils';
        import { EXT_NAMESPACE, DOCS_ROOT_URL, DISPLAY_NAME } from '@sqltools/util/constants';

        import { DriverNotInstalledNotification } from '@sqltools/language-server/src/notifications';
        import { getDataPath } from '@sqltools/util/path';
        import getShellExitCommand from '@sqltools/vscode/utils/get-shell-exit-cmd';

        export default class DependencyManager implements IExtensionPlugin {
          // ... other code ...

          private requestToInstall = async ({ conn, action = 'install', deps = [] }: { conn: IConnection; action: 'upgrade' | 'install'; deps: NodeDependency[] }) => {
            // ... other code ...
            await window.withProgress({ /* ... */ }, async (progress) => {
              // ... other code ...
              const terminal = Win.createTerminal({ name: "SQLTools Dep manager terminal", cwd: getDataPath() });

              const depNamesString = [];
              await new Promise<void>(async (resolve, reject) => {
                const exitCmdPromise = getShellExitCommand();
                const disposable = Win.onDidCloseTerminal((e) => { /* ... */ });
                terminal.show();
                const args = (dependencyManagerSettings.installArgs || []);
                deps.forEach(dep => {
                  const depStr = (`${dep.name}${dep.version ? `@${dep.version}` : ''}`);
                  args.push(depStr);
                  depNamesString.push(depStr);
                  if (dep.args) args.push(...dep.args);
                })
                progress.report({ message: `Installing "${depNamesString.join(", ")}". Please wait until it finishes. Check the opened terminal for more info.` });

                terminal.sendText(`${dependencyManagerSettings.packageManager} ${args.join(" ")} ${await exitCmdPromise}`); // Vulnerable line: Shell command constructed without sanitization
              });
              // ... other code ...
            });
            // ... other code ...
          }

          // ... other code ...
        }
        ```
        - **Vulnerable Command Construction:** The `terminal.sendText` line constructs the shell command using template literals. It incorporates:
            - `dependencyManagerSettings.packageManager`:  The package manager command (e.g., "npm", "yarn"), configurable through extension settings.
            - `dependencyManagerSettings.installArgs`: Additional installation arguments, also from settings.
            - `deps.forEach(...)`: Iterates through an array of `NodeDependency` objects. For each dependency, it constructs a dependency string (`depStr`) using `dep.name` and `dep.version` and pushes it to `args`. It also pushes `dep.args` if they exist.
            - `getShellExitCommand()`: As before, this is appended to the command.
        - **Lack of Sanitization:** None of these components (`dependencyManagerSettings.packageManager`, `dependencyManagerSettings.installArgs`, `dep.name`, `dep.version`, `dep.args`) are sanitized before being included in the shell command string. This creates multiple potential injection points if any of these values can be influenced by an attacker.
        - **Dependency Source:** The source of the `deps` array (NodeDependency objects) is critical. If this array is derived from external sources (e.g., fetched from a remote server, read from a configuration file that could be manipulated), it becomes a primary injection vector.

    - **Data Flow Analysis:**
        - `dependencyManagerSettings`: These settings are user-configurable, but typically controlled through VS Code settings UI. However, in managed environments, settings might be centrally controlled or potentially manipulated. If `dependencyManagerSettings.packageManager` or `dependencyManagerSettings.installArgs` can be altered to include malicious commands, it would lead to direct command injection.
        - `NodeDependency` (`deps` array): Investigate how the `NodeDependency` objects are created and populated. Where does the `deps` array come from? Is it hardcoded, fetched from a remote source, or derived from user-provided data? If it's from an external or partially controllable source, it's a high-risk injection point.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Install SQLTools extension. For testing, you may need to identify a driver that triggers dependency installation or modify the extension to force dependency installation for testing purposes.
    2. **Action:**
        - **Test Case 1 (Malicious Dependency Name - via settings):**
            - Try to manipulate the `dependencyManagerSettings.installArgs` setting in VS Code to inject a malicious command. For example, set `sqltools.dependencyManager.installArgs` to include a command injection payload like `-- '--inject "malicious command"'`. Then, trigger dependency installation (e.g., by trying to connect to a database that requires dependencies).
        - **Test Case 2 (Malicious Dependency Name - via crafted dependency list - more complex):**
            - If you can identify how the `deps` array is generated, try to manipulate the source of this array to include a malicious dependency name. This might involve intercepting network requests, modifying configuration files (if dependencies are read from a file), or other techniques depending on the dependency source. For example, try to create a dependency entry with a name like ``; malicious command & ``.

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - If command injection is successful, you should observe arbitrary code execution during the dependency installation process. This could manifest in similar ways as described in the "Command Injection in Node.js Runtime Detection" vulnerability: unexpected file system changes, network connections, execution of arbitrary commands, etc.

    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        - If arbitrary commands are executed during dependency installation, the test case passes, confirming the Command Injection vulnerability. If the test fails to execute malicious commands and dependency installation works as expected, the test case fails, indicating mitigation or absence of the vulnerability. **Test Case 1, manipulating `installArgs` setting, is a relatively straightforward test to start with.**

- **Vulnerability Name:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Results Filter

- **Description:**
    - The `filterPredicate` function in `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/webview/ui/screens/Results/lib/filterPredicate.ts` is used to filter data in the results grid.
    - When the filter operation is set to 'regex', the function uses `String.search()` with a regular expression derived from user input (filter value).
    - If an attacker provides a specially crafted regular expression, it can lead to catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine.
    - This causes the function to consume excessive CPU resources and potentially leading to a denial of service (ReDoS).

- **Impact:**
    - Successful ReDoS attack can lead to:
        - **CPU Exhaustion:** The filtering operation can become extremely slow, consuming significant CPU resources.
        - **UI Freeze:** The results webview and potentially the entire VS Code extension UI can become unresponsive due to the CPU-intensive filtering.
        - **Denial of Service (Local):** In extreme cases, the ReDoS vulnerability could make the SQLTools extension unusable, effectively causing a local denial of service.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The `filterPredicate` function directly uses the user-provided regex without any safeguards against ReDoS vulnerabilities.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust validation and sanitization for user-provided regular expressions used in filtering. This could involve:
        - **Regex Complexity Analysis and Limits:** Analyze the complexity of user-provided regular expressions. Implement limits on regex complexity (e.g., maximum nesting levels, repetition operators) that are known to contribute to ReDoS vulnerabilities.
        - **Regex Syntax Whitelisting:** Consider allowing only a safe subset of regex syntax, disallowing potentially problematic constructs. Implement a whitelist of allowed regex features.
        - **Input Length Limits:** Limit the maximum length of the regex input string to reduce the potential for complex and long-running regex matching.
    - **Regex Timeout:** Implement a timeout mechanism for regex execution. If a regex takes longer than a predefined threshold to execute, terminate the filtering operation to prevent excessive CPU consumption. This can be achieved using techniques like asynchronous regex execution with cancellation or worker threads with timeouts.
    - **Alternative Filtering Methods:** Evaluate if alternative filtering methods, such as simpler string matching algorithms or pre-compiled and optimized filtering libraries, can be used instead of relying on potentially vulnerable user-provided regular expressions, especially for user-facing filtering functionalities.

- **Preconditions:**
    - A user must apply a filter to the results grid in the SQLTools results webview.
    - The filter operation must be set to 'regex'.
    - An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious regular expression as the filter value. This could be achieved if the filter value is directly controlled by the attacker (e.g., through a compromised workspace configuration or by tricking a user into pasting a malicious regex).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/webview/ui/screens/Results/lib/filterPredicate.ts`
        ```typescript
        import { IntegratedFiltering } from '@devexpress/dx-react-grid';
        export const filterPredicate: typeof IntegratedFiltering['defaultPredicate'] = (value, filter, row) => {
          if (filter.operation !== 'regex') {
            return IntegratedFiltering.defaultPredicate(value, filter, row);
          }
          try {
            return `${value}`.search((filter as any).regex || filter.value) !== -1; // Vulnerable line: String.search() with user-provided regex
          }
          catch (error) {
            return false;
          }
        };
        ```
        - **Regex Execution with `String.search()`:** The `filterPredicate` function uses `String.search()` to perform regex matching when the filter operation is set to 'regex'.
        - **User-Controlled Regex:** The regex pattern used in `String.search()` is derived directly from `(filter as any).regex || filter.value`, which originates from user input in the results webview.
        - **No ReDoS Protection:** There is no input validation, sanitization, complexity analysis, or timeout mechanism implemented to protect against ReDoS vulnerabilities. A malicious or even unintentionally complex regex provided by the user can directly lead to excessive CPU usage and UI unresponsiveness.

    - **Data Flow Analysis:**
        - The `filter` object and its `value` (regex pattern) are directly controlled by user interaction in the results webview. Users can input any string as a regex filter value through the UI. This user-provided regex is then directly passed to `String.search()` without any checks or safeguards.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Precondition:** Install SQLTools extension and any driver. Execute a query that returns a reasonable amount of data (e.g., a few hundred rows). Open the results in the results webview.
    2. **Action:**
        - In the results webview, apply a filter to one of the columns.
        - Set the filter operation to 'regex'.
        - Enter a malicious regular expression known to cause ReDoS in the filter value input. Examples of ReDoS regex patterns (also known as "evil regexes") include:
            - `(a+)+$`
            - `(a|aa)+$`
            - `([a-zA-Z]+)*$`
            - `(a|b|c|d|e)+x`
            - `(.)*?(.)*?$`
            - Variations of these patterns, potentially adjusting them to match the data in your results grid (e.g., if your column contains numbers, you might use `([0-9]+)+$`).
            - A simple ReDoS pattern to test is `^(a+)+$`. Try this pattern first.
        - Apply the filter.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - If ReDoS vulnerability is present, you should observe:
            - **High CPU usage:** The VS Code process or the extension host process will consume a very high amount of CPU (close to 100% on one core). Monitor CPU usage using system tools (Task Manager, Activity Monitor, `top`, `htop`).
            - **UI Unresponsiveness:** The results webview and potentially the entire VS Code UI will become sluggish or freeze completely. The UI might become unresponsive to mouse clicks and keyboard input.
            - **Significant Delay in Filtering:** Applying the filter will take an extremely long time, potentially never completing or taking minutes to complete for a relatively small dataset.
    4. **Pass/Fail:**
        - If you observe high CPU usage and UI unresponsiveness after applying the filter with a malicious regex, the test case passes, confirming the ReDoS vulnerability. If the filtering is performed quickly without excessive CPU usage, the test case fails, indicating mitigation or absence of the vulnerability. Start with the simple pattern `^(a+)+$` and if it doesn't trigger ReDoS, try more complex patterns or patterns tailored to the data in your results grid.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Driver Plugin Code Injection via Plugin Registration

- **Description:**
    - An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the VS Code environment by manipulating the plugin registration process.
    - The `packages/language-server/src/server.ts` file handles plugin registration via the `RegisterPlugin` request.
    - The `onRegisterPlugin` handler in `SQLToolsLanguageServer` uses `require` (or `__non_webpack_require__` in webpack context) to load the plugin module from a path provided in the request (`pluginPath`).
    - If an attacker can control or influence the `pluginPath` value, they could point it to a malicious JavaScript file.
    - When the language server processes the `RegisterPlugin` request, it will execute the code in the malicious file within the language server's process, effectively injecting code into the VS Code extension host.
    - This is possible if there is a way for an attacker to trigger the `ls/RegisterPlugin` request with a crafted path. While external attackers cannot directly send requests to the language server, if there's another vulnerability that allows them to control extension behavior indirectly (e.g., via settings, workspace files, or other extension APIs), they might be able to leverage it to trigger this plugin registration and achieve code execution.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the VS Code extension host process. This can lead to full control over the user's VS Code environment, including access to files, credentials, and further exploitation of the user's system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - A basic try–catch block exists in the handler to log errors, but no input validation is performed on the plugin path.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Validate the supplied plugin path against an allowlist or use sandboxed execution.**
    - **Require explicit user confirmation when a plugin is to be loaded from an unrecognized location.**
    - **Never pass unsanitized external input directly to dynamic module loaders.**
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The `pluginPath` received in the `RegisterPlugin` request should be strictly validated to ensure it points to a legitimate plugin file within the expected extension directory. It should not be possible to load arbitrary files from the user's filesystem or external locations.
    - **Path Restriction:** Restrict the allowed paths for plugin registration to a predefined list or a specific directory within the extension's installation.
    - **Code Signing and Integrity Checks:** Implement code signing for plugins and integrity checks during plugin registration to ensure that only trusted and unmodified plugins are loaded.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The language server process should run with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of code injection. However, in the context of a VS Code extension, this might be limited.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to send a custom `"ls/RegisterPlugin"` request over the established language server channel.
    - The extension host must permit filesystem access for module loading.
    - An attacker needs to find a way to trigger the `ls/RegisterPlugin` request and control the `path` parameter. This might require another vulnerability in the extension or VS Code API abuse to indirectly control the request parameters.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/ls/plugin.ts` (and similar locations in other drivers’ LS registration code) and `/code/packages/language-server/src/server.ts`
    - **Function:** `onRegisterPlugin` in `/code/packages/language-server/src/server.ts`

        ```typescript
        private onRegisterPlugin: RequestHandler<typeof RegisterPlugin> = async ({ path: pluginPath } = { path: '' }) => {
          log.info('request to register plugin: "%s"', pluginPath);
          try {
            let plugin = (__non_webpack_require__ || require)(pathResolve(pluginPath)); // Vulnerable line: Unvalidated path used in require
            plugin = plugin.default || plugin;
            await this.registerPlugin(plugin);
            log.debug('plugin %s loaded', pluginPath);
          } catch (error) {
            log.error({ error }, 'Error registering plugin: %O', error);
            return Promise.reject(error);
          }
        }
        ```
        - In `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/ls/plugin.ts` (and similar locations in other drivers’ LS registration code), the supplied path is used directly with a dynamic require call such as
          ```ts
          (__non_webpack_require__ || require)(pluginPath)
          ```
          without validation.
        - **Vulnerability Flow:**
            1. An external attacker attempts to trigger the `ls/RegisterPlugin` request.
            2. The `onRegisterPlugin` function in `server.ts` is called with a `pluginPath` provided in the request.
            3. The `pathResolve(pluginPath)` resolves the provided path.
            4. `(__non_webpack_require__ || require)(pathResolve(pluginPath))` attempts to load and execute the JavaScript file at the resolved path.
            5. If the attacker can manipulate `pluginPath` to point to a malicious file, the code in that file will be executed within the language server's process.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Assume attacker has a way to send custom requests to the extension (while this is not directly possible for external attacker, assume there is another vulnerability or misconfiguration that allows this for testing purposes. In a real scenario, attacker needs to find such entry point).
        - Create a malicious JavaScript file `malicious_plugin.js` with code that performs a benign but detectable action (such as writing a log file).  For example:
          ```javascript
          module.exports = {
            register: (server) => {
              const fs = require('fs');
              fs.writeFileSync('/tmp/pwned_plugin.log', 'Plugin code executed!');
            }
          };
          ```
        - Place `malicious_plugin.js` in a publicly accessible location (e.g., a web server or a location within the user's workspace if that is somehow accessible by the attacker in the context of triggering the request). For this example, let's assume it's placed at `/tmp/malicious_plugin.js` on the victim's machine for simplicity in testing.
    2. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Send an `"ls/RegisterPlugin"` request containing the parameter `{ "path": "/tmp/malicious_plugin.js" }` over the language server channel.
    3. **Verify Exploitation:**
        - Verify that the extension host loads and executes the content of the malicious file (confirm the benign side effect). Check if the file `/tmp/pwned_plugin.log` is created and contains "Plugin code executed!".
    4. **After mitigation:**
        - After applying proper input validation/sandboxing, confirm that the request is either rejected or sanitized.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Information Disclosure via Unsanitized Error Messages in Query Responses

- **Description:**
    - When a query error occurs (for example, from a malformed SQL query), the extension directly returns the raw error message to the client.
    - This raw error message includes potential stack traces, file paths, and connection details.
    - An attacker who deliberately triggers query errors may force the extension to disclose sensitive internal diagnostic information.

- **Impact:**
    - Leakage of internal configuration details, file paths, and stack traces.
    - The attacker could use the exposed details to plan further targeted attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Errors are caught and logged; however, no sanitization is applied before the error is returned to the client.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Strip out sensitive internal diagnostic data from error messages before sending them.**
    - **Replace detailed error messages with a generic message such as “An unexpected error occurred.”**

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to invoke queries (for example, by crafting malformed SQL) that trigger internal errors.
    - The extension must return raw error messages directly in query responses.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In the connection manager’s language server code, when a query fails the error object’s message (and possibly its stack trace) is used verbatim in the response without sanitization.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Action:** Use a SQL client (or simulate one) to send a deliberately malformed query via the extension’s query interface. For example, send `SELECT * FROM non_existent_table;`.
    2. **Verify:** Verify that the returned error message contains sensitive internal details such as stack traces, file paths, or internal connection strings.  Examine the error response from the language server.
    3. **After Mitigation:** After mitigation, confirm that the response now only returns a generic error message, such as "An unexpected error occurred" or a sanitized error message without sensitive details.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Session File Handling Due to Unsanitized Connection Name

- **Description:**
    - The Connection Manager plugin computes the path for the session file by passing the connection’s name (via `getSessionBasename(conn.name)`) to a path–resolution function without adequate sanitization.
    - An attacker who supplies a connection name containing directory traversal characters (e.g., `"../../sensitive"`) can force the computed path to reference a file outside the intended directory.

- **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the local filesystem.
    - Exposure of sensitive files (such as configuration or system files) to an attacker.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No sanitization or allowlisting is applied to connection names during computation of session file paths.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Sanitize the connection name to remove dangerous path traversal sequences.** Remove sequences like `../` and `..\\` from the connection name.
    - **Enforce that the resolved path remains within a predefined safe directory.** After resolving the path, verify that it is still within the intended session directory.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply or inject a connection configuration.
    - The auto–open session file functionality is enabled so that the computed path is used.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/extension.ts`
        ```typescript
        const sessionFilePath = path.resolve(baseFolder.fsPath, getSessionBasename(conn.name));
        ```
        - Because `getSessionBasename(conn.name)` does not filter directory traversal characters, an attacker can manipulate the session file path.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Action:** Configure a connection within SQLTools. Set the connection name to a malicious string (e.g., `"../../secret_config"`). Ensure auto-open session file functionality is enabled in settings.
    2. **Trigger:** Trigger the auto–open session file functionality (for example, by connecting to the database).
    3. **Verify:** Verify that the extension opens (or attempts to open) a file outside the intended session directory. Observe the file path being accessed by the extension.
    4. **After Mitigation:** After implementing sanitization, confirm that such path traversal attacks are blocked, and the extension correctly handles malicious connection names by either sanitizing them or preventing path traversal.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Credential Collision via Insecure Session ID Generation in Authentication Provider

- **Description:**
    - The authentication provider generates session IDs by concatenating the connection’s *serverName* and *userName* with a forward slash (`/`) without sanitizing these fields.
    - An attacker can supply input that includes additional delimiters (e.g., `"target/admin"`) so that different connections end up with the same session ID, leading to a collision.

- **Impact:**
    - Credential confusion or overwriting, where an attacker may override legitimate connection credentials.
    - Loss of credential isolation between connections, potentially enabling unauthorized access or manipulation of connection data.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The session ID is constructed by simple concatenation without any input validation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Sanitize and validate the *serverName* and *userName* fields to remove delimiter characters or encode them safely.** Remove or encode forward slashes (`/`) and potentially other special characters that could lead to collisions.
    - **Use a robust key–derivation mechanism (e.g., salted hashing) to generate unique session identifiers.** Instead of simple concatenation, use a cryptographic hash function with a salt to generate session IDs, ensuring uniqueness and preventing collisions even with similar inputs.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply or modify connection configuration data processed by the authentication provider.
    - The insecure session ID generation is used during creation or retrieval of authentication sessions.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/plugins/authentication-provider/authenticationProvider.ts`
        ```typescript
        public static sessionId(serverName: string, userName: string): string {
            return `${serverName}/${userName}`;
        }
        ```
        - The lack of sanitization means that crafted input can cause session ID collisions.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Action:**
        - Register a benign connection in SQLTools with *serverName* `"target"` and *userName* `"admin"` (yielding session ID `"target/admin"`).
        - Register a malicious connection with *serverName* set to `"target/admin"` (or with injected delimiters like `"target/admin/attacker"`) so that it also produces the same session ID `"target/admin"` or a colliding ID.
    2. **Trigger:** Trigger the authentication process for both connections (e.g., by trying to connect to both databases).
    3. **Verify:** Confirm that they share the same session ID by observing the session management behavior, possibly by checking logs or debugging the extension's session handling. Observe if credentials are being mixed or overwritten between the two connections.
    4. **Post mitigation:** After mitigation, verify that properly sanitized inputs prevent such collisions and that connections with similar or malicious names are correctly isolated with unique session IDs.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Method Invocation via Unvalidated Command in RunCommandRequest Handler

- **Description:**
    - Within the Connection Manager plugin’s language–server code, the request handler for `"connection/RunCommandRequest"` takes a `command` parameter from the requester and directly invokes the corresponding method on a connection instance via dynamic property access.
    - Because no validation or allowlisting is imposed on the `command` parameter, an attacker may supply a method name that was never intended for external use.
    - This can trigger arbitrary method execution on the connection object.

- **Impact:**
    - An attacker may force the connection instance to execute sensitive or unintended operations.
    - This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or corruption of connection state.
    - The integrity of connection operations is compromised if sensitive methods become inadvertently callable externally.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Although errors are logged via a try–catch block, the `command` parameter is not validated before being used in dynamic dispatch.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Implement an allowlist of permitted command names and check that the provided `command` matches one of these approved methods.** Create a list of safe commands that are allowed to be executed via `RunCommandRequest`.
    - **Alternatively, avoid using raw dynamic property access and use an explicit routing or mapping for allowed commands.** Use a switch statement or a command map to route commands to specific handlers instead of directly accessing properties dynamically.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have access to the language–server communication channel (for example, via a compromised client or potentially another vulnerability in the extension).
    - An active connection instance must exist when the request is sent.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/language-server.ts`
        ```typescript
        private runCommandHandler: RequestHandler<typeof RunCommandRequest> = async ({ conn, args, command }) => {
            try {
                const c = await this.getConnectionInstance(conn);
                if (!c) throw 'Connection not found';
                const results: NSDatabase.IResult[] = await c[command](...args);
                await Handlers.QuerySuccess(results);
                return results;
            } catch (e) {
                this.server.notifyError('Execute query error', e);
                throw e;
            }
        };
        ```
        - The supplied `command` is used directly without checking against a safe list.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Action:** Use a language–server testing tool or a crafted client to send a `"connection/RunCommandRequest"` to the SQLTools language server. Set the `command` value to a sensitive or internal method name of the connection object (e.g., `"close"`, `"destroy"`, or any method not intended for external calls). Supply valid `conn` and `args` as needed for the chosen command.
    2. **Verify:** Observe that the corresponding method on the connection instance is invoked. For example, if you use `"close"`, verify that the connection is unexpectedly closed. Monitor the extension's behavior to confirm unintended actions are triggered by the command.
    3. **After Mitigation:** After mitigation with an allowlist or command mapping, confirm that such requests with unapproved command names are rejected, and only requests with allowed commands are processed correctly.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Credential Disclosure via Unprotected GetConnectionPasswordRequest Handler

- **Description:**
    - The language–server handler for `"connection/GetConnectionPasswordRequest"` fetches the connection’s password by calling `c.getPassword()` and returns it directly.
    - This handler does not verify whether the requester is authorized to receive such sensitive information, nor does it sanitize the output.

- **Impact:**
    - An attacker capable of sending a crafted request to the language server can retrieve stored database passwords or other sensitive authentication data.
    - Exposure of these credentials can lead to unauthorized database access and compromise of sensitive systems.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Although error handling is present, no access restrictions are applied to the return value of `c.getPassword()`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Implement proper authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only trusted components can request password data.** Before returning the password, verify that the request originates from a trusted source or a component with the necessary permissions.
    - **Consider using secure authentication tokens or indirect means rather than exposing plaintext credentials.** Instead of directly retrieving and sending the password, explore alternative authentication mechanisms that do not require exposing the raw password, such as using secure tokens or session-based authentication.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be capable of sending a `"connection/GetConnectionPasswordRequest"` with a valid connection object over the language server channel.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/plugins/connection-manager/language-server.ts`
        ```typescript
        private GetConnectionPasswordRequestHandler: RequestHandler<typeof GetConnectionPasswordRequest> = async ({ conn }): Promise<string> => {
            if (!conn) {
                return undefined;
            }
            const c = await this.getConnectionInstance(conn);
            if (c) {
                return c.getPassword();
            }
            return null;
        };
        ```
        - No authorization check is performed before returning the password.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Action:** Using a language–server testing tool or a crafted client, send a `"connection/GetConnectionPasswordRequest"` to the SQLTools language server. Include a valid connection configuration (`conn`) in the request.
    2. **Verify:** Verify that the response from the language server returns the connection’s raw password in plaintext. Observe the response content.
    3. **After Mitigation:** After applying access control measures, confirm that such a request is either rejected with an authorization error or sanitized by not returning the password in the response.

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in SQLite Driver Queries via Unsanitized Input

- **Description:**
    - The SQLite driver constructs SQL queries using ES6–tagged template literals (via a helper called `queryFactory`) that interpolate dynamic values from connection parameters or query options without proper sanitization.
    - Input such as table names or search strings (supplied via properties like `p.label` or `p.search`) is inserted directly into SQL query strings.
    - An attacker able to control these inputs can inject arbitrary SQL into the queries executed against the local SQLite database.

- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can modify the intended SQL queries to execute additional or alternate SQL commands.
    - This could lead to unauthorized data disclosure, data modification, or even deletion of database objects, thereby compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the stored data.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No input sanitization or parameterized query handling is applied; the code relies solely on simple string interpolation.
    - The `escapeTableName` function in `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts` simply wraps the table name in double quotes without escaping any embedded quotes or special characters, which is insufficient.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of direct interpolation.** Modify the query construction to use parameterized queries, which are supported by SQLite and other database systems.
    - **Implement proper escaping or validation for all user–supplied data inserted into SQL query strings.** If parameterization is not fully feasible, implement robust escaping for all user inputs, including table names and search strings, to prevent SQL injection. For table names, proper escaping should handle embedded quotes and special characters to avoid breaking out of the identifier context. For search strings used in `LIKE` clauses, use appropriate escaping or dedicated functions to sanitize the input for safe use in `LIKE` patterns.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply malicious input through connection configuration or via language server query parameters (for example, by providing a crafted table name or search string).
    - The extension must be configured to use the SQLite driver.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **File:** `/code/packages/driver.sqlite/src/ls/queries.ts`
        - Several query templates are defined that interpolate unsanitized values:
            - The `describeTable` query is built as:
              ```typescript
              const describeTable: IBaseQueries['describeTable'] = queryFactory`
                SELECT C.*
                FROM pragma_table_info('${p => p.label}') AS C
                ORDER BY C.cid ASC
              `;
              ```
            - The helper function `escapeTableName` is defined as:
              ```typescript
              function escapeTableName(table: Partial<NSDatabase.ITable>) {
                return `"${table.label || table.toString()}"`;
              }
              ```
              This function simply wraps the table name in double quotes without escaping any embedded quotes or special characters.
            - Similar unsanitized interpolation is present in the `searchTables` and `searchColumns` queries where `p.search.toLowerCase()` is inserted directly into a LIKE clause.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Action:** Configure a connection for the SQLite driver in SQLTools using a malicious table name in the database itself. For example, create a SQLite database and within it, create a table with a name like `foo"; DROP TABLE users; --`. Alternatively, attempt to inject SQL via search terms in table or column search functionality.
        - **Test Case 1: Table Name Injection:**
            - Create a SQLite database and a table named `foo"; DROP TABLE users; --`.
            - Connect to this database using SQLTools.
            - Attempt to describe this table using SQLTools' table explorer or table description feature.
        - **Test Case 2: Search Injection:**
            - Use the table or column search feature in SQLTools with a search term crafted for SQL injection, like `%'; DROP TABLE users; --`.
    2. **Verify:**
        - **Test Case 1:** Verify that when describing the table, the generated SQL query includes the injected SQL command (`DROP TABLE users;`) and that the SQLite database executes the unintended command (for example, dropping the `users` table if it exists in your test database). Observe database state for unintended changes.
        - **Test Case 2:** Verify if the injected SQL in the search term is executed. This might manifest as database errors if the injected SQL is invalid in the search context, or as unintended data modifications if the injected SQL is crafted to perform data manipulation.
    3. **After Mitigation:** After applying proper mitigations (such as parameterization or proper escaping), confirm that the malicious input is neutralized and the query executes as intended without any injection in both table description and search scenarios.
