## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Application Misuse of Node-Redis:](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node___high-risk_path__exploit_application_misuse_of_node-redis.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a broad category encompassing vulnerabilities arising from how developers use the `node-redis` library within their application code. It's not a vulnerability in `node-redis` itself, but rather in the application's implementation.
*   **Consequences:** Can lead to critical vulnerabilities like Redis command injection, data breaches, and denial of service, depending on the specific misuse.
*   **Mitigations:** Focus on secure coding practices, input validation, secure configuration, and regular security reviews of application code interacting with `node-redis`.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Command Construction:](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node___high-risk_path__insecure_command_construction.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Developers incorrectly construct Redis commands, often by directly embedding user-controlled input into the command string. This is the root cause of Redis command injection.
*   **Consequences:**  Redis Command Injection - Attackers can execute arbitrary Redis commands, potentially leading to data manipulation, data deletion, information disclosure, or even code execution on the Redis server (in rare cases, depending on Redis configuration and available modules).
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION] Always use parameterized commands or command builders provided by `node-redis`**.  These methods properly escape and handle user input, preventing injection.
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION] Never use string interpolation or concatenation to build Redis commands with user input.**
    *   Sanitize and validate user input before using it in any Redis operation, even with parameterized commands, to prevent unexpected behavior or logic flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] String Interpolation in Redis Commands:](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node___high-risk_path__string_interpolation_in_redis_commands.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically using string interpolation (e.g., template literals, string formatting) to embed user input directly into Redis command strings.
*   **Consequences:** Direct Redis Command Injection.  Attackers can inject malicious Redis commands by crafting their input to break out of the intended command structure and insert their own commands.
*   **Example:**
    ```javascript
    // VULNERABLE CODE - DO NOT USE
    const key = req.query.key; // User-controlled input
    const redisCommand = `GET ${key}`; // String interpolation
    redisClient.sendCommand(redisCommand);
    ```
    An attacker could provide `key` as `vulnerable_key\r\nFLUSHALL\r\n` to inject a `FLUSHALL` command after the `GET` command.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]  Absolutely avoid string interpolation for Redis command construction.**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]  Use `node-redis`'s API for command building, such as `redisClient.get(key)`, `redisClient.set(key, value)`, or command chaining/builders.**

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Connection Configuration:](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node___high-risk_path__insecure_connection_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Misconfiguring the Redis server or the connection between the application and Redis, leading to unauthorized access or insecure communication.
*   **Consequences:**  Unauthorized access to Redis data, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential for further exploitation of the application or infrastructure.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION] Use strong, randomly generated passwords for Redis authentication.**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION] Enable and enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between the application and Redis.**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION] Ensure Redis is not directly exposed to the public internet.** Use firewalls to restrict access to Redis only from trusted application servers.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate the Redis server within a secure network zone.
    *   Regularly audit Redis server configuration for security best practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak or Default Redis Password:](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical_node___high-risk_path__weak_or_default_redis_password.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using a weak, easily guessable, or default password for Redis authentication, or disabling authentication entirely.
*   **Consequences:**  Unauthorized access to the Redis server. Attackers can directly connect to Redis, bypass application security, and execute arbitrary Redis commands.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]  Set a strong, randomly generated password for Redis using the `requirepass` configuration directive in `redis.conf`.**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]  Rotate Redis passwords regularly.**
    *   Never use default passwords or disable authentication in production environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Redis Exposed to Public Network:](./attack_tree_paths/6___critical_node___high-risk_path__redis_exposed_to_public_network.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Configuring the Redis server to listen on a public IP address without proper firewall rules or access controls.
*   **Consequences:**  Direct access to the Redis server from the internet. Attackers can attempt to exploit weak passwords, unauthenticated access, or known Redis vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]  Ensure Redis is only listening on a private IP address (e.g., `bind 127.0.0.1` or a private network IP).**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]  Use firewalls to restrict network access to the Redis port (default 6379) only from trusted application servers.**
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate Redis within a private network.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Information Disclosure via Redis:](./attack_tree_paths/7___critical_node___high-risk_path__information_disclosure_via_redis.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Storing sensitive data in Redis without proper encryption or access controls, making it vulnerable to disclosure if Redis is compromised.
*   **Consequences:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive user information, API keys, credentials, or other confidential data.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION] Encrypt sensitive data before storing it in Redis.** Consider application-level encryption or Redis's built-in encryption features (if suitable).
    *   Minimize the storage of sensitive data in Redis if possible.
    *   Implement proper access controls within Redis (using ACLs in Redis 6+ if applicable) to restrict access to sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH] Storing Sensitive Data in Redis Unencrypted:](./attack_tree_paths/8___critical_node___high-risk_path__storing_sensitive_data_in_redis_unencrypted.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically storing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) in Redis in plain text, without encryption.
*   **Consequences:**  If an attacker gains access to Redis (through any of the vulnerabilities outlined above), they can directly read and exfiltrate sensitive data, leading to a data breach.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]  Never store sensitive data in Redis without encryption.**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]  Encrypt sensitive data at the application level before storing it in Redis.**
    *   Consider using a dedicated secrets management system for highly sensitive credentials instead of storing them in Redis.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. [CRITICAL NODE] Dependency Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/9___critical_node__dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies used by `node-redis`.
*   **Consequences:**  Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts, including code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION] Regularly audit `node-redis` dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.**
    *   **[CRITICAL MITIGATION] Promptly update `node-redis` and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.**
    *   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to continuously monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   Stay informed about security advisories related to `node-redis` and its dependencies.
