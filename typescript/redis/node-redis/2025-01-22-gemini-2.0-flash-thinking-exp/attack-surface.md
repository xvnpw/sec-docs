# Attack Surface Analysis for redis/node-redis

## Attack Surface: [Redis Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/redis_command_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious Redis commands by manipulating user-controlled input that is directly incorporated into Redis commands without proper sanitization or parameterization. This is a direct consequence of how developers use `node-redis` to construct and send commands.

**Node-Redis Contribution:** `node-redis` provides the API to send commands to Redis.  Developers using string concatenation or template literals with user input to build commands, instead of using `node-redis`'s parameterized commands, directly create this vulnerability.

**Example:** An application uses `client.set('user:' + userId + ':name', userName)` where `userId` is directly from user input. An attacker could provide `userId` as `1; FLUSHALL;` leading to `client.set('user:1; FLUSHALL;:name', userName)`, which, while not directly executing `FLUSHALL` due to the key name, demonstrates the principle. More dangerous injections are possible in other command contexts.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, modification, deletion, data corruption, denial of service, potential server-side command execution if Redis modules are enabled and vulnerable.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly Use Parameterized Commands in Node-Redis:**  Always utilize `node-redis`'s parameterized command feature (using `?` or `$`). This is the primary defense, ensuring user input is treated as data values, not command parts by `node-redis` when sending to Redis.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):** While parameterization is crucial, still validate and sanitize user-provided input before using it in Redis commands as a secondary defense layer. This can prevent unexpected data types or formats that might cause issues even with parameterization.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit the application's `node-redis` connections to send malicious or excessive requests that overwhelm the Redis server, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability. `node-redis`'s connection management and command sending are the pathways for this attack.

**Node-Redis Contribution:** `node-redis` manages connections and sends commands.  Application logic that, through `node-redis`, triggers expensive Redis operations based on user input, or allows unmanaged/excessive connections via `node-redis`, can be exploited for DoS.

**Example:** An attacker repeatedly triggers an application feature that, using `node-redis`, executes `KEYS *` based on user-provided patterns, causing Redis to consume excessive CPU and memory, slowing down or crashing the server.  Or, an attacker opens a large number of connections via `node-redis` without proper connection pooling or limits, exhausting Redis's connection capacity.

**Impact:** Application downtime, performance degradation, service unavailability, resource exhaustion on the Redis server.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Rate Limiting at Application Level (Controlling Node-Redis Usage):** Implement rate limiting in the application to restrict the number of requests that trigger Redis operations via `node-redis` from a single source within a given timeframe.
*   **Connection Pooling and Limits in Node-Redis:** Utilize `node-redis`'s connection pooling features effectively and configure connection limits to prevent exhaustion of Redis server resources due to excessive connections initiated by the application through `node-redis`.
*   **Command Whitelisting/Blacklisting via Redis ACLs (Server-Side Control):** While not directly in `node-redis`, using Redis ACLs to restrict the commands the application's Redis user can execute (preventing `KEYS *`, `FLUSHALL` etc.) limits the impact of potentially abusive commands sent via `node-redis`.
*   **Timeout Configurations in Node-Redis:** Configure appropriate timeouts in `node-redis` for connection, command execution, and socket operations to prevent indefinite blocking and resource holding by `node-redis` clients.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exposure through Unsecured Redis Connection](./attack_surfaces/data_exposure_through_unsecured_redis_connection.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data transmitted between `node-redis` and Redis is intercepted because the connection is not properly secured. This is directly related to how developers configure the connection using `node-redis`.

**Node-Redis Contribution:** `node-redis` is responsible for establishing and managing the connection to Redis.  If developers fail to configure TLS/SSL encryption or strong authentication within `node-redis`'s connection options, the communication channel remains vulnerable.

**Example:** Connecting `node-redis` to a Redis server without setting the `tls` option in the `node-redis` client configuration, especially when communicating over a network that is not fully trusted. This allows network attackers to eavesdrop on the communication initiated and managed by `node-redis`.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data (user credentials, personal information, application secrets) transmitted to or from Redis via `node-redis`.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Mandatory TLS/SSL Encryption in Node-Redis Configuration:**  Always configure `node-redis` to connect to Redis using TLS/SSL by setting the `tls` option in the client configuration. This ensures all communication managed by `node-redis` is encrypted.
*   **Strong Authentication Configuration in Node-Redis:**  Use strong passwords or Redis ACLs for authentication and configure these credentials within the `node-redis` connection options.  `node-redis` provides the mechanism to pass these credentials to Redis during connection.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Vulnerabilities in `node-redis` Library](./attack_surfaces/client-side_vulnerabilities_in__node-redis__library.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities within the `node-redis` library itself or its dependencies are exploited. This is a direct risk of using `node-redis` as a dependency in the application.

**Node-Redis Contribution:** The application directly includes and relies on `node-redis`. Any vulnerability in `node-redis`'s code or its dependencies becomes a vulnerability in the application itself, exploitable through the application's use of `node-redis`.

**Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in a dependency used by `node-redis`. An attacker exploits this vulnerability by targeting the application that uses `node-redis`, leveraging the vulnerable dependency within the `node-redis` library.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability within `node-redis` or its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical to High** (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Proactive and Regular Updates of Node-Redis:**  Keep `node-redis` updated to the latest stable version. This is crucial to patch known vulnerabilities in `node-redis` itself and its dependencies.
*   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) in the development pipeline to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in `node-redis` and its dependencies.
*   **Security Monitoring and Awareness:** Subscribe to security advisories and monitor vulnerability databases related to `node-redis` and its ecosystem to stay informed about potential threats and apply patches promptly.

## Attack Surface: [Lua Scripting Vulnerabilities (if used via Node-Redis)](./attack_surfaces/lua_scripting_vulnerabilities__if_used_via_node-redis_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced through the use of Redis Lua scripting when executed via `node-redis`. This includes script injection and logic flaws in scripts executed through `node-redis`.

**Node-Redis Contribution:** `node-redis` provides the `eval` and `evalsha` commands, which are the primary way to execute Lua scripts on the Redis server from a Node.js application. Improper script construction or usage within `node-redis` directly leads to these vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Constructing Lua scripts dynamically in the application and then executing them using `node-redis`'s `eval` command, by concatenating user input without proper escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious Lua code into the script executed by `node-redis`.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access, denial of service, potential for complex attacks depending on the capabilities of the injected Lua code and the application's logic.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Parameterize Lua Scripts Executed via Node-Redis:**  Use parameterized Lua scripts and pass user input as arguments to the script using `node-redis`'s `eval` command with arguments.  Avoid string concatenation to build scripts dynamically within the application code that uses `node-redis`.
*   **Thorough Security Review and Testing of Lua Scripts:**  Conduct rigorous security reviews and testing of all Lua scripts before deploying them to production. This includes static analysis and dynamic testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and logic flaws in scripts executed via `node-redis`.
*   **Resource Limits for Lua Scripts (Redis Configuration):** Configure Redis's `lua-time-limit` to limit the execution time of Lua scripts. While not directly in `node-redis`, this server-side setting mitigates the impact of resource-intensive scripts potentially triggered via `node-redis`.
