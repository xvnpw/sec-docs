### 4. Deep Analysis: String Interpolation in Redis Commands

#### 4.1. Vulnerability Description

The "String Interpolation in Redis Commands" vulnerability arises when developers use string interpolation (or similar string formatting techniques) to dynamically construct Redis commands by directly embedding user-controlled input into the command string. This practice is inherently dangerous because it allows attackers to manipulate the structure and content of the Redis command being executed.

Redis commands are text-based and follow a specific protocol.  Crucially, commands and arguments are separated by whitespace and newline characters (`\r\n`).  If user input is directly interpolated without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can inject special characters like `\r\n` to break out of the intended command and inject arbitrary Redis commands.

#### 4.2. Technical Details and Exploitation

**How it Works:**

1.  **User Input:** The application receives user input, often from HTTP requests (query parameters, POST data), web sockets, or other external sources.
2.  **Vulnerable String Interpolation:** This user input is directly embedded into a string that is intended to be a Redis command.  Commonly, template literals (backticks `` ` ``) or string concatenation are used in JavaScript for this purpose.
3.  **`sendCommand()` Execution:** The application uses `redisClient.sendCommand(redisCommand)` to execute the constructed string as a Redis command.
4.  **Command Injection:** If the user input contains Redis protocol control characters (specifically `\r\n`), the Redis server interprets these characters as command separators. This allows the attacker to inject additional, malicious commands after the intended command.

**Exploitation Example (Detailed Breakdown of the provided example):**

```javascript
// VULNERABLE CODE - DO NOT USE
const key = req.query.key; // User-controlled input from query parameter 'key'
const redisCommand = `GET ${key}`; // String interpolation - vulnerable point
redisClient.sendCommand(redisCommand);
```

**Attack Scenario:**

1.  **Attacker crafts malicious input:**  Instead of providing a simple key like `mykey`, the attacker crafts the following input for the `key` query parameter:

    ```
    vulnerable_key\r\nFLUSHALL\r\n
    ```

    *   `vulnerable_key`:  This part might be intended as the actual key to retrieve.
    *   `\r\n`:  This is a newline character in Redis protocol, signaling the end of the current command and the start of a new one.
    *   `FLUSHALL`: This is a destructive Redis command that deletes *all* data from *all* Redis databases.
    *   `\r\n`: Another newline to terminate the `FLUSHALL` command.

2.  **Vulnerable code interpolates the input:** The code constructs the `redisCommand` string:

    ```
    `GET vulnerable_key\r\nFLUSHALL\r\n`
    ```

3.  **`sendCommand()` executes the injected commands:**  `redisClient.sendCommand()` sends this string to the Redis server. The Redis server parses it as *two* separate commands:

    *   `GET vulnerable_key`
    *   `FLUSHALL`

4.  **Consequences:** The Redis server first attempts to execute `GET vulnerable_key` (which might succeed or fail depending on the key's existence).  Crucially, it then executes `FLUSHALL`, resulting in the complete data loss in the Redis instance.

**Beyond `FLUSHALL`:**

Attackers can inject a wide range of malicious commands, including:

*   **`SET malicious_key malicious_value`:**  Injecting arbitrary data into Redis.
*   **`CONFIG GET *` or `CONFIG SET ...`:**  Retrieving sensitive configuration information or modifying Redis settings (potentially leading to further vulnerabilities).
*   **`EVAL "os.execute('malicious_script.sh')"` (if `EVAL` is enabled and Lua scripting is allowed):**  Executing arbitrary code on the Redis server (highly dangerous).
*   **`SLOWLOG GET` or `CLIENT LIST`:**  Gathering information about Redis operations and connected clients for reconnaissance.

#### 4.3. Impact and Severity

The impact of successful Redis command injection via string interpolation can be **critical** and **high-risk**.  The severity depends on the permissions of the Redis user and the commands that can be injected, but potential consequences include:

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data stored in Redis using commands like `GET`, `HGETALL`, `SMEMBERS`, etc.
*   **Data Manipulation/Corruption:** Attackers can modify or delete data using commands like `SET`, `DEL`, `FLUSHDB`, `FLUSHALL`, leading to application malfunction or data integrity issues.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Commands like `FLUSHALL` or resource-intensive operations can cause data loss or disrupt application availability.
*   **Privilege Escalation (in some scenarios):** If Redis is configured with weak authentication or if the application's Redis user has excessive permissions, attackers might be able to escalate privileges within the Redis system or even the underlying server (especially if Lua scripting is enabled and vulnerable).
*   **Lateral Movement (in complex environments):** In compromised environments, successful Redis injection could be a stepping stone for lateral movement to other systems if Redis is used for inter-service communication or shared state.

**Severity Rating:** **CRITICAL**.  Due to the potential for complete data loss, data breaches, and system compromise, this vulnerability is considered critical.

#### 4.4. Real-world Examples and Scenarios

While specific public CVEs directly attributed to string interpolation in `node-redis` might be less common (as it's often a developer coding error rather than a library vulnerability), the underlying principle of command injection is well-documented and exploited across various technologies.

**Realistic Scenarios:**

*   **Caching Layer Vulnerability:** An application uses Redis as a caching layer. User input intended to retrieve cached data is interpolated into a `GET` command. Attackers exploit this to inject `FLUSHDB` and clear the entire cache, potentially causing performance degradation and application instability.
*   **Session Management Bypass:** An application stores session data in Redis.  If session IDs or user identifiers are interpolated into Redis commands for session retrieval, attackers could inject commands to manipulate or invalidate sessions, potentially leading to unauthorized access or session hijacking.
*   **Rate Limiting Bypass:**  If Redis is used for rate limiting and the rate limit keys are constructed using string interpolation with user input, attackers could inject commands to bypass rate limits and perform actions at an uncontrolled rate.
*   **Internal API Exploitation:** In microservice architectures, if internal APIs use Redis for communication and command construction involves string interpolation, a compromised service could exploit this vulnerability to inject commands into other services via Redis.

#### 4.5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

The core mitigation is to **absolutely avoid string interpolation or any form of direct string manipulation when constructing Redis commands with user-controlled input.**  `node-redis` provides robust and secure APIs for building commands that should be used instead.

**4.5.1. [CRITICAL MITIGATION] Avoid String Interpolation:**

*   **Never use template literals (`` ` ``), string concatenation (`+`), or `String.format()` style functions to build Redis commands with user input.** This is the most fundamental and critical mitigation.

**4.5.2. [CRITICAL MITIGATION] Utilize `node-redis`'s API for Command Building:**

`node-redis` offers several secure ways to construct commands:

*   **Dedicated Command Methods:**  Use specific methods like `redisClient.get(key)`, `redisClient.set(key, value)`, `redisClient.hGet(hash, key)`, etc. These methods handle argument escaping and command construction securely.

    ```javascript
    // SECURE EXAMPLE - Using dedicated methods
    const key = req.query.key;
    redisClient.get(key, (err, reply) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error("Error fetching key:", err);
            // Handle error
        } else {
            console.log("Value:", reply);
            // Process reply
        }
    });
    ```

*   **Command Chaining/Builders:**  `node-redis` supports command chaining for more complex operations. This approach also ensures secure command construction.

    ```javascript
    // SECURE EXAMPLE - Command Chaining
    const userId = req.params.userId;
    const userData = {
        name: req.body.name,
        email: req.body.email
    };

    redisClient
        .multi()
        .hmset(`user:${userId}`, userData)
        .expire(`user:${userId}`, 3600) // Set expiration
        .exec((err, replies) => {
            if (err) {
                console.error("Error saving user data:", err);
                // Handle error
            } else {
                console.log("User data saved successfully:", replies);
                // Process replies
            }
        });
    ```

*   **Prepared Statements (Conceptually - not directly in `node-redis` but similar principle):** While `node-redis` doesn't have explicit prepared statements in the SQL sense, the dedicated command methods and command chaining effectively achieve the same goal by separating command structure from user-provided data.

**4.5.3. Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth - but not a primary mitigation for command injection in this context):**

*   While **not a replacement** for avoiding string interpolation, input validation and sanitization can act as a defense-in-depth measure.
*   **Validate user input:**  Ensure that user input conforms to expected formats and character sets. For example, if a key is expected to be alphanumeric, validate that it only contains alphanumeric characters.
*   **Sanitize/Escape (with extreme caution and only if absolutely necessary and you understand Redis protocol escaping - generally discouraged):**  Attempting to manually escape special characters in user input for Redis commands is **highly complex and error-prone**.  It is generally **strongly discouraged** as it's easy to miss edge cases and introduce new vulnerabilities.  **Rely on `node-redis`'s API instead.**

**4.5.4. Principle of Least Privilege for Redis User:**

*   Configure the Redis user that the application uses with the **minimum necessary permissions**.  Avoid granting `ALL` permissions or overly broad access.
*   Restrict the set of commands the Redis user can execute to only those required by the application.  Use Redis ACLs (Access Control Lists) if available in your Redis version to enforce fine-grained permissions.

#### 4.6. Testing and Detection

**4.6.1. Code Review:**

*   **Manual Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the codebase, specifically looking for instances where `redisClient.sendCommand()` is used and where Redis commands are constructed using string interpolation or string manipulation with user input.
*   **Automated Code Scanning/Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools that can detect potential code patterns indicative of string interpolation in Redis command construction.  Custom rules might be needed to specifically target `node-redis` and `sendCommand()`.

**4.6.2. Dynamic Testing and Penetration Testing:**

*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Specifically test for Redis command injection vulnerabilities by crafting malicious input payloads (like the `\r\nFLUSHALL\r\n` example) and observing the Redis server's behavior and application responses.
*   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to automatically generate a wide range of input payloads, including those designed to exploit command injection, and monitor for unexpected Redis server behavior or application errors.

**4.6.3. Runtime Detection and Monitoring:**

*   **Redis Slowlog Monitoring:**  Monitor the Redis slowlog for unusual or suspicious commands being executed.  Injected commands might appear in the slowlog if they are resource-intensive or take longer than expected.
*   **Redis Command Auditing (if available):**  If your Redis version supports command auditing, enable it to log all commands executed against the Redis server. Analyze these logs for suspicious command patterns or unexpected commands.
*   **Application Logging:**  Log the Redis commands being sent by the application (in a secure manner, avoiding logging sensitive data directly in commands).  This can help in debugging and identifying unexpected command execution patterns.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Redis logs and application logs into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and anomaly detection.

#### 4.7. Prevention in Development Lifecycle

*   **Secure Coding Training:**  Educate developers about the risks of command injection vulnerabilities, specifically in the context of Redis and `node-redis`. Emphasize the importance of using secure command construction methods.
*   **Code Review Process:**  Implement mandatory code reviews for all code changes, with a focus on security aspects, including Redis command construction.
*   **Static Analysis Integration:**  Integrate static analysis tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
*   **Security Testing in CI/CD:**  Incorporate automated security testing (including penetration testing and fuzzing) into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously assess the application's security posture.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Keep `node-redis` and other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Security Champions:**  Designate security champions within the development team to promote secure coding practices and act as security advocates.
