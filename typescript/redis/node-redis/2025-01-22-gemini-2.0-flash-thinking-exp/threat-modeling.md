# Threat Model Analysis for redis/node-redis

## Threat: [Redis Command Injection](./threats/redis_command_injection.md)

* **Description:**  When using `node-redis`, if user-provided input is not properly sanitized and is directly incorporated into Redis commands (e.g., through string concatenation or using methods like `redisClient.eval()` without careful input handling), an attacker can inject malicious Redis commands. This allows them to execute commands beyond the intended application logic by manipulating the command structure sent through `node-redis`.
    * **Impact:**
        * Data breaches: Attackers can read or modify sensitive data stored in Redis by executing commands like `GET`, `HGETALL`, `SET`, `DEL`, etc.
        * Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers can crash or overload the Redis server by injecting commands that consume excessive resources or cause server errors, impacting application availability.
        * Code Execution (in specific scenarios): If Redis Lua scripting is enabled, attackers might be able to inject malicious Lua scripts via `redisClient.eval()` and potentially achieve code execution on the Redis server.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `node-redis` client: Vulnerable command construction patterns within application code using `node-redis` methods like `redisClient.eval()`, `redisClient.sendCommand()`, and manual command string building.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Prioritize parameterized command construction:**  Avoid string concatenation of user input directly into Redis commands when using `node-redis`.  Focus on separating user data from the command structure as much as possible.
        * **Strict input validation and sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before incorporating them into Redis commands within your `node-redis` application code.
        * **Implement Redis ACLs:**  Utilize Redis ACLs to restrict the commands that the `node-redis` client's configured user can execute. This limits the potential damage even if command injection vulnerabilities exist in the application.
        * **Exercise extreme caution with `eval`:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of `redisClient.eval()`. If absolutely necessary, rigorously control the Lua scripts and ensure user input is never directly injected into the script without robust sanitization and validation.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Redis Authentication via `node-redis` Configuration](./threats/weak_or_missing_redis_authentication_via__node-redis__configuration.md)

* **Description:** If the `node-redis` client is not configured with proper authentication credentials (password and/or username for ACLs) when connecting to a Redis server that *requires* authentication, or if the Redis server itself is misconfigured to *not* require authentication when it should, attackers can bypass authentication. This allows unauthorized access to the Redis instance through the `node-redis` client connection.
    * **Impact:**
        * Data breaches: Unauthorized access to read and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in Redis, potentially leading to significant data loss and privacy violations.
        * Data manipulation: Unauthorized modification or deletion of critical application data within Redis, causing application malfunction or data integrity issues.
        * Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers can overload or crash the Redis server, or manipulate data to disrupt application functionality, leading to application downtime and service disruption.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `node-redis` client configuration: Specifically, the lack of or incorrect authentication options (`password`, `username`) provided during `node-redis` client initialization.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Mandatory Redis Authentication:** Ensure Redis server is configured to require strong authentication using `requirepass` and/or Redis ACLs.
        * **Secure `node-redis` Client Authentication Configuration:**  Always configure the `node-redis` client with the correct and strong authentication credentials (password and username if using ACLs) during client creation.
        * **Secure Credential Management:**  Never hardcode Redis credentials directly in the application code. Utilize secure methods like environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or cloud provider secret managers to store and retrieve Redis credentials for `node-redis` client configuration.
        * **Regularly Review Redis and `node-redis` Configuration:** Periodically review both Redis server and `node-redis` client configurations to ensure authentication is correctly enabled and securely configured.

## Threat: [Insecure `node-redis` Connection (Man-in-the-Middle)](./threats/insecure__node-redis__connection__man-in-the-middle_.md)

* **Description:** If the `node-redis` client is not configured to use TLS/SSL encryption when connecting to the Redis server, all communication between the application and Redis is transmitted in plaintext. Attackers on the network path can intercept this unencrypted traffic, potentially eavesdropping on sensitive data or injecting malicious commands into the communication stream handled by `node-redis`.
    * **Impact:**
        * Data breaches: Interception and theft of sensitive data transmitted between the application and Redis via the unencrypted `node-redis` connection, leading to confidentiality breaches.
        * Data manipulation: Man-in-the-middle attackers can modify commands in transit through the `node-redis` connection, potentially corrupting data or causing unintended actions within Redis.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `node-redis` client configuration: Specifically, the absence of TLS/SSL configuration (`tls` option not enabled or incorrectly configured) in the `node-redis` client setup.
        * Network communication layer: The unencrypted network connection established by `node-redis` to the Redis server.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce TLS/SSL for `node-redis` Connections:**  Always configure the `node-redis` client to use TLS/SSL encryption by enabling and correctly configuring the `tls` option during client creation.
        * **Verify TLS Configuration:** Ensure proper TLS certificate configuration and validation for both the Redis server and the `node-redis` client to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks using invalid or self-signed certificates.
        * **Secure Network Environment:**  Deploy Redis and the application using `node-redis` in a secure network environment and consider network segmentation to minimize the risk of network-level attacks.

## Threat: [Client-Side Vulnerabilities in `node-redis` or Dependencies](./threats/client-side_vulnerabilities_in__node-redis__or_dependencies.md)

* **Description:**  Vulnerabilities present within the `node-redis` library itself or in its dependencies (including transitive dependencies) can be exploited by attackers. These vulnerabilities could range from remote code execution to denial of service, potentially allowing attackers to compromise the application server running `node-redis` or disrupt its functionality. Exploitation would target the application process using `node-redis`.
    * **Impact:**
        * Application compromise: Remote code execution vulnerabilities in `node-redis` or its dependencies could allow attackers to gain complete control of the application server.
        * Data breaches: Attackers could access sensitive data stored within the application's environment or accessible through the compromised application server.
        * Denial of Service (DoS): Vulnerabilities could be exploited to crash the application process or the application server, leading to service disruption.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `node-redis` library: The `node-redis` npm package code itself.
        * `node-redis` dependencies:  Libraries that `node-redis` directly or indirectly depends on.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Maintain Up-to-Date `node-redis` and Dependencies:**  Establish a process for regularly updating `node-redis` and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities as soon as updates are released.
        * **Implement Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools into your development and deployment pipelines to proactively identify and address known vulnerabilities in `node-redis` and its dependency chain.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for `node-redis` and its dependencies from sources like GitHub, npm security advisories, and security mailing lists. Promptly apply recommended patches or workarounds when vulnerabilities are disclosed.
