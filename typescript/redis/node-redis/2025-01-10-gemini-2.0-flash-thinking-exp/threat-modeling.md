# Threat Model Analysis for redis/node-redis

## Threat: [Plaintext Credential Exposure](./threats/plaintext_credential_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to Redis credentials (host, port, password, username) stored insecurely within the application's codebase or configuration files, which are then used by `node-redis` to connect. This could involve directly reading files or exploiting code vulnerabilities that reveal configuration used by the `node-redis` client.

**Impact:** The attacker can directly connect to the Redis server using the exposed credentials, bypassing the application's access controls. They can read, modify, or delete any data stored in Redis, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `node-redis` client configuration (specifically how connection options are provided).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store Redis credentials in environment variables.
* Utilize secure configuration management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
* Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code.
* Implement proper access controls on configuration files.
* Regularly scan code and configuration for exposed secrets.

## Threat: [Connection String Injection](./threats/connection_string_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates user input or other application data that is directly used to construct the `node-redis` connection string passed to the client initialization. This could involve injecting malicious hostnames, ports, or connection options that `node-redis` will use.

**Impact:** The `node-redis` client might connect to a malicious Redis server controlled by the attacker, potentially leaking sensitive data sent by the application or allowing the attacker to inject commands back into the application's Redis context.

**Affected Component:** `node-redis` client initialization and connection logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never directly use user input to construct connection strings.
* Sanitize and validate any input that influences connection parameters before passing them to the `node-redis` client.
* Use a predefined, secure configuration for Redis connections.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./threats/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious Redis commands by manipulating user input that is directly used in methods like `client.sendCommand()` or when constructing command arguments passed to `node-redis` client methods without proper sanitization. `node-redis` will then execute these crafted commands on the Redis server.

**Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary Redis commands through the `node-redis` client, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting data, executing Lua scripts, or even performing actions that could lead to denial of service on the Redis server.

**Affected Component:** `client.sendCommand()` and any code constructing command arguments passed to `node-redis` client methods.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using `client.sendCommand()` with user-controlled input.
* Utilize the specific command methods provided by `node-redis` (e.g., `client.set()`, `client.get()`) which handle argument escaping.
* If dynamic command construction is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent injection before passing arguments to `node-redis` methods.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Redis Connection](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_redis_connection.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network communication between the `node-redis` client and the Redis server, potentially eavesdropping on sensitive data being sent or received by `node-redis` or manipulating commands in transit.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data exchanged between the application and Redis through `node-redis` or manipulation of data, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:** Network communication initiated by the `node-redis` client.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use TLS/SSL encryption for communication with the Redis server. Configure the `node-redis` client to enforce secure connections using the appropriate options.
* Ensure the Redis server is configured to accept only secure connections.
