## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Connection Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_connection_parameters.md)

If the application dynamically constructs or uses connection strings without proper validation, an attacker might be able to inject malicious parameters. This could redirect the application to connect to a rogue Redis server controlled by the attacker, allowing them to intercept data or manipulate application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsanitized User Input in Redis Commands](./attack_tree_paths/unsanitized_user_input_in_redis_commands.md)

This path highlights the danger of directly embedding user-provided data into Redis commands without proper sanitization. Attackers can inject malicious Redis commands within the user input, leading to the execution of unintended operations on the Redis server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Arbitrary Redis Commands](./attack_tree_paths/inject_arbitrary_redis_commands.md)

This is the direct consequence of successful command injection. The attacker can execute any Redis command, granting them significant control over the Redis instance and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using `EVAL` or `SCRIPT LOAD` with Malicious Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/using__eval__or__script_load__with_malicious_scripts.md)

When applications use Redis's scripting capabilities (`EVAL` or `SCRIPT LOAD`) with untrusted input or without proper validation, attackers can inject malicious Lua scripts. These scripts are executed directly on the Redis server, potentially leading to severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Issues (if storing complex objects)](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_issues__if_storing_complex_objects_.md)

This path focuses on the risks associated with storing serialized objects in Redis. If the deserialization process is vulnerable, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, upon deserialization, can trigger remote code execution or other harmful actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Serialized Objects](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_serialized_objects.md)

If the application stores serialized objects in Redis and uses an insecure deserialization process, attackers can inject malicious objects. When these objects are deserialized, they can trigger arbitrary code execution on the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Leakage through Unintended Access](./attack_tree_paths/data_leakage_through_unintended_access.md)

If the Redis instance lacks proper authentication or access controls (like ACLs), attackers who gain network access to the Redis server can directly access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data stored within.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insufficient Access Controls in Redis](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insufficient_access_controls_in_redis.md)

If the Redis instance lacks proper authentication or access controls (like ACLs), attackers who gain network access to the Redis server can directly access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data stored within.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default or Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/default_or_weak_credentials.md)

This path highlights the critical risk of using default or easily guessable passwords for the Redis instance. Attackers can readily exploit this misconfiguration to gain full access to the Redis server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Redis with Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/access_redis_with_default_credentials.md)

This node represents a severe security misconfiguration. If the Redis instance is running with default or weak credentials, attackers can easily gain unauthorized access and control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in node-redis's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_node-redis's_dependencies.md)

This path emphasizes the importance of maintaining up-to-date dependencies. Vulnerabilities in the libraries that `node-redis` relies on can be exploited by attackers to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via node-redis](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_node-redis.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has gained control over the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to `node-redis`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_command_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

This node signifies a critical weakness where the application allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary Redis commands. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and further compromise of the application or the Redis server.
