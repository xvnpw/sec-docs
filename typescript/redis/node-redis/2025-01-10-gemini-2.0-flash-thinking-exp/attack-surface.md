# Attack Surface Analysis for redis/node-redis

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/command_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary Redis commands into the application's interaction with the Redis server.
    * **How Node-Redis Contributes:** `node-redis` provides functions to execute arbitrary Redis commands. If user input or external data is directly embedded into these command strings without proper sanitization or parameterization, `node-redis` becomes the conduit for executing malicious commands on the Redis server.
    * **Example:**
        ```javascript
        const userId = req.query.id; // Potentially malicious input
        client.get(`user:${userId}:profile`, (err, reply) => { ... });
        // Attacker could set id to "1; DEL users; GET user:1:profile"
        ```
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Redis data, potential disruption of service, and if Redis is used for caching or session management, potential application compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use parameterized queries or command builders provided by `node-redis`.
        * Sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into Redis commands.
        * Implement the principle of least privilege for the Redis user used by the application.

## Attack Surface: [Connection String Exposure](./attack_surfaces/connection_string_exposure.md)

* **Description:** The Redis connection string, containing sensitive information like host, port, and password, is exposed.
    * **How Node-Redis Contributes:** The connection string is used to initialize the `node-redis` client. If this string is hardcoded, stored in insecure configuration files, or logged inappropriately, attackers can gain access to it.
    * **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Hardcoded connection string (insecure!)
        const client = redis.createClient({
          host: 'localhost',
          port: 6379,
          password: 'mysecretpassword'
        });
        ```
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Redis server, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data, potentially impacting multiple applications sharing the same Redis instance.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store connection strings securely using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools.
        * Avoid hardcoding connection strings in the application code.
        * Ensure proper access controls and permissions on configuration files containing connection details.
        * Implement robust logging practices that avoid logging sensitive information like connection strings.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_configuration.md)

* **Description:** The connection between the application and the Redis server is not properly secured.
    * **How Node-Redis Contributes:** `node-redis` provides options for configuring the connection, including TLS/SSL. If these options are not configured correctly or are omitted, the connection may be vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Insecure connection (no TLS)
        const client = redis.createClient({
          host: 'remote-redis-server'
        });
        ```
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between the application and Redis, including commands and responses. Potential for attackers to intercept and modify data in transit.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always enable TLS/SSL for connections to remote Redis servers. Configure the `tls` option in `node-redis`.
        * Ensure the Redis server is also configured to require TLS connections.
        * Use strong authentication mechanisms for the Redis server.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in `node-redis` itself or its dependencies.
    * **How Node-Redis Contributes:** As a dependency of the application, any vulnerabilities in `node-redis` or its own dependencies can be exploited by attackers targeting the application.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability in an older version of `node-redis` that allows for remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Can range from denial of service to remote code execution on the application server, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update `node-redis` and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        * Utilize tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        * Implement a process for monitoring security advisories related to `node-redis` and its ecosystem.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection/Manipulation via Insecure Data Handling](./attack_surfaces/data_injectionmanipulation_via_insecure_data_handling.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious data into Redis that will later be processed insecurely by the application.
    * **How Node-Redis Contributes:** `node-redis` is used to retrieve data from Redis. If the application trusts this data implicitly and doesn't sanitize it before using it in further logic or displaying it to users, `node-redis` facilitates the retrieval of this malicious data.
    * **Example:**
        ```javascript
        client.get('user:description', (err, description) => {
          // If description contains malicious HTML/JS
          document.getElementById('description').innerHTML = description; // Potential XSS
        });
        ```
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, data corruption within the application, and potential for further exploitation depending on how the data is used.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate all data retrieved from Redis before using it.
        * Use appropriate encoding and escaping techniques.
        * Treat Redis as an untrusted data source.
