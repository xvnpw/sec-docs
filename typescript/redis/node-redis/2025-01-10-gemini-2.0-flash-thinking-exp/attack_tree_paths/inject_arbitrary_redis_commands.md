## Deep Analysis: Inject Arbitrary Redis Commands (node-redis)

This analysis delves into the "Inject Arbitrary Redis Commands" attack tree path within the context of a Node.js application using the `node-redis` library. This path represents a critical security vulnerability that can have devastating consequences for the application and its data.

**Attack Tree Path:** Inject Arbitrary Redis Commands

**Parent Node:** Successful Command Injection

**Description:** This attack path is the direct result of successfully injecting malicious commands into the Redis server via the `node-redis` client. Once an attacker can control the commands sent to Redis, they gain the ability to execute any valid Redis command, effectively taking control of the Redis instance and its data.

**Detailed Analysis:**

**1. How Command Injection Occurs in `node-redis`:**

The primary vulnerability lies in how developers construct Redis commands using user-supplied data or external input without proper sanitization or parameterization. Here are the common scenarios:

* **String Concatenation/Template Literals:** The most prevalent method. Developers might directly embed user input into the command string.

   ```javascript
   const redis = require('redis');
   const client = redis.createClient();

   app.get('/set/:key/:value', (req, res) => {
     const key = req.params.key;
     const value = req.params.value;
     client.set(`mykey:${key}`, value, (err, reply) => { // Vulnerable!
       if (err) {
         console.error(err);
         return res.status(500).send('Error setting value');
       }
       res.send(`Set key ${key} to ${value}`);
     });
   });
   ```

   In this example, if an attacker provides a malicious `key` like `"foo\r\nDEL mykey:bar\r\n"`, the resulting command sent to Redis would be:

   ```
   SET mykey:foo
   DEL mykey:bar
   ```

   This allows the attacker to delete arbitrary keys.

* **`eval` Command with User-Controlled Lua Scripts:** If the application uses the `eval` command to execute Lua scripts and the script content is influenced by user input, it creates a significant injection point.

   ```javascript
   client.eval(`return redis.call('SET', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])`, 1, userInputKey, userInputValue, (err, reply) => { // Vulnerable if userInputKey or userInputValue are not sanitized
     // ...
   });
   ```

* **`multi` and `pipeline` Commands with Unsafe Construction:** While `multi` and `pipeline` offer performance benefits, if the commands within them are constructed using unsanitized input, they become vectors for injection.

   ```javascript
   const multi = client.multi();
   const userCommand = req.query.command; // Potentially malicious
   multi.set('key1', 'value1');
   multi[userCommand]('some_arg'); // Vulnerable!
   multi.exec((err, replies) => {
     // ...
   });
   ```

**2. Impact of Injecting Arbitrary Redis Commands:**

Successful command injection grants the attacker immense power over the Redis instance. The potential impact is severe and includes:

* **Data Manipulation:**
    * **Data Breaches:** Attackers can use commands like `GET`, `HGETALL`, `SMEMBERS`, etc., to retrieve sensitive data stored in Redis.
    * **Data Corruption:** Commands like `SET`, `DEL`, `FLUSHDB`, `FLUSHALL` can be used to modify or completely erase data.
    * **Data Planting:** Attackers can insert malicious data into Redis, potentially impacting application logic or other connected systems.

* **Authentication Bypass:**
    * If Redis authentication is enabled, attackers might be able to use commands like `AUTH` with known or brute-forced credentials (if exposed elsewhere).
    * In some cases, attackers might be able to manipulate user sessions or authentication tokens stored in Redis.

* **Configuration Changes:**
    * The `CONFIG SET` command allows attackers to modify Redis server settings. They could:
        * Disable authentication (`requirepass ""`).
        * Change the listening port.
        * Modify persistence settings, potentially leading to data loss or denial of service.
        * Load malicious modules (if enabled).

* **Server Information Disclosure:**
    * Commands like `INFO`, `CLIENT LIST` can reveal sensitive information about the Redis server, its configuration, and connected clients, aiding further attacks.

* **Resource Exhaustion/Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * Attackers can use commands that consume significant resources, such as creating extremely large sets or lists, leading to performance degradation or server crashes.
    * Commands like `DEBUG SEGFAULT` (if enabled) can directly crash the Redis server.

* **Lua Script Execution (If `eval` is exploitable):**
    * If the attacker can inject malicious Lua code via the `eval` command, they can execute arbitrary code within the Redis server's context, potentially leading to complete server compromise.

* **Replication Manipulation:**
    * In a replicated setup, attackers might be able to use commands related to replication to disrupt the replication process or even introduce malicious data into replicas.

* **Module Loading (If Enabled):**
    * If Redis modules are enabled, attackers might be able to load malicious modules that provide further attack capabilities.

**3. Example Attack Scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1: Data Breach and Deletion:** An attacker crafts a URL like `/set/user:password/secret\r\nGET user:password\r\nDEL user:password\r\n` against the vulnerable endpoint in the first code example. This would set the password, retrieve it, and then delete it, potentially exposing the password during the process.

* **Scenario 2: Authentication Bypass:** If the application stores user session IDs in Redis, an attacker might try to inject commands to retrieve or modify session data to gain unauthorized access.

* **Scenario 3: Denial of Service:** An attacker could inject a command like `SADD huge_set $(seq 1 1000000)` to create an extremely large set, consuming significant memory and potentially slowing down or crashing the Redis server.

**4. Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing Redis command injection is crucial. Here are key mitigation strategies:

* **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  The most effective defense. `node-redis` provides methods to pass arguments separately from the command string, preventing interpretation of malicious input as commands.

   ```javascript
   client.set('mykey:' + key, value, (err, reply) => { // Still vulnerable
       // ...
   });

   // Correct approach using arguments:
   client.set(['mykey:' + key, value], (err, reply) => { // Safer
       // ...
   });

   // Even better, avoid concatenation in the key if possible:
   client.set(['mykey', key, value], (err, reply) => { // Best practice
       // ...
   });
   ```

   When using commands like `HSET`, `SADD`, etc., pass the key and values as separate arguments in an array.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before using it to construct Redis commands. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:** Allow only known and safe characters.
    * **Blacklisting:**  Disallow potentially dangerous characters like `\r`, `\n`, `;`, etc.
    * **Encoding:**  Properly encode user input to prevent interpretation as command separators.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Configure the Redis user used by the application with the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid granting the application user `ALL` permissions. Restrict access to potentially dangerous commands like `CONFIG`, `FLUSHALL`, `EVAL`, `SCRIPT`, `DEBUG`, etc., if they are not required.

* **Secure Redis Configuration:**
    * **Enable Authentication (`requirepass`):**  Protect the Redis instance with a strong password.
    * **Bind to Specific Interfaces:**  Restrict network access to the Redis server.
    * **Disable Dangerous Commands:** Use the `rename-command` directive in `redis.conf` to rename or disable potentially dangerous commands if they are not needed.
    * **Regular Security Audits:**  Review the application code and Redis configuration for potential vulnerabilities.

* **Dependency Updates:** Keep the `node-redis` library and Node.js up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests before they reach the application, including attempts to inject Redis commands.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct defense against Redis injection, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of other vulnerabilities that might be chained with Redis injection.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Arbitrary Redis Commands" attack path represents a severe security risk in applications using `node-redis`. It highlights the critical importance of secure coding practices, particularly when constructing Redis commands with user-provided data. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this devastating vulnerability and protect their applications and data. The responsibility lies with the developers to prioritize secure coding practices and leverage the safe features provided by the `node-redis` library.
