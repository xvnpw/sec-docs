## Deep Analysis: Using `EVAL` or `SCRIPT LOAD` with Malicious Scripts in `node-redis` Applications

**Attack Tree Path:** Using `EVAL` or `SCRIPT LOAD` with Malicious Scripts

**Severity:** **Critical**

**Affected Technology:** Redis, `node-redis` library

**Introduction:**

This attack path highlights a significant vulnerability stemming from the powerful scripting capabilities offered by Redis through the `EVAL` and `SCRIPT LOAD` commands. When used carelessly, particularly with untrusted input, these features can become a gateway for attackers to execute arbitrary Lua code directly on the Redis server. This analysis delves into the technical details, potential impact, mitigation strategies, and detection methods for this critical security risk within applications utilizing the `node-redis` library.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

Redis allows the execution of Lua scripts directly on the server for performance optimization and complex data manipulation. This is achieved through two primary commands:

* **`EVAL script numkeys key [key ...] arg [arg ...]`:** Executes a Lua script directly, providing access to Redis data and commands within the script.
* **`SCRIPT LOAD script`:** Compiles and caches a Lua script on the Redis server, returning a SHA1 hash of the script. This hash can then be used with the `EVALSHA` command for efficient execution of the cached script.

The vulnerability arises when the `script` argument in either command is constructed using untrusted input without proper sanitization or validation. Attackers can inject malicious Lua code into this argument, which will then be executed with the privileges of the Redis server process.

**How it works in `node-redis`:**

The `node-redis` library provides methods to interact with these commands:

* **`client.eval(script, numkeys, ...keysAndArgs)`:** Directly executes a Lua script.
* **`client.script('LOAD', script, (err, sha) => { ... })`:** Loads a script and provides the SHA hash.
* **`client.evalsha(sha, numkeys, ...keysAndArgs)`:** Executes a loaded script using its SHA hash.

The risk lies in how the `script` argument is constructed and passed to these methods. If application code directly concatenates user input or data from untrusted sources into the script string, it becomes vulnerable to injection.

**Example Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

app.get('/process/:key/:value', (req, res) => {
  const key = req.params.key;
  const value = req.params.value;

  // Vulnerable: Directly incorporating user input into the script
  const script = `redis.call('SET', '${key}', '${value}'); return 'Success';`;

  client.eval(script, 0, (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error("Error executing script:", err);
      return res.status(500).send("Error processing request");
    }
    res.send(`Script executed: ${result}`);
  });
});
```

In this example, an attacker could craft a malicious URL like `/process/mykey/evil'); redis.call('FLUSHALL'); return('`. This would result in the following script being executed:

```lua
redis.call('SET', 'mykey', 'evil'); redis.call('FLUSHALL'); return('');
```

This script would first attempt to set the key 'mykey' to 'evil', and then, critically, execute `FLUSHALL`, wiping out all data in the Redis database.

**Potential Impact:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:** Attackers can execute scripts to retrieve sensitive data stored in Redis, potentially bypassing application-level access controls.
* **Data Manipulation/Destruction:** Malicious scripts can modify or delete crucial data, leading to data corruption or loss. The `FLUSHALL` example above demonstrates this devastating possibility.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute scripts that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network), causing the Redis server to become unresponsive and impacting the application's availability. This could involve infinite loops, large data operations, or network flooding.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Redis Server:** While the scripting environment is sandboxed to Redis commands, sophisticated attackers might find ways to interact with the underlying operating system through Lua's capabilities or by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Redis server itself.
* **Privilege Escalation:** If the Redis server has access to other systems or resources, attackers might leverage the scripting capability to escalate privileges and gain access to those resources.
* **Lateral Movement:** A compromised Redis server can be used as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.

**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**

* **Compromised User Input:**  Web applications often take user input that might inadvertently end up being used in Redis scripts. For example, search queries, filtering parameters, or configuration settings.
* **Data from Untrusted Sources:** If an application processes data from external APIs or databases and uses this data to construct Redis scripts, a compromise in the external source could lead to malicious script injection.
* **Internal Logic Flaws:** Bugs or design flaws in the application logic might lead to the construction of malicious scripts even without direct user input.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromised dependencies or libraries could introduce vulnerabilities that allow for malicious script injection.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing this vulnerability requires a multi-layered approach:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** **This is the most crucial step.**  Never directly incorporate untrusted input into Redis scripts.
    * **Whitelisting:** Define a strict set of allowed characters and patterns for user-provided data used in scripts.
    * **Escaping:** Properly escape any special characters that could be interpreted as script commands. However, relying solely on escaping can be complex and error-prone for Lua.
    * **Parameterization:**  While Redis scripting doesn't have direct parameterization like SQL prepared statements, structure your application logic to avoid dynamic script generation as much as possible.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Redis server with the minimum necessary privileges. Restrict the commands available to the Redis user if possible.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Avoid Dynamic Script Generation:**  Whenever feasible, predefine scripts and load them using `SCRIPT LOAD`. Then, execute them using `EVALSHA` with carefully controlled arguments.
    * **Abstraction Layers:** Create abstraction layers or helper functions that encapsulate Redis script execution, ensuring proper validation and sanitization within these layers.
    * **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code that interacts with Redis scripting to identify potential injection points.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) (for web applications using Redis):** While not directly preventing Redis script injection, CSP can help mitigate the impact of other client-side vulnerabilities that might be used in conjunction with this attack.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify vulnerabilities in the application and infrastructure.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that interact with Redis scripting to mitigate potential DoS attacks through malicious scripts.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**  Monitor Redis logs for suspicious `EVAL` or `SCRIPT LOAD` commands with unusual patterns or originating from unexpected sources.

**Specific Considerations for `node-redis`:**

* **Be extra cautious when using template literals or string concatenation to build scripts.**  This is a common source of injection vulnerabilities.
* **Utilize the `client.script('LOAD', ...)` approach whenever possible.** This allows you to define and review scripts separately, reducing the risk of dynamic injection.
* **Carefully review any libraries or modules that interact with Redis scripting.** Ensure they are not introducing vulnerabilities.

**Detection Methods:**

Identifying potential exploitation attempts or successful attacks can be challenging but crucial:

* **Redis Logs Analysis:** Monitor Redis logs for unusual `EVAL` or `SCRIPT LOAD` commands. Look for:
    * Scripts with unexpected commands (e.g., `FLUSHALL`, `CONFIG`).
    * Scripts with unusually long or complex structures.
    * Scripts originating from unexpected client IPs or users.
* **Network Monitoring:** Analyze network traffic to and from the Redis server for suspicious patterns or large data transfers.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor Redis server performance metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, network I/O) for sudden spikes that might indicate malicious script execution.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Redis logs and application logs into a SIEM system for centralized analysis and correlation of events.
* **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code for potential injection vulnerabilities.
* **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**  RASP solutions can monitor application behavior at runtime and detect attempts to execute malicious Redis scripts.

**Conclusion:**

The ability to execute arbitrary Lua scripts on a Redis server via `EVAL` or `SCRIPT LOAD` presents a significant security risk when not handled with extreme care. For applications using `node-redis`, it is paramount to prioritize secure coding practices, particularly around input validation and the avoidance of dynamic script generation. By understanding the potential impact and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood of this critical attack path being exploited. Continuous monitoring and proactive security assessments are essential to maintain a secure Redis deployment.
