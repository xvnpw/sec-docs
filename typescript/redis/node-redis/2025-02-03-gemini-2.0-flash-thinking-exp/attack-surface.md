# Attack Surface Analysis for redis/node-redis

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Unsafe Command Construction](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_unsafe_command_construction.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject arbitrary Redis commands by manipulating input that is directly incorporated into Redis commands without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Node-Redis Contribution:** `node-redis` provides methods to execute raw Redis commands and construct commands programmatically. Insecure use of these methods, by directly embedding unsanitized user input into command strings, creates this vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Scenario:** An application uses user-provided keys to fetch data from Redis: `client.get("user:" + userId)`. If `userId` is not validated and an attacker provides input like `123; DEL important_key`, the constructed command might become `GET user:123; DEL important_key`. While Redis command execution is generally sequential, depending on the application logic and command structure, injection can lead to execution of unintended commands.
    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers can inject commands to delete critical data (`DEL`), flush databases (`FLUSHDB` or `FLUSHALL`), access sensitive information using commands like `KEYS *` or `HGETALL`, or potentially execute Lua scripts if scripting is enabled in Redis and the application allows script execution via `node-redis`.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, denial of service, unauthorized data manipulation, potential for further system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterize Commands:**  Utilize `node-redis`'s parameterized command execution methods. This prevents user input from being directly interpreted as commands by using placeholders and passing arguments separately.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into Redis commands. Use allow-lists and escape special characters if direct string concatenation is absolutely necessary (parameterization is strongly preferred).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Redis Permissions):** Configure Redis user access control lists (ACLs) to restrict the commands that the application's Redis user can execute. Limit permissions to only the commands required for the application's functionality, minimizing the impact of potential command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection to Redis Server (Lack of TLS/SSL)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_to_redis_server__lack_of_tlsssl_.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the `node-redis` client and the Redis server occurs over an unencrypted connection, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Node-Redis Contribution:** By default, `node-redis` can connect to Redis over plain TCP. If TLS/SSL encryption is not explicitly enabled in the `node-redis` client configuration, the connection will remain unencrypted.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Scenario:** `node-redis` connects to a Redis server without TLS configured. An attacker positioned on the network path between the application and the Redis server can intercept network traffic.
    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers can capture sensitive data transmitted in plaintext, including application data stored in Redis, session identifiers, authentication credentials (if transmitted in plaintext), and potentially modify data in transit, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, session hijacking, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential compromise of application integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS/SSL Encryption:** Configure both the Redis server and the `node-redis` client to use TLS/SSL for all communication. `node-redis` provides configuration options within the client initialization to enable TLS. Ensure proper certificate configuration on both the client and server sides.
    *   **Secure Network Environment:** Deploy Redis and the application within a trusted and segmented network environment. While TLS is essential, network security measures provide defense-in-depth.
    *   **Avoid Transmitting Highly Sensitive Data in Plaintext:** Even with TLS, minimize the transmission of extremely sensitive data in plaintext if possible. Consider client-side encryption for highly confidential data before storing it in Redis as an additional security layer.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource-Intensive Command Abuse](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource-intensive_command_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit the ability to execute arbitrary Redis commands via `node-redis` to trigger resource-intensive commands that overwhelm the Redis server, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Node-Redis Contribution:** `node-redis` allows the application to execute virtually any Redis command. If application logic or external attackers can induce the execution of commands that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, I/O), it creates a DoS vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker discovers an application endpoint that, through `node-redis`, executes commands like `KEYS *` (on large databases), `SORT` on large sets, or computationally expensive Lua scripts based on user-controlled input.
    *   **Exploitation:** By repeatedly invoking this endpoint with inputs designed to trigger these expensive commands, the attacker can exhaust Redis server resources, causing slow performance, timeouts, or server crashes, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, service disruption, potential business impact due to downtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Command Usage in Application Logic:** Limit the Redis commands used in application code to only those strictly necessary for functionality. Avoid exposing endpoints that directly translate user input into potentially dangerous Redis commands.
    *   **Input Validation and Rate Limiting:** Implement robust input validation to prevent users from providing inputs that trigger resource-intensive Redis operations. Apply rate limiting to application endpoints that interact with Redis to mitigate abuse.
    *   **Redis Resource Limits and Monitoring:** Configure Redis server-side resource limits (e.g., `maxmemory`, `timeout`, `client-output-buffer-limit`) to protect against resource exhaustion. Implement continuous monitoring of Redis server performance metrics (CPU, memory, latency) to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks promptly.
    *   **Command Renaming (Redis Server):** In extreme cases, consider renaming or disabling highly dangerous commands like `KEYS`, `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, `SORT` on the Redis server configuration if they are not essential for the application's functionality and pose a significant DoS risk. This should be done with caution and thorough understanding of the application's requirements.
