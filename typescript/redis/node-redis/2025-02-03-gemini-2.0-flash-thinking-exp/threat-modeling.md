# Threat Model Analysis for redis/node-redis

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication](./threats/unencrypted_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Data transmitted between the Node.js application and the Redis server via `node-redis` is not encrypted. An attacker can eavesdrop on network traffic to intercept sensitive data during transmission. This is possible if TLS/SSL is not explicitly configured when creating the `node-redis` client.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data like user credentials, session tokens, or application data transmitted to or from Redis.
*   **Affected Component:** Network connection established by `redis.createClient()` or `redis.RedisClient` and its configuration options.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption in `node-redis` client configuration using the `tls` option in `redis.createClient()` or connection string.
    *   Ensure proper TLS/SSL certificate validation and management to prevent MitM attacks.
    *   Use secure network infrastructure and avoid transmitting sensitive data over untrusted networks without encryption.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `node-redis` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__node-redis__library.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in the `node-redis` library itself. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of `node-redis`. Exploits could range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can lead to Availability breach (DoS), Integrity breach, Confidentiality breach, or complete system compromise (Remote Code Execution).
*   **Affected Component:** `node-redis` library code and its modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `node-redis` to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, GitHub Security Advisories) for known vulnerabilities in `node-redis`.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to automatically identify and manage vulnerabilities in project dependencies, including `node-redis`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `node-redis` Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__node-redis__dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `node-redis` relies on other JavaScript libraries as dependencies. These dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in these transitive dependencies if they are present in the application's dependency tree.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency. Can lead to Availability breach, Integrity breach, Confidentiality breach, or system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Dependencies of `node-redis` (e.g., libraries used internally by `node-redis`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `node-redis` and its dependencies updated. Updating `node-redis` often pulls in updated dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in the entire dependency tree, including transitive dependencies.
    *   Investigate and address vulnerabilities reported in `node-redis`'s dependencies by updating `node-redis` or, if necessary, directly addressing vulnerable dependencies if possible and safe.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of `node-redis` Client leading to Credential Exposure](./threats/misconfiguration_of__node-redis__client_leading_to_credential_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect configuration of the `node-redis` client can lead to exposure of Redis authentication credentials. For example, hardcoding passwords directly in the code or in publicly accessible configuration files, or insecurely managing connection strings. An attacker gaining access to these credentials can then access the Redis server.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability breach. Unauthorized access to the Redis server, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion, and service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** `node-redis` client configuration, specifically how authentication details are managed and passed to `redis.createClient()`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never hardcode Redis credentials directly in application code.
    *   Use environment variables or secure secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage Redis credentials.
    *   Ensure configuration files containing connection details are not publicly accessible and have appropriate access controls.
    *   Regularly review and audit `node-redis` client configuration and credential management practices.
