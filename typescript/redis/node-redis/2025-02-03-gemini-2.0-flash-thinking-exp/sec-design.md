- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the client library could lead to data breaches or service disruptions in applications using `node-redis`.
  - Performance issues or instability in the client could negatively impact the performance and reliability of applications using `node-redis`.
  - Lack of compatibility with new Redis features or versions could limit the adoption and usefulness of `node-redis`.
  - Poor documentation or a difficult-to-use API could hinder developer adoption and satisfaction.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies of `node-redis` could introduce vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Applications relying on `node-redis` for data caching, session management, real-time data processing, and other critical functionalities. Disruption or compromise of `node-redis` could impact these processes.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of data handled by `node-redis` depends entirely on the applications using it and the data stored in Redis. `node-redis` itself does not store data, but facilitates access to data in Redis.
  - Potential data sensitivity levels could range from public information to highly confidential data, depending on the application's use case.
  - If applications use `node-redis` to store sensitive data in Redis, then the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of `node-redis` become critical for protecting that sensitive data.
