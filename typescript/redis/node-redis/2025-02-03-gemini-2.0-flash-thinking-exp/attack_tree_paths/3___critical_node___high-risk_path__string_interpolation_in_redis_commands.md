### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: String Interpolation in Redis Commands

#### 4.1. Introduction to the Vulnerability

The "String Interpolation in Redis Commands" vulnerability arises when developers construct Redis commands by directly embedding user-controlled input into strings using interpolation techniques (like template literals or string concatenation) without proper sanitization or parameterization. This practice treats user input as code, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary Redis commands alongside the intended command.  This is a critical vulnerability because Redis commands can perform a wide range of operations, including data manipulation, deletion, and even server-level actions.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Unsanitized User Input in String Interpolation

The core attack vector is **user-controlled input**.  If an application takes input from users (e.g., through web forms, APIs, or other interfaces) and directly incorporates this input into Redis command strings using interpolation, it creates an opportunity for injection.  The lack of proper sanitization or parameterization is the key enabler of this vulnerability.

#### 4.3. Breakdown of Exploits

##### 4.3.1. Exploit 1: Direct Injection

* **Description:**  Direct injection is the simplest form of this attack. An attacker provides malicious input that, when interpolated into the Redis command string, directly alters the intended command's behavior or adds new commands.

* **Mechanism:** The attacker crafts input that contains valid Redis commands or command modifiers. When this input is interpolated, it becomes part of the command executed by the `node-redis` client against the Redis server.

* **Example Scenario:** Consider an application that uses user-provided usernames to fetch user data from Redis.  The code might look like this (VULNERABLE):

   ```javascript
   const redis = require('redis');
   const redisClient = redis.createClient();

   async function getUserData(username) {
       const key = `user:${username}`; // Vulnerable string interpolation
       const userData = await redisClient.get(key);
       return userData;
   }

   // ... later in the application ...
   const userInputUsername = req.query.username; // User input from query parameter
   const userData = await getUserData(userInputUsername);
   // ... process userData ...
   ```

   If an attacker provides the username input as `"; FLUSHALL"`, the `key` variable becomes `user:; FLUSHALL`.  When `redisClient.get(key)` is executed, `node-redis` (depending on the specific command parsing and Redis server version, though generally Redis processes commands sequentially separated by semicolons or newlines) might interpret this as two commands:

   1. `GET user:` (which might result in an error or unexpected behavior depending on Redis version and command parsing)
   2. `FLUSHALL` (which would delete all data in the Redis database).

* **Impact:**  Direct injection can lead to:
    * **Data Deletion:** Using commands like `FLUSHALL`, `DEL`, or `UNLINK` to remove data.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Using commands like `SET`, `HSET`, `LPUSH`, etc., to modify or overwrite existing data.
    * **Information Disclosure:**  Potentially using commands like `KEYS *` (if enabled and permissions allow) to list keys and infer information about the data structure.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  In some cases, crafted commands could overload the Redis server or cause unexpected behavior leading to denial of service.

##### 4.3.2. Exploit 2: Crafted Input

* **Description:** Crafted input involves more sophisticated payloads designed to execute multiple Redis commands or leverage advanced Redis features like Lua scripting (`EVAL`).

* **Mechanism:** Attackers craft input that includes:
    * **Command Separators:** Using semicolons (`;`) or newlines (`\n`) to separate multiple Redis commands within the interpolated string.
    * **`EVAL` Command:**  Injecting the `EVAL` command to execute arbitrary Lua scripts on the Redis server. Lua scripting in Redis is powerful and can be used for complex operations, but also introduces significant security risks if injection is possible.
    * **Command Chaining:** Combining multiple Redis commands to achieve a more complex attack, such as first setting a key with malicious data and then retrieving it to trigger further application logic vulnerabilities.

* **Example Scenario (Command Separators):**  Building upon the previous example, if the application uses a command like:

   ```javascript
   const redis = require('redis');
   const redisClient = redis.createClient();

   async function processUserInput(userInput) {
       const command = `SET user_input:${userInput} value`; // Vulnerable interpolation
       await redisClient.sendCommand(command.split(' ')); // Note: sendCommand is used here for demonstration, but the vulnerability exists even with simpler commands like get/set if interpolated.
   }

   // ... later in the application ...
   const userInput = req.query.input;
   await processUserInput(userInput);
   ```

   If `userInput` is set to `test_key value; FLUSHALL`, the `command` becomes `SET user_input:test_key value; FLUSHALL value`.  When `sendCommand` is used (or even if `redisClient.set` was used incorrectly with a string), Redis might execute both `SET user_input:test_key value value` and `FLUSHALL`.

* **Example Scenario (`EVAL` Injection):**

   ```javascript
   const redis = require('redis');
   const redisClient = redis.createClient();

   async function processUserInput(script) {
       const command = `EVAL "${script}" 0`; // Vulnerable interpolation
       await redisClient.sendCommand(command.split(' '));
   }

   // ... later in the application ...
   const userInputScript = req.query.script;
   await processUserInput(userInputScript);
   ```

   If `userInputScript` is set to  `return redis.call('FLUSHALL')`, the `command` becomes `EVAL "return redis.call('FLUSHALL')" 0`. This would execute a Lua script that calls `FLUSHALL`, again wiping out the Redis database.

* **Impact:** Crafted input can significantly amplify the impact of Redis command injection, leading to:
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution (via `EVAL`):**  If Lua scripting is enabled in Redis, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the Redis server, potentially compromising the server itself and potentially the application server if they are co-located or share resources.
    * **Complex Data Manipulation:**  Attackers can perform more intricate data modifications or extractions using multiple chained commands.
    * **Circumventing Basic Security Measures:**  Crafted input can sometimes bypass simple input validation attempts if they are not comprehensive enough.

#### 4.4. Example Breakdown: `redisClient.set(\`user:${userInput}\`, 'somevalue')` with `userInput = "; FLUSHALL"`

Let's analyze the provided example in detail:

* **Vulnerable Code:** `redisClient.set(\`user:${userInput}\`, 'somevalue')`
* **Attacker Input:** `userInput = "; FLUSHALL"`
* **Resulting Command String (after interpolation):** `SET user:; FLUSHALL 'somevalue'`

**Execution Flow:**

1. **Interpolation:** The `userInput` value (`; FLUSHALL`) is directly inserted into the template literal, creating the command string.
2. **Command Transmission:** The `node-redis` client sends this string to the Redis server.
3. **Redis Server Processing:** The Redis server receives the command string.  Redis command parsing, especially in older versions or depending on configuration, might interpret commands separated by semicolons or newlines as distinct commands. In this case, it's likely to interpret it as:
    * **Command 1:** `SET user:` (This part might be incomplete or lead to an error depending on Redis version and parsing, but it's part of the interpretation)
    * **Command 2:** `FLUSHALL`
    * **Command 3:** `'somevalue'` (This might be misinterpreted as arguments to `FLUSHALL` or ignored).

4. **`FLUSHALL` Execution:**  Crucially, the `FLUSHALL` command is executed by the Redis server. This command **deletes all data** from all databases within the Redis instance.
5. **Data Loss:** The application's Redis database is completely emptied, leading to significant data loss and potential application malfunction.

**Impact of this specific example:**  This simple injection leads to catastrophic data loss, effectively causing a severe denial of service and potentially data integrity issues if the application relies on the data in Redis.

#### 4.5. Impact and Consequences of Successful Exploitation

Successful exploitation of string interpolation in Redis commands can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach/Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use commands to retrieve sensitive data stored in Redis, potentially leading to data breaches and privacy violations.
* **Data Manipulation/Corruption:**  Attackers can modify or corrupt data, leading to application malfunctions, incorrect data processing, and loss of data integrity.
* **Data Deletion/Data Loss:**  Commands like `FLUSHALL`, `DEL`, and `UNLINK` can be used to delete critical data, causing data loss and denial of service.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Besides data deletion, attackers can craft commands that overload the Redis server, consume excessive resources, or cause crashes, leading to denial of service for the application.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution (via `EVAL`):**  If Lua scripting is enabled, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the Redis server, potentially gaining control of the server and potentially the application server if they are interconnected. This is the most severe potential impact.
* **Application Logic Bypass:**  Attackers might be able to manipulate data or Redis state in ways that bypass application logic or security controls.

#### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies

To prevent string interpolation vulnerabilities in Redis commands, development teams should implement the following mitigation strategies:

* **4.6.1. Parameterized Commands (Strongly Recommended):**

    * **Use `node-redis`'s Parameterized Command Methods:**  `node-redis` provides methods like `redisClient.set(key, value)`, `redisClient.get(key)`, `redisClient.hSet(key, field, value)`, etc., that automatically handle parameterization.  **Always prefer these methods over constructing command strings manually.**

    * **Example (Secure):**

      ```javascript
      const redis = require('redis');
      const redisClient = redis.createClient();

      async function setUserData(username, data) {
          const key = `user:${username}`;
          await redisClient.set(key, JSON.stringify(data)); // Parameterized set command
      }

      // ... later in the application ...
      const userInputUsername = req.query.username;
      const userDataPayload = { name: 'Example User', ... }; // Example data
      await setUserData(userInputUsername, userDataPayload);
      ```

      In this secure example, `redisClient.set(key, JSON.stringify(data))` treats `key` and `JSON.stringify(data)` as parameters, not as parts of a command string to be parsed for further commands. `node-redis` handles the proper encoding and escaping to prevent injection.

* **4.6.2. Input Sanitization (Defense in Depth - Less Preferred, Parameterization is Primary):**

    * **Validate and Sanitize User Input:**  While parameterization is the primary defense, input sanitization can act as a defense-in-depth measure.  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain unexpected characters or command separators.
    * **Escape Special Characters (If Absolutely Necessary - Avoid if Parameterization is Possible):**  If you absolutely must construct command strings manually (which is generally discouraged), carefully escape any special characters that could be interpreted as command separators or Redis command syntax. However, this is error-prone and less secure than parameterization. **Avoid manual escaping if possible and use parameterized commands instead.**

* **4.6.3. Principle of Least Privilege for Redis:**

    * **Limit Redis User Permissions:**  Configure Redis users with the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid granting overly broad permissions that could be abused if injection occurs.
    * **Disable Dangerous Commands (If Not Needed):**  Use Redis's `rename-command` configuration directive to rename or disable potentially dangerous commands like `FLUSHALL`, `EVAL`, `KEYS`, `CONFIG`, etc., if your application does not require them. This reduces the attack surface.

* **4.6.4. Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**

    * **Periodic Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including Redis command injection flaws.
    * **Code Reviews:** Implement code reviews to ensure that developers are following secure coding practices and are not introducing string interpolation vulnerabilities.

#### 4.7. Secure Code Examples (Using Parameterization)

Here are more secure code examples demonstrating parameterized commands with `node-redis`:

* **Setting a Hash:**

  ```javascript
  const redis = require('redis');
  const redisClient = redis.createClient();

  async function setUserDetails(userId, name, email) {
      await redisClient.hSet(`user:${userId}`, 'name', name); // Parameterized hSet
      await redisClient.hSet(`user:${userId}`, 'email', email); // Parameterized hSet
  }

  // ... usage ...
  await setUserDetails(123, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
  ```

* **Retrieving a Value:**

  ```javascript
  const redis = require('redis');
  const redisClient = redis.createClient();

  async function getUsername(userId) {
      const username = await redisClient.hGet(`user:${userId}`, 'name'); // Parameterized hGet
      return username;
  }

  // ... usage ...
  const username = await getUsername(123);
  console.log(`Username: ${username}`);
  ```

* **Using Lists:**

  ```javascript
  const redis = require('redis');
  const redisClient = redis.createClient();

  async function addLogEntry(logMessage) {
      await redisClient.lPush('application_logs', logMessage); // Parameterized lPush
  }

  // ... usage ...
  await addLogEntry('User logged in successfully.');
  ```

**Key takeaway:**  In all secure examples, we are using the built-in `node-redis` methods that accept parameters directly, avoiding manual string construction and interpolation. This is the most effective way to prevent Redis command injection vulnerabilities.

### 5. Conclusion

String interpolation in Redis commands is a critical vulnerability that can lead to severe security breaches, including data loss, data manipulation, and even arbitrary code execution.  Development teams using `node-redis` must prioritize preventing this vulnerability by **always using parameterized command methods provided by the library**. Input sanitization can be considered as a secondary defense layer, but parameterization is the primary and most effective mitigation.  By adopting secure coding practices and regularly reviewing code for potential vulnerabilities, applications can be effectively protected against Redis command injection attacks.  Remember to always consult the `node-redis` documentation for the most up-to-date and secure usage patterns.
