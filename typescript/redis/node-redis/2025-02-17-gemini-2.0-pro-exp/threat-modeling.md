# Threat Model Analysis for redis/node-redis

## Threat: [Redis Command Injection](./threats/redis_command_injection.md)

*   **Threat:**  Redis Command Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used in constructing Redis commands via `node-redis`, allows them to execute arbitrary Redis commands.  For example, if a key name is taken directly from user input without sanitization, an attacker could provide a key like `"'; FLUSHALL; '"`, causing the `FLUSHALL` command (which deletes all data) to be executed.  This is the most direct and severe threat related to `node-redis` usage.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete data loss (if `FLUSHALL` or similar is injected).
        *   Data modification or corruption.
        *   Potential for remote code execution (RCE) in very specific, misconfigured scenarios (e.g., using `CONFIG SET` to write to files, then loading a malicious module).
        *   Denial of service.
    *   **Affected `node-redis` Component:** Any function that takes user-provided data as input for constructing commands. This includes, but is not limited to:
        *   `client.set(key, value, ...)`
        *   `client.get(key)`
        *   `client.hset(key, field, value, ...)`
        *   `client.hget(key, field)`
        *   `client.zadd(key, score, member, ...)`
        *   `client.eval(script, numkeys, key1, key2, ..., arg1, arg2, ...)` (especially vulnerable if the script itself is constructed from user input)
        *   Any function using raw commands via `client.sendCommand(...)`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  *Strictly* validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied data before using it in *any* Redis command.  This includes key names, values, scores, members, and script arguments. Use a whitelist approach (allow only known-good characters) rather than a blacklist approach.
        *   **Avoid Direct String Concatenation:** Never build Redis commands by directly concatenating strings with user input.
        *   **Structured Data:** If possible, use structured data formats (e.g., JSON) for values and parse them securely.  This helps prevent injection within values.
        *   **Redis ACLs:** Use Redis Access Control Lists (ACLs) to limit the commands that the `node-redis` client can execute.  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Lua Scripting (with Caution):** When using `EVAL`, ensure that the Lua script itself is *not* constructed from user input.  If user input *must* be used within the script, treat it as untrusted and sanitize it thoroughly *within the Lua script itself* (using Lua's string manipulation functions).  Consider alternatives to `EVAL` if possible.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Unencrypted Connection](./threats/information_disclosure_via_unencrypted_connection.md)

*   **Threat:**  Information Disclosure via Unencrypted Connection
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the `node-redis` client and the Redis server because TLS/SSL encryption is not used. The attacker can then read the data being exchanged, including potentially sensitive information. This is a direct threat because `node-redis` is responsible for establishing the connection.
    *   **Impact:**  Data theft (e.g., session tokens, API keys, user data).
    *   **Affected `node-redis` Component:** Connection establishment.
        *   `createClient(...)` (specifically, the *absence* of the `tls` option or incorrect TLS configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always Use TLS/SSL:**  *Always* use TLS/SSL encryption for the connection between `node-redis` and the Redis server.  Configure `node-redis` with the appropriate TLS options, including providing valid certificates.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Slow Operations](./threats/denial_of_service_via_slow_operations.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service via Slow Operations.
    * **Description:** An attacker sends commands that are known to be slow or resource-intensive, such as `KEYS *`, large `MGET` operations with many keys, or complex Lua scripts via `node-redis`. This overwhelms the Redis server, making it unresponsive.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability.
    * **Affected `node-redis` Component:**
        *   `client.keys('*')` (and any use of `KEYS` with broad patterns)
        *   `client.mget(large_array_of_keys)`
        *   `client.eval(...)` (with complex or inefficient Lua scripts)
        *   Any command that operates on large datasets.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `KEYS *`:** Never use `KEYS *` in production. Use `SCAN` (and its variants) instead, which `node-redis` supports (e.g., `client.scan(...)`).
        *   **Pagination/Chunking:** Fetch large datasets in smaller batches.
        *   **Command Timeouts:** Configure `node-redis` with timeouts (`commandTimeout` option).
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the application side.
        *   **Redis Monitoring:** Monitor Redis server performance.
