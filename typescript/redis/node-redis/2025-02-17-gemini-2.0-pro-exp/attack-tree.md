## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exfiltration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exfiltration__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1. Unprotected Redis Instance (No Auth) [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The Redis server is accessible without any authentication, allowing anyone to connect and interact with it. This is a fundamental security flaw.
    *   **1.1.1. Connect directly and issue `KEYS *` then `GET` each key. [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* An attacker uses a Redis client (e.g., `redis-cli` or a custom script) to connect directly to the exposed Redis instance. They then use the `KEYS *` command to retrieve a list of all keys in the database, followed by `GET` commands to retrieve the value of each key.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low (Should be rare in production)
        *   *Impact:* Very High (Complete data compromise)
        *   *Effort:* Very Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Script Kiddie
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   **1.1.2. Use `SCAN` command for large datasets to avoid blocking.**
        *   *Description:* Similar to 1.1.1, but uses the `SCAN` command instead of `KEYS *`. `SCAN` is an iterative command that retrieves keys in batches, preventing the Redis server from being blocked by a single large request.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* Very High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

*   **1.2. Weak/Default Redis Credentials [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The Redis server is protected by authentication, but the password is weak (easily guessable) or is the default password.
    *   **1.2.1. Brute-force attack on Redis password.**
        *   *Description:* An attacker uses a brute-forcing tool to try many different passwords until they find the correct one.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Very High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   **1.2.2. Dictionary attack using common Redis passwords. [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* An attacker uses a dictionary attack, trying a list of common passwords.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Very High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

*   **1.3. Exploiting Application Logic Flaws (Indirect Access)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application code to indirectly access Redis data.
    *   **1.3.1. Inject Redis commands via user input (if input is used to construct Redis queries unsafely). [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* The application uses user-supplied input to construct Redis commands without proper sanitization or validation.  An attacker can inject malicious Redis commands into the input, allowing them to read or modify data. This is analogous to SQL injection.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard

*   **1.4. Network Sniffing (If TLS is not used or improperly configured) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  Communication between the application and the Redis server is not encrypted, allowing an attacker with network access to intercept the traffic.
    *   **1.4.1 Capture Redis traffic between application and server.**
        *   *Description:* An attacker uses a network sniffing tool (e.g., Wireshark) to capture the unencrypted traffic between the application and the Redis server.  This allows them to see all commands and data being exchanged, including credentials if they are sent in plain text.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Manipulation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_manipulation__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1. Unprotected Redis Instance (No Auth) [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Same as 1.1, but the attacker's goal is to modify data instead of reading it.
    *   **2.1.1. Connect directly and use `SET`, `DEL`, `HSET`, etc. to modify data. [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* An attacker connects to the unprotected Redis instance and uses commands like `SET` (to change the value of a key), `DEL` (to delete a key), `HSET` (to modify a hash field), etc., to alter the data stored in Redis.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Very Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Script Kiddie
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   **2.1.2. Overwrite existing keys with malicious data.**
        *   *Description:* A specific form of 2.1.1 where the attacker overwrites existing keys with data designed to disrupt the application or cause incorrect behavior.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Very Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Script Kiddie
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

*   **2.2. Weak/Default Redis Credentials [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]** (Same as 1.2, but with a focus on data modification)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*    **3.1. Connection Exhaustion (node-redis specific)**
    *    **3.1.1. Rapidly create and drop connections without proper resource management (e.g., not calling `client.quit()`). [HIGH RISK]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker repeatedly creates new Redis connections using `node-redis` but doesn't properly close them. This can exhaust the available connections on the server or the application, making the application unable to interact with Redis.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* Medium
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy
