# Attack Surface Analysis for redis/node-redis

## Attack Surface: [Connection String/Credential Exposure (via `node-redis` usage)](./attack_surfaces/connection_stringcredential_exposure__via__node-redis__usage_.md)

*   **Description:** The connection string or individual connection options (including the Redis password) used by *`node-redis`* are exposed through insecure coding practices, logging, or environment variable misconfiguration. This is directly related to how the application *uses* `node-redis`.
*   **`node-redis` Contribution:** `node-redis` uses the provided connection information.  If that information is exposed, the attacker gains the same access `node-redis` has.
*   **Example:** The Redis password is hardcoded in the application's source code that uses `node-redis`, and this code is committed to a public repository.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Redis server, leading to data theft, modification, or deletion.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secrets Management:** *Never* hardcode credentials. Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and retrieve the Redis password used by `node-redis`.
    *   **Environment Variables (Securely):** If using environment variables, ensure they are set securely and not exposed to unauthorized users or processes.
    *   **Secure Logging:** Avoid logging sensitive information, including connection strings and passwords, especially those passed to `node-redis`.
    *   **Code Review:** Conduct code reviews to identify and prevent accidental exposure of credentials used with `node-redis`.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Connection (No TLS) - `node-redis` Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_connection__no_tls__-__node-redis__misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** The connection between `node-redis` and the Redis server is not encrypted, *and this is due to a failure to configure TLS in `node-redis`*. This is a direct `node-redis` configuration issue.
*   **`node-redis` Contribution:** `node-redis` does *not* use TLS encryption by default.  It must be explicitly enabled in the `node-redis` configuration.  Failure to do so leaves the connection vulnerable.
*   **Example:** The application connects to Redis using `node-redis` without specifying any TLS options, even though the network is untrusted.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, including potentially sensitive data stored in Redis and the Redis password itself. Man-in-the-middle attacks are also possible.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (especially on untrusted networks)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **`node-redis` Configuration:** *Always* configure `node-redis` to use TLS by providing the appropriate options in the connection configuration (e.g., `tls: { ... }`).  Ensure you are using a trusted certificate authority and that `rejectUnauthorized` is set to `true` (or omitted, as it defaults to `true`).
    *   **Redis Server Configuration:** Ensure the Redis server itself is also configured for TLS. This is a prerequisite, but the *direct* `node-redis` issue is failing to enable TLS in the client.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection (through `node-redis`)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection__through__node-redis__.md)

*   **Description:** User-supplied data is directly incorporated into Redis commands *within the code that uses `node-redis`* without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious Redis commands. This is a direct misuse of `node-redis`.
*   **`node-redis` Contribution:** While `node-redis` *provides* safe argument handling, it's still possible to construct commands unsafely if the application directly concatenates user input into command strings *passed to `node-redis` methods*.
*   **Example:** An application uses `client.sendCommand(['SET', 'user:' + userInput, 'someValue'])` where `userInput` is directly from a user. An attacker could provide `userInput` as `'; FLUSHALL;` to execute the `FLUSHALL` command.  This is a direct misuse of the `sendCommand` method.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary Redis commands, leading to data loss, data modification, or potentially denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Safe Argument Handling:** *Always* use the provided argument passing mechanisms of `node-redis`. For example, use `client.set('mykey', userInput)` instead of constructing the command string manually.  This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user input *before* it is used with `node-redis`, even if using the safe argument handling. This provides defense-in-depth, but the core issue is the unsafe use of `node-redis`.

## Attack Surface: [TLS Certificate Validation Bypass (in `node-redis`)](./attack_surfaces/tls_certificate_validation_bypass__in__node-redis__.md)

*   **Description:** TLS is enabled, but `node-redis` is explicitly configured to *bypass* certificate validation (e.g., `rejectUnauthorized: false`), making the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This is a *direct and critical misconfiguration of `node-redis`*.
*   **`node-redis` Contribution:** `node-redis` *allows* disabling certificate validation, which is a dangerous option if misused.
*   **Example:** The application sets `tls: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` in the `node-redis` connection options.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can intercept and modify the communication between the application and the Redis server, potentially stealing credentials or data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **`node-redis` Configuration:** *Never* disable certificate validation. Ensure `rejectUnauthorized` is set to `true` (the default) or omitted in the `node-redis` TLS configuration.  Provide the correct CA certificate if necessary. This is the *only* necessary mitigation, as it directly addresses the misconfiguration.
