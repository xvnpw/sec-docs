## Vulnerability List for Tailwind CSS IntelliSense VSCode Extension

**Vulnerability 1: Path Traversal in `@config`, `@plugin`, and `@source` Directives**

- Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious CSS file within a workspace.
    2. This malicious CSS file includes `@config`, `@plugin`, or `@source` directives with a path that attempts to traverse outside the workspace directory (e.g., using `../` or absolute paths).
    3. When the VSCode extension processes this malicious CSS file, the language server might attempt to resolve and access files outside the intended workspace boundary based on the provided path in the directive.
    4. If the extension's file path resolution logic does not properly sanitize or validate these paths, it could lead to path traversal.

- Impact:
    - **High:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the user's file system that the VSCode process has access to. This could lead to information disclosure of sensitive data, including source code, configuration files, or user documents. In more severe scenarios, if combined with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, it might be leveraged for further exploitation.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided project files. The code snippets and README do not indicate any explicit path sanitization or validation for `@config`, `@plugin`, or `@source` directives.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Path Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust path sanitization within the language server to prevent traversal outside the workspace. This should include:
        - Validating that paths are relative to the workspace root.
        - Sanitizing paths to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences like `../`.
        - Using secure path resolution APIs that prevent traversal.
    - **Workspace Root Enforcement:** Ensure that file access operations for `@config`, `@plugin`, and `@source` are strictly limited to within the workspace root directory.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must open a workspace in VSCode.
    - The workspace must contain a CSS file that the attacker can modify or create (if attacker has write access to the workspace, or if user opens a workspace containing attacker-controlled files).
    - The Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension must be active and processing the malicious CSS file.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/packages/tailwindcss-language-server/src/documentLinksProvider.ts`
    2. **Function:** `getDocumentLinks` and `getDirectiveLinks`
    3. **Code Snippet:**
    ```typescript
    async function getDirectiveLinks(
      state: State,
      document: TextDocument,
      patterns: RegExp[],
      resolveTarget: (linkPath: string) => Promise<string>,
    ): Promise<DocumentLink[]> {
      // ...
      for (let match of matches) {
        let path = match.groups.path.slice(1, -1)
        // ...
        links.push({
          target: await resolveTarget(path), // Potential vulnerability point: Unsanitized path passed to resolveTarget
          range: absoluteRange(range, block.range),
        })
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```
    4. **Analysis:**
        - The `getDocumentLinks` function in `documentLinksProvider.ts` processes `@config`, `@plugin`, and `@source` directives to provide document links.
        - The code extracts the path from these directives using regex match groups (`match.groups.path.slice(1, -1)`).
        - The extracted path is directly passed to the `resolveTarget` function without explicit sanitization or validation against path traversal attempts.
        - The `resolveTarget` function, based on the code in `/code/packages/tailwindcss-language-server/src/projects.ts` and `/code/packages/tailwindcss-language-server/src/resolver/index.ts`, uses `path.resolve` and `resolver.resolveJsId`/`resolver.resolveCssId` for path resolution. While `enhanced-resolve` is used, lack of sanitization of the input `path` before passing it to `resolveTarget` can still lead to path traversal if the `path` contains malicious sequences like `../`.

- Security test case:
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Create a folder named `test-workspace` in a safe location on your file system.
    3. Open the `test-workspace` folder in VSCode.
    4. Create a new CSS file named `malicious.css` in the workspace root.
    5. Add the following content to `malicious.css`:
    ```css
    @config "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd";
    @plugin "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd";
    @source "../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd";
    @import "tailwindcss" source("../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd");
    ```
    6. Open the `malicious.css` file in the VSCode editor.
    7. Activate the "Tailwind CSS: Show Output" command from the command palette.
    8. Observe the output logs for any file access errors or attempts to read `/etc/passwd` or similar sensitive files. If the extension attempts to access or process `/etc/passwd` (or similar OS sensitive files), it indicates a path traversal vulnerability. Note that successful exploitation might not always be evident in the output, but file access errors related to restricted files outside the workspace would strongly suggest the vulnerability.
    9. **Expected Result:** The extension should **not** attempt to access files outside the workspace. The security test case would be considered successful if the extension's output logs or system monitoring tools indicate attempts to access `/etc/passwd` or other system-sensitive files due to the malicious paths in the CSS file. A secure extension would either sanitize the paths to prevent traversal or strictly limit file access within the workspace boundary, thus not attempting to read the sensitive file.
