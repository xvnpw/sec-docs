Based on your instructions, let's analyze the provided vulnerability list item and filter it.

**Vulnerability Name:** No New High or Critical Vulnerabilities Identified
**Vulnerability Rank:** None

According to your instructions, we should only include vulnerabilities with a rank of "high" or "critical".  The provided item has a vulnerability rank of "None".

Therefore, this item does not meet the inclusion criteria based on vulnerability rank.

Applying exclusion criteria (even though they are not directly applicable as this is not a vulnerability):
- **Excluded vulnerabilities:**
    - are caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES. (Not applicable, as this is not about a vulnerability caused by insecure code).
    - are only missing documentation to mitigate. (Not applicable, as there is no vulnerability identified).
    - are deny of service vulnerabilities. (Not applicable, as there is no vulnerability identified).

Applying inclusion criteria:
- **Included vulnerabilities:**
    - are valid and not already mitigated. (This is not a vulnerability, but a statement of no vulnerability).
    - has vulnerability rank at least: high (The rank is "None", which is less than "high").

Since the vulnerability rank is "None", and we are instructed to include only vulnerabilities with rank at least "high", this item should be excluded from the updated list.

Therefore, the updated list, after filtering, should be empty.
