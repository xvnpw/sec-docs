# Vulnerabilities

After analyzing the Path Intellisense VSCode extension code according to the specified criteria, I've determined that the previously listed vulnerabilities don't meet the specific requirements.

The two vulnerabilities listed were:

1. **Path Traversal Leading to Command Injection via Configuration Files**
2. **NixOS Provider Path Traversal Vulnerability**

While both are rated as "High" severity, they are primarily path traversal vulnerabilities that allow reading files outside the workspace boundaries. The first vulnerability mentions it could lead to command injection, but only "when combined with other VSCode extensions that might execute files specified in imports" - making it not a direct command injection vulnerability on its own.

Neither vulnerability demonstrates a clear, direct path to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Command Injection, or Code Injection without requiring additional components or specific conditions outside the extension itself.

Based on the criteria to include only:
- Valid and unmitigated vulnerabilities
- With vulnerability rank at least high
- In the classes of RCE, Command Injection, or Code Injection

No vulnerabilities in the provided list fully meet these specific requirements.
