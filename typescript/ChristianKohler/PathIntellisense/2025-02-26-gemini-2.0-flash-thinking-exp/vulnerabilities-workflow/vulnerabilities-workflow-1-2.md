- **Vulnerability Name:** Directory Traversal in File Path Resolution  
  **Description:**  
  The extension gathers the “typed” path string from the currently open document and passes it directly into a helper function (in file‑utills.ts, function `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles`) that normalizes and then “joins” that value with a base directory (either the workspace folder or the file’s own directory). An attacker who controls (or supplies via a malicious repository file) an import statement can inject multiple parent‑directory traversal segments (for example, using a string such as `../../../../etc/`) that after normalization will resolve to a directory outside the intended workspace boundary. When the auto‑completion provider then calls the VS Code file API (`vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory`) on this computed path, it may return file and folder names from sensitive locations beyond the user’s project.  
  **Impact:**  
  Successful exploitation would allow disclosure of file and directory names from locations not intended to be exposed by the extension. In an environment where a malicious repository (or file) is loaded in VS Code, an attacker could craft import paths that trigger the auto‑completion mechanism to reveal parts of the underlying file system—potentially disclosing sensitive system or configuration files.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The code simply normalizes and joins the user‑supplied path without validating that the resulting path is “inside” an allowed base directory. No explicit checks are implemented in the core functions (`getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` and `getChildrenOfPath`) to constrain the resolved file system path.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Sanitize and strictly validate the user‑supplied path segment so that after normalization the resolved path is guaranteed to lie inside an approved directory (for example, by checking that it is a child of the workspace folder).  
  - Implement additional boundary checks before calling file system APIs to list directories.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - An attacker must be able to supply or inject a malicious import (or path) string into a file that will be opened in VS Code (for example, via a compromised repository file).  
  - The workspace or file location used as the base for path resolution must be such that directory traversal can “escape” into sensitive areas (i.e. the resolved path is not already sandboxed).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In **file-utills.ts – `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles`:**  
    - The function accepts a user‑provided text (the “typed” path) and immediately calls `path.normalize(text || "")`; this replaces any mixed or relative separators but does not reject sequences like `../../…`.
    - It then determines a root folder by checking if the normalized text starts with a path separator. When no mapping is found, it sets the root folder either to a provided `rootPath` (when the path is “absolute”) or to `path.dirname(fileName)` (when relative).
    - Finally, it returns `path.join(rootFolder, pathEntered)` without verifying that the resulting path remains within an allowed boundary.
  - In **file-utills.ts – `getChildrenOfPath`:**  
    - The function uses the computed path directly to call `vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory(vscode.Uri.file(path))`.  
    - Because there is no subsequent check to ensure that `path` does not escape the intended workspace directories, an attacker‑controlled import string may lead to disclosure of file names outside the trusted area.
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Prepare a file in a test workspace (or open a file that is part of a repository) with an import statement such as:  
     ```javascript
     import {} from "../../../../etc/"
     ```  
  2. Open this file in VS Code so that the extension’s provider is activated.  
  3. Position the cursor inside (or immediately after) the quoted path portion of the import statement.  
  4. Trigger the auto‑completion manually (for example, by using the command palette or by typing a trigger character).  
  5. Observe the list of suggested completions returned by the extension.  
  6. If the returned list includes entries corresponding to directories or files found in `/etc` (or another sensitive parent directory), the test is successful—that is, the vulnerability is confirmed.
