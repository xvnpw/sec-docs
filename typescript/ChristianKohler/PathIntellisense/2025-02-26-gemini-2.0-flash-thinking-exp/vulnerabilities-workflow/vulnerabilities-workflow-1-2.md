- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Directory Traversal in File Lookup  
  **Description:**  
  The extension builds file paths for autocompletion by taking the user‑supplied “import” string (or similar text fragment) and passing it into the helper function that determines the lookup folder. In particular, the function `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` calls `path.normalize` on the import text and then joins it with a “root folder” (either inferred from the current file’s directory or from a workspace setting such as `absolutePathTo`). Because the normalized text is not validated for traversal sequences such as `"../"`, an attacker who crafts a malicious import (for example, by inserting `"../../"` or other directory‐traversal segments) can force the extension to resolve and enumerate directories outside the intended workspace boundaries. In a publicly available instance of the extension (for example, when a user opens a file that contains a carefully crafted import statement from an untrusted source) the attacker can trigger the vulnerability to reveal otherwise unexpected file and folder listings.  
  **Impact:**  
  - An attacker can cause the extension to list files and directories located outside the intended workspace (or project) directory.  
  - Sensitive files or directory structure information (which may include configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data) may be disclosed directly via autocompletion suggestions.  
  - The disclosure of such file system information increases the risk for further targeted attacks or social engineering.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The code uses Node’s `path.normalize` and `path.join` functions to process the input but does not perform any explicit sanitization or boundary checking to ensure that the resulting path is confined to the intended folder.  
  - There is a configuration option (`showOnAbsoluteSlash`) that—when enabled—allows import strings beginning with “/” to be processed, but no further restrictions are imposed.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Input sanitization or whitelist checking to disallow relative segments (for example, any use of `"../"`) that would cause the resolved path to leave the allowed (e.g. workspace) directory.  
  - Enforcement of boundary restrictions so that even after path normalization and joining, the resolved path is verified to lie within an approved directory (for example, by comparing the resolved path against the absolute workspace path).  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - An attacker must be able to supply or cause the opening of a file containing a malicious import or path string that is processed by the extension.  
  - The extension’s configuration should allow processing of absolute or relative paths in a way that the crafted input is accepted (for instance, when `showOnAbsoluteSlash` is true or the import string begins with a dot).  
  - The workspace (or file system) must contain directories outside the intended target that could expose sensitive file names or directory structures.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` the input parameter `text` (the import string) is normalized with:
    ```javascript
    const normalizedText = path.normalize(text || "");
    ```
    This call converts a user‑supplied string (which may include traversal sequences) into a normalized path but does not remove `"../"` segments.  
  - The function then checks if the text starts with a path separator to decide whether to use a configured root folder or the current file’s directory:
    ```javascript
    rootFolder = isPathAbsolute ? rootPath || "" : path.dirname(fileName);
    ```
  - Finally, the function returns:
    ```javascript
    return path.join(rootFolder, pathEntered);
    ```
    Because no check is made to ensure that `path.join`’s result does not escape the root folder, an attacker’s input such as `"../../../../../etc"` could cause the function to resolve a folder outside the project.  
  - The result is used in `getChildrenOfPath`, which calls:
    ```javascript
    const filesTubles = await vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory(vscode.Uri.file(path))
    ```
    This call will attempt to enumerate the contents of the resolved directory—even if it lies outside of the intended boundaries—and subsequently display the file names as autocompletion suggestions.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Preparation:**  
     - Create a new file in the workspace (for example, `malicious.js`) and add an import statement with a crafted path.  
  2. **Test Steps:**  
     - In `malicious.js`, add a line similar to:  
       ```javascript
       import {} from "../../../../../etc/";
       ```  
       (The exact number of `"../"` segments should be adjusted to target a directory outside the intended workspace boundary.)  
     - Open the file in VS Code so that the extension is activated and the autocompletion provider is triggered.  
     - Place the cursor after the import path and invoke the autocompletion command (for example, by pressing the trigger key such as `/` or by using the VS Code autocompletion shortcut).  
  3. **Expected Result:**  
     - Rather than only listing files from within the project/workspace directory, the autocompletion list includes entries from the directory obtained by the malicious path (for example, system directories such as `/etc` on Unix‑like systems).  
     - This confirms that the extension has allowed directory traversal beyond expected bounds.  
  4. **Cleanup:**  
     - Remove the test file after verifying the vulnerability.  

This vulnerability highlights the risk of relying solely on path normalization and joining without enforcing a strict boundary check. Implementing proper sanitization and path-boundary enforcement is necessary to mitigate the risk of arbitrary file disclosure.
