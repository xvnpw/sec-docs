### Vulnerability: Path Traversal via Malicious Workspace Mapping and Absolute Path Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can configure malicious settings in VSCode for the Path Intellisense extension, either through workspace mappings or absolute path configurations.
    2. **Malicious Workspace Mapping:** The attacker can define a mapping in `path-intellisense.mappings` with a key and a value. The `value` can contain path traversal characters (e.g., `../`) to point outside the workspace directory. For example, mapping a key to `${workspaceFolder}/../sensitive-directory`.
    3. **Malicious Absolute Path Configuration:** Alternatively, the attacker can set `path-intellisense.absolutePathTo` to an absolute path outside the workspace, like `/etc/`, and set `path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace` to `false`.
    4. When the extension resolves paths for autocompletion, it uses these malicious mappings or absolute path configurations as the base directory for path resolution.
    5. When a user types an import statement or any path that triggers path completion (e.g., `import {} from "sensitive/"` if "sensitive" is the malicious mapping key, or `import {} from "/"` if absolute path configuration is malicious), the extension uses the configured malicious path.
    6. The extension then uses the VS Code file API (`vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory`) on the constructed path to list files and directories for completion suggestions.
    7. Due to the path traversal or malicious absolute path, the extension may traverse outside the intended workspace directory and list files and directories from sensitive locations beyond the user’s project, such as system configuration files or other sensitive data.
    8. This allows the attacker to gain file path suggestions for directories and files outside the workspace, potentially exposing sensitive information about the file system structure and existence of files to an attacker observing the suggestions.

- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially discover the existence of files and directories outside the intended workspace, including sensitive configuration files, source code, or data, by observing the path suggestions provided by the extension. This could expose system configuration files, application secrets, or user data, depending on the configured malicious path and the file system permissions.
    - **Increased Attack Surface:** Knowledge of the file system structure outside the workspace can aid an attacker in planning further attacks, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities or gaining unauthorized access.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension currently does not perform any sanitization or validation on user-defined mapping paths or the `absolutePathTo` setting. The code simply normalizes and joins the user-supplied path without validating that the resulting path is “inside” an allowed base directory. No explicit checks are implemented in the core functions (`getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` and `getChildrenOfPath`) to constrain the resolved file system path.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** The extension should validate user-defined mapping paths and the `absolutePathTo` setting to prevent path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`) and ensure they are within allowed boundaries.
    - **Path Sanitization:** Sanitize the mapping `value` and `absolutePathTo` by resolving them against the workspace root and ensuring they stay within the workspace boundaries.
    - **Restrict Path Resolution:** Ensure that path resolution for mappings and absolute paths is limited to within the workspace directory and does not allow traversal to parent directories or arbitrary absolute paths outside the workspace, unless explicitly and securely allowed.
    - **Boundary Checks:** Implement additional boundary checks before calling file system APIs (`vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory`, `vscode.workspace.fs.stat`) to list directories. Verify that the resolved path is guaranteed to lie inside an approved directory (for example, by checking that it is a child of the workspace folder).
    - **Warning Mechanism:** Implement a warning mechanism to inform users about the security risks associated with using absolute paths and custom mappings, especially when pointing outside the workspace.
    - **Security Context and APIs:** Consider using VS Code's security context and APIs to ensure that file system operations are performed with the appropriate permissions and restrictions.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to configure workspace settings for VSCode. In typical scenarios, this means the attacker needs to convince a developer to open a workspace with a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file or to manually add a malicious mapping or absolute path configuration in their user or workspace settings. This is typically possible if the attacker can open a workspace and modify its settings (e.g., if they can contribute to a shared workspace or are using their own).
    - The user must have the Path Intellisense extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - The user must trigger path completion within a workspace that has been configured with malicious mappings or `absolutePathTo` settings by typing an import statement or similar path in an opened file within the workspace.
    - The workspace or file location used as the base for path resolution must be such that directory traversal can “escape” into sensitive areas (i.e. the resolved path is not already sandboxed).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File: `/src/utils/file-utills.ts` Function: `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles`**:
        ```typescript
        export function getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles(
          fileName: string,
          text: string | undefined,
          rootPath?: string,
          mappings?: Mapping[]
        ): string {
          // ...
          const mapping = // ... mapping is selected based on `text` and `mappings`
          // ...
          let rootFolder, pathEntered;
          if (mapping) {
            rootFolder = mapping.value; // Vulnerable point: mapping.value from user config is directly used as rootFolder
            pathEntered = normalizedText.slice(
              path.normalize(mapping.key).length,
              normalizedText.length
            );
          } else {
            // ...
            rootFolder = isPathAbsolute ? rootPath || "" : path.dirname(fileName);
            if (!configuration.absolutePathToWorkspace && isPathAbsolute) {
              rootFolder = configuration.absolutePathTo || path.parse(rootPath || "").root; // Vulnerable point: absolutePathTo from user config is directly used as rootFolder
            } else {
              rootFolder = isPathAbsolute ? rootPath || "" : path.dirname(fileName);
            }
            pathEntered = normalizedText;
          }

          return path.join(rootFolder, pathEntered); // Vulnerable point: path.join with unsanitized rootFolder
        }
        ```
        - The `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` function calculates the path to lookup files for autocompletion.
        - If a mapping is used, the `mapping.value` from user configuration is directly assigned to `rootFolder`.
        - If `absolutePathToWorkspace` is `false` and the path is absolute, the `configuration.absolutePathTo` is directly assigned to `rootFolder`.
        - The function then uses `path.join(rootFolder, pathEntered)` to construct the final lookup path.
        - If `mapping.value` or `configuration.absolutePathTo` contains path traversal sequences or points to a sensitive absolute path, `path.join` will resolve them, potentially leading to path traversal outside the workspace or access to sensitive directories.
    2. **File: `/src/configuration/configuration.service.ts` Function: `getMappings` and `getConfiguration`**:
        ```typescript
        async function getMappings(
          configuration: vscode.WorkspaceConfiguration,
          workfolder?: vscode.WorkspaceFolder
        ): Promise<Mapping[]> {
          const mappings = parseMappings(configuration["mappings"]); // User mappings are parsed
          // ...
          return replaceWorkspaceFolder(allMappings, workfolder); // Workspace folder placeholder is replaced, but no path sanitization
        }

        async function getConfiguration(
          config: vscode.WorkspaceConfiguration,
          rootPath?: string
        ): Promise<Configuration> {
          return {
            absolutePathToWorkspace: config.get<boolean>(
              "absolutePathToWorkspace",
              true
            ) as boolean,
            absolutePathTo: config.get<string>("absolutePathTo", "") as string, // absolutePathTo from user config is retrieved
            mappings: await getMappings(config), // Mappings from user config are retrieved
            // ...
          };
        }
        ```
        - The `getMappings` function retrieves mappings from the configuration. `parseMappings` simply converts the configuration object to an array of `Mapping` objects. `replaceWorkspaceFolder` replaces workspace folder placeholders but does not sanitize path traversal sequences in the `value`.
        - The `getConfiguration` function retrieves `absolutePathTo` and `absolutePathToWorkspace` settings directly from the VSCode configuration without any sanitization.
    3. **File: `/src/configuration/mapping.service.ts` Function: `replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath`**:
        ```typescript
        export function replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath(
          value: string,
          rootPath: string
        ) {
          return value
            .replace("${workspaceRoot}", rootPath)
            .replace("${workspaceFolder}", rootPath); // Only placeholder replacement, no sanitization
        }
        ```
        - `replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath` only replaces placeholders and does not perform any path sanitization to prevent traversal.
    4. **File: `/src/utils/file-utills.ts` Function: `getChildrenOfPath`**:
        ```typescript
        export async function getChildrenOfPath(path: string): Promise<string[]> {
          try {
            return await vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory(vscode.Uri.file(path)); // Vulnerable point: path from user config is directly used in file system API
          } catch (e) {
            return [];
          }
        }
        ```
        - The `getChildrenOfPath` function uses the potentially malicious `path` directly to call `vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory(vscode.Uri.file(path))`, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**

    **Test Case 1: Malicious Workspace Mapping**
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace and open it.
    2. Create a folder named `sensitive-directory` at the same level as your workspace root directory (i.e., parent directory of the workspace root).
    3. Inside `sensitive-directory`, create a file named `sensitive.txt` with some sensitive content.
    4. Inside the workspace root, create a file (e.g., `test.js`).
    5. Open the `test.js` file in VSCode editor.
    6. Open VSCode settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
    7. Go to Workspace settings and search for "path-intellisense mappings".
    8. Add a new mapping with:
        - Key: `sensitive`
        - Value: `${workspaceFolder}/../sensitive-directory`
    9. In `test.js`, type `import {} from "sensitive/` (or any other import statement and trigger character that activates path completion).
    10. Observe the completion suggestions.
    11. **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** The completion list will include `sensitive.txt` from the `sensitive-directory` which is located outside the workspace root, demonstrating path traversal.
    12. **Expected Result (Mitigated):** The completion list should only include files and directories within the workspace, and should not list `sensitive.txt` or any content from outside the workspace root when using the malicious mapping.

    **Test Case 2: Malicious Absolute Path Configuration**
    1. Create a new VS Code workspace and open it.
    2. Create a workspace settings file at `.vscode/settings.json` with the following JSON content to configure malicious absolute path:
       ```json
       {
           "path-intellisense.absolutePathTo": "/etc",
           "path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace": false,
           "path-intellisense.showOnAbsoluteSlash": true
       }
       ```
    3. Create a new JavaScript file named `test.js` in the root of the workspace.
    4. Open `test.js` and insert the following line: `import {} from "/`; (ensure the cursor is immediately after the `/` to trigger completion).
    5. Observe the completion suggestions that appear.
    6. **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** The completion list should display a list of directories and files from the `/etc/` directory of the system, indicating that the malicious absolute path configuration is being used and the extension is listing content from outside the intended workspace scope. This confirms the information disclosure vulnerability.
    7. **Expected Result (Mitigated):** The completion list should only include files and directories within the workspace, and should not list content from `/etc/` or any other absolute path outside the workspace when using the malicious absolute path configuration.

    **Test Case 3: Directory Traversal via Import Path in File**
    1. Prepare a file in a test workspace (or open a file that is part of a repository) with an import statement such as:
        ```javascript
        import {} from "../../../../etc/"
        ```
    2. Open this file in VS Code so that the extension’s provider is activated.
    3. Position the cursor inside (or immediately after) the quoted path portion of the import statement.
    4. Trigger the auto‑completion manually (for example, by using the command palette or by typing a trigger character).
    5. Observe the list of suggested completions returned by the extension.
    6. **Expected Result (Vulnerable):** If the returned list includes entries corresponding to directories or files found in `/etc` (or another sensitive parent directory), the test is successful—that is, the vulnerability is confirmed.
    7. **Expected Result (Mitigated):** The completion list should only include files and directories within the workspace and should not list content from `/etc` or any other directory outside the intended scope when using path traversal in the import path.
