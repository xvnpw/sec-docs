## Vulnerabilities

### Path Traversal via Malicious Workspace Mappings

- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal via Malicious Workspace Mappings
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious VS Code workspace configuration file (`.code-workspace` or workspace settings).
    2. Within this configuration, the attacker defines a custom path mapping in the `path-intellisense.mappings` setting.
    3. The attacker sets up a mapping that points to a sensitive directory on the user's file system, for example, mapping a key like `/sensitive-files` or `/` to the root directory `/` or a user's home directory (`~`).
    4. The attacker then distributes or socially engineers a victim user into opening this malicious workspace in VS Code, ensuring the victim has the "Path Intellisense" extension installed and active. This could be via a public repository or by tricking a user into opening it.
    5. Once the workspace is opened, and the user is working on a project file (e.g., JavaScript, TypeScript, Nix files), the attacker can trigger the vulnerability by inducing the user to initiate path completion within an import or require statement. This is typically done by typing a forward slash `/` or a configured mapping key, depending on the malicious mapping setup.
    6. When the user starts typing a path in a supported file type (like JavaScript, Nix, or any file due to the default provider) that begins with the malicious mapping key (e.g., `/sensitive-files/` or `/`), the Path Intellisense extension uses the configured mapping.
    7. The extension resolves the path based on the malicious mapping, effectively changing the root directory for path completion to the attacker-specified sensitive directory.
    8. The extension then reads the directory contents of the sensitive location and suggests files and folders from that directory in the autocompletion list.
    9. This allows the attacker to indirectly browse the victim's file system through the Path Intellisense extension and potentially discover sensitive file paths and names, disclosing directory structures, filenames, and even sensitive information contained in filenames that they would not normally have access to within the context of their intended project workspace. This information is disclosed directly within the VS Code editor's autocompletion suggestion UI.
- **Impact:**
    - Information Disclosure: A malicious workspace can be crafted to expose the file structure and filenames from sensitive directories on a victim's system. This can aid in further attacks by revealing configuration files, internal scripts, or other sensitive information. A malicious workspace can be crafted to list directory contents from sensitive locations outside the intended workspace. This can reveal sensitive file names and directory structure to the user opening the malicious workspace.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None: The extension currently allows users to define arbitrary mappings without restrictions or validation on the target paths. None specifically within the extension to prevent this misconfiguration risk. VS Code's workspace trust feature provides a general security boundary for untrusted workspaces but does not specifically address this configuration-based path listing issue within extensions.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for user-defined mappings to ensure that they are within safe boundaries (e.g., within the workspace). The extension should validate that the mapped `value` paths are within the workspace or at least provide a warning to the user if a mapping points to an absolute path outside the workspace.
    - Restricting mappings to be relative to the workspace folder or a predefined set of allowed directories. Implementation of a configuration option to restrict custom mappings to only allow workspace-relative paths, preventing the use of absolute paths in mappings altogether.
    - Displaying a warning to the user when a mapping points outside the current workspace, especially to sensitive areas like the root directory or home directories.
    - Implementing a permission model for mappings, potentially requiring user confirmation before resolving paths outside the workspace.
    - Documentation enhancement to explicitly warn users about the security risks of using absolute paths in custom mappings, especially concerning potential information disclosure if mappings are misconfigured or maliciously set by an untrusted workspace.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim user must have the Path Intellisense extension installed in VS Code.
    - The victim user must open a malicious VS Code workspace that contains crafted settings for the Path Intellisense extension. The victim user must open a malicious VS Code workspace crafted by the attacker.
    - The malicious workspace settings must define a path mapping that points to a sensitive directory. The malicious workspace must contain a configuration that sets a path mapping in `path-intellisense.mappings` to a sensitive absolute path (e.g., `/`, `~`, etc.).
    - The user must trigger path completion within a file type supported by the extension (JavaScript, Nix, or any file due to the default provider) and use the malicious mapping prefix. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by inducing the user to initiate path completion within an import or require statement.
    - The `path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace` setting must be set to `false` or not explicitly set (as default is `true`, setting it to `false` increases the risk for absolute paths if mappings are used).
    - The `path-intellisense.showOnAbsoluteSlash` setting should be enabled (`true`) if the mapping key is `/` to trigger completion on typing `/`.
- **Source code analysis:**
    1. `src/configuration/configuration.service.ts`: The `getConfiguration` function reads the `path-intellisense.mappings` configuration from VS Code settings:
    ```typescript
    const cfgExtension = getConfig("path-intellisense");
    const mappings = await getMappings(cfgExtension, workspaceFolder);
    ```
    2. `src/configuration/configuration.service.ts`: The `getMappings` function retrieves mappings and passes them to `replaceWorkspaceFolder`:
    ```typescript
    async function getMappings(
      configuration: vscode.WorkspaceConfiguration,
      workfolder?: vscode.WorkspaceFolder
    ): Promise<Mapping[]> {
      const mappings = parseMappings(configuration["mappings"]);
      // ...
      const allMappings = [...mappings, ...tsConfigMappings];
      return replaceWorkspaceFolder(allMappings, workfolder);
    }
    ```
    3. `src/configuration/mapping.service.ts`: The `parseMappings` function directly parses the user-provided mappings without validation:
    ```typescript
    export function parseMappings(mappings: { [key: string]: string }): Mapping[] {
      return Object.entries(mappings).map(([key, value]) => ({ key, value }));
    }
    ```
    4. `src/utils/file-utills.ts`: The `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` function uses these mappings. If a typed path starts with a mapping key, it uses the mapping's value as the root folder for file lookup:
    ```typescript
    export function getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles(
      fileName: string,
      text: string | undefined,
      rootPath?: string,
      mappings?: Mapping[]
    ): string {
      // ...
      const mapping =
        mappings &&
        mappings.reduce((prev: any, curr: any) => {
          return (
            prev || (normalizedText.startsWith(path.normalize(curr.key)) && curr)
          );
        }, undefined);

      let rootFolder, pathEntered;
      if (mapping) {
        rootFolder = mapping.value; // Mapping value is directly used as rootFolder
        pathEntered = normalizedText.slice(
          path.normalize(mapping.key).length,
          normalizedText.length
        );
      } else {
        rootFolder = isPathAbsolute ? rootPath || "" : path.dirname(fileName);
        pathEntered = normalizedText;
      }

      return path.join(rootFolder, pathEntered); // Path is joined with the potentially malicious rootFolder
    }
    ```
    5. `src/utils/file-utills.ts`:  `getChildrenOfPath` then reads the directory at the potentially attacker-controlled path:
    ```typescript
    export async function getChildrenOfPath(
      path: string, // Path from getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles
      showHiddenFiles: boolean,
      filesExclude: FilesExclude
    ) {
      try {
        const filesTubles = await vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory( // Reads directory based on the path
          vscode.Uri.file(path)
        );
        // ...
      } catch (error) {
        return [];
      }
    }
    ```
    6. `src/providers/javascript/javascript.provider.ts` and `src/providers/nixos/nixos.provider.ts`: These providers use `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` and `getChildrenOfPath` to generate completion items, thus being affected by the malicious mappings.

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User types path with mapping prefix] --> B(getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles);
        B --> C{Mapping found?};
        C -- Yes --> D[Use mapping.value as rootFolder];
        C -- No --> E[Determine rootFolder based on workspace];
        D --> F[Join rootFolder and typed path];
        E --> F;
        F --> G(getChildrenOfPath);
        G --> H[vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory(path)];
        H --> I[Return file suggestions from potentially sensitive path];
    ```

- **Security test case:**
    1. Create a new directory named `path-intellisense-test-workspace`.
    2. Inside `path-intellisense-test-workspace`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content. This configuration maps `/sensitive` to the root directory `/`:
    ```json
    {
        "path-intellisense.mappings": {
            "/sensitive": "/"
        },
        "path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace": false,
        "path-intellisense.showOnAbsoluteSlash": true
    }
    ```
    4. Inside `path-intellisense-test-workspace`, create a file named `test.js` with the following content:
    ```javascript
    import {} from "/sensitive/et
    ```
    5. Open VS Code and open the `path-intellisense-test-workspace` folder.
    6. Open the `test.js` file.
    7. Place the cursor after `/sensitive/et` in the import statement.
    8. Trigger code completion (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+Space or just waiting for it to appear).
    9. Observe the completion suggestions. Verify that the suggestions include files and directories from the root directory `/` (like `etc`, `usr`, `var`, etc.), which are outside the workspace. This confirms that the mapping is working and allows access outside the intended workspace scope.
    10. Alternatively, use the following `settings.json` to map root directly to `/` and test typing `/` in `test.js`:
       ```json
       {
           "path-intellisense.mappings": {
               "/": "/"
           },
           "path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace": false,
           "path-intellisense.showOnAbsoluteSlash": true
       }
       ```
    11. In `test.js`, type `import {} from "/"` and observe the autocompletion suggestions which should list root directory contents.


### Arbitrary Directory Traversal in File Lookup

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Directory Traversal in File Lookup
- **Description:**
  The extension builds file paths for autocompletion by taking the user‑supplied “import” string (or similar text fragment) and passing it into the helper function that determines the lookup folder. In particular, the function `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` calls `path.normalize` on the import text and then joins it with a “root folder” (either inferred from the current file’s directory or from a workspace setting such as `absolutePathTo`). Because the normalized text is not validated for traversal sequences such as `"../"`, an attacker who crafts a malicious import (for example, by inserting `"../../"` or other directory‐traversal segments) can force the extension to resolve and enumerate directories outside the intended workspace boundaries. In a publicly available instance of the extension (for example, when a user opens a file that contains a carefully crafted import statement from an untrusted source) the attacker can trigger the vulnerability to reveal otherwise unexpected file and folder listings.
- **Impact:**
  - An attacker can cause the extension to list files and directories located outside the intended workspace (or project) directory.
  - Sensitive files or directory structure information (which may include configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data) may be disclosed directly via autocompletion suggestions.
  - The disclosure of such file system information increases the risk for further targeted attacks or social engineering.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The code uses Node’s `path.normalize` and `path.join` functions to process the input but does not perform any explicit sanitization or boundary checking to ensure that the resulting path is confined to the intended folder.
  - There is a configuration option (`showOnAbsoluteSlash`) that—when enabled—allows import strings beginning with “/” to be processed, but no further restrictions are imposed.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input sanitization or whitelist checking to disallow relative segments (for example, any use of `"../"`) that would cause the resolved path to leave the allowed (e.g. workspace) directory.
  - Enforcement of boundary restrictions so that even after path normalization and joining, the resolved path is verified to lie within an approved directory (for example, by comparing the resolved path against the absolute workspace path).
- **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker must be able to supply or cause the opening of a file containing a malicious import or path string that is processed by the extension.
  - The extension’s configuration should allow processing of absolute or relative paths in a way that the crafted input is accepted (for instance, when `showOnAbsoluteSlash` is true or the import string begins with a dot).
  - The workspace (or file system) must contain directories outside the intended target that could expose sensitive file names or directory structures.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` the input parameter `text` (the import string) is normalized with:
    ```javascript
    const normalizedText = path.normalize(text || "");
    ```
    This call converts a user‑supplied string (which may include traversal sequences) into a normalized path but does not remove `"../"` segments.
  - The function then checks if the text starts with a path separator to decide whether to use a configured root folder or the current file’s directory:
    ```javascript
    rootFolder = isPathAbsolute ? rootPath || "" : path.dirname(fileName);
    ```
  - Finally, the function returns:
    ```javascript
    return path.join(rootFolder, pathEntered);
    ```
    Because no check is made to ensure that `path.join`’s result does not escape the root folder, an attacker’s input such as `"../../../../../etc"` could cause the function to resolve a folder outside the project.
  - The result is used in `getChildrenOfPath`, which calls:
    ```javascript
    const filesTubles = await vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory(vscode.Uri.file(path))
    ```
    This call will attempt to enumerate the contents of the resolved directory—even if it lies outside of the intended boundaries—and subsequently display the file names as autocompletion suggestions.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Preparation:**
     - Create a new file in the workspace (for example, `malicious.js`) and add an import statement with a crafted path.
  2. **Test Steps:**
     - In `malicious.js`, add a line similar to:
       ```javascript
       import {} from "../../../../../etc/";
       ```
       (The exact number of `"../"` segments should be adjusted to target a directory outside the intended workspace boundary.)
     - Open the file in VS Code so that the extension is activated and the autocompletion provider is triggered.
     - Place the cursor after the import path and invoke the autocompletion command (for example, by pressing the trigger key such as `/` or by using the VS Code autocompletion shortcut).
  3. **Expected Result:**
     - Rather than only listing files from within the project/workspace directory, the autocompletion list includes entries from the directory obtained by the malicious path (for example, system directories such as `/etc` on Unix‑like systems).
     - This confirms that the extension has allowed directory traversal beyond expected bounds.
  4. **Cleanup:**
     - Remove the test file after verifying the vulnerability.

This vulnerability highlights the risk of relying solely on path normalization and joining without enforcing a strict boundary check. Implementing proper sanitization and path-boundary enforcement is necessary to mitigate the risk of arbitrary file disclosure.
