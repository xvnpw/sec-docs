* Vulnerability name: Path Traversal via Malicious Workspace Configuration

* Description:
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious workspace configuration file (e.g., `.code-workspace`) or modify user settings to include a malicious mapping in the `path-intellisense.mappings` setting.
    2. This malicious mapping can define a key that, when used in an import statement, resolves to a path outside the intended workspace scope, potentially allowing access to arbitrary files on the user's file system.
    3. When a user opens a workspace containing this malicious configuration and triggers path completion within a file, the extension will use the attacker-defined mapping.
    4. If the user types an import statement that starts with the malicious mapping key, the extension will attempt to read directory contents based on the attacker-controlled path.
    5. The `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` function uses the mapping to construct the path to lookup files. If the mapping value points outside the workspace, this function will return a path outside the workspace.
    6. The `getChildrenOfPath` function then reads the directory content of the constructed path. If the path is outside the workspace and accessible by the user, the extension will list the files and directories in that location and present them as completion suggestions.
    7. While the extension itself might not directly expose file contents, it allows an attacker to enumerate the file system and potentially leak information about directory structures and filenames outside the intended workspace. This information can be valuable for further attacks.

* Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially enumerate directories and filenames on the user's file system outside the intended workspace. This can reveal sensitive information about the user's system configuration, installed software, or personal files.
    - Increased Attack Surface: Knowledge of the file system structure can be used to plan further attacks, such as targeting specific files or directories for exploitation.

* Vulnerability rank: High

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None observed in the provided code. The extension uses user-provided mappings without validation against path traversal.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `path-intellisense.mappings` setting.
    - Restrict mapping values to be within the workspace or explicitly approved directories.
    - Implement checks in `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` to ensure the resolved path stays within the workspace.
    - Consider displaying a warning to the user when a mapping points outside the workspace.

* Preconditions:
    - The user must open a workspace or have user settings that include a malicious mapping in the `path-intellisense.mappings` configuration.
    - The attacker needs to convince the user to open this malicious workspace or modify their settings. This could be achieved through social engineering or by distributing a project with a crafted `.code-workspace` file.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **`src/configuration/configuration.service.ts` - `getMappings` function**:
        - This function retrieves mappings from the configuration and `tsconfig.json`.
        - It calls `parseMappings` and `replaceWorkspaceFolder` but lacks validation to ensure mappings are safe.
    2. **`src/configuration/mapping.service.ts` - `parseMappings` and `replaceWorkspaceFolder` functions**:
        - `parseMappings` simply converts the mapping object to an array of key-value pairs.
        - `replaceWorkspaceFolder` replaces placeholders but doesn't validate the resulting paths.
    3. **`src/utils/file-utills.ts` - `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` function**:
        - This function constructs the path to lookup files based on the provided text and mappings.
        - If a mapping is used, it directly uses the mapping's value as the root folder without validation.
        - If `isPathAbsolute` is true and no mapping is used, it uses `rootPath` (which can be workspace root or absolute path from settings) as root folder.
        - **Vulnerable part:**  The function doesn't prevent the resolved `rootFolder` from being outside the intended workspace if a malicious mapping is provided or `absolutePathToWorkspace` is set to false and a malicious `absolutePathTo` is provided.
    4. **`src/utils/file-utills.ts` - `getChildrenOfPath` function**:
        - This function reads the directory content using `vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory` based on the path provided by `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles`.
        - **Vulnerable part:** It directly uses the path without checking if it's within the workspace. If `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` returns a path outside the workspace due to a malicious mapping, `getChildrenOfPath` will access and list files from that arbitrary path.
    5. **`src/providers/javascript/javascript.provider.ts` and `src/providers/nixos/nixos.provider.ts` - `provide` function**:
        - These provider functions call `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` to get the path and then `getChildrenOfPath` to get file suggestions.
        - They use the results to create completion items, thus exposing the file system structure based on potentially malicious paths.

    ```

* Security test case:
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. In the workspace settings (settings.json or workspace.code-workspace), add a malicious mapping:
    ```json
    {
        "path-intellisense.mappings": {
            "@malicious": "/"
        }
    }
    ```
    3. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `test.js`) in the workspace.
    4. In `test.js`, type the following import statement: `import {} from "@malicious/et`
    5. Trigger code completion after `@malicious/et` (e.g., by pressing `/` or waiting for auto-completion).
    6. Observe the completion suggestions. They should include the root directory of the file system (e.g., "Applications", "Users", "Volumes" on macOS/Linux, or drive letters like "C:", "D:", etc. on Windows).
    7. This confirms that the malicious mapping allowed the extension to access and list files from the root directory, which is outside the intended workspace scope, demonstrating the path traversal vulnerability.
    8. **Expected Result:** Completion suggestions should be limited to the workspace or paths explicitly intended by the user within the workspace. Listing the root directory is a security vulnerability.
    9. **Successful Exploitation:** If the completion list shows directories from the root level of the filesystem, the vulnerability is successfully demonstrated.
