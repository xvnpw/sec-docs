Here is the combined list of vulnerabilities, formatted as markdown:

### Vulnerabilities

#### Path Traversal via Mappings Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can configure malicious path mappings in the Path Intellisense extension settings, either through workspace settings, user settings, or by crafting a malicious workspace configuration file (e.g., `.code-workspace`).
    2. These mappings can be crafted to point to locations outside of the intended workspace folder, potentially granting access to sensitive file system locations. For example, a mapping can be set such as `{"malicious": "/"}` or `{"/": "/"}`.
    3. When the extension is activated and a user starts typing a path in a workspace file (e.g., in an import statement), the extension uses these configured mappings to resolve paths for autocompletion.
    4. When the extension uses these mappings to resolve paths for autocompletion, it may inadvertently expose files and directories outside the workspace. For example, if a user types `import "malicious/etc/passwd"` or `import "///etc/passwd"` or `import "@malicious/et"`, and a malicious mapping is configured, the extension will attempt to resolve paths starting from the mapped root.
    5. The `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` function uses the mapping value as the `rootFolder` and joins it with the user-provided path, potentially constructing a path outside the intended workspace.
    6. Subsequently, the `getChildrenOfPath` function attempts to read the contents of this arbitrary path using `vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory` to provide autocompletion suggestions.
    7. By triggering autocompletion in a workspace with such malicious mappings configured, an attacker can potentially list and infer the existence of files and directories outside the workspace, and potentially from the entire file system if the VS Code process has sufficient permissions.

- **Impact:**
    - Information Disclosure. An attacker can potentially discover the existence of files and directories outside the workspace folder, including sensitive information if file names or directory structures reveal such details. In a more severe scenario, an attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the user's file system, including sensitive information like configuration files, credentials, or source code outside the intended workspace if the VSCode process running the extension has sufficient file system permissions to access the targeted files. This can also increase the attack surface by revealing system structure and potentially aiding in further targeted attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Workspace folder placeholder replacement in mappings: `${workspaceFolder}` and `${workspaceRoot}` are replaced with the workspace root path. This is intended to restrict mappings within the workspace.
    - Filtering mappings without workspace root in non-workspace folders: Mappings that contain workspace root placeholders are filtered out when no workspace folder is available.
    - *Note*: Some reports indicate "None" as currently implemented mitigations, suggesting that the placeholder replacement might not be considered a sufficient mitigation against path traversal in all scenarios, especially when malicious mappings are crafted to bypass these checks or use absolute paths directly.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for mapping values: The extension should validate and sanitize the values provided in the mappings configuration to ensure they remain within the intended scope, ideally within the workspace. It should prevent absolute paths outside the workspace or relative paths that can traverse out of the workspace. Restrict mapping values to be within the workspace or explicitly approved directories.
    - Workspace boundary enforcement: The extension should strictly enforce workspace boundaries when resolving paths based on mappings, preventing any path resolution that leads outside the workspace. Introduce checks in `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` or `getChildrenOfPath` to verify that the resolved path remains within the workspace boundaries before performing file system operations. If the resolved path goes outside the workspace, the extension should refuse to provide autocompletion suggestions for that path.
    - Path sanitization: Before using the constructed path with `vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory`, the extension should sanitize the path to prevent traversal outside the workspace. This could involve verifying that the resolved path remains within the workspace boundaries.
    - User warnings: The extension documentation and settings description should clearly warn users about the security risks associated with using absolute paths or mappings that could lead to path traversal. Consider displaying a warning to the user when a mapping points outside the workspace.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the Path Intellisense extension installed in VSCode.
    - The attacker needs to be able to configure workspace settings or user settings for a VS Code project where the Path Intellisense extension is active. This could be achieved if the attacker can influence the workspace settings (e.g., by contributing to a shared project or through a compromised development environment, by providing a malicious workspace configuration, or if the user unknowingly imports settings from an untrusted source). The attacker needs to convince the user to open this malicious workspace or modify their settings. This could be achieved through social engineering or by distributing a project with a crafted `.code-workspace` file.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`src/configuration/mapping.service.ts` - `parseMappings` and `replaceWorkspaceFolder`:**
        ```typescript
        export function parseMappings(mappings: { [key: string]: string }): Mapping[] {
          return Object.entries(mappings).map(([key, value]) => ({ key, value }));
        }

        export function replaceWorkspaceFolder(
          mappings: Mapping[],
          workfolder?: vscode.WorkspaceFolder
        ): Mapping[] {
          const rootPath = workfolder?.uri.path;

          if (rootPath) {
            /** Replace placeholder with workspace folder */
            return mappings.map(({ key, value }) => ({
              key,
              value: replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath(value, rootPath),
            }));
          } else {
            /** Filter items out which contain a workspace root */
            return mappings.filter(({ value }) => !valueContainsWorkspaceFolder(value));
          }
        }
        ```
        - `parseMappings` simply converts the mapping object from settings into an array of `Mapping` objects. No validation is performed here.
        - `replaceWorkspaceFolder` replaces placeholders and filters mappings for non-workspace folders. However, it doesn't prevent malicious values in mappings from being set in the first place if they resolve within the workspace but point outside the intended project directory within the workspace, or absolute paths that point outside the workspace.

    2. **`src/utils/file-utills.ts` - `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles`:**
        ```typescript
        export function getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles(
          fileName: string,
          text: string | undefined,
          rootPath?: string,
          mappings?: Mapping[]
        ): string {
          const normalizedText = path.normalize(text || "");
          const isPathAbsolute = normalizedText.startsWith(path.sep);

          const mapping =
            mappings &&
            mappings.reduce((prev: any, curr: any) => {
              return (
                prev || (normalizedText.startsWith(path.normalize(curr.key)) && curr)
              );
            }, undefined);

          let rootFolder, pathEntered;
          if (mapping) {
            rootFolder = mapping.value; // User-defined mapping value is used directly as rootFolder
            pathEntered = normalizedText.slice(
              path.normalize(mapping.key).length,
              normalizedText.length
            );
          } else {
            rootFolder = isPathAbsolute ? rootPath || "" : path.dirname(fileName); // rootPath can be from absolutePathTo setting (user-defined)
            pathEntered = normalizedText;
          }

          return path.join(rootFolder, pathEntered); // Path is constructed by joining rootFolder and pathEntered
        }
        ```
        - This function uses the configured mappings. If a mapping key matches the start of the input text, it uses the mapping's value as the `rootFolder`.
        - The `rootFolder` from the mapping value is directly used in `path.join` without further validation. If a malicious mapping like `"malicious": "/"` or `{"/": "/"}` is configured, and the user types "malicious/" or "///etc/passwd", the `rootFolder` will be "/" or derived from "/", and the path resolution will start from the root of the file system. The `rootFolder` can be directly controlled by the user through mappings or the `absolutePathTo` setting. `path.join` is used to combine `rootFolder` and user-provided `pathEntered`.

    3. **`src/utils/file-utills.ts` - `getChildrenOfPath`:**
        ```typescript
        export async function getChildrenOfPath(
          path: string,
          showHiddenFiles: boolean,
          filesExclude: FilesExclude
        ) {
          try {
            const filesTubles = await vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory( // Uses path to read directory
              vscode.Uri.file(path)
            );
            // ...
          } catch (error) {
            return [];
          }
        }
        ```
        - `vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory` is used with the potentially attacker-influenced `path`. This function uses the path constructed by `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` to read directory contents.

    4. **`src/configuration/configuration.service.ts` - `getMappings`:**
        ```typescript
        async function getMappings(
          configuration: vscode.WorkspaceConfiguration,
          workfolder?: vscode.WorkspaceFolder
        ): Promise<Mapping[]> {
          const mappings = parseMappings(configuration["mappings"]); // Load mappings from configuration
          // ...
          return replaceWorkspaceFolder(allMappings, workfolder);
        }
        ```
        - Mappings are directly loaded from the `path-intellisense.mappings` setting without validation.

    5. **`src/providers/javascript/javascript.provider.ts` and `src/providers/nixos/nixos.provider.ts` - `provide` function:**
        ```typescript
        async function provide(
          context: Context,
          config: Config
        ): Promise<vscode.CompletionItem[]> {
          const workspace = vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder(context.document.uri);

          const rootPath =
            config.absolutePathTo ||
            (config.absolutePathToWorkspace ? workspace?.uri.fsPath : undefined);

          const path = getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles(
            context.document.uri.fsPath,
            context.fromString,
            rootPath,
            config.mappings
          );

          const childrenOfPath = await getChildrenOfPath(
            path,
            config.showHiddenFiles,
            config.filesExclude
          );

          return [
            ...childrenOfPath.map((child) =>
              createPathCompletionItem(child, config, context)
            ),
          ];
        }
        ```
        - These provider functions call `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` to get the path and then `getChildrenOfPath` to get file suggestions. They use the results to create completion items, thus exposing the file system structure based on potentially malicious paths.

        M --> N(createPathCompletionItem);
        N --> O[Completion Items displayed in VSCode];
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open VS Code in a workspace (e.g., any folder as a VSCode workspace).
    2. Open the workspace settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings, then Workspace tab) or User Settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings, then User tab), or directly edit workspace settings in `settings.json` or create/edit `.code-workspace` file.
    3. In the settings, search for "path-intellisense.mappings" and edit the settings in `settings.json` or `.code-workspace`.
    4. Add a malicious mapping like this:
        ```json
        "path-intellisense.mappings": {
            "malicious": "/"
        }
        ```
        or
        ```json
        "path-intellisense.mappings": {
            "/": "/"
        }
        ```
        or
        ```json
        {
            "path-intellisense.mappings": {
                "@malicious": "/"
            }
        }
        ```
    5. Open any JavaScript file within the workspace (e.g., `demo-workspace/project-one/index.js` or create a new `test.js`).
    6. In the JavaScript file, type `import {} from "malicious/` (or `require("malicious/` or `export * from "malicious/`) or `import "///etc/passwd` or `import {} from "@malicious/et`.
    7. Trigger code completion after the malicious path prefix (e.g., by typing `/` or waiting for auto-completion, or pressing `Ctrl+Space`).
    8. Observe the autocompletion suggestions. If the vulnerability exists, you will see file system root directory contents (e.g., "Applications", "Users", "Program Files" etc. on macOS/Linux/Windows respectively) in the suggestions. Or, depending on the mapping and path used, you might see entries from `/etc/passwd` or `C:/Windows/win.ini` being suggested as completion items.
    9. To further verify, select one of the suggestions that looks like it's from outside your workspace. While the extension may not directly display the content, successful completion listing of system files confirms the path traversal vulnerability.
    10. This confirms that the malicious mapping allowed the extension to access and list files from the root directory, which is outside the intended workspace scope, demonstrating the path traversal vulnerability.
    11. **Expected Result:** Completion suggestions should be limited to the workspace or paths explicitly intended by the user within the workspace. Listing the root directory or system files is a security vulnerability.
    12. **Successful Exploitation:** If the completion list shows directories from the root level of the filesystem, or system files like `/etc/passwd` or `C:/Windows/win.ini`, the vulnerability is successfully demonstrated.
