### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Package Subfolder Intellisense
* Description:
    1. The extension's "Package Subfolder Intellisense" feature, when enabled, allows listing files and folders within `node_modules` based on the path provided in the import statement.
    2. When a user types an import statement like `import 'package-name/subfolder'`, the extension attempts to read subfolders of the module `package-name` within `node_modules`.
    3. The code in `src/provide.ts` in the `readModuleSubFolders` function splits the import path by `/` and constructs a file path by joining `workspace.rootPath`, `node_modules`, and the split path fragments.
    4. If a user crafts a malicious import path containing path traversal sequences like `..`, it's possible to traverse up the directory structure starting from `node_modules`.
    5. This allows an attacker to list the contents of directories within the `node_modules` folder or potentially traverse to other locations within the workspace, depending on the input path. Although `readDir` is used, limiting the impact to listing directory contents, it still constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability.
* Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially list files and directories within the `node_modules` directory and potentially traverse to other parts of the workspace, gaining knowledge of the project structure and potentially sensitive file names. This information can be used to understand the project's dependencies and internal structure, potentially revealing sensitive information or aiding in further targeted attacks.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None: The code directly uses the user-provided path fragments to construct the file path without sanitization in `readModuleSubfolders` function in `src/provide.ts`.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Path Sanitization: The `pkgFragmentSplit` obtained from the user input in `readModuleSubfolders` function in `src/provide.ts` should be sanitized to prevent path traversal. Specifically, path traversal sequences like `..` should be removed or neutralized before constructing the file path using `path.join`.
* Preconditions:
    - The `npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense` setting must be enabled in the user's VSCode settings.
    - The user must be working in a workspace with a `node_modules` directory.
    - The user must be typing an import statement that triggers the completion provider.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`src/provide.ts:readModuleSubFolders` function:**
    ```typescript
    function readModuleSubFolders(dependencies: string[], state: State, fsf: FsFunctions) {
        const fragments: Array<string> = state.textCurrentLine.split('from ');
        const pkgFragment: string = fragments[fragments.length - 1].split(/['"]/)[1];
        const pkgFragmentSplit = pkgFragment.split('/');
        const packageName: string = pkgFragmentSplit[0];

        if (dependencies.filter(dep => dep === packageName).length) {
            const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit); // Vulnerable path construction
            // Todo: make the replace function work with other filetypes as well
            return fsf.readDir(path)
                .then(files => files.map(file => pkgFragment + file.replace(/\.js$/, '')))
                .catch(err => ['']);
        }

        return Promise.resolve(dependencies);
    }
    ```
    2. The `pkgFragmentSplit` is directly derived from `state.textCurrentLine`, which is user-controlled.
    3. This `pkgFragmentSplit` is then used in `path.join` to construct the path to read directory contents using `fsf.readDir(path)`.
    4. If `pkgFragmentSplit` contains `..`, `path.join` will resolve it, allowing traversal outside the intended module directory.
    5. **Visualization:**
        ```
        User Input (textCurrentLine): import 'package-a/../../package-b/...'
        pkgFragment: package-a/../../package-b/...
        pkgFragmentSplit: ['package-a', '..', '..', 'package-b', '...']
        path constructed by path.join: /workspace/root/node_modules/package-a/../../package-b/... (resolves to /workspace/root/node_modules/package-b/...)
        fsf.readDir(path) is called, potentially listing files from unintended directories.
        ```
* Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-test setup:**
        - Create a new VSCode workspace.
        - Create a `package.json` file in the workspace root with the following content:
          ```json
          {
            "dependencies": {
              "package-a": "1.0.0",
              "package-b": "1.0.0"
            }
          }
          ```
        - Run `npm install` in the workspace root to create `node_modules` directory and install `package-a` and `package-b`. (These packages don't need to actually exist in npm registry, npm will create empty folders).
        - Enable the `npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense` setting to `true` in VSCode settings.
        - Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `test.js`) in the workspace root.
        - Create files inside `node_modules`:
          - Create `node_modules/package-a/file-a.js` (can be empty).
          - Create `node_modules/package-b/file-b.js` (can be empty).
    2. **Steps to reproduce:**
        - Open the `test.js` file in the VSCode editor.
        - Type the following import statement, but do not press Enter: `import 'package-a/../package-b/` (Keep the cursor after the last `/`).
        - Observe the auto-completion suggestions provided by Npm Intellisense.
    3. **Expected Result:**
        - The auto-completion suggestions should include `file-b.js` (and potentially other files/folders from `node_modules/package-b/`). This indicates that the extension successfully traversed using `..` to list the contents of `node_modules/package-b/` when the user intended to browse subfolders of `package-a`.
    4. **Pass/Fail Criteria:**
        - **Fail:** If the auto-completion list contains `file-b.js` (or contents of `node_modules/package-b/`). This indicates successful path traversal and information disclosure.
        - **Pass:** If the auto-completion list does not contain `file-b.js` and path traversal is prevented (e.g., no suggestions or suggestions only relevant to `package-a`).
