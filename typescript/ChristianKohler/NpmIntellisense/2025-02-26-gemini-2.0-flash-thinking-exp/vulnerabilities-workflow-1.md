### Vulnerability 1: Path Traversal in Package Subfolder Intellisense

* **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal in Package Subfolder Intellisense
* **Description:**
    1. The Npm Intellisense extension, when the `packageSubfoldersIntellisense` feature is enabled, is vulnerable to path traversal when resolving module subfolders in import statements.
    2. When a user types an import statement like `import something from 'module-name/subfolder'`, the extension attempts to provide autocompletion for subfolders within the specified module in `node_modules`.
    3. The extension extracts a package fragment from the current line of code without proper sanitization. It splits the current line on the string `"from "` and then further splits by quotation marks to retrieve the module path.
    4. The extension constructs a file path by joining the workspace root, 'node_modules', and the user-provided module path fragment. This is done using Node's `path.join` function.
    5. If the user-provided path fragment in the import statement contains path traversal sequences like `..`, these sequences are resolved by `path.join`. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious import statement that includes directory traversal sequences inside the module path.
    6. Consequently, the extension may traverse out of the intended `node_modules` directory and access files and directories within the workspace, or even potentially outside the workspace depending on the workspace root and traversal depth.
    7. The `readDir` function is then used to list files in the constructed path. While `readDir` is intended for directories, path traversal allows listing the content of directories outside of `node_modules` but within or potentially outside the workspace.
    8. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive file listings through the auto-completion suggestions generated by the extension.

* **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially list directories and check for the existence of files within the workspace directory structure, and potentially outside of it, by crafting malicious import statements. This could expose sensitive project structure information, configuration files, source code file names, or even sensitive data stored outside of the project.
    - **Limited Arbitrary File Read (Listing):** While the vulnerability utilizes `readDir` which is intended for directories and might fail if traversal leads to a file directly, it effectively allows an attacker to list directory contents from unintended locations, potentially revealing sensitive information.
    - In a worst-case scenario, an attacker could gain insight into the file system layout or sensitive data, potentially escalating to further attacks if more sensitive information is revealed.

* **Vulnerability Rank:** High
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. There is no validation or sanitization performed on the extracted module path (the “pkgFragment” and its components) in the function used for module subfolder intellisense. The code directly uses the parts obtained from the current line without ensuring they conform to a safe or expected format. The code directly uses user-provided path fragments in `path.join` without sanitization or validation for path traversal sequences.

* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input sanitization:** Sanitize the `pkgFragmentSplit` array in `readModuleSubfolders` function to remove or reject path traversal sequences like `..`. Validate that the extracted module path does not contain any directory traversal sequences (such as `"../"`).
    - **Path validation:** After resolving the path using `path.join`, validate that the resolved path is still within the intended `node_modules` directory and within the workspace. Restrict file system operations so that—even if traversal sequences are present—the resolved path remains within the expected boundaries (for example, within the `node_modules` subdirectory of the workspace root).
    - **Whitelist allowed characters:** Enforce a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns for module names to prevent unexpected inputs.

* **Preconditions:**
    - The `npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense` setting must be enabled in the user's VS Code settings.
    - The user must be working within a VS Code workspace that has a `node_modules` directory and at least one dependency installed, listed in `package.json`. The workspace must contain a file in which the text (specifically, the import statement) can be manipulated.
    - The user must be in the process of typing an import statement that triggers the autocompletion. The workspace’s `package.json` lists a dependency name that will pass the dependency check (the code verifies that the first segment of the imported path exists as a dependency). This allows an attacker to include traversal segments in later parts of the path.

* **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/provide.ts`
    - Function: `readModuleSubFolders`
    ```typescript
    function readModuleSubFolders(dependencies: string[], state: State, fsf: FsFunctions) {
        const fragments: Array<string> = state.textCurrentLine.split('from ');
        const pkgFragment: string = fragments[fragments.length - 1].split(/['"]/)[1]; // User input from import statement
        const pkgFragmentSplit = pkgFragment.split('/'); // Split user input by '/'
        const packageName: string = pkgFragmentSplit[0];

        if (dependencies.filter(dep => dep === packageName).length) {
            const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit); // Vulnerable path construction - user input directly used in path.join
            // Todo: make the replace function work with other filetypes as well
            return fsf.readDir(path) // File system operation on potentially traversed path
                .then(files => files.map(file => pkgFragment + file.replace(/\.js$/, '')))
                .catch(err => ['']);
        }

        return Promise.resolve(dependencies);
    }
    ```
    1. The vulnerability lies in the line `const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit);`. The `pkgFragmentSplit` array, derived from user input `pkgFragment`, is directly used in `path.join` without any validation.
    2. The function `readModuleSubFolders` begins by splitting the current line on `"from "`: `const fragments: Array<string> = state.textCurrentLine.split('from ');`.
    3. It then obtains the package fragment by splitting the last token on quotation marks: `const pkgFragment: string = fragments[fragments.length - 1].split(/['"]/)[1];`. For a well-formed import, this would be a path like `"lodash/subfolder"`.
    4. If an attacker supplies an import such as: `import {} from 'lodash/../../../../etc'`, then `pkgFragment` becomes `"lodash/../../../../etc"`.
    5. The code splits this string into segments: `const pkgFragmentSplit = pkgFragment.split('/');` and `const packageName: string = pkgFragmentSplit[0];`. In this case, `packageName` is `"lodash"`. The function then checks whether this name exists in the dependencies. If it does, the check passes.
    6. The full file system path is built with: `const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit);`. Because `pkgFragmentSplit` contains several `"../"` segments, the normalized path may resolve outside of the intended directory.
    7. Finally, it reads the directory contents using: `return fsf.readDir(path) ...`. This call returns file listings from an arbitrary directory—potentially disclosing sensitive information.

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup the Environment:**
        - Open VS Code and create a new workspace or open an existing Javascript/Typescript project.
        - Ensure that the workspace root has a `package.json` file and run `npm install` to install dependencies (e.g., `lodash`).
        - Ensure that the user’s VS Code settings enable the package subfolder intellisense feature by setting `npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense` to `true`.
    2. **Craft a Malicious Import Statement:**
        - Create a new Javascript or Typescript file (e.g., `test.js`) in the workspace root.
        - In `test.js`, type the following import statement: `import _ from 'lodash/../../'` or `import {} from 'lodash/../../../../etc'` and place the cursor at the end of the line. Place the cursor inside the quotes so that `state.textCurrentLine` reflects this malicious string.
    3. **Trigger the Vulnerable Functionality:**
        - Wait for the autocompletion suggestions to appear. Invoke the auto-completion (for example, by triggering the completion provider or running the “npm-intellisense.import” command) so that the extension processes the current line.
    4. **Observe the Outcome:**
        - Observe the autocompletion list. The extension will use the malicious import string to build the path `join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', 'lodash', '..', '..', '..', '..', 'etc')`.
        - Verify that the resolved path points outside the expected directory (for example, it might resolve to the workspace root directory or a system directory such as `/path/to/etc`).
        - Check that the auto-completion suggestions now include filenames from the unauthorized directory. If the list contains files and directories from the workspace root directory (e.g., `package.json`, `test.js`, `node_modules`, `src`, etc.), or even system directories, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability. The extension is listing the contents of an unintended directory instead of subfolders within the `lodash` module inside `node_modules`.
    5. **Conclusion:**
        - If the test returns file names from outside the intended `node_modules` folder, the vulnerability is confirmed.
