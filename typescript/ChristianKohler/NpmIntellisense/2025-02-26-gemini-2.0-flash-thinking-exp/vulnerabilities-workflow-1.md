### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines security vulnerabilities identified in the Npm Intellisense extension. Each vulnerability is detailed with its description, potential impact, rank, implemented and missing mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and a security test case.

#### 1. Path Traversal in `readModuleSubFolders`

- **Description:**
    1. The user opens a JavaScript or TypeScript file in VSCode within a workspace that contains a `node_modules` directory.
    2. The user starts typing an import statement that includes a module name and a subfolder path, for example: `import X from 'module-name/`.
    3. The Npm Intellisense extension triggers autocompletion for subfolders within the specified module.
    4. The extension, in the `readModuleSubfolders` function, extracts the module path from the import statement.
    5. This extracted path is split into fragments by `/` and used to construct a path to the `node_modules` directory using `path.join`.
    6. If a malicious user crafts an import statement that includes path traversal sequences like `..` within the subfolder path (e.g., `import X from 'module-name/../../`), the `path.join` function will resolve this path, potentially leading to access outside the intended `node_modules` directory.
    7. The extension then attempts to read the directory at this potentially traversed path using `fsf.readDir`.
    8. This can allow an attacker to list directories outside of the `node_modules` directory, potentially gaining information about the file system structure. In more critical scenarios, depending on how this path is further used, it could potentially lead to arbitrary file reads or other file system operations outside the intended scope.

- **Impact:**
    - High - An attacker could potentially list directories outside the `node_modules` directory of the workspace. This information disclosure could aid in further attacks. Depending on how the traversed path is used in other parts of the extension (although not immediately apparent in the provided code, future modifications might expand its use), it could potentially escalate to arbitrary file reads within the user's workspace or even the system, depending on the permissions of the VSCode process.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None - The code directly uses the user-provided path fragments without any sanitization or validation before using `path.join`.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization of the path fragments extracted from the import statement in the `readModuleSubfolders` function.
    - Implement checks to ensure that path fragments do not contain path traversal sequences like `..`.
    - Consider using `path.resolve` with a controlled base path (like the workspace's `node_modules` directory) and then `path.join` the sanitized fragments to ensure the final path remains within the intended boundaries.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. VSCode with Npm Intellisense extension installed and activated.
    2. Workspace with a `node_modules` directory and at least one installed npm package.
    3. `npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense` setting enabled (or default to enabled).
    4. User is editing a JavaScript or TypeScript file and starts writing an import statement, triggering autocompletion within a module's path (after `from 'module-name/`).

- **Source code analysis:**
    ```typescript
    // /code/src/provide.ts
    function readModuleSubFolders(dependencies: string[], state: State, fsf: FsFunctions) {
        const fragments: Array<string> = state.textCurrentLine.split('from ');
        const pkgFragment: string = fragments[fragments.length - 1].split(/['"]/)[1];
        const pkgFragmentSplit = pkgFragment.split('/'); // Split user input path
        const packageName: string = pkgFragmentSplit[0];

        if (dependencies.filter(dep => dep === packageName).length) {
            const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit); // Path constructed with user input
            // ...
            return fsf.readDir(path) // Directory read operation on constructed path
                .then(files => files.map(file => pkgFragment + file.replace(/\.js$/, '')))
                .catch(err => ['']);
        }

        return Promise.resolve(dependencies);
    }
    ```
    - The `readModuleSubFolders` function takes user input from `state.textCurrentLine`, which represents the current line of code in the editor.
    - It extracts the module path using string manipulation (`split('from ')`, `split(/['"]/)[1]`).
    - The extracted path (`pkgFragment`) is then split into segments by `/` into `pkgFragmentSplit`.
    - Critically, `path.join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit)` directly uses these user-controlled path segments to construct a file path.
    - If `pkgFragmentSplit` contains elements like `'..'`, `path.join` will resolve them, potentially leading to a path outside of the intended `node_modules` directory.
    - The `fsf.readDir(path)` then attempts to read the directory at this potentially manipulated path.
    - There is no validation or sanitization of `pkgFragmentSplit` to prevent path traversal.

- **Security test case:**
    1.  Install the Npm Intellisense extension in VSCode.
    2.  Create a new workspace and initialize an npm project (`npm init -y`).
    3.  Install any npm package, for example: `npm install lodash`.
    4.  Enable the `npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense` setting in VSCode (`settings.json`):
        ```json
        {
            "npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense": true
        }
        ```
    5.  Create a new JavaScript (`.js`) or TypeScript (`.ts`) file in the workspace.
    6.  In the file, start typing an import statement for the installed package, but include path traversal characters:
        ```typescript
        import _ from 'lodash/../../';
        ```
    7.  Observe the behavior of the extension. In a vulnerable scenario, the extension might attempt to read directories outside of the `node_modules/lodash` directory, potentially even outside the `node_modules` directory itself.
    8.  To confirm path traversal, you would ideally need to monitor the file system calls made by VSCode or the extension. However, as an external attacker without direct access to the execution environment, you can look for indirect signs:
        - **Unexpected errors or behavior:** If the extension throws errors or behaves erratically after entering the path traversal sequence, it might indicate that it is attempting to access invalid paths, which is a symptom of path traversal attempts.
        - **Completion suggestions for directories outside `node_modules/lodash` (though less likely to be directly visible):** In a successful path traversal, if the extension were to list directory contents, and if you could somehow observe these suggestions (which might not be directly exposed in the UI for directory listings), you might see directories from higher up in the file system.

        **Note:** Directly observing file system access from an extension in VSCode as an external attacker is generally not possible. This test case relies on observing indirect effects. A more thorough test would require internal access or debugging tools. A mitigation would involve sanitizing the input path to prevent `..` sequences before using it in file system operations.

#### 2. Malicious Package Name Code Injection

- **Description:**
    The extension reads dependency names directly from a project’s package.json (via functions in `provide.ts` and later used by the auto import command in `command-import.ts`). An attacker who controls a repository’s package.json can provide a specially crafted dependency key (for example, one containing embedded quotes and code payloads) that, when interpolated into the auto import statement template, creates a malformed or malicious statement.
    **Steps to trigger:**
    1. An attacker creates a malicious repository whose package.json contains a dependency with a name such as:
       ```json
       {
         "dependencies": {
           "\"; process.exit();//": "1.0.0"
         }
       }
       ```
    2. A developer opens this repository in VSCode with the npm Intellisense extension enabled.
    3. The extension (via the `getNpmPackages` function in `provide.ts`) parses package.json and extracts the dependency names without sanitization.
    4. When the developer triggers the auto import command (via the command palette), the extension constructs an import statement in either ES6 or CommonJS style by directly interpolating the dependency name into a template string (see `command-import.ts`).
    5. The generated import statement contains the attack payload (for example,
       ```javascript
       import {} from '"; process.exit();//'
       ```
       if ES6 is enabled) which can disrupt the developer’s code or lead to further injection issues if later processed.

- **Impact:**
    The unsanitized dependency name is injected directly into source code. This can cause arbitrary code fragments to be inserted into developer files, resulting in unexpected behavior or even potential code execution when the code is built or run. It compromises the integrity of the developer’s source code and can facilitate further exploitation steps.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • No sanitization or validation is performed on dependency names after reading them from package.json.
    • The code uses `Object.keys(packageJson.dependencies || {})` which does no filtering of non-alphanumeric or special characters.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Validate and sanitize dependency names before using them to construct auto import statements.
    • Escape or remove characters that could interfere with the syntax of generated import statements.
    • Enforce a strict naming pattern that matches valid npm module name rules before accepting a dependency name.

- **Preconditions:**
    • The attacker must control the workspace’s package.json file, for example by luring a user into opening a malicious repository.
    • The extension’s auto import command is triggered (with configuration options such as `importES6` enabled).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `provide.ts` the function `getNpmPackages` calls:
       ```javascript
       fsf.readJson(getPackageJson(state, config, fsf))
         .then(packageJson => [
             ...Object.keys(packageJson.dependencies || {}),
             ...Object.keys(config.scanDevDependencies ? packageJson.devDependencies || {} : {}),
             ...(config.showBuildInLibs ? getBuildInModules() : [])
         ])
         .catch(() => []);
       ```
       This produces an array of dependency names directly from the parsed JSON.
    2. In `command-import.ts`, when the import command is invoked, the dependency name appears (as `item.label`) in the following template without any escaping:
       ```javascript
       const statementES6 = `import {} from ${config.importQuotes}${item.label}${config.importQuotes}${config.importLinebreak}`;
       ```
       Similarly for CommonJS import formats.
    3. Because no filtering occurs on `item.label`, a name with quotes and special characters (e.g. `"; process.exit();//`) is injected verbatim into the output statement.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a test workspace that contains a package.json with a dependency key that includes an injection payload, for example:
       ```json
       {
         "dependencies": {
           "\"; process.exit();//": "1.0.0"
         }
       }
       ```
    2. **Execution:**
       - Open the test workspace in VSCode with the npm Intellisense extension installed.
       - Trigger the auto import command (e.g. via the command palette, “npm-intellisense.import”).
    3. **Verification:**
       - Examine the auto import suggestion(s) to verify that the dependency name appears unsanitized.
       - Check that the generated import statement exactly contains the malicious payload (e.g.,
         ```javascript
         import {} from '"; process.exit();//'
         ```
         or equivalent in the require form).
       - The test passes if the malicious name is reflected verbatim in the output (indicating the vulnerability), and fails if proper escaping or filtering is implemented.

#### 3. Symlink Traversal Leading to Sensitive File Disclosure

- **Description:**
    The extension recursively scans the workspace and its subdirectories to provide auto import suggestions. It does so using functions like `readFilesFromDir` (in `util.ts`), which uses Node’s `readdir` and `stat` without checking whether a directory is a symbolic link. An attacker who controls a repository’s file structure may include a symbolic link that points to a directory outside the workspace (for example, a system folder with sensitive files). The extension will follow the symlink blindly and enumerate files beyond the workspace’s intended boundaries.

    **Steps to trigger:**
    1. In a malicious repository, the attacker creates a symlink (e.g., `./malicious_link`) that points to a sensitive system directory such as `/etc` on Linux (or another directory on Windows).
    2. The repository is opened in VSCode with the extension active.
    3. When the extension calls `readFilesFromDir` (and also indirectly through `getQuickPickItems` and `readFilesFromPackage`), it follows the symlink and reads files from the target directory.
    4. The discovered file paths are then included in the auto import suggestions, exposing names and possibly details of files outside the project.

- **Impact:**
    An attacker may trick a developer into opening a repository with these malicious symlinks, thereby causing the extension to disclose sensitive file system information (including system configuration files or other sensitive documents) via the auto import dropdown. This information disclosure could assist in further targeted attacks or compromises.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    • The recursive file scan in `readFilesFromDir` excludes directories named exactly `'node_modules'` to avoid unnecessary scanning of dependency folders.
    • No explicit check exists to verify whether a scanned directory is a symlink or whether it lies within the workspace boundaries.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Validate and restrict scanned directory paths to ensure that they reside within the workspace root.
    • Before recursing into a directory, check (using methods such as `lstat` or by resolving the real path) whether the directory is a symbolic link—and if so, either ignore it or ensure its target is within an allowed boundary.
    • Implement safe traversal measures to prevent path traversal beyond the intended workspace.

- **Preconditions:**
    • The attacker must be able to include or commit a symlink in the repository that points outside the workspace (e.g., via a malicious Git repository).
    • The extension’s auto import completion is invoked so that the recursive directory scan is executed.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `util.ts`, the function `readFilesFromDir` is defined as follows:
       ```javascript
       export const readFilesFromDir = (dir: string): Promise<Array<string>> => {
         return new Promise<Array<string>>((resolve, reject) => {
           let paths: Array<string> = [];
           readdir(dir, (error, files) => {
             Promise.all(
               files.map(file => {
                 const path = join(dir, file);

                 if (file === 'node_modules') {
                   return Promise.resolve([]);
                 }

                 return isDirectory(path)
                   .then(isDir => isDir ? readFilesFromDir(path) : Promise.resolve([path]));

               })
             )
               .then((filesPerDir: Array<any>) => {
                 resolve([].concat(...filesPerDir));
               })
               .catch(error => reject(error));
           });
         });
       }
       ```
    2. Notice that there is no check for whether `path` is a symbolic link or whether its resolved absolute path lies outside the intended workspace (root).
    3. As a result, if a symbolic link exists that points to an external directory, `isDirectory` (which calls `stat` and follows symlinks) returns true, and the function recurses into that directory—thereby reading and eventually returning files from outside the workspace.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** In a test workspace, create a symbolic link (for example, named `malicious_link`) inside the workspace root that points to a sensitive directory outside the workspace (e.g. on Unix: `/etc` or on Windows: `C:\Windows\System32`).
    2. **Execution:**
       - Open the test workspace in VSCode with the npm Intellisense extension enabled.
       - Trigger auto import completion (by invoking a command such as “npm-intellisense.import” or via code completion that calls `getQuickPickItems`).
    3. **Verification:**
       - Examine the list of completion items returned by the extension.
       - Check whether file paths from the external sensitive directory (e.g., entries with paths from `/etc`) are present in the suggestions.
       - The test passes (i.e. vulnerability is confirmed) if paths from the external directory appear; it fails if the extension correctly restricts file traversal to within the workspace.
