- **Vulnerability Name:**  
  Arbitrary Directory Traversal via Module Subfolder Intellisense

- **Description:**  
  The extension’s module subfolder feature (used when the configuration option for package subfolders intellisense is enabled) extracts a package fragment from the current line of code without proper sanitization. In the function that builds the file system path for reading subfolders, the code splits the current line on the string `"from "` and then further splits by quotation marks to retrieve the module path. An attacker can craft a malicious import statement that includes directory traversal sequences (for example, using `../` segments) inside the module path. When the extension subsequently calls the file system read function on the path built via Node’s `join()` function, the traversal sequences are resolved. Consequently, the extension may end up reading directories outside the intended `node_modules` folder—thereby disclosing sensitive file listings.

- **Impact:**  
  If an attacker is able to influence the contents of a file in the workspace (for example, by enticing a user to open a file that contains a malicious import statement), the extension can be tricked into enumerating files from unintended directories. Sensitive file or configuration data might be disclosed through the auto‐completion suggestions generated by the extension. In a worst‐case scenario, an attacker could gain insight into the file system layout or sensitive data stored outside of the project (information disclosure).

- **Vulnerability Rank:**  
  High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  There is no validation or sanitization performed on the extracted module path (the “pkgFragment” and its components) in the function used for module subfolder intellisense. The code directly uses the parts obtained from the current line without ensuring they conform to a safe or expected format.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Input validation and sanitization need to be added to verify that the extracted module path does not contain any directory traversal sequences (such as `"../"`).  
  • Enforce a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns for module names.  
  • Restrict file system operations so that—even if traversal sequences are present—the resolved path remains within the expected boundaries (for example, within the `node_modules` subdirectory of the workspace root).

- **Preconditions:**  
  • The user’s workspace contains a file in which the text (specifically, the import statement) can be manipulated.  
  • The configuration option for “package subfolders intellisense” is enabled so that the extension calls the vulnerable function.  
  • The workspace’s package.json lists a dependency name that will pass the dependency check (the code verifies that the first segment of the imported path exists as a dependency). This allows an attacker to include traversal segments in later parts of the path.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  1. In the file `src/provide.ts`, the function `readModuleSubFolders` begins by splitting the current line on `"from "`:  
     ```javascript
     const fragments: Array<string> = state.textCurrentLine.split('from ');
     ```  
  2. It then obtains the package fragment by splitting the last token on quotation marks:  
     ```javascript
     const pkgFragment: string = fragments[fragments.length - 1].split(/['"]/)[1];
     ```  
     For a well-formed import, this would be a path like `"lodash/subfolder"`. However, if an attacker supplies an import such as:  
     ```
     import {} from 'lodash/../../../../etc'
     ```  
     then `pkgFragment` becomes `"lodash/../../../../etc"`.
  3. The code splits this string into segments:  
     ```javascript
     const pkgFragmentSplit = pkgFragment.split('/');
     const packageName: string = pkgFragmentSplit[0];
     ```  
     In this case, `packageName` is `"lodash"`. The function then checks whether this name exists in the dependencies (obtained earlier from package.json). If it does, the check passes.
  4. The full file system path is built with:  
     ```javascript
     const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit);
     ```  
     Because `pkgFragmentSplit` contains several `"../"` segments, the normalized path may resolve outside of the intended directory.
  5. Finally, it reads the directory contents using:  
     ```javascript
     return fsf.readDir(path)
         .then(files => files.map(file => pkgFragment + file.replace(/\.js$/, '')))
         ```
     This call returns file listings from an arbitrary directory—potentially disclosing sensitive information.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup the Environment:**  
     • Create or use a test workspace that includes a valid `package.json` with at least one dependency (for example, `"lodash"`).  
     • Ensure that the user’s VS Code settings enable the package subfolder intellisense feature.
  2. **Craft a Malicious Import Statement:**  
     • Open a file within the workspace and insert an import statement such as:  
       ```javascript
       import {} from 'lodash/../../../../etc'
       ```  
     • Place the cursor inside the quotes so that `state.textCurrentLine` reflects this malicious string.
  3. **Trigger the Vulnerable Functionality:**  
     • Invoke the auto-completion (for example, by triggering the completion provider or running the “npm-intellisense.import” command) so that the extension processes the current line.
  4. **Observe the Outcome:**  
     • The extension will use the malicious import string to build the path 
       `join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', 'lodash', '..', '..', '..', '..', 'etc')`.  
     • Verify that the resolved path points outside the expected directory (for example, it might resolve to a system directory such as `/path/to/etc`).  
     • Check that the auto-completion suggestions now include filenames from the unauthorized directory.
  5. **Conclusion:**  
     • If the test returns file names from outside the intended `node_modules` folder, the vulnerability is confirmed.
