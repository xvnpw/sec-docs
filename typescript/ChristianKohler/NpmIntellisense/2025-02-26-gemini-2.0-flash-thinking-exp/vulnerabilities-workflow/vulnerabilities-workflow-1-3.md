### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Directory Traversal in Package Subfolder Intellisense

- Description:
    1. The `readModuleSubFolders` function in `src/provide.ts` constructs a file path to read subfolders of a node module based on user input from the import statement.
    2. The function extracts the module path from the text after `from` in the import statement: `const fragments: Array<string> = state.textCurrentLine.split('from ');` and `const pkgFragment: string = fragments[fragments.length - 1].split(/['"]/)[1];`.
    3. It then splits this path by `/` to create an array of path fragments: `const pkgFragmentSplit = pkgFragment.split('/');`.
    4. Finally, it constructs the full path by joining the workspace root path, `node_modules`, and the path fragments: `const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit);`.
    5. If a malicious user crafts an import statement with directory traversal sequences like `..` in the module path, it's possible to traverse outside the intended `node_modules` directory and potentially access or list files in other directories within the workspace or even outside of it, depending on the workspace root.
    6. For example, an import statement like `import 'test/../../../../etc/passwd'` could lead to the extension attempting to read files outside of the `node_modules` directory.

- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially list files and directories within the workspace and, in some cases, read file contents if they are accessible to the user running VSCode. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information within the project or the user's file system, depending on the workspace scope.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses user-provided input to construct file paths without sanitization or validation against directory traversal sequences.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The `pkgFragmentSplit` should be sanitized to remove or replace directory traversal sequences like `..`.
    - Path validation: After constructing the path, it should be validated to ensure it remains within the intended `node_modules` directory or a subdirectory of it.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the "npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense" setting enabled (even though it is experimental and defaults to false, users might enable it).
    - The user must be editing a Javascript or Typescript file within a VSCode workspace that has a `node_modules` directory.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the import statement, which is always the case for an external attacker targeting a VSCode extension as the user types the import statement.

- Source code analysis:
    - Vulnerable code is located in `src/provide.ts` in the `readModuleSubfolders` function:

    ```typescript
    function readModuleSubFolders(dependencies: string[], state: State, fsf: FsFunctions) {
        const fragments: Array<string> = state.textCurrentLine.split('from ');
        const pkgFragment: string = fragments[fragments.length - 1].split(/['"]/)[1];
        const pkgFragmentSplit = pkgFragment.split('/');
        const packageName: string = pkgFragmentSplit[0];

        if (dependencies.filter(dep => dep === packageName).length) {
            const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit); // Vulnerable path construction
            // Todo: make the replace function work with other filetypes as well
            return fsf.readDir(path)
                .then(files => files.map(file => pkgFragment + file.replace(/\.js$/, '')))
                .catch(err => ['']);
        }

        return Promise.resolve(dependencies);
    }
    ```
    - The `join` function in `path` module resolves path traversal sequences like `..`, but it does not prevent directory traversal if the input path contains them. It simply resolves the path, potentially leading outside the intended directory.
    - No checks are performed to validate if the constructed `path` is still within the `node_modules` directory or any allowed base directory.

- Security test case:
    1. Open VSCode in a workspace that contains a `node_modules` directory and a file outside of it (e.g., `test.txt` in the workspace root).
    2. Enable the "npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense" setting in VSCode settings to `true`.
    3. Create a new Javascript or Typescript file in the workspace.
    4. In the new file, type the following import statement and place the cursor within the quotes to trigger autocompletion: `import 'test/../../`
    5. Observe if the extension attempts to list files or directories outside of the `node_modules` directory. While direct observation of file system access might not be possible, you can try to traverse to a known file outside `node_modules` but within the workspace, e.g., if you have a `test.txt` file in the workspace root, try to import using a path that would resolve to it, such as `import '../../../test.txt'` or similar variations.
    6. By debugging the extension (if possible) or monitoring file system access (using system tools), confirm if the extension attempts to access files outside the `node_modules` directory based on the crafted import path.
    7. If the extension lists files or attempts to access files based on the traversed path, the vulnerability is confirmed. For instance, if you expect `test.txt` to be listed in autocompletion or if the extension throws an error indicating it tried to read `test.txt` (or a file in a similar traversed path), it would confirm the directory traversal vulnerability.
