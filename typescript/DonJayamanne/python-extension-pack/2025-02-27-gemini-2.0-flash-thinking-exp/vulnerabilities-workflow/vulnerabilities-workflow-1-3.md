## Vulnerability List

There are no high-rank vulnerabilities found in the provided project files. The project consists of documentation files (README.md and CHANGELOG.md) for a VSCode extension pack. These files describe the extension pack and list the included extensions. They do not contain any executable code or configuration that could introduce vulnerabilities of high rank exploitable by an external attacker.

It's important to note that while the extension pack itself might not introduce vulnerabilities based on its documentation files, the *included extensions* could potentially have vulnerabilities. However, analyzing the security of the *included extensions* is outside the scope of analyzing the provided *project files* for the extension pack itself, as requested by the prompt, and based on the constraint of an *external attacker* targeting the *extension pack project files*.

Therefore, based on the provided information, there are no vulnerabilities of high rank or above to report for this specific project's documentation files when considering an external attacker and the defined inclusion/exclusion criteria.
