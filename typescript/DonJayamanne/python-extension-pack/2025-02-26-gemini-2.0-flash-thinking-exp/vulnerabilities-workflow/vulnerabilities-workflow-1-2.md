- **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Extension Inclusion via Unvetted Pull Requests  
  **Description:**  
  The extension pack explicitly invites external contributions with the line “Open a PR and I'd be happy to take a look.” This open invitation can be manipulated by an attacker who submits a pull request in which they add a new extension entry pointing to a malicious package. The attack would be executed as follows:
  - The attacker forks the repository and modifies the list of extensions (for example, in the README or in the packaged extension metadata that will be published) by inserting a reference to an extension under the attacker’s control.
  - The attacker submits a pull request. If proper controls, reviews, or automated validations are not in place, the malicious addition may be merged.
  - Once merged and republished, users installing the extension pack will receive the malicious extension along with trusted extensions, thereby exposing them to potential code execution or other forms of compromise.
  
  **Impact:**  
  - End users who install the extension pack from the marketplace may inadvertently install a malicious extension.  
  - The malicious extension could execute arbitrary code, bypass security sandboxing, or leak private information from the user’s development environment.  
  - This supply‑chain issue undermines trust in the extension pack and can lead to a broader compromise of users’ development ecosystems.
  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - There are no automated validation mechanisms or explicit security controls in place in the repository.  
  - No defined contributor guidelines or whitelist of approved extensions have been enforced in the project files.
  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - A strict contribution and code review process specifically focused on extension references.  
  - Automated validation (or manual auditing) that checks any new extension identifiers against a pre‑approved list or trusted marketplace records.  
  - Role‑based access controls such that only trusted contributors can modify the extension pack contents.  
  - Security testing for any new PRs that may affect the set of extensions included in the published pack.
  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must have a valid GitHub account to submit a pull request.  
  - The project maintainers must rely solely on non‑robust review processes that do not effectively verify the legitimacy of newly added extension entries.
  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - **Step 1:** In the `/code/README.md` file, the repository invites open contributions via pull requests (“Open a PR and I'd be happy to take a look”).  
  - **Step 2:** The README (or downstream manifest file when the extension pack is built) contains a published list of extensions.  
  - **Step 3:** There is no code or automation that verifies if each extension entry (its identifier and source URL) is coming from a trusted origin (e.g., VS Marketplace with validated publisher credentials).  
  - **Step 4:** The absence of valid controls or audits means that if a malicious PR is submitted with an added extension entry—one that directs users to a compromised or attacker‑controlled extension—it will be published with the next release of the extension pack.
  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Preparation:**  
     - Fork the repository as an external contributor.
     - Create a new branch for testing purposes.
  2. **Injection:**  
     - Edit the README (or the manifest file of the extension pack if available) to add a new extension entry with a link and identifier controlled by the attacker. For example, insert a bullet like:  
       `* [Malicious Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=attacker.malicious-extension)`  
  3. **Submission:**  
     - Commit the changes and submit a pull request with a description explaining the addition.
  4. **Review Bypass:**  
     - (In a test environment, simulate a scenario where the PR passes review due to lack of stringent checks.)
  5. **Deployment Simulation:**  
     - Merge the PR and simulate the building and publishing process (or run the extension pack locally).
  6. **Verification:**  
     - Install the extension pack into a VSCode instance.
     - Verify that the “Malicious Extension” is installed along with the trusted extensions.
     - Attempt to trigger functionality from the malicious extension (in a controlled, test sandbox environment) to prove that malicious code would be executed if the extension were activated.
