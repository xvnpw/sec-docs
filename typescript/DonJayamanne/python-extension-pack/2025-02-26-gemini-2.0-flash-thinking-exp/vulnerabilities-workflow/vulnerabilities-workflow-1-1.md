## Vulnerability List

Based on the analysis of the provided documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md) for this VSCode extension pack project, no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria were identified.

Specifically:

*   **No high-rank vulnerabilities introduced by the project itself were found.** The examined files are documentation and do not contain code or configurations that could directly introduce exploitable vulnerabilities by an external attacker in a VSCode extension context.
*   **The analysis was limited to documentation files.**  A comprehensive security assessment would require examining the extension's manifest (`package.json`) and any included scripts or code, which were not provided.

Therefore, according to the given instructions and the scope of the provided files, there are no vulnerabilities to report that meet the criteria of being high-rank or above, valid, not mitigated, and exploitable by an external attacker in a VSCode extension, while excluding the specified vulnerability types.
