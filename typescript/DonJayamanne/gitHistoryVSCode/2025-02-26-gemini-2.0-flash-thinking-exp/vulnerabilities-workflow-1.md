### Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines a list of security vulnerabilities identified in the Git History extension for VS Code. Each vulnerability is described in detail, including its potential impact, rank, existing mitigations, missing mitigations, preconditions for exploitation, source code analysis, and security test cases.

#### 1. Command Injection via Git Object Name in `getObjectHashArgs`

- **Description:**
    - The `getObjectHashArgs` function in `GitArgsService` constructs Git commands using user-controlled input (`object`) without sufficient sanitization.
    - An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by crafting a Git object name that contains shell metacharacters.
    - This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the user's system when the extension attempts to retrieve the hash of the crafted object.

- **Impact:**
    - **Critical**
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - Attackers could potentially steal sensitive information, install malware, or compromise the user's system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses the `object` parameter in the `git show` command.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization for the `object` parameter in `getObjectHashArgs` to prevent shell injection.
    - Ideally, avoid using shell commands for operations where a safer API or method exists. In this case, validating the `object` parameter to ensure it is a valid Git object name and does not contain shell metacharacters.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must open the Git History viewer in VSCode.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted message to the VSCode extension's webview, triggering the `getCommit` command in `ApiController` with a malicious commit hash. This could potentially be achieved through a crafted workspace or by exploiting a vulnerability in VSCode's webview messaging system itself (though less likely for an external attacker). For the purpose of this analysis, we assume the attacker can somehow influence the `hash` parameter sent to the `getCommit` API endpoint.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/adapter/repository/gitArgsService.ts`
    ```typescript
    export class GitArgsService implements IGitArgsService {
        // ...
        public getObjectHashArgs(object: string): string[] {
            return ['show', `--format=${Helpers.GetCommitInfoFormatCode(CommitInfo.FullHash)}`, '--shortstat', object];
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    - The `getObjectHashArgs` function takes `object: string` as input. This `object` string is directly incorporated into the command arguments for `git show`.
    - If the `object` string contains shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`, `$()`, ``), Git might interpret these as command separators or expansions, leading to command injection.
    - For example, if an attacker can control the `object` parameter and sets it to `"commit-hash; malicious-command"`, the executed command could become `git show --format=%H --shortstat commit-hash; malicious-command`. Git might execute `malicious-command` after the `git show` command.

    - File: `/code/src/server/apiController.ts`
    ```typescript
    export class ApiController {
        // ...
        public async getCommit(args: any) {
            const hash: string = args.hash;
            // ...
            const commit = await this.gitService.getCommit(hash);
            // ...
            return commit;
        }
        private postMessageParser = async (message: IPostMessage) => {
            try {
                const result = await this[message.cmd].bind(this)(message.payload);
                this.webview.postMessage({
                    requestId: message.requestId,
                    payload: result,
                });
            } catch (ex) {
                this.applicationShell.showErrorMessage((ex as Error).message);
                this.webview.postMessage({
                    requestId: message.requestId,
                    error: ex,
                });
            }
        };
    }
    ```
    - The `ApiController` class handles messages from the webview in the `postMessageParser` method.
    - When a message with `cmd: 'getCommit'` is received, the `getCommit` method is called.
    - The `getCommit` method directly takes the `hash` from the `args` parameter (which originates from the webview message payload) and passes it to `this.gitService.getCommit(hash)`.
    - If `gitService.getCommit` internally uses `getObjectHashArgs` without sanitizing the `hash` input, a command injection vulnerability exists.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open the Git History extension in VSCode on any Git repository.
    2. We need a way to send a crafted message to the extension's webview. For testing purposes, we can modify the extension code temporarily to send a malicious message. In a real attack scenario, the attacker would need to find a way to inject or influence messages sent to the webview.
    3. Modify the `htmlViewer.ts` or any file that sends messages to `ApiController` to send a 'getCommit' message with a malicious hash. For example, in `htmlViewer.ts`, inside `createHtmlView` function, after `new ApiController(...)`, add the following line for testing:
    ```typescript
    webviewPanel.webview.postMessage({ cmd: 'getCommit', requestId: '1', payload: { hash: 'test-commit-hash; touch /tmp/pwned' } });
    ```
    4. Reload the VSCode extension or reopen the Git History view.
    5. Observe if a file named `pwned` is created in the `/tmp/` directory.
    6. If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed.

- **Missing Test Case:**
    - No specific test case exists to validate the sanitization of Git object names passed to `getObjectHashArgs` or any functions using it, especially when triggered via the `getCommit` API endpoint.

#### 2. Webview Unsanitized FileName Injection (Cross‑Site Scripting)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Webview Unsanitized FileName Injection (Cross‑Site Scripting)

- **Description:**
    - In the extension’s HTML webview (constructed in, for example, `src/server/htmlViewer.ts`), most dynamic values are safely serialized (using methods such as `JSON.stringify`) before they are injected. However, the file name variable is injected directly into an inline script without proper escaping or serialization. An external attacker who is able to influence file names in a repository (for example, by adding a file with a specially crafted name such as  `; alert('XSS');//`) can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the webview. When the webview is rendered, this unsanitized file name causes the injected code to execute in the VS Code extension context.

- **Impact:**
    - An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the VS Code extension. This may lead to disclosure or manipulation of sensitive data, compromise of repository state, or further escalation of control over the editor’s environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - While most dynamic data inserted into the webview are properly serialized (for example, using `JSON.stringify`), the file name variable currently is directly interpolated.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - • The file name must be sanitized or safely serialized (e.g. using `JSON.stringify(fileName)` before injecting).
    - • Alternatively, pass the file name via a secure data‑transfer mechanism such as the VS Code `postMessage` API.
    - • Apply consistent output‑escaping routines for all externally controlled data inserted into HTML.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to influence the file names present in a repository or workspace, for example by creating or renaming files with malicious payloads.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - • In the webview creation logic (e.g. in `src/server/htmlViewer.ts`), a `<script>` block sets dynamic globals by directly embedding variables such as `fileName`.
    - • Unlike configuration objects (which are inserted using `JSON.stringify`), the file name is set as follows:
    ```js
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.fileName = '${fileName}';
    </script>
    ```
    - • Because no escaping is applied, a file name containing characters like a single quote (`'`) can break out of the intended string literal and allow injection of arbitrary JavaScript.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prepare a test repository (or workspace) having at least one file with a name that deliberately contains injection payload (for example:  `; alert('XSS');//`).
    2. Open this repository in VS Code so that the extension processes it and renders the webview.
    3. Confirm that the unsanitized file name is injected into the HTML and the malicious JavaScript executes (for instance, an alert box appears).
    4. Verify remediation by updating the webview construction code to safely serialize the file name or pass it via `postMessage`, then reload the webview and ensure the injection no longer triggers.

#### 3. Insecure Window Message Handling (Lack of Origin Validation) in Message Bus

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Window Message Handling (Lack of Origin Validation) in Message Bus

- **Description:**
    - The extension’s communication helper—in the module responsible for dispatching and receiving messages (in particular, in `browser/src/actions/messagebus.ts`)—creates promises that are resolved using a global `message` event listener. This listener does not validate the origin of incoming messages. An external attacker who is able to send a message into the window context (for example, via an injected or malicious iframe or via compromised content in the webview) could craft a message with a matching `requestId` to a pending request. This would cause the promise to resolve with attacker‑controlled data.

    - **Step‑by‑step trigger:**
        1. The extension calls the `post` function with a command and payload, which generates a unique `requestId` and sends a message (using the VS Code API’s `postMessage`).
        2. The helper function `createPromiseFromMessageEvent` installs a listener on the window for all `message` events.
        3. Without any origin (or sender) check, an attacker who can post a message into the window with the same `requestId` can have their message handled as if it were the legitimate response.
        4. The promise is then resolved (or rejected) with data supplied by the attacker.

- **Impact:**
    - By spoofing responses to outgoing messages, an attacker can cause the extension to process unexpected—and potentially malicious—payloads. This might lead to unauthorized state changes (for example, incorrect updates in the Redux store) or trigger further actions in the extension, opening a path to supply manipulated data that may result in privilege escalation or further exploitation.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There are no checks in the message event handler to verify the origin or source of the incoming message. The promise simply matches the `requestId` in the event’s data.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - • Validate the `origin` (or source) of incoming message events to ensure they come from a trusted source (e.g. compare against the expected VS Code API origin).
    - • Consider limiting the scope of the event listener or using a more robust messaging framework that binds responses to a verified sender.
    - • Immediately remove the event listener after resolving the promise (currently done, but only after a matching `requestId` is found; additional filtering is required).

- **Preconditions:**
    - • The attacker must be able to inject or post arbitrary messages into the window context of the extension’s webview.
    - • This may be possible if the webview’s content security policy is not strictly enforced or if an existing injection (such as the aforementioned XSS vulnerability) already provides the attacker with the means to execute script in the context.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - • In `browser/src/actions/messagebus.ts`, the `post` function sends a message with a generated `requestId` using a function (bound from the VS Code API).
    - • The helper function `createPromiseFromMessageEvent` installs a global event listener:
      ```js
      function createPromiseFromMessageEvent(requestId): Promise<any> {
          return new Promise<any>((resolve, reject) => {
              const handleEvent = (e: MessageEvent) => {
                  if (requestId === e.data.requestId) {
                      window.removeEventListener('message', handleEvent);

                      if (e.data.error) {
                          reject(e.data.error);
                      } else {
                          resolve(e.data.payload);
                      }
                  }
              };

              window.addEventListener('message', handleEvent);
          });
      }
      ```
    - • Notice that there is no check (for example, against `e.origin`) to ensure that the message event is coming from an expected and trusted source.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled test environment (e.g. a test webview), trigger an outgoing message from the extension using the `post` function (record the generated `requestId` in a controlled test harness).
    2. From an externally controlled script (for example, in an injected iframe or via the browser console if the webview context is accessible), post a message with the following structure:
       - The same `requestId` as the pending request.
       - A fabricated payload (or an error field) that represents malicious data.
    3. Verify that the promise returned by the `post` function resolves (or rejects) with the attacker‑supplied payload.
    4. Confirm that the extension subsequently behaves unexpectedly (for example, Redux state updates or actions are dispatched with the malicious data).
    5. After applying proper origin validation in the message event listener, repeat the test and confirm that spoofed messages from untrusted origins are ignored.

#### 4. Git Command Injection via Search Text

- **Vulnerability Name:** Git Command Injection via Search Text

- **Description:**
    1. The VSCode extension "Git History, Search and More" allows users to search git history using a search text input field in the webview.
    2. When a user enters a search term and submits it, the extension sends a message from the webview to the backend with the search text as payload.
    3. In the backend, specifically in `src/viewers/historyViewer.ts`, the `handleMessageFromWebview` function processes the `SearchText` command. It extracts the `searchText` from the payload and stores it in the settings.
    4. Subsequently, when fetching git history logs (e.g., via `GitService.getLogEntries`), this `searchText` is passed down to `GitArgsService.getLogArgs`.
    5. Within `GitArgsService.getLogArgs`, the `searchText` is directly incorporated into the `git log` command using the `--grep` option without proper sanitization.
    6. An attacker can inject malicious git command options or shell commands into the `searchText` field. Since the `gitCommandExecutor.exec` executes the constructed git command via `child_process.spawn`, the injected commands will be executed by the system.

- **Impact:**
    - **High**. Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the machine where the VSCode extension is running, under the privileges of the user running VSCode. This could lead to:
        - Reading sensitive files.
        - Modifying or deleting files.
        - Installing malware.
        - Potentially escalating privileges depending on the system configuration.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses user-provided search text in the git command without any sanitization or validation.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the `searchText` input to remove or escape any characters that could be interpreted as git command options or shell commands. For example, escape shell metacharacters or disallow characters like backticks, semicolons, pipes, etc.
    - **Input Validation:** Validate the `searchText` input to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and does not contain any potentially harmful characters or command sequences.
    - **Parameterization:** If possible, use git command parameterization mechanisms to separate user-provided search terms from command options. However, `--grep` might not directly support parameterization in a way that prevents injection.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** While not a direct mitigation for command injection, running the git commands with the least necessary privileges can limit the impact of a successful attack. However, this is usually managed at the system level and not within the extension itself.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the "Git History, Search and More" extension installed and activated in VSCode.
    - The user must open a workspace that is a Git repository.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the `searchText` that is used when the extension executes `git log`. This is achieved through the webview search input.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`src/viewers/historyViewer.ts`:**
    ```typescript
    // ...
    private handleMessageFromWebview(message: IPostMessage) {
        switch (message.cmd) {
            // ...
            case 'SearchText': {
                this.settings.searchText = message.payload as string;
                this.updateHistory();
                break;
            }
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    The `searchText` from the webview message payload is directly assigned to `this.settings.searchText` without any sanitization.

    2. **`src/adapter/repository/git.ts`:**
    ```typescript
    // ...
    public async getLogEntries(
        pageIndex = 0,
        pageSize = 0,
        branches: string[] = [],
        searchText = '', // searchText is passed here
        file?: vscode.Uri,
        lineNumber?: number,
        author?: string,
    ): Promise<LogEntries> {
        // ...
        const args = this.gitArgsService.getLogArgs( // searchText is passed to getLogArgs
            pageIndex,
            pageSize,
            branches,
            searchText,
            relativePath,
            lineNumber,
            author,
        );
        // ...
        const countPromise = lineNumber
            ? Promise.resolve(-1)
            : this.exec(...args.counterArgs).then(value => parseInt(value)); // Command execution
        ``;

        const itemsPromise = Promise.all([this.exec(...args.logArgs), this.loadDereferenceHashes()]).then( // Command execution
            ([output]) => {
                // ...
            },
        );
        // ...
    }
    // ...
    private async exec(...args: string[]): Promise<string> {
        const gitRootPath = this.getGitRoot();
        return this.gitCmdExecutor.exec(gitRootPath, ...args); // Command execution using gitCommandExecutor
    }
    ```
    `searchText` is passed to `getLogArgs` and then the commands constructed using arguments from `getLogArgs` are executed via `this.exec`.

    3. **`src/adapter/repository/gitArgsService.ts`:**
    ```typescript
    // ...
    public getLogArgs(
        pageIndex = 0,
        pageSize = 100,
        branches: string[] = [],
        searchText = '', // searchText received here
        relativeFilePath?: string,
        lineNumber?: number,
        author?: string,
    ): GitLogArgs {
        // ...
        const logArgs = ['log', ...authorArgs, ...lineArgs, '--full-history', LOG_FORMAT];
        const fileStatArgs = [
            'log',
            ...authorArgs,
            ...lineArgs,
            '--full-history',
            `--format=${LOG_ENTRY_SEPARATOR}${newLineFormatCode}`,
        ];
        const counterArgs = ['rev-list', ...authorArgs, '--full-history'];

        if (searchText && searchText.length > 0) {
            searchText
                .split(' ')
                .map(text => text.trim())
                .filter(text => text.length > 0)
                .forEach(text => {
                    logArgs.push(`--grep=${text}`, '-i'); // searchText is used directly in --grep
                    fileStatArgs.push(`--grep=${text}`, '-i'); // searchText is used directly in --grep
                    counterArgs.push(`--grep=${text}`, '-i'); // searchText is used directly in --grep
                });
        }
        // ...
        return { logArgs, fileStatArgs, counterArgs };
    }
    // ...
    ```
    The `searchText` is directly embedded within the `--grep` argument in `logArgs`, `fileStatArgs`, and `counterArgs` without any sanitization. This directly leads to the command injection vulnerability.

    4. **`src/server/apiController.ts`:**
    ```typescript
    // ...
    public async getLogEntries(args: any) {
        let searchText = args.searchText;
        searchText = typeof searchText === 'string' && searchText.length === 0 ? undefined : searchText;

        // ... other arguments parsing

        const entries = await this.gitService.getLogEntries(
            pageIndex,
            pageSize,
            branches,
            searchText, // searchText is passed to gitService.getLogEntries
            file,
            lineNumber,
            author,
        );
        // ...
    }
    // ...
    ```
    In `apiController.ts`, the `getLogEntries` function receives the `searchText` from the webview's request payload (`args.searchText`). It performs a basic check to treat empty strings as undefined but does not apply any sanitization or validation before passing it to `this.gitService.getLogEntries`. This confirms that the unsanitized `searchText` from the webview is directly used in subsequent git commands.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open VSCode in a workspace that is a Git repository.
    2. Activate the "Git History: View History" command (e.g., using `F1` and typing "Git: View History"). This will open the Git History webview.
    3. In the search bar within the Git History webview, enter the following payload as the search text:
        ```
        `--author=$(touch /tmp/pwned)`
        ```
        or
        ```
        `--author=$(calc.exe)` (for Windows)
        ```
        or any other system command you want to execute.
    4. Press Enter or trigger the search.
    5. Observe the result. If the command injection is successful, a file named `pwned` should be created in the `/tmp/` directory (or calculator should open on Windows).

This test case demonstrates that arbitrary commands can be injected via the search text field and executed by the system.
