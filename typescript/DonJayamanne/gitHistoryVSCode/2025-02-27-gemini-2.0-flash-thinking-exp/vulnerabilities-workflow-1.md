### Combined Vulnerability List

#### 1. Vulnerability Name: Dynamic Method Invocation in API Controller

- Description:
    1. The VSCode extension employs a dynamic method invocation pattern in the `postMessageParser` function within `src/server/apiController.ts`.
    2. This function handles messages received from the webview, where each message includes a `cmd` property specifying the method to be invoked on the `ApiController` instance.
    3. The code utilizes `this[message.cmd].bind(this)(message.payload)` to dynamically call the method named by `message.cmd`.
    4. While the current set of API methods appears safe, this dynamic invocation approach poses a security risk. If new methods are added to `ApiController` without rigorous security scrutiny, the vulnerability could be exploited.
    5. An attacker might craft a malicious message with a `cmd` value targeting an unintended or newly introduced method within `ApiController`, especially if future methods lack sufficient input validation or access controls.

- Impact:
    - High. Currently, the risk is limited to the existing API methods, which seem benign. However, successful exploitation of dynamic method invocation could lead to unintended actions within the extension's backend. This could escalate to more serious vulnerabilities depending on the nature of any future API methods introduced. If a new API method with unintended side effects or security flaws is added, an attacker could leverage this dynamic invocation to trigger them, potentially compromising the extension's functionality or accessing sensitive data.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The existing API commands in `ApiController` are designed for the extension's intended functionality and do not inherently present critical vulnerabilities based on the current codebase.
    - Input validation and sanitization within each individual API method serve as specific mitigations for those methods. However, the dynamic dispatch mechanism itself lacks inherent protection against newly added, potentially vulnerable methods.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Validation and Whitelisting for Commands:** Implement robust input validation on the `message.cmd` value within `postMessageParser`. Instead of directly using `message.cmd` for dynamic invocation, establish a whitelist of explicitly permitted command names. Before invoking `this[message.cmd]`, verify that `message.cmd` is present in this whitelist. This ensures only predefined and reviewed commands can be executed.
    - **Stronger Type Checking and Interface Definition for API Commands:** Define a clear interface or type for API commands that are intended to be invoked from the webview. This practice enhances type safety, making it easier to understand and control the exposed API surface. It also helps in preventing unintended method calls and ensures that only methods designed for external invocation are accessible.
    - **Mandatory Security Review for New API Methods:** Establish a mandatory security review process for any new methods added to the `ApiController` that are intended to be invokable from the webview. This review should specifically assess the potential security implications of the new method within the context of dynamic invocation, considering aspects like access control, input validation, and potential unintended side effects.

- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must be capable of sending messages to the VSCode extension's webview component. This could be achieved by developing a malicious VSCode extension or by crafting specific VSCode workspaces or files if vulnerabilities in message handling mechanisms exist.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/server/apiController.ts`
    2. Function: `postMessageParser`
    3. Vulnerable Code Snippet:
    ```typescript
    private postMessageParser = async (message: IPostMessage) => {
        try {
            const result = await this[message.cmd].bind(this)(message.payload); // Vulnerable line
            this.webview.postMessage({
                requestId: message.requestId,
                payload: result,
            });
        } catch (ex) {
            this.applicationShell.showErrorMessage((ex as Error).message);
            this.webview.postMessage({
                requestId: message.requestId,
                error: ex,
            });
        }
    };
    ```
    - The code directly utilizes `message.cmd` to access and invoke a method on the `ApiController` instance (`this`) without any validation or sanitization of `message.cmd`.
    - There is no explicit validation or whitelisting of the `message.cmd` value before it's used for dynamic method invocation.
    - If a new method is added to `ApiController` and its name becomes known or is guessable, a crafted malicious webview message could trigger its execution. This is especially concerning if new methods are added without considering their exposure through this dynamic invocation mechanism.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** For demonstration, assume a hypothetical new method `__internalAdminFunction` is added to `ApiController`. This function, which doesn't exist in the provided code and is purely illustrative, represents a potentially sensitive administrative action.
    2. **Craft Malicious Message:** An attacker develops a VSCode extension designed to send a message to the "Git History" extension's webview using `vscode.postMessage`. The crafted message payload is structured as follows:
    ```json
    {
        "requestId": "testRequestId",
        "cmd": "__internalAdminFunction",
        "payload": {}
    }
    ```
    3. **Send Message:** The attacker's extension uses `webview.postMessage` to send this message to the "Git History" extension's webview. Note that targeting a specific extension's webview might require further investigation into the extension's messaging and webview setup.
    4. **Observe Behavior:** If the dynamic invocation vulnerability is exploitable and the hypothetical `__internalAdminFunction` exists and is callable through this method, it would be executed within the context of the "Git History" extension. In a real-world scenario, this could lead to unintended or malicious actions if such a function were to exist and was not properly secured. In this test case, since the function is hypothetical, an error is expected to be thrown, but the dynamic invocation mechanism's potential vulnerability is still demonstrated.
    5. **Expected Result (without mitigation):** The `postMessageParser` attempts to call `this.__internalAdminFunction`. If the function were to exist, it would be executed. If it does not exist, an error is caught and potentially shown to the user, but the attempt to dynamically call a potentially unintended function succeeds at the code level.
    6. **Expected Result (with mitigation - whitelisting):** If a whitelist of allowed commands is implemented, and `__internalAdminFunction` is not included in this whitelist, the code should not attempt to call `this.__internalAdminFunction`. Instead, the command should be rejected, effectively preventing the dynamic invocation of potentially unsafe or unauthorized methods.

#### 2. Vulnerability Name: Git Command Injection

- Description:
    1. The Git History extension allows users to search through git history using a text input field in the webview. This user-provided search text is then passed to the backend and used to construct Git commands, specifically leveraging the `--grep` option.
    2. By carefully crafting a malicious search text, an attacker can inject arbitrary Git command options into the executed command. This is because the extension does not properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied search input before incorporating it into the Git command.
    3. The vulnerability arises because the `searchText` is directly embedded into the Git command arguments without sufficient escaping or sanitization, making it possible for an attacker to insert malicious options that alter the intended behavior of the Git command.

- Impact:
    - High. Successful command injection in Git commands can have significant security repercussions. It can enable an attacker to execute arbitrary Git commands, potentially leading to:
        - **Information Disclosure:** Access to sensitive information from the Git repository, including commit details, file contents, and repository metadata, or even sensitive data from the system running VSCode.
        - **Data Integrity Compromise:** Modification of Git repository data, potentially corrupting the history or injecting malicious content into the repository.
        - **Local File System Access:** Depending on the injected Git commands and further exploitation, an attacker could gain read or write access to arbitrary files on the machine running VSCode, potentially leading to further system compromise.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the user-provided search text in the construction of Git commands without any apparent sanitization or validation to prevent command injection. The splitting of the search text by spaces and trimming does not prevent injection vulnerabilities.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Robust Input Sanitization:** Implement thorough sanitization of the `searchText` input to remove or escape any characters or sequences that could be interpreted as Git command options or shell metacharacters. Ideally, avoid directly using `--grep` with user-provided input. If using `--grep` is necessary, ensure proper argument escaping or consider using a Git command API if available to bypass shell command construction and argument parsing.
    - **Strict Input Validation:** Validate the search input to ensure it strictly conforms to expected patterns and does not contain any malicious characters or sequences. Implement restrictions on allowed characters and patterns in the search input to prevent injection attempts.
    - **Parameterization or Git Command API Usage:** Explore and utilize Git command parameterization or a Git command API if provided by Git tooling libraries or VSCode's API. Parameterization can help avoid shell injection vulnerabilities by separating commands from arguments. Using a Git command API, if available, can abstract away the complexities of shell command construction and execution, potentially offering built-in security against injection attacks.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the Git History extension installed and activated within VSCode.
    - The user must open a Git repository in VSCode and activate the Git History view.
    - The user must interact with the search functionality in the Git History view by entering text in the search input field.
    - The Git repository must be accessible to the extension for Git commands to be executed.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/adapter/repository/gitArgsService.ts`
    2. Function: `getLogArgs`
    3. Vulnerable Code Snippet:
    ```typescript
    public getLogArgs(
        pageIndex = 0,
        pageSize = 100,
        branches: string[] = [],
        searchText = '', // User-controlled input
        relativeFilePath?: string,
        lineNumber?: number,
        author?: string, // User-controlled input
    ): GitLogArgs {
        // ...
        const logArgs = ['log', ...authorArgs, ...lineArgs, '--full-history', LOG_FORMAT];
        const fileStatArgs = [
            'log',
            ...authorArgs,
            ...lineArgs,
            '--full-history',
            `--format=${LOG_ENTRY_SEPARATOR}${newLineFormatCode}`,
        ];
        const counterArgs = ['rev-list', ...authorArgs, '--full-history'];

        if (searchText && searchText.length > 0) {
            searchText
                .split(' ') // Splits by space, but doesn't prevent option injection
                .map(text => text.trim())
                .filter(text => text.length > 0)
                .forEach(text => {
                    logArgs.push(`--grep=${text}`, '-i'); // Injects user input directly into git command
                    fileStatArgs.push(`--grep=${text}`, '-i'); // Injects user input directly into git command
                    counterArgs.push(`--grep=${text}`, '-i'); // Injects user input directly into git command
                });
        }
        // ...
        return { logArgs, fileStatArgs, counterArgs };
    }
    ```
    - The `getLogArgs` function in `gitArgsService.ts` constructs arguments for Git commands. It takes `searchText` as input, which is user-controlled input from the webview.
    - The code iterates over space-separated words in `searchText` and pushes each word as a `--grep` option to `logArgs`, `fileStatArgs`, and `counterArgs`.
    - Splitting by space and trimming is insufficient sanitization and does not prevent command injection. Attackers can use various shell metacharacters or Git option sequences to inject malicious commands or options.

    4. File: `/code/src/adapter/exec/gitCommandExec.ts`
    5. Function: `exec`
    6. Vulnerable Code Snippet:
    ```typescript
    import { spawn } from 'child_process';
    // ...
    export class GitCommandExecutor implements IGitCommandExecutor {
        // ...
        public async exec(options: any, ...args: any[]): Promise<any> {
            // ...
            const gitShow = spawn(gitPathCommand, args, childProcOptions);
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    - The `exec` function in `gitCommandExec.ts` uses `child_process.spawn` to execute Git commands.
    - The `...args` parameter, which is constructed in `gitArgsService.ts` and includes the unsanitized `searchText`, is directly passed to `spawn` as command arguments.
    - `child_process.spawn` by default does not use a shell, which reduces the risk of shell injection in some scenarios, but Git itself parses command-line options, and `--grep` is interpreted by Git, not the shell. Therefore, Git command injection is still possible even with `spawn` by injecting Git-specific options.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:** Install and activate the Git History extension in VSCode. Open a Git repository in VSCode and open the Git History view.
    2. **Test Case 1: Injecting `--pretty` option:**
        - In the search input field, enter the payload: `test --pretty=format:'%x00'`
        - Trigger the search (e.g., by pressing Enter).
        - Observe the output in the 'Git History' output channel. If command injection is successful, you might see unexpected output or errors resulting from the injected `--pretty` option, which is not intended for use with `--grep`. Successful injection may change the log format or produce Git errors due to the unexpected option.
    3. **Test Case 2: Injecting `--max-count` option:**
        - In the search input field, enter: `" --max-count=1 `.
        - Trigger the Git History search.
        - Verify that only one commit is displayed in the Git History view, regardless of the actual number of commits. This confirms that the `--max-count=1` option was successfully injected, altering the command's behavior.
    4. **Test Case 3: Attempting output redirection (Potentially harmful, perform with caution in a controlled environment):**
        - In the search box, enter a malicious payload like: `commit --author='attacker" -oPayload=">output.txt'`.
        - Trigger the Git History search.
        - Check if a file named `output.txt` is created in the Git repository's root directory or a location accessible to the VSCode process. If the file is created and contains content reflecting command execution (e.g., environment variables or system information), it indicates successful command injection that could potentially be used for more harmful actions.

Vulnerability Rank Justification:

The Git Command Injection vulnerability is ranked as **high** due to the significant security risks associated with it. The ability to inject arbitrary Git command options allows an attacker to potentially:

- **Exfiltrate sensitive information**: By injecting commands that output repository content or system information.
- **Modify repository data**: By injecting commands that alter the Git repository's history or metadata.
- **Gain local file system access**: In certain scenarios, command injection could be leveraged to read or write files on the system, especially if combined with other Git features or vulnerabilities.

Given the potential for significant impact and the relative ease of exploitation (simply by entering a crafted search term in the Git History view), a high-rank is justified. This type of vulnerability can lead to serious security breaches and requires immediate attention and mitigation.
