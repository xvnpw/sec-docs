### Vulnerability List for Git History, Search and More VSCode Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Git Command Execution

* Description:
    1. The extension uses `child_process.spawn` to execute Git commands.
    2. User-provided input, such as file paths or branch names, could potentially be passed as arguments to these Git commands.
    3. If this user input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious commands that are then executed by the system.
    4. Specifically, the `exec` function in `/code/src/adapter/exec/gitCommandExec.ts` takes command arguments as rest parameters which can be influenced by extension's features.

* Impact:
    - **High**: Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could lead to sensitive data exposure, modification of files, or even complete system compromise.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided code. The code uses `child_process.spawn` directly without explicit sanitization of command arguments.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization**: All user-provided input that is used as arguments to Git commands must be thoroughly sanitized to prevent command injection. This includes escaping shell metacharacters and validating input against expected patterns.
    - **Parameterization**: Utilize Git command parameterization if available in the Git API to avoid shell injection entirely.
    - **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs against expected formats (e.g., branch names, file paths) to ensure they do not contain unexpected or malicious characters.

* Preconditions:
    - The user must have the Git History extension installed and activated in VSCode.
    - The user must interact with features of the extension that use user input to construct Git commands, such as:
        - Searching Git history with a specific text.
        - Viewing file history for a file with a specially crafted name.
        - Comparing branches or commits where branch or commit names are user-controlled.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/adapter/exec/gitCommandExec.ts`
    ```typescript
    import { spawn } from 'child_process';
    // ...
    export class GitCommandExecutor implements IGitCommandExecutor {
        // ...
        public async exec(options: any, ...args: any[]): Promise<any> {
            // ...
            const gitShow = spawn(gitPathCommand, args, childProcOptions);
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    - The `exec` function uses `child_process.spawn` to execute git commands. The `args` parameter, which can be influenced by user input via extension features, is directly passed to `spawn` without sanitization.

    2. **File:** `/code/src/adapter/gitArgsService.ts` and `/code/src/adapter/repository/gitArgsService.ts`
    - These files construct the arguments passed to the `exec` function based on user actions and settings. For example, `getLogArgs` in `/code/src/adapter/repository/gitArgsService.ts` includes `searchText` and `author` in the command arguments which could originate from user input.
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/adapter/repository/gitArgsService.ts
    public getLogArgs(
        pageIndex = 0,
        pageSize = 100,
        branches: string[] = [],
        searchText = '', // User controlled input
        relativeFilePath?: string,
        lineNumber?: number,
        author?: string, // User controlled input
    ): GitLogArgs {
        // ...
        if (author && author.length > 0) {
            authorArgs.push(`--author=${author} `); // Potential command injection
        }
        // ...
        if (searchText && searchText.length > 0) {
            searchText
                .split(' ')
                .map(text => text.trim())
                .filter(text => text.length > 0)
                .forEach(text => {
                    logArgs.push(`--grep=${text}`, '-i'); // Potential command injection
                    // ...
                });
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    - The code directly embeds user-provided `searchText` and `author` into the git command arguments using template literals and array push without any sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious git command options via these inputs.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Open a Git repository in VSCode.
    2. Open the Git History view.
    3. In the search box, enter a malicious payload like: `commit --author='attacker" -oPayload=">output.txt'`.
    4. Trigger the Git History search (e.g., by pressing Enter or clicking a search button if available).
    5. Check if a file named `output.txt` is created in the Git repository's root directory or a location accessible to the VSCode process. If the file is created and contains content reflecting command execution (e.g., environment variables, system information), it indicates successful command injection.

    Alternatively, test with a more benign payload to observe command modification without harmful side effects:
    1. Open a Git repository in VSCode.
    2. Open the Git History view.
    3. In the search box, enter: `" --max-count=1 `.
    4. Trigger the Git History search.
    5. Verify that only one commit is displayed in the Git History view, regardless of the actual number of commits, confirming that the `--max-count=1` option was successfully injected into the Git command.
