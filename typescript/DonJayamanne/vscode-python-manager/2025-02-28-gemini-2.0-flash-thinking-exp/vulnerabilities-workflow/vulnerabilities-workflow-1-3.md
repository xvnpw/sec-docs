## Vulnerability List for PROJECT FILES

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Synchronous Terminal Service
  - Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious command string.
    2. This command string is passed as the `command` argument to `SynchronousTerminalService.sendCommand`.
    3. `SynchronousTerminalService.sendCommand` calls `internalScripts.shell_exec(command, lockFile.filePath, args)`.
    4. `internalScripts.shell_exec` constructs arguments including the attacker-controlled `command` and passes them to the `shell_exec.py` python script.
    5. If `shell_exec.py` in python doesn't properly sanitize the `command` argument before executing it as a shell command (e.g., using `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)` without proper escaping), it can lead to command injection.
  - Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the machine running VSCode. An attacker can potentially gain full control over the user's system.
  - Vulnerability Rank: Critical
  - Currently implemented mitigations: No explicit sanitization or mitigation is visible in the provided code snippets. The security relies on the assumed security of `fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt()` and `shell_exec.py`, which is not guaranteed without further inspection of their implementations.
  - Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization/escaping of the `command` string in `SynchronousTerminalService.sendCommand` before passing it to `internalScripts.shell_exec`.
    - Proper argument handling in `shell_exec.py` script in Python, ideally avoiding `shell=True` and using argument lists instead of raw command strings, or using secure escaping if `shell=True` is necessary.
    - Input validation on the `command` string to ensure it conforms to expected format and doesn't contain malicious characters.
  - Preconditions:
    - The user must use a feature in the VSCode extension that utilizes `SynchronousTerminalService.sendCommand` and allows passing a command string that is not fully controlled by the extension developer (e.g., derived from user input or external sources).
    - The underlying shell must be vulnerable to command injection based on the characters used in the malicious command.
  - Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/client/common/terminal/syncTerminalService.ts`
      ```typescript
      public async sendCommand(
          command: string,
          args: string[],
          cancel?: CancellationToken,
          swallowExceptions: boolean = true,
      ): Promise<void> {
          // ...
          const state = new ExecutionState(lockFile.filePath, this.fs, [command, ...args]);
          try {
              const pythonExec = this.pythonInterpreter || (await this.interpreter.getActiveInterpreter(undefined));
              const sendArgs = internalScripts.shell_exec(command, lockFile.filePath, args); // [Vulnerable code] command is passed to shell_exec
              await this.terminalService.sendCommand(pythonExec?.path || 'python', sendArgs);
              // ...
          } finally {
              // ...
          }
      }
      ```
    - File: `/code/src/client/common/process/internal/scripts/index.ts`
      ```typescript
      // eslint-disable-next-line camelcase
      export function shell_exec(command: string, lockfile: string, shellArgs: string[]): string[] {
          const script = path.join(SCRIPTS_DIR, 'shell_exec.py');
          // We don't bother with a "parse" function since the output
          // could be anything.
          return [
              script,
              command.fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt(), // [Vulnerable code] command is passed as argument
              // The shell args must come after the command
              // but before the lockfile.
              ...shellArgs,
              lockfile.fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt(),
          ];
      }
      ```

            B --> C[shell_exec.py (Python Script - Not Provided)]
            C --> D[subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True) or similar - Assumption]
            D --> E[Operating System Shell]
            E --> F[Arbitrary Code Execution]
        ```
  - Security test case:
    1. Open VSCode with the Python extension activated.
    2. In your Python project, create or modify a Python file to include the following code to trigger the vulnerable code path (this is a simplified example, real trigger might be different based on extension features):
       ```python
       import vscode

       async def test_vulnerability():
           terminal_service = vscode.extensions.getExtension('your-extension-id').exports.get_synchronous_terminal_service() # Replace 'your-extension-id'
           malicious_command = 'harmless_command & touch /tmp/pwned_vuln_test'
           await terminal_service.sendCommand(malicious_command, [])

       test_vulnerability()
       ```
       *(Note: Replace `'your-extension-id'` with the actual extension ID and adapt the code to properly obtain the `SynchronousTerminalService` instance if needed. This is a conceptual test case, the exact triggering method depends on how the extension exposes this service.)*
    3. Run this Python code within VSCode (e.g., execute the file).
    4. After execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_vuln_test` exists on your system.
    5. If the file `/tmp/pwned_vuln_test` is created, it indicates that the command injection was successful, and the vulnerability is confirmed.
    6. For Windows, use a different command like `malicious_command = 'harmless_command & echo injected > C:\\Users\\Public\\pwned_vuln_test.txt'` and check for `C:\Users\Public\pwned_vuln_test.txt`.
