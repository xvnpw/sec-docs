## Vulnerability List for PROJECT FILES

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Synchronous Terminal Service
* Description:
    1. An attacker can inject malicious commands by manipulating the `command` or `args` parameters in the `SynchronousTerminalService.sendCommand` function.
    2. The `sendCommand` function in `syncTerminalService.ts` uses `internalScripts.shell_exec` to prepare arguments for a python script (`shell_exec.py`).
    3. `internalScripts.shell_exec` passes the user-provided `command` and `args` to the `shell_exec.py` script as command-line arguments without proper sanitization or quoting.
    4. The `shell_exec.py` script then uses `subprocess.Popen` to execute these command-line arguments in a shell environment.
    5. If the `command` or `args` contain shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `&&`, `||`, `$()`, `` ` ``) and are not properly quoted, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands that will be executed on the user's machine.
* Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    - An external attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process.
    - This can lead to complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
* Vulnerability Rank: Critical
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided code. The code does not appear to sanitize or validate the `command` and `args` parameters before executing them in a shell.
* Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for `command` and `args` in `SynchronousTerminalService.sendCommand` to prevent injection of shell metacharacters.
    - Proper quoting of `command` and `args` when constructing the command line in `internalScripts.shell_exec` and `shell_exec.py` before executing with `subprocess.Popen`.
    - Consider using `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=False` and passing command and arguments as a list to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities altogether, if possible.
* Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the `command` or `args` parameters passed to the `SynchronousTerminalService.sendCommand` function. This could occur in scenarios where the extension processes user-provided input to construct terminal commands.
* Source code analysis:
    1. **`syncTerminalService.ts` (sendCommand function):**
    ```typescript
    public async sendCommand(
        command: string,
        args: string[],
        cancel?: CancellationToken,
        swallowExceptions: boolean = true,
    ): Promise<void> {
        ...
        const lockFile = await this.createLockFile();
        const state = new ExecutionState(lockFile.filePath, this.fs, [command, ...args]);
        try {
            const pythonExec = this.pythonInterpreter || (await this.interpreter.getActiveInterpreter(undefined));
            const sendArgs = internalScripts.shell_exec(command, lockFile.filePath, args); // [HIGHLIGHT] - Potential command injection point
            await this.terminalService.sendCommand(pythonExec?.path || 'python', sendArgs);
            ...
        } finally {
            ...
        }
    }
    ```
    The `sendCommand` function takes `command` and `args` as input and passes them to `internalScripts.shell_exec`.

    2. **`internal/scripts/index.ts` (shell_exec function):**
    ```typescript
    // eslint-disable-next-line camelcase
    export function shell_exec(command: string, lockfile: string, shellArgs: string[]): string[] {
        const script = path.join(SCRIPTS_DIR, 'shell_exec.py');
        // We don't bother with a "parse" function since the output
        // could be anything.
        return [
            script,
            command.fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt(), // [HIGHLIGHT] - Argument preparation, potential issue
            // The shell args must come after the command
            // but before the lockfile.
            ...shellArgs, // [HIGHLIGHT] - Arguments passed directly, potential issue
            lockfile.fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt(), // [HIGHLIGHT] - Argument preparation, potential issue
        ];
    }
    ```
    The `shell_exec` function constructs arguments for the `shell_exec.py` script, including the user-provided `command` and `shellArgs`. `fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt()` is used, but it's not clear if it provides sufficient protection against command injection in all scenarios.

    3. **`pythonFiles/shell_exec.py` (shell_exec.py script):**
    ```python
    import subprocess
    import sys
    import os

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # First argument is the command to execute.
        command = sys.argv[1]
        # Last argument is the lockfile.
        lockfile = sys.argv[-1]
        # Middle arguments are args to the command.
        shell_args = sys.argv[2:-1]

        try:
            # subprocess.Popen is known to have security vulnerabilities if not used carefully.
            process = subprocess.Popen([command, *shell_args], shell=True, executable=os.environ['COMSPEC'] if os.name == 'nt' else '/bin/bash') # [HIGHLIGHT] - subprocess.Popen with shell=True, potential command injection
            # subprocess.Popen is known to have security vulnerabilities if not used carefully.
            process.wait()
            if process.returncode != 0:
                with open(f'{lockfile}.error', 'w') as error_file:
                    error_file.write(f'Exit Code: {process.returncode}')
                sys.exit(1)
        except Exception as ex:
            with open(f'{lockfile}.error', 'w') as error_file:
                error_file.write(str(ex))
            sys.exit(1)
        finally:
            with open(lockfile, 'w') as marker_file:
                marker_file.write('END')

    ```
    The `shell_exec.py` script uses `subprocess.Popen([command, *shell_args], shell=True, ...)` which is vulnerable to command injection if `command` or `shell_args` are not properly sanitized. `shell=True` makes the script execute the command through a shell interpreter, which interprets shell metacharacters.

    **Visualization:**

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[VSCode Extension] --> B(syncTerminalService.ts - sendCommand);
        B --> C(internalScripts.shell_exec);
        C --> D(shell_exec.py script);
        D --> E(subprocess.Popen shell=True);
        E --> F[Operating System - Shell Execution];
        F --> G[Attacker Controlled Command Execution];
    ```

* Security test case:
    1. Open VSCode with the extension enabled.
    2. Create a Python file and add a breakpoint in the `sendCommand` function within `syncTerminalService.ts`.
    3. Trigger a functionality in the extension that utilizes `SynchronousTerminalService` and allows you to control the `command` or `args` parameters (e.g., a custom command execution feature, if available, or try to trigger any feature that uses terminal commands). If no such direct feature exists, you might need to mock or modify the extension's code to inject a malicious command for testing purposes.
    4. Set `command` to a malicious string like `"$(touch /tmp/pwned)"` and `args` to an empty array `[]`.
    5. Continue the execution and observe if a file named `pwned` is created in the `/tmp/` directory (or equivalent temporary directory for your OS).
    6. If the file `pwned` is created, it confirms the command injection vulnerability.

    **Example Test Code Snippet (for internal testing/modification if direct external trigger is unavailable):**

    Modify `syncTerminalService.ts` temporarily for testing (not for production):

    ```typescript
    // ... inside SynchronousTerminalService class, in sendCommand function
    if (!cancel) {
        // return this.terminalService.sendCommand(command, args); // original code
        command = "$(touch /tmp/pwned)"; // [INJECTED MALICIOUS COMMAND]
        args = [];
    }
    ```

    Run the modified extension and trigger the code path that executes `sendCommand`. Check for the creation of `/tmp/pwned`.
