## Vulnerability List (Updated)

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Terminal Activation via Crafted Python Path
- Description: An external attacker can craft a malicious Python path that leads to command injection when opening a terminal in VSCode using the "Python: Open in Integrated Terminal" command.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. `toCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt` and `fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt` exist but are not effectively applied.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization for Python path in terminal activation commands. Robust escaping/sanitization using existing functions or safer process execution APIs.
- Preconditions: VSCode, Python extension, malicious Python path configuration, user action to open terminal.
- Source Code Analysis: `terminal.ts`, `activate` command handler, `terminal.sendText(command)` with unsanitized Python path in `activationCommands`, `helper.ts`, `environmentActivationProviders/*`, `service.ts`, `buildCommandForTerminal`.
- Security Test Case: Craft malicious Python path, configure VSCode, open workspace, trigger "Open in Terminal", verify command execution.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Package Management via Malicious Package Name
- Description: An external attacker can craft a malicious package name that leads to command injection when installing or uninstalling packages through the extension's UI.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. `toCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt` and `fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt` exist but are not effectively applied.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization for package names in package management commands. Robust escaping/sanitization using existing functions or safer process execution APIs.
- Preconditions: VSCode, Python extension, user interaction with package management features, attacker-controlled package name input.
- Source Code Analysis: `pip.ts`, `conda.ts`, `poetry.ts`, `getInstall*SpawnOptions`, `getUninstall*SpawnOptions` functions using unsanitized package names in commands, `rawProcessApis.ts`.
- Security Test Case: Enter malicious package name in "Install Package" input, trigger package installation, verify command execution.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in ActiveState Tool Path Configuration
- Description: An external attacker can inject arbitrary commands by configuring a malicious path for the ActiveState tool via user settings, leading to command execution when the extension interacts with ActiveState features.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. `toCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt` and `fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt` exist but are not applied to the ActiveState tool path setting.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization for the ActiveState tool path setting. Robust validation and sanitization of the tool path setting, or safer process execution APIs.
- Preconditions: VSCode, Python extension, malicious ActiveState tool path configuration in settings, extension's interaction with ActiveState.
- Source Code Analysis: `activestate.ts`, `getProjectsCached` function, `shellExecute` using unsanitized `stateCommand` from settings, `configSettings.ts`, `rawProcessApis.ts`.
- Security Test Case: Configure malicious ActiveState tool path in settings, open workspace, trigger ActiveState functionality (if applicable, else observe background extension activity), verify command execution.

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in Micromamba Shell Initialization via Malicious Root Prefix
- Description: An external attacker can inject arbitrary commands by configuring a malicious root prefix for Micromamba, leading to command execution during Micromamba shell initialization.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None. `toCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt` and `fileToCommandArgumentForPythonMgrExt` exist but are not applied to `MICROMAMBA_ROOTPREFIX`.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization for the Micromamba root prefix path in shell initialization commands. Robust sanitization of `MICROMAMBA_ROOTPREFIX`, or safer process execution APIs.
- Preconditions: VSCode, Python extension with Micromamba integration, malicious Micromamba root prefix configuration (hypothetical), Micromamba shell initialization trigger.
- Source Code Analysis: `micromamba/shells.ts`, `initializeMicromambaShells` function, `exec` calls using unsanitized `MICROMAMBA_ROOTPREFIX` from `constants.ts`, `rawProcessApis.ts`.
- Security Test Case: Hypothetically configure malicious Micromamba root prefix (e.g., by patching code), trigger Micromamba installation, verify command execution.
