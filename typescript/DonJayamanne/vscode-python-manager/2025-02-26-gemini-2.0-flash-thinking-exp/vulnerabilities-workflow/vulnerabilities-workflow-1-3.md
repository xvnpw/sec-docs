- Vulnerability name: Potential Command Injection in Package Installation and Uninstallation
- Description:
    The `installPackage` and `uninstallPackage` functions in `/code/src/environments/packages.ts` and related functions in `/code/src/environments/tools/pip.ts`, `/code/src/environments/tools/conda.ts`, and `/code/src/environments/tools/poetry.ts` construct shell commands using package names that are obtained from user input via `searchPackage`. If the package name returned from `searchPackage` is not properly sanitized, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft a malicious package name that, when processed by the extension, executes arbitrary commands on the user's system.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. An attacker somehow influences the search results to include a malicious package name. This could be through poisoning package repositories (PyPI, conda-forge, etc.), which is less likely to be directly controlled by an external attacker targeting the VSCode extension, but still a theoretical vector if the upstream repos are compromised. A more plausible scenario is if the search provider itself is vulnerable or if the search results processing is flawed.
    2. User searches for a package using the "search package" functionality provided by the extension.
    3. The search results include the malicious package name crafted by the attacker.
    4. User selects the malicious package from the search results to install or uninstall.
    5. The extension constructs a shell command using the unsanitized malicious package name.
    6. The shell command is executed, leading to command injection and arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- Impact:
    Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could allow an attacker to:
    - Install malware.
    - Steal sensitive data.
    - Modify system configurations.
    - Pivot to other systems.
- Vulnerability rank: critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The code does not appear to have any explicit sanitization or validation of package names before constructing shell commands. The `searchPackageWithProvider` in `/code/src/environments/packageSearch.ts` retrieves package information, but does not sanitize the `item` property that contains the package name. This unsanitized package name is then passed to `installPackage` and `uninstallPackage` in `/code/src/environments/packages.ts`, and subsequently used in `getInstallPipPackageSpawnOptions`, `getUninstallPipPackageSpawnOptions`, `getCondaPackageInstallSpawnOptions`, `getUninstallCondaPackageSpawnOptions`, `getPoetryPackageInstallSpawnOptions`, `getUninstallPoetryPackageSpawnOptions` within the `tools` directory, where shell commands are constructed.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Package names retrieved from search results should be strictly validated and sanitized before being used in shell commands. This should include escaping shell metacharacters and ensuring that the package name conforms to expected formats.
    - Command construction: Use parameterized commands or argument lists instead of constructing commands as strings to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities. When using `child_process.spawn` or similar functions, pass arguments as an array rather than a single command string where shell interpretation might occur.
- Preconditions:
    1. User must use the "search package" functionality of the VSCode extension.
    2. Search results must contain a malicious package name.
    3. User must select and attempt to install or uninstall the malicious package.
- Source code analysis:
    The file `/code/src/environments/packages.ts` uses `searchPackageWithProvider` from `/code/src/environments/packageSearch.ts` to get package information.
    ```typescript
    export async function searchPackage(env: Environment): Promise<SearchPackageResult> {
        try {
            if (isCondaEnvironment(env)) {
                const result = await searchPackageWithProvider(searchCondaPackage, env);
                if (!result) {
                    throw new CancellationError();
                }
                return { conda: result };
            }
            // ... other environment types
            const result = await searchPackageWithProvider(searchPipPackage, env);
            if (!result) {
                throw new CancellationError();
            }
            return { pip: result };
        } catch (ex) {
            traceError(`Failed to install a package in ${env.id})`, ex);
            throw ex;
        }
    }
    ```
    `searchPackageWithProvider` in `/code/src/environments/packageSearch.ts` retrieves package items but doesn't sanitize the `item` property.
    ```typescript
    export async function searchPackageWithProvider<T>(searchProvider: SearchProvider<T>, env: Environment): Promise<T | undefined> {
        // ...
        quickPick.onDidAccept(async () => {
            if (!quickPick.selectedItems.length) {
                return;
            }
            // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
            resolve('item' in quickPick.selectedItems[0] ? (quickPick.selectedItems[0] as any).item : undefined);
            quickPick.hide();
        });
        // ...
    }
    ```
    The package name from the `item` property is then used in `installPackage` and `uninstallPackage` in `/code/src/environments/packages.ts` to construct commands using functions from `/code/src/environments/tools/pip.ts`, `/code/src/environments/tools/conda.ts`, and `/code/src/environments/tools/poetry.ts`. For example, in `installPackage`:
    ```typescript
    export async function installPackage(env: Environment, packageInfo: SearchPackageResult) {
        let packageName = '';
        if ('conda' in packageInfo && packageInfo.conda) {
            packageName = packageInfo.conda.name;
        } else if ('poetry' in packageInfo && packageInfo.poetry) {
            packageName = packageInfo.poetry;
        } else if ('pip' in packageInfo && packageInfo.pip) {
            packageName = packageInfo.pip.name;
        } else {
            throw new Error('Not supported');
        }

        await window.withProgress(
            { location: ProgressLocation.Notification, cancellable: true, title: `Installing ${packageName}` },
            async (progress, token) => {
                let result: {
                    command: string;
                    args: string[];
                    options?: SpawnOptions | undefined;
                };
                try {
                    if ('conda' in packageInfo && packageInfo.conda) {
                        result = await getCondaPackageInstallSpawnOptions(env, packageInfo.conda, token);
                    } else if ('poetry' in packageInfo && packageInfo.poetry) {
                        result = await getPoetryPackageInstallSpawnOptions(env, packageInfo.poetry, token);
                    } else if ('pip' in packageInfo && packageInfo.pip) {
                        result = await getInstallPipPackageSpawnOptions(env, packageInfo.pip, token);
                    } else {
                        throw new Error('Not supported');
                    }
                    // ... command execution using result.command and result.args
                } catch (ex) {
                    traceError(`Failed to install package ${packageName} into ${getEnvLoggingInfo(env)})`, ex);
                }
            },
        );
    }
    ```
    Functions like `getInstallPipPackageSpawnOptions` in `/code/src/environments/tools/pip.ts` directly use the package name to construct command arguments without sanitization:
    ```typescript
    export async function getInstallPipPackageSpawnOptions(
        env: Environment,
        pkg: PipPackageInfo,
        _token: CancellationToken,
    ): Promise<{ command: string; args: string[]; options?: SpawnOptions }> {
        return { command: env.path, args: ['-m', 'pip', 'install', pkg.name, '-q'] };
    }
    ```
    If `pkg.name` contains malicious shell characters, they will be interpreted by the shell when the command is executed.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Have the VSCode extension installed and activated.
        - Have Python and pip/conda/poetry available in an environment managed by the extension.
    2. **Poison Search Results (Simulated):**
        - To simulate a malicious package name in search results, we can intercept the `searchPackageWithProvider` function. In a real scenario, this would involve poisoning an upstream package repository or compromising the search provider. For testing purposes, we will modify the behavior of `searchPackageWithProvider` to return a malicious package name.
        - Modify `/code/src/environments/packageSearch.ts` temporarily for testing. Inside `searchPackageWithProvider`, before returning items, add a malicious item to the results. For example, if `searchProvider` is `searchPipPackage`, and you are testing pip:
        ```typescript
        // ... inside searchPackageWithProvider function, before `quickPick.items = packages;`
        if (searchProvider === searchPipPackage) {
            packages.push({
                label: 'malicious-package',
                description: 'Malicious package for testing command injection',
                detail: 'This package is designed to trigger command injection',
                item: { name: 'test-package"; touch PWNED_COMMAND_INJECTION; #', version: '1.0.0', description: 'Malicious package' } // Malicious package name here
            });
        }
        ```
        - **Note**: Modifying extension code directly is only for local testing. In a real attack scenario, the attacker would need to influence the actual search results from package repositories.
    3. **Search for a Package:**
        - In VSCode, use the extension's functionality to search for a package (e.g., using a command like "Python Environments: Search Package"). Enter any search term that will trigger the modified `searchPackageWithProvider` to include the malicious package in the results.
    4. **Select and Install Malicious Package:**
        - From the search results in the QuickPick, select the "malicious-package" (or whatever label you used).
        - Choose to install the selected package.
    5. **Verify Command Injection:**
        - After attempting to install the package, check if the command injection was successful. In the example malicious package name `'test-package"; touch PWNED_COMMAND_INJECTION; #'`, the command `touch PWNED_COMMAND_INJECTION` should have been executed.
        - Check for the file `PWNED_COMMAND_INJECTION` in your workspace or a predictable location (e.g., user's home directory, depending on where the extension executes commands). If the file exists, command injection is confirmed.
    6. **Clean up (after testing):**
        - Revert the changes made to `/code/src/environments/packageSearch.ts` to remove the malicious package injection for testing.
        - Delete the `PWNED_COMMAND_INJECTION` file if it was created.

- Vulnerability name: Potential Path Traversal in Environment Activation Scripts
- Description:
    The `getEnvironmentActivationShellCommands` function, used in `/code/src/client/interpreter/activation/service.ts` to generate shell commands for environment activation, might be vulnerable to path traversal. If the environment path is not properly sanitized before being used in the script generation, an attacker could potentially craft a malicious environment path containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). When the extension attempts to activate an environment using this path, the generated activation script could inadvertently access or execute files outside of the intended environment directory due to the path traversal.

    Steps to trigger vulnerability:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python environment path containing path traversal sequences.
    2. User configures the VSCode extension to use this malicious environment path as their Python interpreter. This can be done through settings or by directly selecting the interpreter.
    3. VSCode attempts to activate the selected Python environment, which triggers the vulnerable script generation process.
    4. The extension calls `getEnvironmentActivationShellCommands` using the malicious environment path.
    5. If `getEnvironmentActivationShellCommands` or its underlying implementations do not sanitize the path, it generates activation scripts that include path traversal sequences.
    6. When these scripts are executed, they may access or execute files outside the intended environment directory, leading to path traversal.
- Impact:
    Path traversal could allow an attacker to read sensitive files, execute arbitrary code (if executable files are targeted), or bypass security restrictions by manipulating the environment activation process.
- Vulnerability rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None apparent in the provided code snippets. The code relies on `ITerminalHelper` and its implementations to handle path sanitization during activation script generation, which is not explicitly shown in these files. The file `/code/src/common/terminal/helper.ts` is responsible for getting environment activation commands. It uses different `ITerminalActivationCommandProvider` implementations located in `/code/src/client/common/terminal/environmentActivationProviders/` directory, such as `bash.ts`, `nushell.ts`, `commandPrompt.ts`, `condaActivationProvider.ts`, `pipEnvActivationProvider.ts`, and `pyenvActivationProvider.ts`. These providers generate activation commands that include file paths. If the environment paths provided to these providers are not sanitized, path traversal vulnerabilities can occur.
- Missing mitigations:
    Input sanitization for environment paths before generating activation scripts in `ITerminalHelper` implementations and within `ITerminalActivationCommandProvider` implementations. Ensure that path traversal sequences are neutralized or disallowed when constructing file paths used in activation scripts.
- Preconditions:
    1. User must select or configure a Python environment with a maliciously crafted path.
    2. The environment path must contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
    3. The VSCode extension attempts to activate this environment.
- Source code analysis:
    1. **`/code/src/client/interpreter/activation/service.ts` - `getActivatedEnvironmentVariablesImpl` function:**
    ```typescript
    public async getActivatedEnvironmentVariablesImpl(
        resource: Resource,
        interpreter?: PythonEnvironment,
        allowExceptions?: boolean,
        shell?: string,
    ): Promise<NodeJS.ProcessEnv | undefined> {
        // ...
        const activationCommands = await this.helper.getEnvironmentActivationShellCommands(
            resource,
            shellInfo.shellType,
            interpreter,
        );
        // ...
    }
    ```
    The vulnerability lies in the `getEnvironmentActivationShellCommands` function of the `ITerminalHelper` interface. The provided code does not show explicit path sanitization within `getEnvironmentActivationShellCommands` in `/code/src/client/common/terminal/helper.ts` or in the `getActivationCommandsForInterpreter` and `getActivationCommands` methods of the `ITerminalActivationCommandProvider` implementations in `/code/src/client/common/terminal/environmentActivationProviders/`. If these functions directly use the `interpreter.path` or environment paths to construct commands without proper sanitization, path traversal is possible.
- Security test case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Have the VSCode extension installed and activated.
        - Have Python and a virtual environment manager (e.g., venv) available.
        - Create a malicious virtual environment path. For example, create a directory named `malicious_env_path_traversal`. Inside this directory, create a symbolic link (or junction on Windows) named `env` that points to `/tmp/..`. Inside `/tmp`, create a file named `pwned_path_traversal.txt`. The malicious environment path would be `/path/to/malicious_env_path_traversal/env`.
    2. **Configure Malicious Environment Path:**
        - In VSCode, open settings and set `python.pythonPath` to the malicious environment path: `/path/to/malicious_env_path_traversal/env/bin/python` (or `/path/to/malicious_env_path_traversal/env/Scripts/python.exe` on Windows).
    3. **Trigger Environment Activation:**
        - Open a new integrated terminal in VSCode. This action should trigger the extension to activate the configured Python environment.
    4. **Verify Path Traversal:**
        - After opening the terminal, check if path traversal occurred. For instance, attempt to verify if the file `/tmp/pwned_path_traversal.txt` was accessed or if any unexpected behavior related to file access outside the intended environment is observed during terminal initialization.
        - A more direct approach is to examine the generated activation commands (through debugging or detailed logging, if available) to confirm if they contain the path traversal sequences and are attempting to operate outside the expected environment directory.
    5. **Expected Outcome:**
        - If `ITerminalHelper` is vulnerable to path traversal, the activation script, when executed, might attempt to access or operate within `/tmp` (due to `../` in the path) instead of the intended virtual environment directory. Successful creation or modification of files in `/tmp` (or attempts to access files in `/tmp`) as a result of environment activation would confirm the path traversal vulnerability.
