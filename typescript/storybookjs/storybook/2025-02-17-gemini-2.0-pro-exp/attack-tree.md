## Attack Tree Path: [<<{Exploit Storybook Configuration/Deployment}>>](./attack_tree_paths/{exploit_storybook_configurationdeployment}.md)

This entire branch represents the most critical and easily exploitable set of vulnerabilities. Misconfigurations in deployment are the primary concern.

   *   **<<{Exposed Storybook}>> (Critical Node within the Critical Path):**
        *   **Description:** Storybook is deployed to a publicly accessible environment without proper access controls (e.g., no authentication, no firewall, no VPN). This is a catastrophic error.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            1.  **Discovery:** Attacker uses search engines (Shodan, Google Dorking) or port scanning to find publicly accessible Storybook instances.
            2.  **Access:** Attacker directly accesses the Storybook URL in a web browser.
            3.  **Exploitation:** Attacker browses stories, inspects components, potentially extracts sensitive information (if present in stories â€“ which should *never* be the case), and identifies potential attack vectors for further exploitation of the main application. They might also find information about internal APIs, infrastructure, or development practices.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (but alarmingly common due to misconfiguration).
        *   **Impact:** High (complete exposure of Storybook, potential access to sensitive information, reconnaissance for further attacks).
        *   **Effort:** Low (trivial to find and access if exposed).
        *   **Skill Level:** Low (requires minimal technical skill).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (for the attacker), High (for the defender without proactive monitoring).

   *   **[Weak/Default Credentials]:**
        *   **Description:** If Storybook *is* configured with authentication (which it should be, even in development), weak or default credentials are used.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            1.  **Credential Guessing:** Attacker attempts to log in using common usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin, admin/password).
            2.  **Brute-Force Attack:** Attacker uses automated tools to try a large number of username/password combinations.
            3.  **Access:** If successful, the attacker gains full access to the Storybook instance.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on password policies).
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (unauthorized access to Storybook).
        *   **Effort:** Low (automated tools are readily available).
        *   **Skill Level:** Low (requires minimal technical skill).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (failed login attempts might be logged).

## Attack Tree Path: [[Abuse Storybook Addons] -> {Vulnerable Addon}](./attack_tree_paths/_abuse_storybook_addons__-_{vulnerable_addon}.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within legitimate Storybook addons.

   *   **{Vulnerable Addon}:**
        *   **Description:** A legitimate, published Storybook addon contains a security vulnerability (e.g., XSS, command injection, insecure deserialization).
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            1.  **Vulnerability Identification:** Attacker researches known vulnerabilities in Storybook addons or performs their own security analysis.
            2.  **Exploitation:** Attacker crafts a malicious input or request that triggers the vulnerability in the addon. This could involve manipulating URL parameters, form inputs, or other data passed to the addon.
            3.  **Impact:** The specific impact depends on the vulnerability.
                *   **XSS:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users' browsers, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting users.
                *   **Command Injection:** Attacker executes arbitrary commands on the server hosting Storybook.
                *   **Insecure Deserialization:** Attacker manipulates serialized data to execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (vulnerabilities in third-party libraries are common).
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the specific vulnerability).
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (exploiting a *known* vulnerability is often easier than finding a new one).
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (depends on the complexity of the vulnerability).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (vulnerability scanners can detect known vulnerabilities; exploitation might require monitoring for unusual application behavior).
