# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Code Reviews and Data Sanitization (Storybook-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_code_reviews_and_data_sanitization__storybook-specific_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Strict Code Reviews and Data Sanitization (Storybook-Specific)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Storybook-Specific Policy:** Maintain a documented policy *exclusively* for Storybook, prohibiting sensitive data (API keys, PII, internal URLs) in *any* part of a story: props, mock data, comments, addon configurations.
    2.  **Dedicated Storybook Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews *specifically* for Storybook stories, separate from component reviews. Reviewers should have Storybook security training.
    3.  **Storybook Review Checklist:** Use a checklist during reviews, focusing on:
        *   Absence of hardcoded secrets (regex checks can help).
        *   Use of *only* the approved data generation library for mock data.
        *   No internal URLs or network paths.
        *   Sanitization of any user-provided input (if applicable).
    4.  **Data Generation Library (Storybook-Focused):** Develop/adopt a library *dedicated* to generating realistic but *fake* data *specifically for Storybook*. This library should be the *sole* source of mock data.
    5.  **Storybook-Specific Training:** Train developers on the Storybook security policy, review process, and the data generation library.
    6.  **Storybook Linters/Static Analysis (Optional):** Explore Storybook-specific linters or static analysis tools that can automatically flag potential policy violations within story files.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Sensitive Data in Stories):** *High Severity*. Direct exposure of secrets within Storybook.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Indirectly via Leaked Info):** *Medium Severity*. Leaked internal URLs within Storybook.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** *High Impact*. Prevents sensitive data from being included in Storybook.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** *Medium Impact*. Reduces the risk of leaking information useful for further attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Policy Document: `/docs/security/storybook-security-policy.md`
    *   Code Review Checklist: `/docs/security/storybook-review-checklist.md`
    *   Mandatory Reviews: Enforced via pull request checks.
    *   Data Generation Library: Partially implemented in `/src/utils/mockData.js`. Needs expansion.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Storybook-Specific Linters/Static Analysis: Not yet implemented.
    *   Data Generation Library: Incomplete coverage.
    *   Storybook-Specific Training: Needs regular refreshers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Vulnerability Scanning (Storybook Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_vulnerability_scanning__storybook_focus_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Dependency Management and Vulnerability Scanning (Storybook Focus)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Storybook Dependency Locking:** Ensure `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` is *always* used to guarantee consistent Storybook builds and prevent unexpected dependency changes.
    2.  **Regular Storybook Updates:** Establish a schedule for updating Storybook *and all its addons*. Prioritize updates addressing security vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Storybook Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate a vulnerability scanner (Snyk, npm audit) into the CI/CD pipeline, configured to specifically scan Storybook and its addon dependencies.
    4.  **Storybook-Specific Alerting:** Configure the scanner to send alerts (email, Slack) for vulnerabilities found in Storybook or its addons.
    5.  **Minimal Addon Usage:** *Strictly* limit the number of installed Storybook addons. Each addon adds dependencies and potential attack surface. Document the justification for *each* addon.
    6.  **Addon Security Review:** Before installing *any* Storybook addon, review its:
        *   Popularity and maintenance status (GitHub stars, recent commits).
        *   Security-related issues in its issue tracker.
        *   Source code (if possible) for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Storybook Dependencies:** *High Severity*. Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Storybook or its addons.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Storybook Addons):** *Medium Severity*. Malicious code introduced through compromised addons.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** *High Impact*. Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** *Medium Impact*. Mitigates the risk of compromised addons.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dependency Locking: `package-lock.json` is used.
    *   Vulnerability Scanning: Snyk integrated into CI/CD.
    *   Alerting: Snyk email alerts configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Minimal Addon Usage: Needs a review of installed addons.
    *   Addon Security Review: Formal process needs to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Content Security Policy (CSP) (Storybook Context)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_content_security_policy__csp___storybook_context_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Input Sanitization and Content Security Policy (CSP) (Storybook Context)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Storybook Input Points:** Identify all places within Storybook where user input or external data is displayed: component props, addon configurations, custom addons.
    2.  **Storybook Sanitization:** Use a sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) *within Storybook stories and addons* to sanitize *any* user input or data *before* it's rendered. This is crucial even for seemingly "safe" data.
    3.  **Storybook CSP (via `managerHead`):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) *specifically for Storybook*. This can be done by adding a `<meta>` tag with the CSP directives to the `managerHead` section of your Storybook configuration (usually in `.storybook/manager-head.html` or through a similar configuration mechanism).
    4.  **Storybook CSP Configuration:** Carefully configure the CSP to allow *only* necessary resources for Storybook to function.  Use a CSP validator to ensure correctness.
    5.  **Storybook-Specific Testing:** Thoroughly test sanitization and CSP within Storybook using browser developer tools and automated tests (if possible).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (within Storybook):** *High Severity*. XSS attacks targeting the Storybook interface itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** *High Impact*. Sanitization and CSP significantly reduce the risk of XSS within Storybook.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Sanitization Library: DOMPurify used in *some* components, but not consistently.
    *   CSP Header: Basic CSP implemented, but needs review and tightening.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent Sanitization: Need to enforce DOMPurify usage across *all* stories and addons.
    *   Storybook CSP Review: Current CSP needs to be reviewed and made more restrictive, specifically tailored to Storybook's needs.
    *   Storybook-Specific Testing: More comprehensive testing of XSS mitigations within Storybook is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Storybook Feature Usage](./mitigation_strategies/secure_storybook_feature_usage.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Storybook Feature Usage**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Custom Addon Code Review:** Thoroughly review the code of *all* custom Storybook addons, focusing on how they handle Markdown, HTML, or user input. Look for XSS or code injection vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Sanitize Markdown/HTML (within Addons):** If addons or stories allow user-provided Markdown or HTML, *always* sanitize it using a library like DOMPurify *before* rendering.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Storybook Features:** If features like `DocsPage` with arbitrary Markdown rendering, or specific addons, are not *essential*, disable them to reduce attack surface. Document the reasoning.
    4.  **Regular Storybook Audits:** Periodically audit the usage of Storybook features and addons to ensure secure usage and identify new vulnerabilities.
    5.  **Least Privilege (Addon Development):** When developing custom addons, adhere to the principle of least privilege. Addons should only request necessary permissions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (via Addons/Docs):** *High Severity*. Malicious code injected through Markdown or HTML within Storybook.
    *   **Code Injection (via Addons):** *High Severity*. Vulnerabilities in custom addons allowing arbitrary code execution within Storybook.
    *   **Information Disclosure (via Addons):** *Medium Severity*. Poorly written addons leaking sensitive information within Storybook.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** *High Impact*. Sanitization and review significantly reduce the risk.
    *   **Code Injection:** *High Impact*. Code review and least privilege are crucial.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** *Medium Impact*. Audits and careful addon development minimize the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Review Custom Addons: Initial review conducted, but needs regular updates.
    *   Disable Unnecessary Features: Some unnecessary addons disabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sanitize Markdown/HTML: Consistent sanitization not yet implemented everywhere.
    *   Regular Storybook Audits: Formal schedule for audits needed.
    *   Least Privilege (Addon Development): Needs explicit enforcement.
