# Threat Model Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Stories](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_stories.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a publicly exposed or poorly secured Storybook instance. They browse through the stories and find sensitive data, such as API keys, internal URLs, PII, or database credentials, that were hardcoded into the story's source code or displayed within the rendered component. The attacker might use this information for further attacks or data breaches.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of API keys, leading to unauthorized access to backend services.
    *   Exposure of PII, leading to privacy violations and potential legal consequences.
    *   Revelation of internal network structure, aiding in reconnaissance for further attacks.
    *   Data breaches and financial losses.
*   **Affected Storybook Component:**
    *   `*.stories.js` (or `*.stories.tsx`, `*.stories.jsx`, etc.) files: The actual story files where component examples and data are defined.
    *   Component source code (if directly included or referenced within the story): The component itself might contain hardcoded sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Hardcode Secrets:** Absolutely prohibit hardcoding any sensitive data directly within stories or component code.
    *   **Mock Data:** Use mock data generators (libraries like Faker.js, or Storybook addons like `@storybook/addon-mock` or `msw-storybook-addon`) to create realistic but non-sensitive data for testing and demonstration.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Load sensitive configuration data from environment variables.  Document clearly how to set these variables for local development and testing. *Never* commit environment variable values to the repository.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for all stories, with a specific focus on identifying and removing any potential sensitive data.
    *   **Automated Scanning:** Integrate static analysis tools or linters into the development workflow to automatically scan for potential secrets or sensitive data patterns within story files.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access control (authentication and authorization) for all Storybook deployments.

## Threat: [Malicious Addon Compromises Storybook](./threats/malicious_addon_compromises_storybook.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious Storybook addon to a public repository (e.g., npm). A developer unknowingly installs this addon. The addon could then:
    *   Inject malicious JavaScript into the Storybook environment, potentially stealing developer credentials or modifying build artifacts.
    *   Exfiltrate data from the Storybook environment.
    *   Disrupt the development workflow.
    *   Use the compromised Storybook instance as a launching point for further attacks on the development environment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of developer credentials.
    *   Injection of malicious code into the production application (if build artifacts are affected).
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Disruption of development workflow.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Affected Storybook Component:**
    *   Storybook Addons: Specifically, any third-party addon installed via `npm install` or similar.
    *   `main.js` (or equivalent configuration file): Where addons are registered.
    *   Potentially any part of Storybook that the addon interacts with.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Vetting:** Thoroughly vet any third-party addon before installation. Check the addon's:
        *   **Reputation:** Look for reviews, stars, and community feedback.
        *   **Source Code:** If available, review the source code for suspicious patterns.
        *   **Maintainer:** Check the maintainer's profile and activity.
        *   **Dependencies:** Examine the addon's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a package manager (npm, yarn) with lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent and reproducible dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly run vulnerability scanners (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in Storybook and its addons.
    *   **Minimal Addons:** Only install addons that are absolutely necessary. Avoid using experimental or poorly maintained addons.
    *   **Update Regularly:** Keep Storybook and all addons updated to the latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Storybook Instance](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_storybook_instance.md)

*   **Description:** Storybook is deployed to a publicly accessible URL without any authentication mechanisms in place. An attacker can simply navigate to the URL and access the Storybook instance, viewing all components and stories.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of internal component designs and logic.
    *   Potential disclosure of sensitive information (if present in stories â€“ see Threat 1).
    *   Increased attack surface for other vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Storybook Component:**
    *   The entire Storybook instance.  This is a deployment and configuration issue, not a specific code component.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication:** Implement authentication for *all* Storybook deployments. Options include:
        *   **Basic Authentication:** Simple username/password.
        *   **Reverse Proxy Authentication:** Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) to handle authentication.
        *   **SSO (Single Sign-On):** Integrate with your organization's SSO provider.
        *   **Storybook Addons:** Explore addons that provide authentication features.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Deploy Storybook to a network segment that is only accessible to authorized users (e.g., a VPN, internal network).
    *   **Never Deploy to Publicly Accessible URLs Without Authentication:** This should be a fundamental rule.
