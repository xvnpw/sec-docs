# Attack Surface Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure: Internal Component Logic](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_internal_component_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of the internal structure, props, and potentially the source code of application components.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** Storybook's core functionality is to display and document components, making their internal details readily accessible. This is *inherent* to Storybook's design.
*   **Example:** A Storybook instance reveals the props and source code of a component that handles user authentication, showing how user roles are managed internally. An attacker could use this information to craft targeted attacks against the main application.
*   **Impact:** Facilitates targeted attacks, reverse engineering, and potential discovery of vulnerabilities in the main application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Source Code Control:** Use Storybook's `parameters.docs.source.excludeStories` (or similar configuration options) to prevent source code display for sensitive components.
    *   **Prop Control:** Limit the exposure of sensitive props through Storybook's "controls." Avoid controls that allow manipulation of props related to security, authentication, or data handling.
    *   **Docs Mode:** For publicly accessible Storybook instances, use "docs" mode with minimal information, focusing on usage examples rather than internal implementation.
    *   **Code Review:** Regularly review Storybook configurations and stories to ensure sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed.
    *   **Abstraction:** Create wrapper components or stories that present a simplified, less revealing interface for sensitive components.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure: Secrets and API Keys](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_secrets_and_api_keys.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental exposure of API keys, environment variables, or other secrets within Storybook stories or addon configurations.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** Developers might inadvertently hardcode secrets into stories for testing or demonstration purposes, or misconfigure addons to expose sensitive data. This is a direct risk related to *how* Storybook is used.
*   **Example:** A Storybook story for a component that interacts with a third-party API includes the API key directly in the code. This key is then exposed to anyone with access to the Storybook instance.
*   **Impact:** Direct compromise of connected services, data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Hardcode Secrets:** Absolutely prohibit hardcoding secrets in Storybook stories or configurations.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables and inject them into Storybook's build process (e.g., `process.env` with build-time replacement). Ensure these variables are *not* exposed in the built output.
    *   **Mock Data:** Use Storybook's `parameters` or context features to pass in mock data or configurations that *resemble* real data but contain no actual secrets.
    *   **Code Review:** Implement strict code review processes to prevent accidental inclusion of secrets.
    *   **Pre-Commit Hooks:** Use tools like `git-secrets` to prevent committing secrets to the repository.
    *   **Secrets Management Tools:** Consider using dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely manage and inject secrets, even during development.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Vulnerable Addons](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_vulnerable_addons.md)

*   **Description:** Introduction of XSS vulnerabilities into the Storybook *environment* itself through poorly written or malicious third-party addons.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** Storybook's extensibility through addons creates a direct vector for XSS if an addon is not properly secured. This is a vulnerability *within* the Storybook ecosystem.
*   **Example:** A malicious addon injects a script into the Storybook UI that steals user cookies or redirects users to a phishing site.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the Storybook environment, potential data theft, and potential for further attacks against users of the Storybook instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Addon Vetting:** Thoroughly vet all third-party addons before installation. Check their code, reviews, and community reputation.
    *   **Update Addons:** Keep addons updated to their latest versions to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Minimal Addons:** Use a minimal set of addons to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** Report any suspected vulnerabilities in addons to their maintainers.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strict CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even in addons.

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional Public Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_public_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental deployment of an internal Storybook instance to a publicly accessible location.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** While a general deployment issue, the *content* of Storybook (component details, potential secrets) makes this a critical risk specifically *because* it's a Storybook instance.
*   **Example:** A Storybook instance intended for internal use only is deployed to a public URL without any authentication or access controls.
*   **Impact:** Exposes all information disclosure risks (component logic, secrets, network structure) to the public internet.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Deployment Procedures:** Implement strict deployment procedures and controls, with clear separation between internal and public environments.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Use network segmentation and access controls (VPNs, IP whitelisting) to restrict access to internal Storybook instances.
    *   **Authentication:** Implement authentication (basic auth, OAuth, etc.) even for internal Storybook instances.
    *   **Build Configurations:** Use different build configurations for public and internal deployments, ensuring that sensitive information is only included in internal builds.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit deployed Storybook instances to ensure they are not unintentionally exposed.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks.md)

* **Description:** Compromise of Storybook itself or one of its dependencies, leading to the introduction of malicious code.
* **How Storybook Contributes:** Storybook, as a software project with its own dependencies, is directly susceptible to supply chain attacks. This is a risk inherent to using *any* software, but is listed here because it directly impacts Storybook.
* **Example:** A compromised npm package used by a popular Storybook addon injects malicious code into the Storybook build process.
* **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and compromise of the entire Storybook environment and potentially the main application.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to identify and track dependencies, and to detect known vulnerabilities.
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep Storybook and all its addons updated to the latest versions.
    * **Dependency Monitoring:** Monitor for security advisories related to Storybook and its dependencies.
    * **Private Registry:** Consider using a private npm registry to control and vet the dependencies used in your project.
    * **Dependency Pinning:** Pin dependencies to specific versions (with caution, balancing security and maintainability). Regularly review and update pinned versions.
    * **Code Audits:** For critical dependencies, consider performing code audits to identify potential vulnerabilities.
