# Deep Analysis: Information Disclosure (Secrets and API Keys) in Storybook

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand and mitigate the risk of accidental exposure of sensitive information (API keys, secrets, environment variables) within a Storybook instance.  We aim to provide actionable guidance to developers and establish robust preventative measures.  This analysis focuses specifically on how Storybook's usage patterns and features can contribute to this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis covers the following areas:

*   **Storybook Stories:**  Code within individual Storybook stories (`*.stories.js`, `*.stories.tsx`, etc.).
*   **Storybook Addons:**  Configuration and usage of official and third-party Storybook addons.
*   **Storybook Configuration:**  The main Storybook configuration files (e.g., `main.js`, `preview.js`).
*   **Build Process:**  How Storybook's build process handles environment variables and other potential sources of secrets.
*   **Deployment Environment:**  Where and how the built Storybook is deployed (e.g., public web server, internal network).
* **Git Repository:** How secrets can be commited to git repository.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General application security outside the context of Storybook.
*   Security of the underlying infrastructure (servers, networks) *unless* directly related to Storybook deployment.
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party APIs themselves (we assume the API keys are valid and need protection).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis employs the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review Simulation:**  We will conceptually "review" common Storybook usage patterns, identifying potential points of secret exposure.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  We will consider various attack scenarios where an attacker could gain access to exposed secrets.
*   **Best Practices Analysis:**  We will compare current practices against established security best practices for handling secrets.
*   **Tool Analysis:**  We will evaluate the effectiveness of tools and techniques for preventing and detecting secret exposure.
*   **Documentation Review:**  We will examine Storybook's official documentation for guidance and potential pitfalls related to secrets management.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1. Threat Vectors and Attack Scenarios

Several attack scenarios can lead to secret exposure within Storybook:

*   **Publicly Accessible Storybook:**  If Storybook is deployed to a publicly accessible URL without proper authentication, *any* exposed secret is immediately vulnerable.  An attacker could simply browse the Storybook instance and inspect the source code.
*   **Internal Network Exposure:**  Even if Storybook is deployed internally, an attacker who gains access to the internal network (e.g., through phishing, compromised credentials) could access the Storybook instance.
*   **Source Code Leakage:**  If the source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) is compromised or accidentally made public, any secrets committed to the repository are exposed.
*   **Compromised Developer Machine:**  If a developer's machine is compromised, an attacker could access the source code and any locally stored secrets.
*   **Third-Party Addon Vulnerability:**  A malicious or vulnerable third-party Storybook addon could leak secrets.
*   **Insecure Build Process:** If the build process is not configured securely, environment variables or other secrets might be inadvertently included in the built Storybook output.

### 4.2. Common Mistakes and Vulnerabilities

Here are specific ways secrets can be leaked within Storybook, categorized by area:

**4.2.1. Storybook Stories:**

*   **Hardcoded API Keys:**  The most direct vulnerability.  Example:
    ```javascript
    // BAD:  Never do this!
    export const MyComponentStory = () => (
      <MyComponent apiKey="sk_live_1234567890abcdef" />
    );
    ```
*   **Accidental Exposure via Props:**  Passing secrets as props, even if intended for internal use, can expose them in the Storybook UI.
    ```javascript
    // BAD:  Secrets exposed in the Storybook UI
    export const MyComponentStory = (args) => <MyComponent {...args} />;
    MyComponentStory.args = {
        apiKey: "sk_live_1234567890abcdef",
    };
    ```
*   **Conditional Rendering Based on Secrets:**  Using secrets to conditionally render parts of a story can leak information about the secret's value or structure.

**4.2.2. Storybook Addons:**

*   **Addons Requiring API Keys:**  Some addons (e.g., for interacting with design tools or APIs) might require API keys.  Misconfiguring these addons can expose the keys.
*   **Addons Displaying Environment Variables:**  An addon designed to display environment variables for debugging purposes could inadvertently expose sensitive variables.
*   **Vulnerable Addons:**  A third-party addon with a security vulnerability could be exploited to leak secrets.

**4.2.3. Storybook Configuration:**

*   **Hardcoded Secrets in `main.js` or `preview.js`:**  Similar to stories, hardcoding secrets in configuration files is a major vulnerability.
*   **Incorrect Webpack Configuration:**  Misconfiguring Webpack (which Storybook uses internally) can lead to secrets being included in the bundled JavaScript files.

**4.2.4. Build Process:**

*   **Environment Variables in Build Output:**  If environment variables are not properly handled during the build process, they might be included in the final output.  This is especially dangerous if using a simple string replacement mechanism.
*   **Lack of Build-Time Validation:**  Not checking for the presence of secrets during the build process can allow them to slip through.

**4.2.5. Git Repository:**

*   **Committing Secrets:**  Accidentally committing secrets to the Git repository is a common and serious mistake. This exposes the secrets to anyone with access to the repository, and the secrets remain in the repository's history even after they are removed.

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies provide a layered defense against secret exposure:

**4.3.1.  Never Hardcode Secrets (Reinforced):**

*   **Policy:**  Establish a strict, zero-tolerance policy against hardcoding secrets *anywhere* in the codebase, including Storybook files.
*   **Training:**  Educate all developers on the dangers of hardcoding secrets and the proper alternatives.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews must explicitly check for hardcoded secrets.

**4.3.2.  Environment Variables (Proper Usage):**

*   **Build-Time Injection:**  Use environment variables and inject them into Storybook's build process.  This typically involves using a tool like `dotenv` and Webpack's `DefinePlugin` (or similar).
    ```javascript
    // webpack.config.js (or Storybook's main.js)
    const webpack = require('webpack');

    module.exports = {
      // ...
      plugins: [
        new webpack.DefinePlugin({
          'process.env.MY_API_KEY': JSON.stringify(process.env.MY_API_KEY),
        }),
      ],
      // ...
    };
    ```
*   **`JSON.stringify`:**  Always use `JSON.stringify` when injecting environment variables.  This prevents accidental code injection vulnerabilities.
*   **`.env` Files (Local Development Only):**  Use `.env` files to store environment variables *locally* for development.  **Never commit `.env` files to the repository.**  Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
*   **Production Environment Variables:**  In production, set environment variables through your hosting provider's interface (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS, etc.).

**4.3.3.  Mock Data and Storybook Features:**

*   **`parameters`:**  Use Storybook's `parameters` feature to provide mock data or configurations that resemble real data but contain no actual secrets.
    ```javascript
    // MyComponent.stories.js
    export const Default = () => <MyComponent />;
    Default.parameters = {
      apiConfig: {
        baseUrl: 'https://mock-api.example.com',
        // NO API KEY HERE!
      },
    };
    ```
*   **Context:**  Use Storybook's context feature (if applicable) to provide mock data at a higher level.
*   **Storybook Decorators:** Create decorators to wrap components and provide mock API responses.
*   **Mock Service Workers (MSW):**  Consider using Mock Service Worker (MSW) to intercept network requests and return mock data.  This is a powerful technique for simulating API interactions without real secrets.

**4.3.4.  Code Review (Enhanced):**

*   **Checklists:**  Create a code review checklist that specifically includes checks for secret exposure.
*   **Automated Scanning:**  Integrate automated code scanning tools into the code review process to detect potential secrets.

**4.3.5.  Pre-Commit Hooks (and CI/CD):**

*   **`git-secrets`:**  Use `git-secrets` (or a similar tool) to prevent committing files that contain patterns matching potential secrets.  This provides a crucial last line of defense before secrets are pushed to the repository.
    ```bash
    # Install git-secrets
    brew install git-secrets  # macOS
    # Or use your system's package manager

    # Initialize git-secrets in your repository
    git secrets --install
    git secrets --register-aws  # Add common AWS secret patterns
    ```
*   **CI/CD Integration:**  Integrate secret scanning into your CI/CD pipeline.  This ensures that even if a secret bypasses pre-commit hooks, it will be detected before deployment.  Many CI/CD platforms offer built-in secret scanning or integrations with third-party tools.

**4.3.6.  Secrets Management Tools:**

*   **HashiCorp Vault:**  For more complex applications and environments, consider using a dedicated secrets management tool like HashiCorp Vault.  Vault provides a secure way to store, manage, and access secrets.
*   **AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault / Google Cloud Secret Manager:**  If you are using a cloud provider, leverage their native secrets management services.
*   **Integration with Storybook:**  Integrating these tools with Storybook typically involves fetching secrets during the build process and injecting them as environment variables.

**4.3.7 Addons security**
*   **Carefully Vet Addons:**  Thoroughly vet any third-party Storybook addons before using them.  Check their reputation, code quality, and security practices.
*   **Keep Addons Updated:**  Regularly update addons to the latest versions to ensure you have the latest security patches.
*   **Minimal Addon Usage:** Only use addons that are strictly necessary.  The fewer addons you use, the smaller your attack surface.

**4.3.8.  Deployment Environment:**

*   **Authentication:**  If your Storybook instance contains *any* sensitive information (even mock data that could reveal internal structures), protect it with authentication.  Storybook supports various authentication methods.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  If possible, deploy Storybook to a separate network segment that is not directly accessible from the public internet.
*   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit your Storybook deployment and configuration to ensure that no secrets are exposed.

## 5. Conclusion

Protecting secrets within Storybook requires a multi-faceted approach that combines secure coding practices, robust build processes, and careful configuration.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of information disclosure and maintain the security of their applications.  Continuous vigilance and regular security reviews are essential to ensure that these protections remain effective. The most important rule is to never store secrets in code repository.
