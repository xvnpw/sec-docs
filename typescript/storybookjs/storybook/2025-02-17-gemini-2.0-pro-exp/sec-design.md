Okay, let's create a design document for the Storybook project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Storybook is a widely-used open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation.  It's used by numerous organizations, from small startups to large enterprises.  Given its nature, the business priorities and goals revolve around:

*   Developer Productivity:  Enable faster and more efficient UI development by providing a sandbox for isolated component creation and testing.
*   UI Consistency:  Promote consistent UI design and behavior across applications and teams by providing a central, shareable component library.
*   Collaboration: Facilitate collaboration between designers, developers, and other stakeholders through a visual and interactive UI development environment.
*   Quality Assurance:  Improve UI quality by enabling visual testing, accessibility testing, and interaction testing of components.
*   Community Growth: Maintain and grow a vibrant open-source community around Storybook, ensuring its continued development and adoption.
*   Integration: Seamlessly integrate with various front-end frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and testing tools.

Based on these priorities, the most important business risks are:

*   Compromise of the Storybook build process, leading to malicious code injection into user applications. (Supply Chain Risk)
*   Vulnerabilities within Storybook itself that could be exploited to gain access to sensitive information (e.g., API keys, design system details) displayed within Storybook instances.
*   Inability to support new versions of popular front-end frameworks, leading to decreased adoption and relevance.
*   Lack of security awareness among Storybook users, leading to insecure configurations and deployments.
*   Damage to reputation due to security incidents, impacting community trust and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Storybook, being a development tool, has a unique security posture. It's not typically deployed in a production environment facing end-users directly. However, it often interacts with sensitive data (design tokens, API mocks, etc.) and is a critical part of the software development lifecycle.

Existing Security Controls (based on the repository and common practices):

*   security control: Dependency Management: Storybook uses package managers (npm, yarn) to manage dependencies.  This includes mechanisms for checking for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `npm audit`). (Implemented in package.json and related lock files)
*   security control: Code Quality Tools: The repository shows evidence of linters (ESLint), code formatters (Prettier), and static analysis tools. These help prevent common coding errors that could lead to vulnerabilities. (Implemented in configuration files like .eslintrc.js, .prettierrc.js)
*   security control: Testing: Storybook itself has extensive unit and integration tests. This helps ensure the stability and reliability of the core codebase. (Implemented in test files throughout the repository)
*   security control: Community Reporting: As an open-source project, Storybook benefits from community scrutiny and vulnerability reporting. (Documented on the project's website and GitHub issues)
*   security control: Documentation: Security considerations are documented, guiding users on secure configurations. (Found in Storybook's official documentation)
*   security control: Sandboxing: Storybook's core functionality of isolating components provides a degree of inherent sandboxing, limiting the impact of potential vulnerabilities within individual components.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Addons: Storybook's extensibility through addons introduces a risk of vulnerabilities in third-party code. Users are responsible for vetting the addons they choose to install.
*   accepted risk: Local Development Environment Security: Storybook is primarily used in local development environments, which are often less strictly controlled than production environments. The security of the development environment is largely the user's responsibility.
*   accepted risk: Data Exposure in Development: Storybook instances may display sensitive data (mocked or real) during development. Users are responsible for managing access to their Storybook instances.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Integrate a dedicated SCA tool to continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities and provide more detailed reporting and remediation guidance.
*   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Incorporate SAST tools into the build process to identify potential vulnerabilities in Storybook's own codebase.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Provide guidance and examples for configuring CSP headers within Storybook instances to mitigate XSS risks.
*   Addon Security Guidelines: Develop clear security guidelines and best practices for addon developers to promote secure addon development.
*   Signed Releases: Digitally sign Storybook releases to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   While Storybook itself doesn't typically require authentication for local development, documentation should cover integration with authentication systems for shared or publicly accessible Storybook instances.
    *   If authentication is implemented, it should follow best practices for secure password management, session management, and protection against common attacks (e.g., brute-force, session hijacking).

*   Authorization:
    *   For shared Storybook instances, consider role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive information or features based on user roles.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Storybook's core functionality should properly sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent XSS and other injection vulnerabilities. This is particularly important for features that allow user-provided content (e.g., addon configurations, custom documentation).

*   Cryptography:
    *   If Storybook handles sensitive data (e.g., API keys, secrets), it should use appropriate cryptographic techniques to protect this data at rest and in transit.
    *   Any cryptographic operations should use strong, well-vetted libraries and algorithms.

## BUILD

The Storybook build process typically involves the following steps:

1.  Developer writes code (components, stories, addons).
2.  Code is committed to a version control system (e.g., Git).
3.  A build process is triggered (manually or automatically via CI/CD).
4.  Dependencies are installed (using npm, yarn, etc.).
5.  Code is linted and formatted.
6.  Tests are run (unit, integration, visual regression).
7.  Storybook is built (compiling code, generating static assets).
8.  The output is a set of static files that can be deployed.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Build Process
        A[Developer] --> B(Version Control System);
        B --> C(CI/CD Pipeline);
        C --> D(Dependency Installation);
        D --> E(Linting & Formatting);
        E --> F(Testing);
        F --> G(Storybook Build);
        G --> H(Static Files);
    end
```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   Dependency Management: Using package managers with vulnerability scanning (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`).
*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Integrating a dedicated SCA tool for continuous monitoring of dependencies.
*   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Incorporating SAST tools to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities.
*   Linting and Formatting: Enforcing code style and identifying potential errors.
*   Automated Testing: Running various types of tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   Secure CI/CD Configuration: Protecting the CI/CD pipeline from unauthorized access and tampering.
*   Artifact Signing: Digitally signing the build artifacts to ensure their integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   UI Component Development: The core process of creating and maintaining UI components.
*   Design System Management: Maintaining a consistent and up-to-date design system.
*   Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: Facilitating communication and collaboration between developers, designers, and other stakeholders.

Data to Protect:

*   Source Code (Low to Medium Sensitivity): The code for Storybook itself and the user's components. While often not highly sensitive, it can contain proprietary logic or design details.
*   Design System Assets (Medium Sensitivity): Design tokens, style guides, and other assets that define the visual identity of the application.
*   Mocked Data (Variable Sensitivity): Mocked data used in stories can range from non-sensitive to highly sensitive, depending on the context.  It's crucial to avoid using real production data in Storybook.
*   API Keys and Secrets (High Sensitivity):  API keys or other secrets should *never* be hardcoded in Storybook or committed to the repository.  If needed for development, they should be managed securely using environment variables or other secure mechanisms.
*   Addon Configurations (Variable Sensitivity): Configurations for addons might contain sensitive information, depending on the addon.
