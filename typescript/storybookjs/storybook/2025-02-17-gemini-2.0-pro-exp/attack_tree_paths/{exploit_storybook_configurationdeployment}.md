# Deep Analysis: Storybook Attack Tree - Exploitation of Configuration/Deployment

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack vectors, likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty associated with misconfigurations in Storybook deployments, specifically focusing on scenarios where Storybook is exposed publicly without adequate protection or uses weak/default credentials.  This analysis will inform mitigation strategies and prioritize security efforts.  The ultimate goal is to prevent unauthorized access to Storybook and protect the application it supports.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following attack tree path:

**<<{Exploit Storybook Configuration/Deployment}>>**  ->  **<<{Exposed Storybook}>>**  ->  **[Weak/Default Credentials]**

The scope includes:

*   **Publicly Exposed Storybook Instances:**  Instances deployed without any form of access control (authentication, network restrictions, etc.).
*   **Weak/Default Credentials:**  Instances protected by authentication, but using easily guessable or default credentials.
*   **Storybook Versions:**  While the attack tree doesn't specify a version, this analysis assumes attackers will target any version they encounter, with a preference for older, potentially unpatched versions.  However, the core vulnerabilities discussed here are configuration-based, not version-specific.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities within Storybook itself (e.g., XSS in a specific addon).  It focuses solely on deployment and configuration issues.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis employs the following methodology:

1.  **Attack Tree Decomposition:**  Breaking down the attack tree path into its constituent nodes and analyzing each node individually.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identifying potential attackers, their motivations, and their capabilities.  For this scenario, we assume a range of attackers, from script kiddies to more sophisticated adversaries.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examining the specific vulnerabilities that enable the attack vectors.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluating the potential consequences of a successful attack.
5.  **Likelihood Estimation:**  Assessing the probability of an attack occurring.
6.  **Effort and Skill Level Assessment:**  Determining the resources and expertise required for an attacker to execute the attack.
7.  **Detection Difficulty Analysis:**  Evaluating how difficult it is for both the attacker and the defender to detect the attack or vulnerability.
8.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Proposing specific actions to reduce the risk.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 4.1.  <<{Exposed Storybook}>> (Critical Node)

*   **Description:**  Storybook is deployed to a publicly accessible environment without any access controls (authentication, firewall, VPN, etc.). This is a critical vulnerability.

*   **Attack Vector:**

    1.  **Discovery:**
        *   **Search Engine Dorking:** Attackers use search engines like Google, Bing, or specialized search engines like Shodan, to find exposed Storybook instances.  Example dorks:
            *   `inurl:"/iframe.html?id=" intitle:Storybook`
            *   `"This preview is being rendered inside an iframe"` (searching for common Storybook text)
            *   Shodan queries targeting specific ports (e.g., 6006, 9001) and identifying HTTP responses with Storybook-related headers or content.
        *   **Port Scanning:** Attackers use port scanning tools (e.g., Nmap, Masscan) to scan IP address ranges for open ports commonly used by Storybook.
        *   **Subdomain Enumeration:** If the attacker knows the target domain, they might use tools like `subfinder`, `amass`, or `assetfinder` to discover subdomains, potentially revealing a Storybook instance hosted on a subdomain (e.g., `storybook.example.com`).

    2.  **Access:**  Once discovered, the attacker simply navigates to the Storybook URL in a web browser.  No authentication or authorization is required.

    3.  **Exploitation:**
        *   **Reconnaissance:** The attacker gains a detailed understanding of the application's UI components, their properties, and their behavior.  This information can be used to plan further attacks against the main application.
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  While Storybook *should not* contain sensitive data, developers sometimes inadvertently include API keys, internal URLs, or other sensitive information in stories or component documentation.  The attacker can extract this information.
        *   **Component Analysis:** The attacker can analyze the source code of the components (if exposed) to identify potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
        *   **API Endpoint Discovery:** Storybook often interacts with backend APIs.  The attacker can use the browser's developer tools to inspect network requests and identify API endpoints, potentially revealing internal APIs that are not intended to be publicly accessible.
        *   **Infrastructure Fingerprinting:**  The attacker might be able to glean information about the underlying infrastructure (e.g., framework versions, server types) from HTTP headers or error messages.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (but alarmingly common due to misconfiguration and lack of awareness).  Many organizations mistakenly believe that Storybook is only for internal use and don't secure it properly.

*   **Impact:** High.  Complete exposure of Storybook provides attackers with valuable information for reconnaissance and potentially exposes sensitive data.  It significantly increases the attack surface of the application.

*   **Effort:** Low.  Finding and accessing an exposed Storybook instance is trivial.

*   **Skill Level:** Low.  Requires minimal technical skill.  Basic web browsing and knowledge of developer tools are sufficient.

*   **Detection Difficulty:**
    *   **Attacker:** Low.  Discovery is easy using publicly available tools.
    *   **Defender:** High (without proactive monitoring).  Unless the organization is actively monitoring for exposed services or has implemented robust web application firewalls (WAFs) with rules to detect Storybook access, they are unlikely to detect this vulnerability until it's too late.  Log analysis might reveal unusual traffic patterns, but this requires proper logging and monitoring to be in place.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement Authentication:**  Require authentication for *all* Storybook instances, even those used for development or testing.  Use strong, unique passwords.  Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Deploy Storybook to a private network or behind a VPN.  Do not expose it directly to the public internet.
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Configure firewall rules to restrict access to Storybook to authorized IP addresses or networks.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Use a WAF to block access to Storybook from unauthorized sources and to detect and prevent common web attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate misconfigurations.
    *   **Automated Scanning:**  Use automated vulnerability scanners to proactively identify exposed services.
    *   **Educate Developers:**  Train developers on the importance of securing Storybook and the risks of exposing it publicly.
    *  **Least Privilege:** Ensure that any service accounts or credentials used by Storybook have the minimum necessary permissions.

### 4.2. [Weak/Default Credentials]

*   **Description:**  Storybook is configured with authentication, but weak or default credentials are used.

*   **Attack Vector:**

    1.  **Credential Guessing:**  The attacker attempts to log in using common usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin, admin/password, storybook/storybook).
    2.  **Brute-Force Attack:**  The attacker uses automated tools (e.g., Hydra, Burp Suite Intruder) to try a large number of username/password combinations.  They might use wordlists of common passwords or generate passwords based on patterns.
    3.  **Credential Stuffing:** If the attacker has obtained credentials from a previous breach (e.g., from a data dump), they might try those credentials on the Storybook instance, hoping that the user has reused the same password.
    4.  **Access:**  If successful, the attacker gains full access to the Storybook instance, with the same consequences as described in the "Exposed Storybook" section.

*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium.  Depends on the organization's password policies and the awareness of the developers.  Organizations with strong password policies are less likely to be vulnerable to this attack.

*   **Impact:** Medium to High.  Unauthorized access to Storybook provides the attacker with the same advantages as described in the "Exposed Storybook" section.

*   **Effort:** Low.  Automated tools for credential guessing and brute-force attacks are readily available.

*   **Skill Level:** Low.  Requires minimal technical skill.

*   **Detection Difficulty:**
    *   **Attacker:** Low.  The attacker can easily determine if the login is successful.
    *   **Defender:** Medium.  Failed login attempts might be logged, but this requires proper logging and monitoring to be in place.  Rate limiting and account lockout policies can help detect and prevent brute-force attacks, but they can also be bypassed by sophisticated attackers.  Intrusion detection systems (IDS) can also be configured to detect brute-force attacks.

*   **Mitigation:**

    *   **Strong Password Policy:**  Enforce a strong password policy that requires complex passwords (e.g., minimum length, mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).
    *   **Disable Default Accounts:**  Disable or change the passwords for any default accounts that come with Storybook or the underlying web server.
    *   **Account Lockout:**  Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.  After a certain number of failed login attempts, the account should be temporarily locked.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a given time period.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security.  Even if the attacker obtains the password, they will not be able to access the Storybook instance without the second factor (e.g., a code from a mobile app).
    *   **Monitor Login Attempts:**  Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity, such as a large number of failed login attempts from a single IP address.
    *   **Regular Password Audits:** Conduct regular password audits to identify and remediate weak passwords.

## 5. Conclusion

Exposing Storybook without proper security controls, or using weak credentials, presents a significant security risk.  These vulnerabilities are easily exploited by attackers with minimal technical skills and can lead to information disclosure, reconnaissance, and further attacks against the application.  Implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above is crucial to protect Storybook and the application it supports.  Prioritizing network segmentation and strong authentication (including MFA) are the most effective defenses.
