*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Execution via Stories
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within a Storybook story. This could be done by compromising a developer's machine and modifying story files, or by exploiting a vulnerability in a Storybook addon that allows arbitrary code injection into stories. When another developer views this story in their Storybook environment, the malicious code will execute within their browser context. The attacker might attempt to steal credentials stored in local storage, make unauthorized API calls to internal services, or even try to compromise the developer's machine further.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of developer machines, potential exfiltration of sensitive development data (API keys, internal URLs), introduction of vulnerabilities into components if the malicious code modifies the component's behavior or introduces new flaws.
    *   **Affected Component:** `stories` (the individual story files and the Storybook's rendering engine that executes the code within them).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all Storybook stories.
        *   Utilize linters and static analysis tools to detect potentially malicious or unsafe JavaScript code within stories.
        *   Consider sandboxing or isolating the execution environment of stories, although this can be technically challenging with Storybook's current architecture.
        *   Educate developers about the risks of including untrusted or poorly reviewed code in stories.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Storybook Stories
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information directly within Storybook stories. This could include API keys, internal URLs, example user credentials, or even snippets of production data used for demonstration purposes. If the Storybook instance is publicly accessible or if the story files are committed to a public repository without proper sanitization, this sensitive information becomes exposed to potential attackers. An attacker could then use this information to gain unauthorized access to internal systems or data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to internal resources, potential compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** `stories` (the content of the story files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict policies against including sensitive information in Storybook stories.
        *   Utilize secrets management tools and environment variables to manage sensitive data instead of hardcoding it in stories.
        *   Regularly scan Storybook story files for potential secrets using tools designed for this purpose (e.g., truffleHog, git-secrets).
        *   Ensure Storybook instances are not publicly accessible unless absolutely necessary and are protected by appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Vulnerable Addons or Story Configuration
    *   **Description:**  Storybook's extensibility through addons introduces the risk of using addons with XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit a flaw in an addon to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users viewing the Storybook. Similarly, misconfigurations in story parameters or custom render functions could also introduce XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker might use this to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise of developers or other users accessing the Storybook, potential for further attacks on internal systems if the Storybook environment has access to them.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Addons API`, `Story Parameters`, potentially custom `render` functions within stories.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit Storybook addons before using them.
        *   Keep Storybook and all its addons updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Storybook application to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Sanitize any user-provided input or data used within story parameters or custom render functions.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Addons
    *   **Description:** Storybook relies on a plugin ecosystem (addons). If an attacker manages to compromise a popular Storybook addon, they could inject malicious code into the addon that would then be executed in the Storybook environments of all users who have installed that addon. This could lead to widespread compromise of developer machines or the introduction of vulnerabilities into the applications being developed.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially widespread compromise of developer environments, introduction of vulnerabilities into multiple applications, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Addons API`, the addon installation and management process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit Storybook addons before using them, paying attention to the addon's maintainership, security history, and permissions.
        *   Keep Storybook and all its addons updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
        *   Consider using a private addon registry or mirroring approved addons to have more control over the supply chain.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Storybook addons.

*   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Storybook in Production
    *   **Description:** Storybook is a development tool and should not be deployed to production environments. However, due to misconfigurations or errors in the deployment process, a Storybook instance might be accidentally deployed to production. This would expose internal components, potentially sensitive data within stories, and the ability to interact with components in ways not intended for production users.
    *   **Impact:** Significant security risk, potential for data breaches, exposure of internal application details, unintended manipulation of application state.
    *   **Affected Component:** The deployment process and configuration, potentially the Storybook's build output if not properly isolated.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict deployment pipelines and access controls to prevent the accidental deployment of Storybook to production environments.
        *   Clearly differentiate between development and production build processes and ensure Storybook is excluded from production builds.
        *   Regularly audit deployed environments to ensure no unintended Storybook instances are running in production.
