## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Production Deployments of Storybook](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_production_deployments_of_storybook.md)

### 1. Avoid Production Deployments of Storybook

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid Production Deployments of Storybook
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Deployment Locations:** Audit all deployed applications and infrastructure to ensure Storybook is *not* accidentally deployed to production environments.
    2.  **Automated Deployment Checks:** Integrate automated checks into the deployment pipeline to prevent Storybook build artifacts from being included in production deployments. This could involve checking for specific Storybook build output directories or configuration files within the deployment process.
    3.  **Clear Deployment Procedures:** Document and enforce clear deployment procedures that explicitly exclude Storybook from production deployments. Ensure developers are aware of this policy.
    4.  **Educate Development Team:** Train the development team on the security risks of deploying Storybook to production and the importance of excluding it from production builds and deployments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Production deployment exposes internal application details, component library, and development configurations to the public internet *via Storybook*.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** Storybook in production adds unnecessary code and potential vulnerabilities *within the production application's context*, increasing the overall attack surface.
    *   **Accidental Exposure of Development Tools (Medium Severity):** Storybook is a development tool and its presence in production can inadvertently expose development-related functionalities or configurations *through the running Storybook instance*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** High reduction. Eliminates the risk of exposing sensitive development information in production *through Storybook*.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface:** Medium reduction. Removes unnecessary code and potential vulnerabilities *introduced by Storybook* from the production environment.
    *   **Accidental Exposure of Development Tools:** Medium reduction. Prevents accidental exposure of development functionalities in production *via Storybook*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented via deployment scripts that explicitly exclude the Storybook build directory from production deployments.
    *   Deployment procedures document the exclusion of Storybook from production.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consider adding automated tests in the CI/CD pipeline to *specifically verify* that Storybook artifacts are not present in production builds.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for Storybook](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__for_storybook.md)

### 2. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for Storybook

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define CSP Policy:** Create a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) *specifically for the Storybook application*. Start with a restrictive policy and gradually relax it as needed, ensuring each relaxation is justified and secure for Storybook's functionality.
    2.  **CSP Directives:** Carefully configure CSP directives such as `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, `connect-src`, etc. to control the sources from which *Storybook* can load resources. Tailor these directives to Storybook's specific needs and addon requirements.
    3.  **Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` in `script-src` and `style-src` directives *within Storybook's CSP*. If necessary for specific addons, use nonces or hashes for inline scripts and styles, but carefully evaluate the security implications.
    4.  **Report-Uri (Optional):** Configure `report-uri` or `report-to` directives *in Storybook's CSP* to receive reports of CSP violations, allowing you to monitor and refine your policy specifically for Storybook.
    5.  **Deploy CSP:** Implement the CSP by setting the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header in the server configuration serving *Storybook instances*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** CSP significantly reduces the impact of XSS vulnerabilities *within Storybook itself* by preventing the execution of malicious scripts injected into Storybook or its addons.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High reduction. CSP is a highly effective mitigation against XSS attacks *targeting Storybook*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic CSP is implemented in the staging Storybook environment, primarily focusing on `default-src 'self'`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Refine the CSP to be more strict and comprehensive, specifically defining `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, and other relevant directives *for Storybook*.
    *   Implement CSP in all Storybook environments (development, staging).
    *   Configure `report-uri` or `report-to` to monitor CSP violations and identify potential issues *within Storybook deployments*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Manage and Sanitize Story Content in Storybook](./mitigation_strategies/manage_and_sanitize_story_content_in_storybook.md)
