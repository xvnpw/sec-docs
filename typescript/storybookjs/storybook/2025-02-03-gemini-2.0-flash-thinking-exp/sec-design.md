# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: To provide a development and documentation tool for UI components, enabling faster development, better collaboration, and improved UI consistency.
  - Priority: Developer productivity and UI quality.
  - Priority: Community growth and adoption of Storybook as a standard UI development tool.
  - Priority: Extensibility and customization to fit various project needs.

- Business Risks:
  - Business Risk: Security vulnerabilities in Storybook could expose developer environments or project code, leading to intellectual property theft or supply chain attacks if malicious addons are used.
  - Business Risk: Lack of adoption or competition from alternative tools could reduce the value proposition of Storybook.
  - Business Risk: Community contributions might introduce instability or security issues if not properly vetted.
  - Business Risk: Changes in frontend technology landscape could make Storybook obsolete if not adapted.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Security - Public code review and community scrutiny of the codebase on GitHub.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Usage of `npm` or `yarn` for dependency management, allowing for vulnerability scanning of dependencies.
  - security control: Code Review - Pull requests are reviewed by maintainers before merging into the main branch (process described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Regular Updates - Active development and maintenance, including updates to address reported issues and vulnerabilities (evident from GitHub commit history and release notes).
  - security control: Input Validation - Frameworks and libraries used within Storybook likely have built-in input validation mechanisms to prevent common web vulnerabilities (inferred from standard web development practices).
  - security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle -  Adherence to general secure coding practices within the development team (assumed based on project maturity and community).
  - security control: Deployment Model - Primarily a developer tool, often run locally or within private networks, reducing direct exposure to public internet threats (typical usage pattern).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce vulnerabilities if not thoroughly reviewed.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - accepted risk: Risk of developer misconfiguration leading to insecure Storybook deployments (e.g., exposing sensitive information if publicly hosted without proper controls).
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security audits or penetration testing (typical for open-source projects without dedicated security budgets).

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated SAST and DAST scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
  - security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning - Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning tools to automatically identify and alert on vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Security Champions - Designate security champions within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices.
  - security control: Security Training - Provide security training to developers and maintainers on secure coding practices and common web vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Incident Response Plan - Develop a basic incident response plan to handle reported security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Public Security Policy - Create a SECURITY.md file in the repository outlining the project's security practices and vulnerability reporting process.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - requirement: For self-hosted Storybook instances intended for team collaboration, consider optional authentication mechanisms to control access to the Storybook instance and its content.
    - requirement: For Storybook addons that require user-specific data or actions, implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms within the addon itself.
  - Authorization:
    - requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls within Storybook addons to manage access to features and data based on user roles or permissions, if applicable.
    - requirement: If authentication is implemented for self-hosted Storybook instances, ensure proper authorization to control who can view, edit, or manage stories and configurations.
  - Input Validation:
    - requirement: Rigorous input validation should be applied to all user inputs, especially in addons and configurations, to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, command injection).
    - requirement: Sanitize user-provided content before rendering it in the Storybook UI to mitigate XSS risks.
  - Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use HTTPS for all network communication, especially for self-hosted Storybook instances accessed over a network, to protect data in transit.
    - requirement: If storing sensitive data (e.g., API keys in addon configurations), ensure proper encryption at rest and in transit. Avoid storing sensitive data directly in Storybook configuration files if possible.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of UI component code and design assets.
  - Ensuring developer productivity and efficient UI development workflow.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trust in Storybook as a secure and reliable tool.
  - Preventing supply chain attacks through compromised addons or dependencies.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Source code of UI components: Sensitive - Intellectual property, potential for vulnerabilities if exposed.
  - Design assets (images, styles): Sensitive - Intellectual property, brand identity.
  - Storybook configuration: Low to Medium - May contain project-specific settings, but generally not highly sensitive.
  - Developer environment data: Low to Medium - Local development data, potential for information disclosure if compromised.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended deployment environment for Storybook (local, hosted, integrated)?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that Storybook needs to adhere to?
  - What is the process for reviewing and approving community contributions, especially addons?
  - Are there any plans for formal security audits or penetration testing of Storybook?
  - What is the expected user base and access control requirements for hosted Storybook instances?

- Assumptions:
  - Assumption: Storybook is primarily used as a development tool and not directly exposed to end-users in production environments.
  - Assumption: Security is a concern for the Storybook project, but resources for dedicated security efforts might be limited due to its open-source nature.
  - Assumption: Developers using Storybook are expected to follow general security best practices in their own code and configurations.
  - Assumption: The project relies heavily on community contributions and open-source principles for development and security.
  - Assumption: The target audience is primarily frontend developers and designers working on web applications.
