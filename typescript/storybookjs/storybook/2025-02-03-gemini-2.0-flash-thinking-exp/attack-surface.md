# Attack Surface Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Production Deployment](./attack_surfaces/accidental_production_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** Storybook, a development tool, is mistakenly deployed to a production environment, becoming publicly accessible.
*   **Storybook Contribution:** Storybook is a separate application that can be built and deployed. Lack of clear separation in build/deployment processes can lead to accidental inclusion in production.
*   **Example:**  A CI/CD pipeline incorrectly includes the Storybook build step in the production deployment workflow, resulting in Storybook files being deployed to the live production server alongside the main application.
*   **Impact:**  Critical exposure of internal application components, documentation, source code, and potentially sensitive data within stories to the public internet. This provides attackers with deep insights into the application's architecture, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strict separation of build and deployment processes for Storybook and the main application.**
    *   **Enforce CI/CD pipeline configurations that explicitly exclude Storybook build artifacts from production deployments.**
    *   **Utilize environment variables or build flags to conditionally control Storybook build inclusion, ensuring it's disabled for production builds.**
    *   **Conduct regular audits of production deployments to verify the absence of Storybook artifacts.**
    *   **Implement automated checks in deployment pipelines to prevent Storybook files from being deployed to production environments.**

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Story Content](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_story_content.md)

*   **Description:** Stories, intended as examples, inadvertently contain sensitive information about the application, its APIs, or internal data structures, exposing these details publicly if Storybook is accessible.
*   **Storybook Contribution:** Storybook's core function is to showcase components with examples. Developers might unintentionally include sensitive details within these examples without proper sanitization, making them visible through Storybook.
*   **Example:** A story demonstrating an API client component includes a hardcoded, but realistic-looking, API endpoint URL that is actually an internal or staging API endpoint not intended for public knowledge.
*   **Impact:** **High** risk of information disclosure. Exposure of internal API endpoints, data structures, business logic, or even potential credentials (if carelessly included). This information can be directly used by attackers to target vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized access to internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory and thorough review of all story content and examples for any sensitive information before code commits.**
    *   **Strictly use placeholder data, mock data, or sanitized data in stories instead of real or potentially sensitive information.**
    *   **Implement code review processes specifically focused on identifying and removing sensitive information from Storybook stories.**
    *   **Educate developers on the critical risks of information disclosure through Storybook examples and enforce secure coding practices.**
    *   **Consider automated scanning tools to detect potential sensitive data patterns within Storybook stories.**

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Stories or Addons](./attack_surfaces/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_stories_or_addons.md)

*   **Description:** Stories or Storybook addons render user-provided or dynamically generated content without proper sanitization, creating opportunities for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks within the Storybook environment.
*   **Storybook Contribution:** Storybook renders stories, which can incorporate dynamic content. Addons can introduce new rendering logic or content injection points. If these are not implemented with robust security measures, XSS vulnerabilities can be introduced.
*   **Example:** A Storybook addon designed to display user-provided Markdown content in stories fails to properly sanitize the Markdown input. An attacker could craft a malicious Markdown payload containing JavaScript that, when rendered by Storybook, executes in the browser of anyone viewing the Storybook.
*   **Impact:** **High** risk of client-side attacks. Successful XSS can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution within the Storybook application. This can be exploited to steal developer session tokens, deface the Storybook interface, or potentially pivot to other attacks if Storybook is mistakenly deployed in a less isolated environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement rigorous input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided or dynamically generated content within stories and Storybook addons.**
    *   **Adhere to secure coding practices when developing stories and addons, with a strong focus on preventing XSS vulnerabilities (e.g., using templating engines with automatic escaping, Content Security Policy).**
    *   **Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Storybook stories and addons to identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Keep Storybook and all addons updated to the latest versions, as updates often include critical security patches for XSS and other vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Prioritize the use of well-maintained and reputable Storybook addons with a proven security track record and active community support.**
