# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Story Data](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_story_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all stories that currently use or might use real or sensitive data within Storybook examples and documentation.
    2.  Replace real data with mock data that resembles the structure and type of real data but contains no actual sensitive information. This mock data should be realistic for development but not expose confidential details.
    3.  For dynamic or real-world example data, create sanitized versions by anonymizing personal information, replacing sensitive numbers with placeholders, and obfuscating text content.
    4.  Review all stories after data sanitization to ensure no real data remains, as part of story creation and updates.
    5.  Establish an ongoing review process for new and updated stories to maintain data sanitization within Storybook.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (High Severity) - Accidental exposure of sensitive data (PII, API keys, internal configurations) through publicly accessible Storybook instances or committed story files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: High reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data leaks through Storybook by ensuring no real sensitive data is present in stories.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Mock data is used in some component stories, particularly for UI elements in the `src/stories/components` directory.
    *   Implemented in: `src/stories/components`
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Data sanitization is not consistently applied across all stories, especially in stories showcasing complex data structures, page layouts, or integrations. Stories in `src/stories/pages` and `src/stories/integrations` often use examples that might inadvertently include real-world data structures or patterns that could be considered sensitive or revealing of internal systems.
    *   Missing in: `src/stories/pages`, `src/stories/integrations`, and as a consistent practice across all new story development.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Environment Variable Management](./mitigation_strategies/environment_variable_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify any sensitive configuration values, API keys, internal URLs, or environment-specific settings that are currently hardcoded within Storybook story files or Storybook configuration files (`.storybook/main.js`, `.storybook/preview.js`).
    2.  Move these hardcoded values to environment variables. Utilize `.env` files for local Storybook development and proper environment variable configuration for different Storybook deployment environments.
    3.  Access these environment variables within your Storybook stories and Storybook configuration using process environment access methods (e.g., `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` in Node.js within Storybook files).
    4.  Ensure that `.env` files containing sensitive variables are properly excluded from version control (e.g., added to `.gitignore` in the Storybook project).
    5.  Document the required environment variables and their purpose specifically for developers working with Storybook.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity) - Accidental exposure of API keys, internal URLs, or configuration details if hardcoded values are committed to version control or exposed through Storybook's static build.
    *   Configuration Drift (Low Severity) - Inconsistent Storybook configurations across different environments if settings are hardcoded instead of managed through environment variables.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive configuration details in version control and Storybook builds.
    *   Configuration Drift: High reduction - Ensures consistent Storybook configuration management across environments.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. API base URLs are configured using environment variables in the main application, but Storybook configuration and some stories might still contain hardcoded example URLs or settings.
    *   Implemented in: Application configuration files (e.g., `config.js`, `.env.example`)
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of environment variables within Storybook configuration (`.storybook/main.js`, `.storybook/preview.js`) and stories themselves. Some stories might still rely on hardcoded example values that should be externalized within Storybook.
    *   Missing in: `.storybook/main.js`, `.storybook/preview.js`, and within individual stories that handle configuration or external service interactions within Storybook.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Stories for Sensitive Information](./mitigation_strategies/review_stories_for_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Integrate a mandatory code review process specifically focused on Storybook stories before merging changes into the main branch or deploying Storybook instances.
    2.  Train developers on identifying sensitive information that should not be included in Storybook stories (e.g., real data, internal URLs, API keys, security-related details within Storybook examples).
    3.  During code reviews, specifically check Storybook stories for:
        *   Accidental inclusion of real or sensitive data within Storybook examples.
        *   Hardcoded API keys or secrets within Storybook stories.
        *   Internal URLs or paths within Storybook stories that could reveal system architecture.
        *   Comments or documentation within Storybook stories that might contain confidential information.
    4.  Use code review checklists or guidelines specifically tailored for Storybook stories to ensure consistent and thorough reviews.
    5.  Encourage developers to proactively think about security implications when creating and updating Storybook stories.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (High Severity) - Unintentional leakage of sensitive information due to human error in Storybook story creation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium reduction - Reduces the likelihood of sensitive information leaks from Storybook by adding a human review step to catch errors before deployment.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   General code reviews are in place for all code changes, including Storybook stories. However, there is no specific focus on security aspects within Storybook stories during these reviews.
    *   Implemented in: General code review process using pull requests.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Specific security-focused review step for Storybook stories. No dedicated checklist or guidelines for reviewers to specifically look for sensitive information in Storybook stories.
    *   Missing in: Dedicated Storybook security review process, checklists, and developer training on Storybook-specific security considerations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Addon Selection & Review](./mitigation_strategies/careful_addon_selection_&_review.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a policy for Storybook addon selection and approval. Require developers to justify the need for new Storybook addons and document their purpose within the Storybook context.
    2.  Prioritize Storybook addons from reputable sources (official Storybook addons, well-known maintainers, large community adoption within the Storybook ecosystem).
    3.  Before installing a Storybook addon, review its documentation, source code (if available), and permissions it requests. Pay attention to addons that request access to sensitive data or external services within Storybook.
    4.  Check for recent updates and active maintenance of the Storybook addon. Avoid using Storybook addons that are outdated or no longer maintained.
    5.  Consider the security reputation of the Storybook addon maintainers and community feedback regarding the addon's security and reliability within the Storybook community.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Addons (High Severity) - Installation of malicious Storybook addons that could compromise Storybook's security or introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   Addon Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity) - Vulnerabilities within poorly written or outdated Storybook addons that could be exploited.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Addons: High reduction - Reduces the risk of installing malicious Storybook addons by implementing a careful selection and review process.
    *   Addon Vulnerabilities: Medium reduction - Lowers the risk of using vulnerable Storybook addons by prioritizing reputable and well-maintained addons.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Storybook addons are generally added as needed by developers, but there is no formal review process or policy for Storybook addon selection.
    *   Implemented in: Informal Storybook addon selection process.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal Storybook addon selection policy and review process. No documented guidelines for choosing Storybook addons or security checks before installation.
    *   Missing in: Storybook addon selection policy, review process, and developer guidelines for Storybook addon security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Addon Vulnerability Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/addon_vulnerability_scanning.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Extend your dependency vulnerability scanning tools and processes to specifically include Storybook addons.
    2.  Configure your vulnerability scanning tools to analyze the dependencies of installed Storybook addons.
    3.  Regularly run vulnerability scans on Storybook dependencies and addons as part of your CI/CD pipeline or development workflow for Storybook.
    4.  Prioritize addressing vulnerabilities identified in Storybook addons, especially those with high severity ratings.
    5.  If vulnerabilities are found in Storybook addons that cannot be easily fixed or updated, consider alternative addons or removing the vulnerable addon if its functionality is not critical for Storybook.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Addon Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity) - Exploitation of vulnerabilities within Storybook addons that are not detected through standard dependency scanning if addons are not specifically included in the scan.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Addon Vulnerabilities: Medium reduction - Ensures that Storybook addon vulnerabilities are also detected and addressed, providing a more comprehensive security posture for Storybook.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dependency vulnerability scanning is performed for the main application dependencies, but it is not explicitly configured to scan Storybook addons.
    *   Implemented in: Dependency vulnerability scanning for main application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Configuration of vulnerability scanning tools to specifically include Storybook addons in the scan. No current process to ensure Storybook addon vulnerabilities are regularly checked.
    *   Missing in: Vulnerability scanning configuration for Storybook addons, integration into CI/CD pipeline for Storybook addon vulnerability checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization in Stories (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_in_stories__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify Storybook stories that dynamically render user-provided data or external content within Storybook examples. This is less common in typical Storybook usage but might occur in stories that demonstrate data binding or external data integration within Storybook.
    2.  For any dynamic content rendering in Storybook stories, implement proper input sanitization and output encoding to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within Storybook itself.
    3.  Sanitize user inputs within Storybook stories by removing or escaping potentially malicious characters or code before rendering them in the story.
    4.  Use appropriate output encoding techniques (e.g., HTML entity encoding) within Storybook stories to prevent browser interpretation of user-provided data as executable code.
    5.  Test Storybook stories with various inputs, including potentially malicious payloads, to ensure that sanitization and encoding are effective in preventing XSS within Storybook.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity) - Potential for XSS vulnerabilities if Storybook stories dynamically render unsanitized user inputs or external content, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts within Storybook.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities within Storybook itself if stories handle dynamic content.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not explicitly implemented. Input sanitization is generally practiced in the main application, but not specifically considered within Storybook stories as dynamic content rendering is not a primary use case in Storybook.
    *   Implemented in: General application development practices.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Specific input sanitization and output encoding measures within Storybook stories that handle dynamic content. No dedicated checks or guidelines for XSS prevention in Storybook stories.
    *   Missing in: Story code review process for XSS in stories, specific sanitization functions or libraries used within Storybook stories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) for Storybook (If Publicly Accessible)](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__for_storybook__if_publicly_accessible_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If Storybook is publicly accessible, implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) specifically for Storybook to control the resources that Storybook can load and execute.
    2.  Define a CSP policy that restricts the sources from which Storybook can load scripts, stylesheets, images, and other resources. Tailor the CSP to Storybook's specific needs and functionalities.
    3.  Start with a restrictive CSP policy for Storybook and gradually relax it as needed, while maintaining a strong security posture for the Storybook instance. Example CSP directives relevant to Storybook:
        *   `default-src 'self';` - Allow resources only from the same origin for Storybook.
        *   `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';` - Allow scripts from the same origin and inline scripts for Storybook (adjust 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' based on Storybook's requirements and security assessment).
        *   `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';` - Allow styles from the same origin and inline styles for Storybook.
    4.  Configure your web server or Storybook deployment environment to send the CSP header with every response specifically for Storybook pages.
    5.  Monitor CSP reports for Storybook to identify any violations and refine your policy as needed for the Storybook instance.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity) - CSP can mitigate the impact of XSS attacks within Storybook by limiting the actions that malicious scripts can perform, even if they are successfully injected into Storybook.
    *   Malicious Addons (Medium Severity) - CSP can restrict the capabilities of malicious Storybook addons, limiting their potential damage within Storybook.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium reduction - Reduces the impact of XSS attacks within Storybook by limiting the browser's ability to execute malicious scripts in the Storybook context.
    *   Malicious Addons: Medium reduction - Limits the potential damage from malicious Storybook addons by restricting their resource loading and execution capabilities within Storybook.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. CSP is not currently configured for Storybook as it is not publicly accessible.
    *   Implemented in: None.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CSP configuration specifically for Storybook. No CSP headers are currently sent for Storybook pages.
    *   Missing in: Web server configuration for Storybook, Storybook deployment setup, CSP policy definition for Storybook.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize `robots.txt` and Meta Tags](./mitigation_strategies/utilize__robots_txt__and_meta_tags.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Create a `robots.txt` file in the root directory of your Storybook static build output (`storybook-static`). This file is specific to controlling search engine crawlers for your Storybook instance.
    2.  In the `robots.txt` file, disallow crawling of the entire Storybook site by adding the following rule:
        ```
        User-agent: *
        Disallow: /
        ```
        This specifically instructs search engines not to index your Storybook content.
    3.  Add `noindex` meta tags to the `<head>` section of your Storybook HTML files (typically in `preview-head.html` or similar Storybook configuration). This further reinforces the instruction to search engines not to index Storybook pages. Example meta tag for Storybook:
        ```html
        <meta name="robots" content="noindex">
        ```
    4.  Deploy these changes with your Storybook static build output. Ensure these files are correctly placed within the Storybook deployment.
    5.  Verify that the `robots.txt` file is correctly served from your Storybook deployment and the `noindex` meta tag is present in the HTML of your Storybook pages.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental Public Exposure (Low Severity) - Prevents search engines from indexing Storybook, reducing the risk of accidental discovery and exposure of Storybook content to unintended audiences if it is inadvertently made publicly accessible. This is specific to preventing search engine visibility of Storybook.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental Public Exposure: Low reduction - Reduces the discoverability of Storybook by search engines, but does not prevent direct access if the URL is known. This primarily addresses search engine based discovery of Storybook.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Currently, there is no `robots.txt` file or `noindex` meta tags in the Storybook build output.
    *   Implemented in: None.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Creation and deployment of `robots.txt` file and addition of `noindex` meta tags to Storybook HTML. These are Storybook-specific deployment configurations.
    *   Missing in: `storybook-static` directory, `preview-head.html` or Storybook configuration files.
