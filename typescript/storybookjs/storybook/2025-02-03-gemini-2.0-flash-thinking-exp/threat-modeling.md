# Threat Model Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Threat: [Component Source Code Exposure](./threats/component_source_code_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a publicly exposed Storybook instance. They can then view the source code of UI components and stories, potentially revealing sensitive logic, API keys, internal URLs, or business logic embedded within the code.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data, potential for further attacks based on revealed internal information, intellectual property theft.
*   **Storybook Component Affected:** Stories, Components (source code displayed in Storybook UI).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement access controls (authentication) for Storybook instances.
    *   Avoid embedding sensitive information directly in component code or stories.
    *   Utilize environment variables or configuration files for sensitive data.
    *   Regularly review stories and component code for accidental sensitive data exposure.
    *   Restrict Storybook access to internal networks or VPN.

## Threat: [Mock/Test Data Exposure (Sensitive Data)](./threats/mocktest_data_exposure__sensitive_data_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker accesses a publicly exposed Storybook and views stories containing mock or test data. If this data contains sensitive information (e.g., PII, financial data), it can be exposed, leading to potential privacy breaches or misuse of data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data, privacy violations if PII is exposed, potential regulatory compliance issues.
*   **Storybook Component Affected:** Stories (data displayed in stories).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use anonymized or synthetic data for stories.
    *   Absolutely avoid using production data or data closely resembling sensitive production data in stories.
    *   Document the sensitivity of data used in stories and enforce data handling policies.
    *   Implement data sanitization or masking for any potentially sensitive data used in stories.
    *   Restrict Storybook access to internal networks or VPN.

## Threat: [XSS via Insecure Addons/Configuration](./threats/xss_via_insecure_addonsconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability introduced by a malicious or vulnerable Storybook addon, or through misconfiguration of Storybook itself. They could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users accessing the Storybook instance, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or further malicious actions within the development environment.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise of developers, data theft from the development environment, malicious redirects, defacement of Storybook interface, potential for further attacks leveraging compromised developer accounts.
*   **Storybook Component Affected:** Addons, Storybook Core (if misconfigured), potentially Storybook UI rendering.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exercise extreme caution when selecting and installing Storybook addons.
    *   Thoroughly vet and review all Storybook addons before installation, prioritizing addons from trusted sources with active maintenance and security records.
    *   Keep Storybook and addons updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) for Storybook to mitigate potential XSS attacks.
    *   Regularly audit Storybook configuration and addon usage for potential security weaknesses and misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (High Severity Dependency Vulnerability)](./threats/supply_chain_vulnerabilities__high_severity_dependency_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *high severity* known vulnerability in one of Storybook's dependencies or addon dependencies. This could be achieved by targeting a publicly exposed Storybook instance or by compromising a developer's machine if vulnerabilities are exploitable locally.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on developer machines or the Storybook server, information disclosure, denial of service, potentially compromising the entire development environment depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Storybook Component Affected:** Storybook Core Dependencies, Addon Dependencies (npm packages).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement automated and regular dependency scanning using security tools (npm audit, yarn audit, Snyk, etc.) to identify and remediate high severity vulnerabilities in `package.json` and lock files.
    *   Prioritize updating to patched versions of dependencies as soon as high severity vulnerabilities are identified and fixes are released.
    *   Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) process to track and manage dependencies and facilitate vulnerability management.

## Threat: [Accidental Public Exposure of Storybook Instance](./threats/accidental_public_exposure_of_storybook_instance.md)

*   **Description:** Developers unintentionally configure or deploy a Storybook instance to be publicly accessible on the internet. This critically exposes all other Storybook-related threats to a wider audience, including malicious actors, significantly increasing the attack surface and potential for exploitation.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure to all other Storybook threats at scale, potentially leading to large-scale information disclosure, attacks on development infrastructure, reputational damage, and severe security incidents.
*   **Storybook Component Affected:** Storybook Deployment Configuration, Network Configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory:** Ensure Storybook instances are **never** directly accessible from the public internet.
    *   Strictly restrict Storybook instances to internal development networks or secure access via VPN only.
    *   Implement robust network firewalls and access control lists to enforce network segmentation and prevent public access.
    *   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for accessing Storybook, even within internal networks.
    *   Implement automated infrastructure checks and regular security audits of network configurations to proactively prevent accidental public exposure.

## Threat: [Unintended High-Impact Actions via Storybook Controls](./threats/unintended_high-impact_actions_via_storybook_controls.md)

*   **Description:**  Stories or addons are misconfigured or insecurely designed to perform actions beyond UI demonstration, such as triggering API calls that modify or delete critical backend data, or initiate other harmful operations. If these actions are not properly secured and controlled, they could be misused, either intentionally or unintentionally, leading to significant damage.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption or loss in backend systems, unintended modifications to critical infrastructure, potential for significant business disruption and financial loss if harmful actions are triggered.
*   **Storybook Component Affected:** Stories, Addons (interaction with external systems, especially backend APIs).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly limit the capabilities of stories and addons to UI demonstration and development tasks only.**  Avoid allowing stories or addons to trigger actions that have side effects or interact with backend systems in a way that could cause harm.
    *   If absolutely necessary for stories to interact with backend services for demonstration purposes, ensure extremely robust authentication, authorization, and input validation are implemented for all such interactions.
    *   Clearly and prominently document the intended behavior and *potential side effects* of any stories or addons that interact with external systems.
    *   Implement code review processes specifically focused on identifying and mitigating potential unintended actions within stories and addons.
    *   Consider using mock services or isolated test environments for stories that require data interaction, rather than connecting to live or production-like backend systems.
