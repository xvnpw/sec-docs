## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Storybook Vulnerabilities Directly -> Exploit Storybook Application Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Storybook UI -> Inject malicious JavaScript via Story Description/Addon Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_storybook_vulnerabilities_directly_-_exploit_storybook_application_vulnerabilities_-_cross-s_77680e1b.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker identifies input fields in Storybook's UI that are used to configure stories or addons (e.g., story descriptions, addon parameters).
    *   Attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code and injects it into these input fields.
    *   When a developer or user views the Storybook instance, the injected JavaScript executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of Storybook UI, further attacks against the application by leveraging the compromised user's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Storybook Misconfiguration/Insecure Deployment -> Production Exposure of Storybook -> Accidental Production Deployment -> Storybook instance accessible on production domain/subdomain](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_storybook_misconfigurationinsecure_deployment_-_production_exposure_of_storybook_-_accidenta_f6b114d6.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Due to misconfigured CI/CD pipelines, human error, or lack of proper deployment controls, the Storybook build is accidentally deployed to a production environment.
    *   The Storybook instance becomes publicly accessible on a production domain or subdomain.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (application structure, API endpoints, potentially sensitive code in stories), expanded attack surface, reconnaissance opportunities for attackers to identify further vulnerabilities in the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Storybook Misconfiguration/Insecure Deployment -> Production Exposure of Storybook -> Intentional Production Deployment (discouraged) -> Storybook instance intentionally exposed in production environment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_storybook_misconfigurationinsecure_deployment_-_production_exposure_of_storybook_-_intention_c67c1e4a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Developers or management intentionally deploy Storybook to production, often under the false premise of \"internal documentation\" or \"developer tools\" being needed in production.
    *   The Storybook instance is exposed in the production environment, even if behind some basic authentication (which might be weak or misconfigured).
    *   **Impact:** Similar to accidental production deployment, but potentially with a false sense of security due to the \"intentional\" nature. Still leads to information disclosure, expanded attack surface, and potential exploitation of Storybook vulnerabilities in a production context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Storybook Misconfiguration/Insecure Deployment -> Environment Variable Exposure via Storybook Configuration -> Storybook configuration inadvertently exposes environment variables containing secrets](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_storybook_misconfigurationinsecure_deployment_-_environment_variable_exposure_via_storybook__487e13cc.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Developers misconfigure Storybook's environment variable handling.
    *   Sensitive environment variables (containing API keys, database credentials, etc.) are inadvertently exposed through Storybook's configuration files, build process, or runtime environment.
    *   An attacker accessing the exposed Storybook instance can retrieve these environment variables.
    *   **Impact:** Direct exposure of critical secrets, leading to immediate and potentially full compromise of backend systems, data breaches, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Storybook Addons -> Malicious Addon Installation -> Social Engineering Developers to Install Malicious Addon -> Attacker tricks developers into installing a compromised or malicious Storybook addon](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_storybook_addons_-_malicious_addon_installation_-_social_engineering_developers_to_install_m_32152b72.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker creates a seemingly legitimate or useful Storybook addon, potentially mimicking a popular addon or offering desirable functionality.
    *   Attacker uses social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing, forum posts, fake recommendations) to trick developers into installing this malicious addon.
    *   Once installed, the addon executes malicious code within the developer's environment and potentially during the application build process.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of developer machines, potential supply chain attack by injecting malicious code into the application build, data theft from development environments, and long-term persistence within the development workflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Storybook Addons -> Supply Chain Attack on Addon Repository -> Attacker compromises a legitimate addon repository and injects malicious code into an addon](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_storybook_addons_-_supply_chain_attack_on_addon_repository_-_attacker_compromises_a_legitima_f595a054.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker targets a legitimate and widely used Storybook addon repository (e.g., npm registry).
    *   Attacker compromises the repository's infrastructure or developer accounts.
    *   Attacker injects malicious code into a popular addon, publishing a compromised version.
    *   Developers unknowingly update to the compromised addon version.
    *   **Impact:** Large-scale supply chain attack affecting all applications using the compromised addon version. Potential for widespread data breaches, malware distribution, and significant reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Storybook Addons -> Vulnerable Addon Exploitation -> Known Vulnerabilities in Installed Addons -> Exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure Storybook addons](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_storybook_addons_-_vulnerable_addon_exploitation_-_known_vulnerabilities_in_installed_addons_8688ad83.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attackers scan for applications using Storybook and identify the installed addons and their versions (potentially through dependency information leakage).
    *   Attackers research publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure Storybook addons.
    *   Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the Storybook environment.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, could lead to XSS, Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the Storybook environment, information disclosure, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Exploitation via Storybook Integration -> Credential Leakage in Stories or Storybook Configuration -> Accidental Hardcoding of Credentials -> Developers accidentally hardcode API keys, tokens, or passwords in Storybook stories or configuration files](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_exploitation_via_storybook_integration_-_credential_leakage_in_stories_or_storybook_configu_e30f3e7a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Developers, during development or testing, accidentally hardcode sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords) directly into Storybook stories or configuration files.
    *   If Storybook is exposed (even unintentionally or in non-production environments accessible to attackers), these hardcoded credentials become accessible.
    *   **Impact:** Direct exposure of credentials, leading to unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, and full application compromise.
