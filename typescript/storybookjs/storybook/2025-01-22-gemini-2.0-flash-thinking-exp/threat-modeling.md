# Threat Model Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of Storybook's Node.js dependencies. This could be achieved by targeting a publicly exposed Storybook instance or by compromising a developer's machine and leveraging vulnerabilities during development. Attackers might use publicly available exploits or develop custom exploits to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or developer machine running Storybook, data breaches if sensitive information is accessible in the development environment, Denial of Service (DoS), supply chain compromise affecting projects using the vulnerable Storybook instance.
*   **Storybook Component Affected:** `node_modules` directory, specifically vulnerable packages within Storybook's dependency tree (e.g., core packages, builder packages, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Storybook and all its dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or Snyk in CI/CD pipelines and local development workflows.
    *   Use dependency lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions and facilitate easier vulnerability patching.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Storybook and its dependencies and promptly apply patches.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Addon Exploitation](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_addon_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability in a Storybook addon or introduces a malicious addon. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in popular addons, creating seemingly benign but malicious addons, or compromising addon repositories to inject malicious code. Once installed, a malicious addon can execute arbitrary code within the Storybook environment.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the Storybook environment, potentially leading to compromise of the developer machine or access to sensitive development resources. Data exfiltration, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks targeting developers using the Storybook instance, supply chain attacks if malicious addons are widely distributed.
*   **Storybook Component Affected:** Storybook Addon system, specifically the addon packages installed in `node_modules` and the addon registration/loading mechanism within Storybook's core.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and select addons from trusted sources and official Storybook channels.
    *   Review addon code, especially for community-developed addons, before installation to identify suspicious or potentially malicious code.
    *   Keep addons updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a process for reporting and removing suspicious or vulnerable addons.
    *   Minimize the number of installed addons and only use those strictly necessary for development.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage via Stories](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_via_stories.md)

*   **Description:** Developers unintentionally include sensitive information (API keys, secrets, personal data, internal URLs, etc.) directly within Storybook stories, example data, or component props. If the Storybook instance or its code repository is publicly accessible, attackers can discover this sensitive data by browsing the stories or inspecting the source code.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials leading to unauthorized access to APIs or services, data breaches if personal information is exposed, information disclosure about internal systems and configurations, reputational damage, potentially full compromise of associated systems if leaked credentials are critical.
*   **Storybook Component Affected:** Storybook Stories (`*.stories.js|jsx|ts|tsx` files), Storybook Docs addon (if used to document props and examples).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement mandatory code reviews to specifically check for and remove sensitive data from stories and example data before committing code.
    *   Educate developers about the risks of hardcoding sensitive data in Storybook and promote secure coding practices.
    *   Utilize environment variables or configuration files to manage sensitive data and access them programmatically within stories instead of hardcoding values.
    *   Avoid using real production data in Storybook stories. Use mock data or sanitized data for examples.
