# Attack Surface Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Accessible Storybook Instance](./attack_surfaces/publicly_accessible_storybook_instance.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing a Storybook instance to the public internet or untrusted networks.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** Storybook is designed to be a visual UI development environment, often deployed as a static website. If not properly secured, it can be easily made publicly accessible.
*   **Example:** A development team deploys their Storybook to a publicly accessible AWS S3 bucket without any access restrictions. An attacker discovers this URL and can browse the entire Storybook instance, gaining insights into internal application components and potentially sensitive data within stories.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of internal application details, leakage of sensitive data embedded in stories (API keys, internal URLs), potential for targeted attacks on the live application based on exposed information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Access:** Deploy Storybook only on private networks or behind strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., VPN, corporate network with multi-factor authentication, password protection with strong policies).
    *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement strict ACLs on hosting platforms (e.g., S3 bucket policies, web server configurations, firewall rules) to limit access to only authorized users and IP ranges.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review the accessibility of the Storybook instance and ensure access controls are correctly configured and effective.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Storybook Addons](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_storybook_addons.md)

*   **Description:** Using Storybook addons that contain security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** Storybook's extensibility relies on addons, which are often developed by third parties and may not undergo rigorous security reviews, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the Storybook environment.
*   **Example:** A team uses a popular Storybook addon that has a known Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript into the Storybook UI. When developers use this Storybook instance, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking or credential theft.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks targeting developers, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if addons interact with server-side components or expose vulnerable APIs, compromise of developer machines and development environment, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability type and the addon's privileges)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Addon Vetting:** Carefully vet addons before using them. Prioritize addons from trusted sources, with active maintenance, strong community support, and a history of security awareness. Check for known vulnerabilities reported against the addon.
    *   **Dependency Scanning for Addons:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of Storybook addons.
    *   **Regular Addon Updates:** Keep addons updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement a process for timely updates of Storybook addons.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Addons:** Avoid using addons that request excessive permissions or access to sensitive resources unless absolutely necessary and after thorough security review.
    *   **Security Audits of Addons (Critical Projects):** For critical projects or sensitive environments, consider performing dedicated security audits of used addons, especially custom or less widely adopted ones.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Storybook Addons (Supply Chain Attack)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_storybook_addons__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** Using intentionally malicious Storybook addons designed to compromise the development environment through a supply chain attack.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** The npm ecosystem and Storybook's addon architecture make it possible for attackers to publish malicious packages disguised as legitimate addons, which developers might unknowingly install.
*   **Example:** An attacker publishes a malicious Storybook addon with a name similar to a popular, legitimate addon (typosquatting). Developers, mistaking it for the legitimate one, install the malicious addon. This addon contains code to steal developer credentials, inject backdoors into the project's build process, or exfiltrate sensitive data from the development environment.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on developer machines and potentially build servers, data theft (credentials, source code, environment variables, secrets), backdoors in development environment and potentially deployed applications, severe supply chain compromise affecting the entire development pipeline.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Trusted Sources:** Only install addons from highly trusted sources and reputable maintainers. Verify addon publishers and package integrity using npm's security features and package provenance information if available.
    *   **Package Name Double-Verification:** Carefully double-check addon package names to prevent typosquatting attacks. Verify the package name, author, and repository against official documentation and trusted sources.
    *   **Mandatory Code Review of Addons:** Implement a mandatory code review process for all new addons before installation, especially for projects with high security requirements. Focus on reviewing addon code for suspicious or malicious behavior.
    *   **Dependency Locking and Integrity Checks:** Use package lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml) to ensure consistent dependency versions and enable integrity checks (using `integrity` hashes) to detect tampering with packages.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Sandboxing:** Implement security monitoring in development environments to detect suspicious network activity or system behavior after installing new addons. Consider using sandboxing or containerization for development environments to limit the impact of compromised addons.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storybook Configuration Leading to Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storybook_configuration_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguring Storybook with insecure options that can lead to arbitrary code execution, particularly through features that allow dynamic code evaluation or insecure content loading.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** Storybook offers configuration options that, if misused, can weaken security. For example, enabling insecure content loading or features that bypass security restrictions can create vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A developer inadvertently enables a Storybook configuration option that allows loading and executing arbitrary JavaScript code from external URLs within stories. An attacker could then craft a malicious URL and trick a developer into loading a story that executes this malicious code within their Storybook instance, leading to RCE on the developer's machine.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on developer machines, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) with the potential for more severe consequences due to the development context, compromise of the development environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review all Storybook configuration options and understand their security implications before enabling or modifying them. Consult Storybook documentation and security best practices.
    *   **Disable Insecure Features:** Disable any Storybook configuration options that enable insecure content loading, dynamic code evaluation from untrusted sources, or bypass security restrictions unless absolutely necessary and after implementing compensating security controls.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Configuration:**  Configure Storybook with the principle of least privilege in mind. Only enable necessary features and avoid enabling potentially risky options unless there is a clear and justified need.
    *   **Configuration Hardening and Security Templates:** Develop and enforce secure Storybook configuration templates based on security best practices and organizational security policies. Regularly review and update these templates.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Storybook Dependencies Leading to RCE or XSS](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_storybook_dependencies_leading_to_rce_or_xss.md)

*   **Description:** Using Storybook with outdated or vulnerable npm dependencies that have known Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** Storybook, being a Node.js application, relies on a large number of npm packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact Storybook's security and can be exploited through the Storybook application.
*   **Example:** Storybook uses an outdated version of a critical library with a publicly known Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request to the Storybook instance, leading to code execution on the server hosting Storybook or potentially even on developer machines if the vulnerability is client-side exploitable through the Storybook UI.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. RCE and XSS vulnerabilities are considered high to critical severity.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (specifically focusing on RCE and XSS vulnerabilities in dependencies)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Continuous Dependency Scanning:** Implement continuous dependency scanning using automated tools (e.g., npm audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check, GitHub Dependabot) to proactively identify vulnerable dependencies in Storybook projects.
    *   **Automated Dependency Updates and Patching:** Implement automated processes for updating Storybook dependencies and applying security patches as soon as they are released. Prioritize updates for dependencies with known RCE or XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Locking and Reproducible Builds:** Use package lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments and facilitate easier and safer updates.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:** Include Storybook deployments in regular security testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities arising from dependencies or other sources.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure of Sensitive Data through Storybook UI in Publicly Accessible Instances](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_of_sensitive_data_through_storybook_ui_in_publicly_accessible_instances.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing sensitive or confidential information through the Storybook user interface when the Storybook instance is publicly accessible or accessible to unauthorized users.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** Storybook is designed to display component code, examples, and potentially data within stories. If stories or component examples inadvertently contain sensitive data and Storybook is publicly accessible, this data can be exposed.
*   **Example:** Developers accidentally include API keys, database connection strings, internal URLs, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as example data within Storybook stories or component documentation. If the Storybook instance is publicly accessible, attackers or unauthorized individuals can discover and exploit this sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data (API keys, credentials, internal URLs, PII, intellectual property), potential for account compromise, unauthorized access to internal systems, compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control:** As a primary mitigation, enforce strict access control to Storybook instances, ensuring they are not publicly accessible and only accessible to authorized development team members.
    *   **Data Sanitization and Mocking in Stories:** Implement mandatory data sanitization and mocking practices for all data used in Storybook stories and component examples. Ensure that no real or sensitive data is ever included in Storybook. Replace sensitive data with mock data or sanitized placeholders.
    *   **Automated Data Leakage Prevention Scans:** Implement automated scans to detect potential sensitive data leakage within Storybook stories and component code before deployment.
    *   **Code Review for Sensitive Data:** Conduct thorough code reviews of Storybook stories and component examples to identify and remove any inadvertently included sensitive data before deploying or sharing Storybook instances.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Storybook Core or Addons Leading to Developer Compromise](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_storybook_core_or_addons_leading_to_developer_compromi_5e89dad3.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present in Storybook core or its addons that can be exploited to inject malicious scripts into the Storybook UI, targeting developers who use the Storybook instance.
*   **How Storybook Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in Storybook's core code or within its addons can create pathways for XSS attacks. If Storybook itself is vulnerable, it becomes a platform for delivering attacks against its users (developers).
*   **Example:** A zero-day XSS vulnerability is discovered in Storybook core. An attacker finds a way to inject a malicious script into a Storybook story or component. When developers view this compromised story in their Storybook instance, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing their session cookies, accessing local storage, or performing actions on their behalf within the development environment.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking of developer accounts, credential theft, unauthorized access to development resources, malicious actions performed on behalf of developers within the development environment, potential for further compromise of development systems and code repositories.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated with Storybook Security Patches:**  Prioritize staying up-to-date with the latest Storybook releases and security patches. Monitor Storybook security advisories and apply patches promptly to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for Storybook instances to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities. Configure CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the attack surface for injected scripts.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of Storybook deployments, including both the core Storybook application and used addons, to proactively identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding (in Custom Code/Addons):** If developing custom addons or adding custom code within Storybook, ensure proper input sanitization and output encoding to prevent introducing new XSS vulnerabilities. However, for core Storybook and well-vetted addons, this is primarily the responsibility of the Storybook and addon maintainers.
