# Attack Surface Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Production Deployment](./attack_surfaces/accidental_production_deployment.md)

**Description:** Storybook, intended for development, is mistakenly deployed to a production environment accessible to the public.

**How Storybook Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Storybook inherently exposes internal UI components, their states, and potentially sensitive data used for demonstration purposes. It provides a detailed view of the application's front-end architecture.

**Example:** A build script error or misconfiguration leads to the Storybook build output being included in the production deployment package and accessible via a predictable URL (e.g., `/storybook`).

**Impact:** Exposure of internal application structure, potential data leaks (if demo data is sensitive), and a roadmap for attackers to understand the application's front-end logic and potential vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict separation of development and production build processes:** Ensure Storybook is explicitly excluded from production builds.
* **Automated checks in CI/CD pipelines:** Implement checks to prevent Storybook build artifacts from being included in production deployments.
* **Network segmentation:** If Storybook needs to be accessible for internal testing, ensure it's isolated from the public internet.
* **Regular security audits:** Review deployment configurations to ensure Storybook is not inadvertently exposed.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Storybook Addons](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_storybook_addons.md)

**Description:** Third-party Storybook addons, used to extend functionality, may contain security vulnerabilities.

**How Storybook Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Storybook's extensibility through addons introduces dependencies on external code, which might not be as rigorously vetted for security as the core Storybook library.

**Example:** A widely used Storybook addon has a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the Storybook environment.

**Impact:** Compromise of the Storybook environment, potential access to developer machines if the addon has access to local resources, and the ability to inject malicious code into the development workflow.

**Risk Severity:** **High** (can be critical depending on the vulnerability and addon privileges)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Carefully vet and audit third-party addons before use:** Check for known vulnerabilities, review the addon's code if possible, and consider the maintainer's reputation.
* **Keep addons updated to the latest versions:** Ensure you are using versions with known security vulnerabilities patched.
* **Implement a process for managing and tracking addon dependencies:** Use tools that can identify vulnerable dependencies.
* **Minimize the number of addons used:** Only install necessary addons to reduce the attack surface.
