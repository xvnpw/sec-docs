## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Storybook's Own Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_storybook's_own_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This critical node represents a direct attack on Storybook itself, exploiting weaknesses in its code or dependencies. Success here can lead to significant compromise.

    *   **Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities:**  Focuses on vulnerabilities exploitable within the user's browser when interacting with Storybook.
        *   **Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Storybook UI [CRITICAL]:** Attackers inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser.
            *   **Inject Malicious Script via Story Parameters:**  Leveraging the data used to configure and display stories to inject malicious JavaScript.
                *   **Modify Story Parameters in DevTools:** Directly altering story parameters in the browser's developer tools to inject malicious scripts.
                *   **Exploit Insecure Parameter Handling in Addons:**  Taking advantage of vulnerabilities in how Storybook addons process story parameters to inject scripts.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Vulnerable Dependencies or Addons [CRITICAL]:** Exploiting security flaws in the Node.js modules Storybook relies on or within the code of installed addons to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
        *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Node.js Modules:** Utilizing publicly known vulnerabilities in the versions of Node.js modules used by Storybook.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Storybook's Configuration and Addons [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_storybook's_configuration_and_addons__critical_.md)

This critical node focuses on exploiting the extensibility of Storybook through its configuration and addon system. Insecure practices here can introduce significant risks.

    *   **Exploit Insecure Addon Configurations:**  Taking advantage of misconfigurations or inherent vulnerabilities within installed addons.
        *   **Leverage Addons with Known Security Vulnerabilities:** Targeting Storybook instances that use outdated or vulnerable addons.
            *   **Utilize Outdated or Unpatched Addons:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in addons that have not been updated to address security flaws.
    *   **Leverage Insecure Storybook Deployment [CRITICAL]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how Storybook is deployed and made accessible.
        *   **Access Storybook Instance Deployed in Production:**  Gaining access to a Storybook instance that should not be available in a live production environment.
            *   **Exploit Exposed Storybook Instance without Authentication:**  Accessing a production Storybook instance that lacks proper authentication mechanisms.
