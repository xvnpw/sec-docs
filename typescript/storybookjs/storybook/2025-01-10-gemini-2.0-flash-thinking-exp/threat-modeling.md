# Threat Model Analysis for storybookjs/storybook

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Addon](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_addon.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could convince a developer to install a seemingly benign but actually malicious Storybook addon. Upon installation and Storybook execution, the addon's code could run arbitrary commands on the developer's machine or within the Storybook environment. This is a direct consequence of Storybook's addon system allowing third-party code integration.
- **Impact:** Complete compromise of the developer's machine or development environment, potential data breaches if sensitive information is accessed, supply chain attacks if the malicious addon is committed to a shared repository.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Story Examples](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_story_examples.md)

- **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or internal URLs directly within story files or component props for demonstration purposes. If the Storybook instance is publicly accessible or accessible to unauthorized individuals, this data, directly present within Storybook's rendering of components, could be easily discovered by an attacker browsing the stories.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal systems or services, potential data breaches if exposed credentials grant access to sensitive data.
- **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Addon or Configuration](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_addon_or_configuration.md)

- **Description:** A compromised or poorly developed Storybook addon, or a vulnerable custom configuration within Storybook, might allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the Storybook interface. When other developers or users access the Storybook instance, these scripts, executed within the context of Storybook's UI, could steal session cookies, redirect them to malicious sites, or perform other harmful actions.
- **Impact:** Account compromise of Storybook users, potential access to development resources or the main application if session cookies are stolen.
- **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks via Addon Dependencies](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks_via_addon_dependencies.md)

- **Description:** Storybook addons rely on external dependencies. An attacker could potentially exploit dependency confusion vulnerabilities by publishing a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency used by an addon. Storybook's addon installation process, relying on standard package managers, could then fetch and install the malicious package instead of the legitimate one.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Storybook environment, potential data breaches or supply chain compromise.
- **Risk Severity:** High
