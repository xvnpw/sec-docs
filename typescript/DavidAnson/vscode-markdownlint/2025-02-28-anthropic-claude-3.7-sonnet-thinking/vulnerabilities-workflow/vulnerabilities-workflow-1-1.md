# Vulnerabilities

Based on the available project files, I cannot identify any high-severity vulnerabilities (RCE, Command Injection, or Code Injection) in the markdownlint VSCode extension that meet all the required criteria.

The extension does handle potentially dangerous operations such as executing JavaScript from custom rules, markdown-it plugins, or configuration files (.markdownlint.cjs/.markdownlint-cli2.cjs), which could be attack vectors when a victim opens a malicious repository. However, the README.md explicitly documents that the extension honors VSCode's Workspace Trust setting to mitigate this risk:

> Running JavaScript from custom rules, `markdown-it` plugins, or configuration files (such as `.markdownlint.cjs`/`.markdownlint-cli2.cjs`) could be a security risk, so VS Code's [Workspace Trust setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust) is honored to block JavaScript for untrusted workspaces.

Without access to the implementation files (such as extension.mjs mentioned in package.json but not included in the provided files), I cannot thoroughly analyze if there are any bypasses to this protection mechanism or other unmitigated high-severity vulnerabilities that would meet the specified criteria.
