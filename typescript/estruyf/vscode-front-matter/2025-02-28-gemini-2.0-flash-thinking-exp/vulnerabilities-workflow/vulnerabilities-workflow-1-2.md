- vulnerability name: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Webviews
  - description: An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the webviews of the Front Matter extension. This could be achieved by crafting a malicious markdown file or data file that, when processed and displayed within a webview, executes the injected script.
      - steps to trigger vulnerability: 1. Create a markdown or data file in the workspace managed by Front Matter. 2. In the front matter or content of the file, inject malicious JavaScript code. For example, in a markdown file's front matter, add a field like `description: "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS\")'>"` or in the content `![alt](<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS\")'>)`. 3. Open the markdown or data file within VSCode and activate the Front Matter panel or dashboard, which renders a webview previewing or displaying file metadata. 4. The webview, when rendering the crafted content, will execute the injected JavaScript code, leading to XSS.
  - impact: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to: - Steal sensitive information, such as user tokens or workspace data, if accessible within the webview context. - Perform actions on behalf of the user within the VSCode environment, potentially leading to further compromise. - Redirect the user to malicious websites or display misleading information within the extension's UI.
  - vulnerability rank: high
  - currently implemented mitigations: - Content Security Policy (CSP) is implemented in the webviews (e.g., in `webpack/dashboard.config.js` and `webpack/panel.config.js`). However, the CSP might not be strict enough to prevent all types of XSS attacks, especially if `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval` are allowed for scripts, or if there are loopholes in the CSP configuration. - The code uses `WebviewHelper.getNonce()` in `PanelProvider.ts`, `Preview.ts` and `Chatbot.ts` which is intended to enhance CSP security by using nonces for script execution.
  - missing mitigations: - **Strict CSP:** Enforce a stricter Content Security Policy that disallows `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` for scripts. Ensure that the CSP is correctly applied to all webviews and that there are no bypasses. - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for all user-controlled data rendered in webviews. This should include sanitizing front matter data, content body, and any other data sources that influence webview rendering. Use a trusted sanitization library to prevent XSS. - **Code Review for XSS Vulnerabilities:** Conduct a thorough code review specifically targeting potential XSS vulnerabilities in webview rendering logic, especially in components that display user content like content previews, data dashboards, and panel views.
  - preconditions: - The user must open a workspace containing a malicious markdown or data file with the Front Matter extension active. - The Front Matter extension's panel or dashboard must be used to preview or display the crafted content.
  - source code analysis: - Files potentially involved in rendering user content in webviews include: - `/code/src/panelWebView/PanelProvider.ts`: Creates and manages the main panel webview. - `/code/src/dashboardWebView/*`: Contains components for the dashboard webview, including content and media display. - `/code/src/commands/Preview.ts`: Handles the preview webview. - The CSP is set up in webpack configs (`/code/webpack/dashboard.config.js`, `/code/webpack/panel.config.js`, `/code/webpack/panel.config.js`), but needs to be reviewed for strictness. - The use of `WebviewHelper.getNonce()` suggests an attempt to mitigate XSS, but the implementation and effectiveness need to be verified. - Code in `/code/src/dashboardWebView/components/` and `/code/src/panelWebView/` should be examined for how user-provided data is rendered and if it's properly sanitized. For instance, check how fields like `title`, `description`, and content are displayed in the UI, particularly in card components and detail panels.
  - security test case: 1. Create a new markdown file named `xss-test.md` in a workspace folder opened in VSCode. 2. Add the following front matter to the file: ```markdown --- title: XSS Test description: "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS in Description\")'>" --- ![XSS](<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS in Content\")'>) ``` 3. Save the `xss-test.md` file. 4. Open the Front Matter panel in VSCode (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` and type "Front Matter: Open Panel"). 5. Navigate to the "Contents" section in the Front Matter panel. 6. Observe if an alert box appears with "XSS in Description" or "XSS in Content". If an alert box appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability.
