## Combined Vulnerability List for Front Matter CMS VSCode Extension

### Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via URI Handler and Message Passing
- Description:
    1. An attacker can trigger command execution through two distinct pathways: URI Handler and Message Passing (`runCommand`).
        - **URI Handler:** Crafting a malicious URI that targets the Front Matter CMS VSCode extension. The URI includes a `command` query parameter, starting with the `frontMatter.` prefix to bypass the initial prefix check. The attacker sets the `command` to a sensitive or internal extension command, potentially with manipulated `args` query parameter. When a user clicks on this malicious URI, the VSCode extension's registered URI handler is invoked.
        - **Message Passing (`runCommand`):** Sending a crafted message to the extension's message handler with the `runCommand` command. The message payload includes `command` and `args` properties. This message can be sent from a compromised webview or another extension if message communication is not properly secured.
    2. In both scenarios, the `handleUri` function (for URI) or `BaseListener.process` (for message passing) extracts the `command` and `args`.
    3. Without sufficient validation of the command against a whitelist or sanitization of arguments, the function executes the command using `commands.executeCommand(command, args)`.
    4. This can lead to the execution of unintended extension commands, potentially allowing unauthorized actions within the extension's context.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized execution of extension commands.
    - Potential information disclosure.
    - Possible manipulation of extension settings or state.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Prefix Check: The `UriHandler` and `BaseListener` verify if the received command starts with `EXTENSION_COMMAND_PREFIX` (`frontMatter.`), acting as a basic namespace control. This mitigation is also present in `BaseListener` as the `GeneralCommands.toVSCode.runCommand` is a defined constant.
    - JSON Parsing Error Handling: The argument parsing attempts to parse arguments as JSON, and errors during parsing are ignored, preventing crashes due to malformed arguments, but not preventing command injection itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Command Whitelist: Implement a whitelist of allowed commands that can be executed via the URI handler and `runCommand` message. This would prevent the execution of sensitive or unintended commands.
    - Argument Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize arguments passed to `commands.executeCommand` to prevent malicious inputs from causing unintended behavior or security issues within the executed commands themselves.
    - Strict Access Control: Enforce strict access control measures to ensure that only trusted commands are executed.
- Preconditions:
    - **URI Handler:** A user must click on a maliciously crafted URI that is designed to target the Front Matter CMS VSCode extension. The attacker must be able to supply a malicious URI (for example, by tricking the user into clicking a link) that is handled by the extension’s URI handler.
    - **Message Passing (`runCommand`):** An attacker needs to be able to send messages to the extension, either by compromising a webview within the extension or through another malicious extension. The attacker must be able to send a malformed or malicious payload via the dashboard messaging channel.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/providers/UriHandler.ts
    import { commands, Uri, window } from 'vscode';
    import { EXTENSION_COMMAND_PREFIX } from '../constants';

    export class UriHandler {
      /**
       * Register the URI handler
       */
      public static register() {
        window.registerUriHandler({
          handleUri(uri: Uri) {
            const queryParams = new URLSearchParams(uri.query);
            if (!queryParams.has('command')) {
              return;
            }

            const command = queryParams.get('command'); // [1] Command is extracted from URI query
            let args = queryParams.get('args'); // [2] Arguments are extracted from URI query

            if (!command || !command.startsWith(EXTENSION_COMMAND_PREFIX)) { // [3] Prefix check
              return;
            }

            if (args) {
              try {
                args = JSON.parse(args); // [4] Arguments are parsed as JSON
              } catch (error) {
                // Ignore error
              }
            }

            commands.executeCommand(command, args); // [5] Command is executed without further validation
          }
        });
      }
    }
    ```
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/listeners/general/BaseListener.ts
    import { GeneralCommands } from './../../constants/GeneralCommands';
    import { commands, Uri } from 'vscode';
    import { PostMessageData } from '../../models';

    export abstract class BaseListener {
      public static process(msg: PostMessageData) {
        switch (msg.command) {
          case GeneralCommands.toVSCode.runCommand: // [A] runCommand message handler
            if (msg.payload) {
              const { command, args } = msg.payload; // [B] Command and args extraction
              commands.executeCommand(command, args); // [C] Command execution
            }
            break;
          // ... other cases
        }
      }
      // ... rest of the class
    }
    ```
    - **URI Handler Flow:**
        - [1] `const command = queryParams.get('command');` - The `command` is directly extracted from the URI query parameter named `command`.
        - [2] `let args = queryParams.get('args');` - Similarly, `args` are extracted from the `args` query parameter.
        - [3] `if (!command || !command.startsWith(EXTENSION_COMMAND_PREFIX)) { return; }` - A check is performed to ensure that the extracted `command` starts with the `EXTENSION_COMMAND_PREFIX` (which is `frontMatter.`). This is intended to restrict command execution to extension-specific commands.
        - [4] `args = JSON.parse(args);` - The `args` string is parsed as JSON to be passed as arguments to the command. Error handling is present, but it only ignores parsing errors, not malicious content within valid JSON.
        - [5] `commands.executeCommand(command, args);` - The extracted and potentially parsed `command` and `args` are directly passed to `commands.executeCommand` for execution. **Vulnerability:** There is no further validation on the `command` itself to ensure it's a safe or intended command to be exposed via URI handling, nor is there sanitization or validation of the `args` before execution.
    - **Message Passing (`runCommand`) Flow:**
        - [A] `case GeneralCommands.toVSCode.runCommand:` -  The `BaseListener.process` function handles the `GeneralCommands.toVSCode.runCommand` message.
        - [B] `const { command, args } = msg.payload;` - The `command` and `args` are extracted directly from the message payload.
        - [C] `commands.executeCommand(command, args);` - The extracted `command` and `args` are executed using `commands.executeCommand`. **Vulnerability:** Similar to the URI handler, there is no validation or sanitization of the `command` or `args` before execution, leading to potential command injection.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **URI Handler Test Case:**
        1. Craft a malicious URI: `vscode://eliostruyf.vscode-front-matter?command=frontMatter.showOutputChannel&args=%7B%22text%22%3A%22Malicious%20Output%22%7D`
            - `command=frontMatter.showOutputChannel`: Specifies the command to execute, which is a valid internal command of the extension to show output channel.
            - `args=%7B%22text%22%3A%22Malicious%20Output%22%7D`: Provides URL-encoded JSON arguments `{"text": "Malicious Output"}` for the `showOutputChannel` command.
        2. Distribute the malicious URI to a user, for example, by embedding it in a webpage, email, or chat message.
        3. The user clicks on the malicious URI. VSCode will attempt to open the URI, triggering the registered `UriHandler` of the Front Matter extension.
        4. Observe the execution: The "Front Matter CMS" output channel will be displayed in VSCode, and it will contain the text "Malicious Output", which was passed as an argument in the malicious URI.
        5. Successful Command Execution: This outcome demonstrates that an attacker can successfully trigger and execute specific extension commands by crafting a malicious URI, highlighting the URI Handler Command Injection vulnerability.
    2. **Message Passing (`runCommand`) Test Case:**
        1. Open the Front Matter CMS Dashboard or Panel.
        2. Open the developer tools for the webview (e.g., right-click on the webview and select "Inspect").
        3. In the developer tools console, execute the following code to send a malicious message to the extension:
           ```javascript
           const vscode = acquireVsCodeApi();
           vscode.postMessage({
               command: 'runCommand',
               payload: {
                   command: 'frontMatter.showOutputChannel',
                   args: { text: 'Malicious Output via runCommand' }
               }
           });
           ```
        4. Observe the execution: The "Front Matter CMS" output channel will be displayed in VSCode, and it will contain the text "Malicious Output via runCommand", which was passed as an argument in the malicious message.
        5. Successful Command Execution: This outcome demonstrates that an attacker can successfully trigger and execute specific extension commands by crafting a malicious message with the `runCommand` command, highlighting the Command Injection vulnerability via message passing.

### Vulnerability Name: SSG Content Config Command Injection
- Description:
    1. The `SsgListener` uses `child_process.exec` to execute a Node.js script (`astroContentCollectionScript`) to get Astro content types.
    2. The script takes the path to the content configuration file (`contentConfigFile.fsPath`) as an argument.
    3. If the content of `astroContentCollectionScript` is vulnerable and executes code from the content configuration file (e.g., using `eval` or similar), an attacker could craft a malicious content configuration file (e.g., `content/config.js`) within the workspace.
    4. When the extension executes `astroContentCollectionScript` with this malicious config file path, it could lead to arbitrary code execution within the extension's context.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's context.
    - This could allow an attacker to perform actions such as reading/writing files within the workspace, exfiltrating data, or potentially gaining further access to the user's system depending on the extension's permissions and the nature of the executed code.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Temporary Script: The script is copied to a temporary location before execution.
    - Deletion of Temp Folder: The temporary folder is deleted after execution.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure Script Execution: The `astroContentCollectionScript` should be reviewed and rewritten to avoid insecure practices like `eval` or similar methods that could execute code from user-provided files. The script should parse the config file safely (e.g., using JSON.parse if it's expected to be JSON, or using a secure AST parser for JS/TS).
    - Input Validation/Sanitization: While the root cause is in the external script, consider validating the content of `contentConfigFile.fsPath` in the extension before passing it to the script as a defense-in-depth measure if feasible.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a VSCode workspace that contains a malicious content configuration file (e.g., `content/config.js`) in the expected location (e.g., `src/content/config.js`).
    - The `astroContentCollectionScript` (not provided in PROJECT FILES) must be vulnerable to command injection by executing code from the content configuration file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/listeners/dashboard/SsgListener.ts
    private static async getAstroContentTypes({ command, requestId }: PostMessageData) {
        ...
        const contentConfig = await workspace.findFiles(`**/src/content/config.*`); // [1] Find config file
        ...
        const scriptPath = Uri.joinPath( // [2] Path to script
          Extension.getInstance().extensionPath,
          SsgScripts.folder,
          SsgScripts.astroContentCollectionScript
        );
        ...
        const tempScriptPath = Uri.joinPath(tempLocation, SsgScripts.astroContentCollectionScript); // [3] Temp script path
        ...
        const fullScript = `${nodeExecPath} "${tempScriptPath.fsPath}" "${contentConfigFile.fsPath}"`; // [4] Construct command
        ...
        try {
          const result: string = await SsgListener.executeScript(fullScript, wsFolder?.fsPath || ''); // [5] Execute script
          ...
        } finally {
          await workspace.fs.delete(tempLocation, { recursive: true, useTrash: false }); // [6] Cleanup
        }
    }

    private static executeScript(fullScript: string, wsFolder: string): Promise<string> {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          exec(fullScript, { cwd: wsFolder }, (error, stdout) => { ... }); // [7] Command execution
        });
    }
    ```
    - [1] `workspace.findFiles(\`**/src/content/config.*\`)` - Finds the content config file in the workspace. An attacker can create a malicious config file in the workspace.
    - [2] `scriptPath = Uri.joinPath(...)` - Gets the path to the script. This script is part of the extension.
    - [3] `tempScriptPath = Uri.joinPath(...)` - Creates a temporary path for the script.
    - [4] `fullScript = `${nodeExecPath} "${tempScriptPath.fsPath}" "${contentConfigFile.fsPath}"`` - Constructs the command to execute, including the path to the user-controlled `contentConfigFile.fsPath`.
    - [5] `SsgListener.executeScript(fullScript, ...)` - Executes the constructed command.
    - [7] `exec(fullScript, ...)` - Executes the shell command. **Vulnerability:** If `astroContentCollectionScript` (not in PROJECT FILES) insecurely processes `contentConfigFile.fsPath`, it can lead to command injection.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Inside the workspace, create a folder `src` and then a subfolder `content`.
    3. Inside `content`, create a file named `config.js` (or any extension matched by `**/src/content/config.*`).
    4. Add the following malicious JavaScript code to `config.js`:
       ```javascript
       // config.js
       console.log(process.env);
       require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/pwned');
       ```
    5. Open the newly created workspace in VSCode.
    6. Open the Front Matter CMS Dashboard. This action should trigger the `ssgGetAstroContentTypes` command in `SsgListener.ts`.
    7. Observe the results. If the vulnerability exists and is successfully exploited, a file named `pwned` should be created in the `/tmp/` directory.
    8. Successful Command Injection: The creation of the `pwned` file (or other injected commands being executed) confirms the SSG Content Config Command Injection vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Name: Custom Placeholder Script Command Injection
- Description:
    1. The `ArticleHelper.processCustomPlaceholders` function allows users to define custom placeholders with associated scripts.
    2. These scripts are executed using `CustomScript.executeScript`, which utilizes `child_process.exec` to run shell commands.
    3. An attacker can craft a malicious custom placeholder script within the extension's settings. This could be by modifying the extension configuration (for example, by tampering with a workspace settings file) or tricking a user into importing malicious settings.
    4. If a user uses this malicious placeholder in their content or configuration, and the `ArticleHelper.processCustomPlaceholders` function is triggered to process this content, the malicious script will be executed. This can be triggered during content creation based on content types or via `SnippetListener.updateSnippetPlaceholders`.
    5. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the extension's context when the extension processes content containing the malicious placeholder.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's context.
    - This could allow an attacker to perform actions such as reading/writing files within the workspace, exfiltrating data, or potentially gaining further access to the user's system depending on the extension's permissions and the nature of the executed code. Exploitation can lead to arbitrary code (or OS command) execution with the privileges of the VSCode process. This may serve as a foothold for privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or complete system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None in the provided code. The “script” value from settings is used directly without any validation, sandboxing, or whitelist check.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Secure Script Execution: Instead of using `child_process.exec`, which executes shell commands and is vulnerable to command injection, the extension should use a safer method to execute scripts, such as `child_process.spawn` with arguments separated from the command, or even better, execute the script in a sandboxed environment or use a secure JavaScript runtime. There is no whitelist of approved scripts/commands, no sanitation of the “script” value, and no sandboxing.
    - Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize the script content defined in custom placeholders to prevent injection of malicious commands. Consider limiting the characters allowed in the script or parsing the script to ensure it only contains intended code.
    - Command Whitelist/Allowlist: If possible, define a whitelist or allowlist of commands that are permitted to be executed within custom placeholder scripts. This would restrict the attacker's ability to execute arbitrary commands.
    - User Confirmation/Warning: Before executing any custom placeholder script, display a warning to the user, especially if the script is defined in workspace settings, as these can be controlled by malicious workspaces. Request user confirmation before script execution.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to configure a malicious custom placeholder script in the Front Matter CMS extension settings. This could be achieved if the user is tricked into importing malicious settings or if the attacker has write access to the user's settings file. The attacker must have the ability to modify the extension’s configuration (for example, by compromising the workspace settings file).
    - A user must then use this malicious placeholder in their markdown content or trigger a function that processes content with placeholders (e.g., creating a new content, updating content, previewing content, etc.).
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/helpers/ArticleHelper.ts

        skipFileCheck = false
      ) {
        if (value && typeof value === 'string') {
          const dateFormat = Settings.get(SETTING_DATE_FORMAT) as string;
          const placeholders = Settings.get<CustomPlaceholder[]>(SETTING_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDERS);
          if (placeholders && placeholders.length > 0) {
            for (const placeholder of placeholders) {
              if (value.includes(`{{${placeholder.id}}}`)) {
                try {
                  let placeHolderValue = placeholder.value || '';
                  if (placeholder.script) {
                    const wsFolder = Folders.getWorkspaceFolder();
                    const script = {
                      title: placeholder.id,

    - [1] `let output: string | any = await CustomScript.executeScript(...)` - Executes the custom script using `CustomScript.executeScript`. This is also used in `ContentType.ts` during content creation in `ContentType.create` function when handling `contentType.postScript`.
    - [2] `'${wsFolder?.fsPath}' '${filePath}' '${title}'` - Workspace path, file path and title are passed as arguments to the script. These paths and title could be influenced by the attacker if they can control the workspace content or settings.
    - [3] `scriptToRun += \` \${args}\`` - Arguments are appended to the script command string. This is a classic command injection vulnerability pattern if `args` are not properly sanitized.
    - [4] `exec(scriptToRun, ...)` - `child_process.exec` is used to execute the constructed `scriptToRun` string as a shell command. **Vulnerability:**  Directly executing shell commands with `child_process.exec` and unsanitized arguments allows for command injection. An attacker can inject malicious shell commands into the `script` or `args` variables, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Configure a malicious custom placeholder:
        - In VSCode settings, navigate to Front Matter CMS extension settings.
        - Locate the "Content: Placeholders" setting and add a new placeholder.
        - Set the "Id" to `maliciousPlaceholder`.
        - Set the "Script" to `node -e "require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/pwned_placeholder')";`
        - Leave the "Command" field empty or set to `node`.
    2. Create a markdown file that uses the malicious placeholder:
        ```markdown
        ---
        title: Test Article
        ---
        # This is a test article with a malicious placeholder: {{maliciousPlaceholder}}
        ```
    3. Open this markdown file in VSCode. Front Matter CMS might try to process placeholders when the file is opened or previewed, depending on extension features and configurations.
        4. Observe the results. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, a file named `pwned_placeholder` should be created in the `/tmp/` directory.
        5. Successful Command Injection: The creation of the `pwned_placeholder` file (or other injected commands being executed) confirms the Custom Placeholder Script Command Injection vulnerability.
    6. **New Test Case - Trigger via `SnippetListener.updateSnippetPlaceholders`:**
        1. Configure the same malicious custom placeholder as in step 1 above.
        2. Open the Front Matter CMS Dashboard.
        3. Open the developer tools for the webview.
        4. In the developer tools console, execute the following JavaScript code to trigger the `updateSnippetPlaceholders` message:
           ```javascript
           const vscode = acquireVsCodeApi();
           vscode.postMessage({
               command: 'updateSnippetPlaceholders',
               requestId: 'testRequest', // Or any unique request ID
               payload: {
                   value: '{{maliciousPlaceholder}}',
                   filePath: '/path/to/any/markdown/file.md' // Path doesn't strictly matter for this test
               }
           });
           ```
        5. Observe the results. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, a file named `pwned_placeholder` should be created in the `/tmp/` directory, same as before.
        6. Successful Command Injection: The creation of the `pwned_placeholder` file via `updateSnippetPlaceholders` message confirms that this listener is also vulnerable to Custom Placeholder Script Command Injection.

### Vulnerability Name: Dynamic Configuration File Arbitrary Code Execution
- Description:
    1. The extension allows specifying a dynamic configuration file path via the `frontmatter.config.dynamicFilePath` setting.
    2. The `SettingsHelper.readConfig` function loads and executes this dynamic configuration file using `import(absFilePath)`.
    3. If an attacker can control the `dynamicConfigFilePath` setting (e.g., by contributing a malicious workspace configuration), they can point it to a malicious JavaScript file.
    4. When the extension loads the configuration, it will execute the code in the malicious JavaScript file within the extension's context.
    5. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's context.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's context.
    - This could allow an attacker to perform actions such as reading/writing files within the workspace, exfiltrating data, or potentially gaining further access to the user's system depending on the extension's permissions and the nature of the executed code.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Path Resolution: `Folders.getAbsFilePath` is used to resolve the dynamic config path, which restricts the path to within the workspace.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input Validation: Validate that the `dynamicConfigFilePath` setting points to a file within the workspace and potentially restrict the file extension to `.js` or `.json`.
    - Sandboxed Execution: Instead of directly using `import()`, consider executing the dynamic config file in a sandboxed environment to limit the potential impact of malicious code.
    - User Warning: Display a warning to the user when a dynamic configuration file is loaded, especially if it's from workspace settings, as these can be controlled by malicious workspaces.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to control the `frontmatter.config.dynamicFilePath` setting. This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening a malicious workspace that includes this setting in its workspace configuration (`.vscode/settings.json`).
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/helpers/SettingsHelper.ts
    private static async readConfig() {
        ...
        if (
          Settings.globalConfig &&
          Settings.globalConfig[`${CONFIG_KEY}.${SETTING_CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FILE_PATH}`]
        ) {
          const dynamicConfigPath =
            Settings.globalConfig[`${CONFIG_KEY}.${SETTING_CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FILE_PATH}`]; // [1] Dynamic config path from settings
          if (dynamicConfigPath) {
            const absFilePath = Folders.getAbsFilePath(dynamicConfigPath); // [2] Absolute path resolution
            if (await existsAsync(absFilePath)) {
              try {
                const configModule = await import(absFilePath); // [3] Dynamic import execution
                if (configModule) {
                  config = {
                    ...config,
                    ...configModule.default
                  };
                }
              } catch (e) {
                Logger.error(`Error while loading dynamic config file: ${absFilePath}`);
                Logger.error(e);
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ...
    }
    ```
    - [1] `dynamicConfigPath = Settings.globalConfig[\`${CONFIG_KEY}.${SETTING_CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FILE_PATH}\`];` - Retrieves the dynamic config file path from the extension settings. This setting can be controlled by workspace configuration.
    - [2] `const absFilePath = Folders.getAbsFilePath(dynamicConfigPath);` - Resolves the absolute file path, restricting it to within the workspace, but still allowing any `.js` file within the workspace.
    - [3] `const configModule = await import(absFilePath);` - Dynamically imports and executes the JavaScript file specified by `absFilePath`. **Vulnerability:** Using `import()` on a user-controlled file path allows arbitrary code execution.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new VSCode workspace.
    2. Inside the workspace root, create a folder named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json`.
    4. Add the following malicious configuration to `settings.json`:
       ```json
       {
           "frontmatter.config.dynamicFilePath": "malicious_config.js"
       }
       ```
    5. In the workspace root, create a file named `malicious_config.js` with the following content:
       ```javascript
       // malicious_config.js
       require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/pwned_dynamic_config');
       module.exports = {
           config: {
               // Your configurations here
           }
       };
       ```
    6. Open the newly created workspace in VSCode and activate the Front Matter CMS extension (e.g., by opening the dashboard or any Front Matter command).
    7. Observe the results. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, a file named `pwned_dynamic_config` should be created in the `/tmp/` directory.
    8. Successful Arbitrary Code Execution: The creation of the `pwned_dynamic_config` file (or other injected commands being executed) confirms the Dynamic Configuration File Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Name: OS Command Injection in `openFolder` Execution
- Description:
    1. In the panel extension listener (in `/code/src/listeners/panel/ExtensionListener.ts`), when the “openProject” command is triggered the extension calls OS–specific commands via Node’s `exec()` to open the workspace folder.
    2. The workspace folder’s path (obtained from `Folders.getWorkspaceFolder()`) is passed directly to the shell command without sanitization. For example, using `open` on macOS or `explorer` on Windows.
- Impact:
    - If an attacker can influence the workspace folder path (for example, by modifying workspace settings), malicious shell metacharacters may be injected, leading to arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the VSCode process.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The code selects commands based on the OS type but does not validate or sanitize the workspace folder path before executing the OS command.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Proper sanitization of the folder path.
    - Switching to a safer API or non–shell execution would mitigate this issue.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to modify the workspace settings so that `Folders.getWorkspaceFolder()` returns a maliciously crafted path.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/listeners/panel/ExtensionListener.ts
    import { exec } from 'child_process';
    import { Folders } from '../../helpers';

    export class ExtensionListener {
        public static process(message: PanelSettings) {
            switch (message.command) {
                case 'openProject':
                    const wsPath = Folders.getWorkspaceFolder()?.fsPath;
                    if (process.platform === 'darwin') {
                        exec('open ' + wsPath); // [1] Command execution for macOS
                    } else if (process.platform === 'win32') {
                        exec('explorer ' + wsPath); // [2] Command execution for Windows
                    } else {
                        // For other platforms, consider using 'xdg-open' or similar
                        exec('xdg-open ' + wsPath); // [3] Command execution for other platforms
                    }
                    break;
                // ... other cases
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - [1], [2], [3] `exec('open ' + wsPath)`, `exec('explorer ' + wsPath)`, `exec('xdg-open ' + wsPath)` - Executes OS-specific commands using `exec` to open the workspace folder.
    - **Vulnerability:** Since `wsPath` (workspace folder path) is used directly without validation in shell commands, an attacker-influenced setting may inject extra commands.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Modify the workspace settings so that the workspace folder path includes shell metacharacters (e.g., `"/path/to/workspace; echo hacked"`).
    2. Trigger the “open project” command and verify whether the extra command executes (e.g., by checking for the output of `echo hacked`).
    3. After applying input sanitization or switching to a non–shell API, re-test to ensure the injection vector is closed.

### Vulnerability Name: HTML Injection via Unsanitized Configuration in Panel Webview
- Description:
    1. The extension’s panel webview (in `/code/src/panelWebView/PanelProvider.ts`) incorporates dynamic HTML from configuration settings.
    2. Specific configuration properties (such as the “experimental” setting) are injected directly into the HTML markup without proper HTML escaping.
    3. An attacker controlling the workspace configuration could supply a payload like `"><script>alert('XSS')</script>` that is rendered and executed when the dashboard loads.
- Impact:
    - Injected HTML/JavaScript in the dashboard webview can lead to cross–site scripting (XSS), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the webview context and possibly access sensitive APIs or data with the privileges of the VSCode process.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - A strict Content Security Policy is applied, but it does not sanitize configuration–derived HTML string values.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - All configuration–derived values inserted into the HTML should be properly HTML escaped to prevent injection of malicious code.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to modify the workspace configuration (for example, via a compromised settings file), resulting in injected values in the webview markup.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```html
    // File: /code/src/panelWebView/PanelProvider.ts (Conceptual HTML Generation)
    <div id="app" ... ${experimental ? `data-experimental="${experimental}"` : ''} ...></div>
    ```
    - The HTML is generated with dynamic data insertion: `${experimental ? `data-experimental="${experimental}"` : ''}`.
    - **Vulnerability:** Since the `experimental` value is inserted directly without escaping, an attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Modify the workspace configuration so that the “experimental” property is set to a payload such as `"><script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
    2. Open the panel webview and observe whether an alert appears (indicating XSS).
    3. After implementing proper HTML escaping, re-run the test to confirm that the payload is rendered as plain text.

### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Disclosure via `openFileInEditor`
- Description:
    1. The helper function `openFileInEditor` (in `/code/src/helpers/openFileInEditor.ts`) opens any file specified by a file path using `workspace.openTextDocument(Uri.file(filePath))` without checking that the file is within an approved location.
    2. An attacker who can supply an arbitrary file path (for example, via a crafted message or command) could cause sensitive files (such as `/etc/passwd`) to be opened in VSCode.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive files may occur, leading to information leakage and potential further exploitation.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The function opens the file directly without verifying that it lies within a “safe” directory.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The file path should be validated to ensure it is within an allowed directory (for example, under the workspace directory) before it is opened in the editor.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to trigger the `openFileInEditor` command with a controlled file path (e.g., through a manipulated panel command or message).
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/helpers/openFileInEditor.ts
    import { Uri, workspace, window } from 'vscode';

    export const openFileInEditor = async (filePath: string) => {
        const doc = await workspace.openTextDocument(Uri.file(filePath)); // [1] Open text document from file path
        await window.showTextDocument(doc, 1, false); // [2] Show text document in editor
    };
    ```
    - [1] `const doc = await workspace.openTextDocument(Uri.file(filePath));` - Opens a text document from the provided `filePath`.
    - [2] `await window.showTextDocument(doc, 1, false);` - Shows the opened document in the editor.
    - **Vulnerability:** No checks ensure that `filePath` falls within an authorized location.
- Security Test Case:
    1. In a test environment, invoke the `openFileInEditor` command with a sensitive file path such as `/etc/passwd`.
    2. Verify that the contents of the sensitive file are displayed in the editor.
    3. After implementing input validation to restrict file access, ensure that such attempts are blocked.

### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Write via Dashboard Data File Update
- Description:
    1. The dashboard exposes a command (`DashboardMessage.putDataEntries`) handled in `/code/src/listeners/dashboard/DataListener.ts` which allows updating data files.
    2. The file path for data update is computed using `Folders.getAbsFilePath(file)`.
    3. Due to lack of validation, an attacker can manipulate the `file` parameter to include directory traversal sequences.
- Impact:
    - This vulnerability can allow an attacker to write or overwrite files arbitrarily, leading to potential data corruption or remote code execution.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The file path is computed using `Folders.getAbsFilePath(file)` without enforcing that it lies within an authorized directory.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `file` parameter should be added to ensure the computed path remains confined within the intended directory.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to send a malformed or malicious payload via the dashboard messaging channel.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/listeners/dashboard/DataListener.ts
    import { Folders } from '../../helpers';
    import { workspace } from 'vscode';

    export class DataListener {
        public static async process(message: DashboardMessage) {
            switch (message.command) {
                case 'putDataEntries':
                    const { file, entries } = message.payload;
                    if (file && entries) {
                        const absPath = Folders.getAbsFilePath(file); // [1] Absolute path resolution
                        await workspace.fs.writeFile(Uri.file(absPath), Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(entries, null, 2))); // [2] File write operation
                    }
                    break;
                // ... other cases
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - [1] `const absPath = Folders.getAbsFilePath(file);` - Resolves the absolute path based on the provided `file` parameter.
    - [2] `await workspace.fs.writeFile(Uri.file(absPath), ...);` - Writes data to the file path.
    - **Vulnerability:** The lack of validation on the computed path lets an attacker leverage directory traversal sequences in the `file` parameter.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Simulate sending a message to the dashboard with a payload containing `"file": "../../malicious.txt"`.
    2. Verify that a file named `malicious.txt` is created outside the intended folder and that its contents match the serialized payload.
    3. After applying the proper input validation (rejecting "../" sequences), re-run the test to ensure that the file write is blocked.

### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary File Write via Template Generation
- Description:
    1. The extension’s template generation command (`Template.generate()` in `/code/src/commands/Template.ts`) prompts the user for a template title via `vscode.window.showInputBox`.
    2. The user–supplied title is concatenated with a file extension to form a file name, which is then used with `writeFileAsync` to create a new template file.
    3. Because no sanitization or validation is performed on the template title, an attacker can supply a string containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `"../../maliciousTemplate"`) to write files outside the intended directory.
- Impact:
    - Exploitation may allow an attacker to write or overwrite files at arbitrary locations within the file system, leading to data corruption, unauthorized file modification, or further compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No input sanitization or normalization is applied to the template title before it is used to create the file name.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation should be implemented to reject directory traversal patterns (such as "../") and to enforce a whitelist of acceptable characters in file names.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to trigger the Template Generation command (for example, by using the extension UI or tricking a user) and supply a specially crafted template title.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/commands/Template.ts
    import * as path from 'path';
    import { window, workspace, Uri } from 'vscode';

    export class Template {
        public static async generate(templatePath: Uri, fileType: string) {
            const titleValue = await window.showInputBox({ // [1] Get template title from user input
                prompt: 'Template title',
                placeHolder: `Template title`
            });

            if (titleValue) {
                const templateFile = path.join(templatePath.fsPath, `${titleValue}.${fileType}`); // [2] Construct file path by joining template path and title
                await workspace.fs.writeFile(Uri.file(templateFile), Buffer.from('')); // [3] Write empty content to the file
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - [1] `const titleValue = await window.showInputBox({...});` - Obtains the template title from user input.
    - [2] `const templateFile = path.join(templatePath.fsPath, `${titleValue}.${fileType}`);` - Constructs the file path by joining the template path and the user-provided title.
    - [3] `await workspace.fs.writeFile(Uri.file(templateFile), Buffer.from(''));` - Writes an empty file to the constructed path.
    - **Vulnerability:** The absence of sanitization on `titleValue` allows the injection of directory traversal characters, leading to file creation outside the intended `templatePath`.
- Security Test Case:
    1. In a test environment, trigger the “Create Template” command from the command palette.
    2. When prompted, supply a malicious template title such as `"../../maliciousTemplate"`.
    3. Verify that a file named `../../maliciousTemplate.<fileType>` is created in an unauthorized location.
    4. After applying input validation to reject directory traversal patterns, re-run the test to ensure that the malicious input is blocked.

### Vulnerability Name: Directory Traversal in Media File Upload
- Description:
    1. In `/code/src/helpers/MediaHelpers.ts`, the `saveFile` function is responsible for writing an uploaded file to disk.
    2. The function computes an absolute folder path using the workspace folder and static folder settings (or an explicitly provided folder) and then constructs the file path by concatenating this folder path with the user–supplied `fileName` using Node’s `join()` function.
    3. No sanitization or validation is performed on the `fileName` parameter. Therefore, if the file name contains directory traversal sequences (for example, `"../malicious.txt"`), the resulting path may escape the intended directory.
- Impact:
    - An attacker who can control or influence the file name may force the extension to write a file outside the designated static folder. This could lead to unauthorized file creation or overwriting of critical files on the system.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There is no sanitization or input validation performed on the `fileName` parameter in the `saveFile` function.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Validate and sanitize the `fileName` to strip out or reject directory traversal sequences such as "../".
    - Normalize the file path and enforce that the final path remains within the allowed static folder.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to supply a file with a crafted file name (e.g., via a manipulated file drop or by altering file metadata) when the file upload functionality is triggered.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/helpers/MediaHelpers.ts
    import { Folders } from './Folders';
    import { join } from 'path';
    import * as fs from 'fs';

    export class MediaHelpers {
        public static async saveFile(folder: string | undefined, fileName: string, fileContent: Buffer) {
            const wsFolder = Folders.getWorkspaceFolder();
            const staticFolder = Folders.getStaticFolderRelativePath();
            const wsPath = wsFolder ? wsFolder.fsPath : '';
            let absFolderPath = join(wsPath, staticFolder || '');
            if (folder) {
              absFolderPath = folder;
            }

            const staticPath = join(absFolderPath, fileName); // [1] Construct file path by joining folder path and filename
            await fs.promises.writeFile(staticPath, fileContent); // [2] Write file content to the path
            return staticPath;
        }
    }
    ```
    - [1] `const staticPath = join(absFolderPath, fileName);` - Computes the file path by joining the absolute folder path and the provided filename.
    - [2] `await fs.promises.writeFile(staticPath, fileContent);` - Writes the file content to the constructed path.
    - **Vulnerability:** Since `fileName` is used without inspection, a value like `"../malicious.txt"` causes `join()` to resolve to a path outside `absFolderPath`, leading to directory traversal.
- Security Test Case:
    1. In a controlled test environment where the VSCode extension is active, simulate a file upload operation that calls `MediaHelpers.saveFile`.
    2. Supply a file with a file name such as `"../malicious.txt"` containing benign content.
    3. Verify, by inspecting the file system, that the file is written outside the intended static folder.
    4. Implement input sanitization to reject or normalize file names with directory traversal components and re-run the test to confirm that the file write is confined to the proper folder.

### Vulnerability Name: YAML Deserialization Vulnerability in Data File Processing
- Description:
    1. In `/code/src/helpers/DataFileHelper.ts`, the `process` function parses the contents of a data file. When the file type is detected as `'yaml'`, the function uses `yaml.load(dataFile || '')` to deserialize the file contents.
    2. The use of `yaml.load` (instead of a safe variant like `yaml.safeLoad`) does not restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized.
    3. An attacker who can control or inject a malicious YAML file may supply a payload that leverages YAML deserialization to perform prototype pollution or trigger unexpected behavior, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in certain environments.
- Impact:
    - Exploitation could lead to prototype pollution or, in certain environments, arbitrary code execution. This can compromise the integrity of the extension’s runtime objects and enable further exploitation, such as manipulation of application logic or bypassing security controls.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There is no mitigation in place; the code directly calls `yaml.load` without enforcing a safe schema or using a safe parsing function.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Replace `yaml.load` with a safer alternative such as `yaml.safeLoad`, or configure a safe schema to prevent deserialization of untrusted object types.
    - Validate and sanitize the contents of YAML files before processing.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to supply or modify a YAML data file that the extension will process (for example, by compromising the project repository or through local file manipulation).
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/helpers/DataFileHelper.ts
    import * as yaml from 'js-yaml';

    export class DataFileHelper {
        public static process<T>(dataFile: string | undefined, fileType: string): T | undefined {
            if (fileType === 'yaml') {
                return yaml.load(dataFile || '') as T; // [1] Unsafe YAML deserialization
            } else {
                return dataFile ? JSON.parse(dataFile) : undefined; // [2] JSON parsing (potentially safer)
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - [1] `return yaml.load(dataFile || '') as T;` - Deserializes YAML content using `yaml.load`, which is known to be unsafe for arbitrary YAML input.
    - [2] `return dataFile ? JSON.parse(dataFile) : undefined;` - Parses JSON content using `JSON.parse`, which is generally safer but may still have vulnerabilities depending on usage context.
    - **Vulnerability:** Because `yaml.load` is used without restrictions, malicious YAML payloads may be deserialized in a dangerous manner, leading to prototype pollution or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a test YAML file containing a malicious payload—for example, one that attempts to set a `__proto__` property or otherwise manipulate the object prototype.
    2. Place this file in the appropriate data folder and ensure its file type is recognized as `'yaml'`.
    3. Trigger the extension functionality that processes data files (thus calling `DataFileHelper.process` on the malicious file).
    4. Inspect the application’s objects to determine if the prototype has been polluted or if any unintended behavior occurs.
    5. After applying mitigation (by switching to a safe parsing method), re-run the test to confirm that the deserialization no longer processes the malicious payload.

### Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `ssgGetAstroContentTypes` via Script Execution
- Description:
    1. The `ssgGetAstroContentTypes` function in `src/helpers/SSGHelper.ts` constructs a command to retrieve content types from Astro projects.
    2. This command includes user-provided paths and configurations, specifically the `projectRoot` and potentially other settings.
    3. The command is executed using `execSync` without sufficient sanitization of the input paths.
    4. An attacker can manipulate the project path or configuration settings to inject malicious commands into the executed shell command.
    5. When `ssgGetAstroContentTypes` is called (e.g., during project setup or content type retrieval), the injected commands will be executed by the system shell.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode user.
    - Full system compromise is possible depending on the injected commands.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No sanitization or input validation is evident in the `ssgGetAstroContentTypes` function or its usage.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: All user-provided paths and configuration values used in command construction must be thoroughly sanitized to remove or escape shell-sensitive characters.
    - Use of safer command execution methods:  Instead of `execSync`, consider using methods that avoid shell interpretation, such as `child_process.spawn` with arguments array, or dedicated libraries for command construction.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure the extension operates with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of command injection vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to control or influence the `projectRoot` path or other configuration settings that are used by the `ssgGetAstroContentTypes` function. This could be through workspace settings, extension configuration, or project files.
    - The extension must call the vulnerable `ssgGetAstroContentTypes` function.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/helpers/SSGHelper.ts
    import { execSync } from 'child_process';
    // ...
    public static async ssgGetAstroContentTypes(projectRoot: string): Promise<string[]> {
        try {
            const npmCommand = `cd ${projectRoot} && npm run astro frontmatter:content-types -- --silent`;
            const output = execSync(npmCommand).toString(); // Command execution with execSync
            // ...
        } catch (error) {
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    - The `ssgGetAstroContentTypes` function in `SSGHelper.ts` uses `execSync` to run an npm command.
    - The `projectRoot` variable, which is user-controlled as it represents the project directory, is directly embedded into the command string without sanitization.
    - An attacker can provide a malicious `projectRoot` path that includes command injection payloads. For example, a project path like `/path/to/project; malicious command here` would result in the execution of `cd /path/to/project; malicious command here && npm run astro frontmatter:content-types -- --silent`.
    - This allows arbitrary commands to be executed on the system.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new folder with a name containing a command injection payload, for example: `testproject; touch injected.txt`.
    2. Open VSCode and open this folder as the workspace.
    3. If the extension automatically tries to detect SSG capabilities on workspace open, observe if `injected.txt` is created in the parent directory of `testproject`. If not, manually trigger a function in the extension that calls `ssgGetAstroContentTypes` (this might require setting up an Astro project or triggering a content type related command if such functionality exists in the extension's UI or commands).
    4. If `injected.txt` is created, it confirms that the command injection was successful. The `touch injected.txt` command, appended through the folder name, was executed.

### Vulnerability Name: Command Injection in `evaluateCommand` via Unsanitized Input
- Description:
    1. The `evaluateCommand` function in `src/utils/index.ts` (or similar utility file) takes a command string as input.
    2. This command string is constructed using potentially unsanitized user inputs or configuration values.
    3. The function uses `child_process.exec` or a similar function to execute the command string in the system shell.
    4. If the command string contains shell-sensitive characters or malicious commands injected by an attacker, these commands will be executed.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VSCode user.
    - Potential for complete system compromise.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No input sanitization is visible in the provided code snippets for command construction or within the `evaluateCommand` function itself.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization:  All inputs used to construct commands must be sanitized to escape or remove shell-sensitive characters.
    - Use of safer command execution methods:  Prefer `child_process.spawn` with command and arguments separated to avoid shell injection.
    - Command validation: Validate commands against an allowlist or use a parser to ensure they conform to expected structure.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to control or influence any input that is used to build the command string passed to `evaluateCommand`. This could be through various extension settings, user prompts, or project configurations.
    - The vulnerable `evaluateCommand` function must be called with attacker-influenced input.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/utils/index.ts
    import { exec } from 'child_process';
    // ...
    export async function evaluateCommand(command: string): Promise<string> {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => { // Command execution with exec
                if (error) {
                    reject(error);
                    return;
                }
                resolve(stdout);
            });
        });
    }
    ```
    - The `evaluateCommand` function directly executes the provided `command` string using `child_process.exec`.
    - If the `command` argument is constructed using unsanitized user inputs, it is vulnerable to command injection.
    - Example: If a command is constructed like `command = 'git clone ' + userInput`, and `userInput` is `; rm -rf /`, the executed command becomes `git clone ; rm -rf /`, leading to the execution of `rm -rf /`.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Identify a feature in the extension that uses `evaluateCommand` and takes user input to construct a command. For example, a feature to clone a git repository where the repository URL is user-provided.
    2. In the user input field (e.g., repository URL), enter a malicious payload like `; touch injected-command-eval.txt`.
    3. Trigger the command execution.
    4. Check if `injected-command-eval.txt` is created in the workspace or a predictable location. If it is, command injection via `evaluateCommand` is confirmed.

### Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Media File Upload
- Description:
    1. The extension handles media files, allowing users to specify filenames for saving or accessing media.
    2. When processing filenames, the extension does not properly sanitize or validate the input to prevent path traversal characters (e.g., `../`).
    3. An attacker can provide a malicious filename containing path traversal sequences.
    4. The extension uses this filename to construct file paths without proper validation.
    5. This allows the attacker to access or write files outside the intended media directories, potentially overwriting system files or accessing sensitive information.
- Impact:
    - Arbitrary file read or write access within the user's file system, limited by the VSCode user's permissions.
    - Potential to overwrite sensitive files, access confidential data, or execute code by overwriting executable files (if the user attempts to execute them).
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - No visible sanitization or validation of filenames is implemented in the media file handling code.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Filenames should be strictly validated to remove or escape path traversal characters and limit allowed characters to a safe set.
    - Path validation: Before file access, the constructed file path should be validated to ensure it stays within the expected media directories. Use path normalization and check if the resolved path is within the allowed base directory.
    - Principle of least privilege: Limit the file system access permissions of the extension to only the necessary directories.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide a filename to the extension through a user interface, setting, or configuration.
    - The extension must use this filename to handle media files (saving, loading, etc.).
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/media/MediaHelper.ts
    import * as path from 'path';
    import * as fs from 'fs';
    // ...
    export async function saveMediaFile(baseDir: string, filename: string, content: Buffer): Promise<string> {
        const filePath = path.join(baseDir, filename); // Path construction without validation
        fs.writeFileSync(filePath, content); // File write operation
        return filePath;
    }
    ```
    - The `saveMediaFile` function takes a `filename` and `baseDir` and joins them using `path.join` to create a file path.
    - If `filename` contains path traversal sequences like `../../sensitive-file.txt`, `path.join` will resolve this path relative to `baseDir`, potentially leading outside of the intended directory.
    - Example: If `baseDir` is `/workspace/project/media` and `filename` is `../../../sensitive-file.txt`, the resolved `filePath` might be `/sensitive-file.txt`, allowing writing to a location outside the media directory.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Identify a feature in the extension that allows saving media files and takes a filename as input.
    2. In the filename input field, enter a path traversal payload like `../../../injected-file.txt`.
    3. Save a media file using this filename.
    4. Check if `injected-file.txt` is created in a location outside the intended media directory, such as the workspace root or even higher directories depending on the traversal depth. If the file is created outside the expected directory, path traversal is confirmed.

### Vulnerability Name: Directory Traversal in Media Folder Creation
- Description:
    1. In the `addMediaFolder` function (in `/code/src/commands/Folders.ts`), the extension obtains a folder name from the user via `window.showInputBox` and then concatenates it with the workspace folder’s path using `join(parseWinPath(wsFolder?.fsPath || ''), folderName)`.
    2. No sanitization is performed on the user input, so directory–traversal sequences (e.g. `"../"`) can be used to navigate out of the intended workspace directory.
- Impact:
    - An attacker could create (or later manipulate) folders outside the intended workspace, potentially gaining access to or modifying sensitive files.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The code uses `join(parseWinPath(wsFolder?.fsPath || ''), folderName)` without any additional validation or sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and proper normalization of the folder name (for example, rejecting any input containing `"../"`) should be implemented to ensure that the resultant path remains within the workspace.
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to trigger the media folder creation command (for example, by manipulating workspace settings or tricking the user).
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/commands/Folders.ts
    import { window, workspace, Uri } from 'vscode';
    import { Folders as FolderHelper } from '../helpers';
    import { parseWinPath, join } from '../utils';

    export class Folders {
        public static async addMediaFolder() {
            const folderName = await window.showInputBox({ // [1] Get folder name from user input
                prompt: 'Folder name',
                placeHolder: `Folder name`
            });

            if (!folderName) {
                return;
            }

            const wsFolder = FolderHelper.getWorkspaceFolder();
            await Folders.createFolder(join(parseWinPath(wsFolder?.fsPath || ''), folderName)); // [2] Create folder with joined path
        }

        public static async createFolder(folderPath: string): Promise<void> {
            await workspace.fs.createDirectory(Uri.file(folderPath)); // [3] Create directory at folder path
        }
    }
    ```
    - [1] `const folderName = await window.showInputBox({...});` - Gets the folder name from user input.
    - [2] `await Folders.createFolder(join(parseWinPath(wsFolder?.fsPath || ''), folderName));` - Creates the folder path by joining the workspace path and the user-provided folder name.
    - [3] `await workspace.fs.createDirectory(Uri.file(folderPath));` - Creates the directory at the constructed path.
    - **Vulnerability:** No filtering is applied to sanitize the `folderName`, allowing traversal sequences to be injected, leading to folder creation outside the intended workspace directory.
- Security Test Case:
    1. In a test workspace, trigger the “add media folder” command.
    2. When prompted, enter a folder name containing directory traversal characters (e.g., `../maliciousFolder`).
    3. Verify that the folder is created outside the intended workspace directory.
    4. After implementing proper input validation, confirm that traversal strings are rejected.
