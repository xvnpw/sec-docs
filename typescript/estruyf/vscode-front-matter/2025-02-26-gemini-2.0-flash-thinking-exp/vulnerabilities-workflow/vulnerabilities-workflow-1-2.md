- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Custom Script Placeholders  
  **Description:**  
  • In the front–matter placeholder–processing routine (in the `ArticleHelper.processCustomPlaceholders` function), if a custom placeholder definition contains a “script” property then that script is executed without input sanitization or sandboxing.  
  • The code builds a command object using the placeholder’s id, script, and command and then directly calls the custom script executor via `CustomScript.executeScript`.  
  • An attacker who can modify the extension configuration (for example, by tampering with a workspace settings file) may inject a malicious script command that will be executed within the VSCode process.  
  **Impact:**  
  • Exploitation can lead to arbitrary code (or OS command) execution with the privileges of the VSCode process. This may serve as a foothold for privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or complete system compromise.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The “script” value from settings is used directly without any validation, sandboxing, or whitelist check.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • There is no whitelist of approved scripts/commands, no sanitation of the “script” value, and no sandboxing.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must have the ability to modify the extension’s configuration (for example, by compromising the workspace settings file).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `/code/src/helpers/ArticleHelper.ts`, the function checks for a “script” property and then calls:  
  `await CustomScript.executeScript(script, …)`  
  • No input validation is done on the “script” property, so an attacker–controlled custom script is executed directly.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a safe test workspace, modify the settings file to include a custom placeholder with a “script” property that runs a benign command (for example, logging a unique string).  
  2. Insert the matching placeholder token in a Markdown file and reload/trigger processing.  
  3. Confirm that the benign command executes (by checking log output).  
  4. After applying mitigation (such as whitelisting), verify that the command is no longer executed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Directory Traversal in Media Folder Creation  
  **Description:**  
  • In the `addMediaFolder` function (in `/code/src/commands/Folders.ts`), the extension obtains a folder name from the user via `window.showInputBox` and then concatenates it with the workspace folder’s path using `join(parseWinPath(wsFolder?.fsPath || ''), folderName)`.  
  • No sanitization is performed on the user input, so directory–traversal sequences (e.g. `"../"`) can be used to navigate out of the intended workspace directory.  
  **Impact:**  
  • An attacker could create (or later manipulate) folders outside the intended workspace, potentially gaining access to or modifying sensitive files.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The code uses `join(parseWinPath(wsFolder?.fsPath || ''), folderName)` without any additional validation or sanitization.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Input validation and proper normalization of the folder name (for example, rejecting any input containing `"../"`) should be implemented to ensure that the resultant path remains within the workspace.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must be able to trigger the media folder creation command (for example, by manipulating workspace settings or tricking the user).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `/code/src/commands/Folders.ts`, after obtaining `folderName` from `window.showInputBox`, the folder is created using:  
  `await Folders.createFolder(join(parseWinPath(wsFolder?.fsPath || ''), folderName));`  
  • No filtering is applied to sanitize the `folderName`, allowing traversal sequences to be injected.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a test workspace, trigger the “add media folder” command.  
  2. When prompted, enter a folder name containing directory traversal characters (e.g., `../maliciousFolder`).  
  3. Verify that the folder is created outside the intended workspace directory.  
  4. After implementing proper input validation, confirm that traversal strings are rejected.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Command Execution via Malicious URI Handler  
  **Description:**  
  • The extension registers a URI handler (in `/code/src/providers/UriHandler.ts`) that parses incoming URIs for a “command” query parameter.  
  • The handler only checks that the command starts with the required extension prefix (e.g. `frontMatter.`) but does not validate the rest of the payload or enforce strict authorization.  
  • As a result, a crafted URI may trigger the execution of an arbitrary extension command with attacker–controlled arguments.  
  **Impact:**  
  • An attacker may be able to execute unintended commands within the extension – potentially chaining commands or invoking OS commands if the extension functions allow such behavior.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The URI handler verifies that the command starts with the expected prefix.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Additional validation of the payload and strict access control measures should be enforced to ensure that only trusted commands are executed.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must be able to supply a malicious URI (for example, by tricking the user into clicking a link) that is handled by the extension’s URI handler.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `/code/src/providers/UriHandler.ts`, if a “command” parameter is present and its value begins with the expected prefix, the handler calls:  
  `commands.executeCommand(command, args);`  
  • The lack of thorough sanitization or authorization of the arguments gives an attacker control over the command’s payload.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Construct a URI with query parameters such as `command=frontMatter.someCommand&args={"key":"value"}` that triggers a benign action.  
  2. Open the URI and observe that the corresponding command is executed.  
  3. After implementing stricter parameter validation or proper access control, re-run the test to ensure that the payload is rejected.

- **Vulnerability Name:** OS Command Injection in openFolder Execution  
  **Description:**  
  • In the panel extension listener (in `/code/src/listeners/panel/ExtensionListener.ts`), when the “openProject” command is triggered the extension calls OS–specific commands via Node’s `exec()` to open the workspace folder (e.g., using `open` on macOS or `explorer` on Windows).  
  • The workspace folder’s path (obtained from `Folders.getWorkspaceFolder()`) is passed directly to the shell command without sanitization.  
  **Impact:**  
  • If an attacker can influence the workspace folder path (for example, by modifying workspace settings), malicious shell metacharacters may be injected, leading to arbitrary command execution.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The code selects commands based on the OS type but does not validate or sanitize the workspace folder path before executing the OS command.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Proper sanitization of the folder path and switching to a safer API or non–shell execution would mitigate this issue.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must be able to modify the workspace settings so that `Folders.getWorkspaceFolder()` returns a maliciously crafted path.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `/code/src/listeners/panel/ExtensionListener.ts`, the function retrieves the workspace folder’s path and then executes a command like:  
  `exec('open ' + wsPath);`  
  • Since `wsPath` is used directly without validation, an attacker–influenced setting may inject extra commands.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Modify the workspace settings so that the workspace folder path includes shell metacharacters (e.g., `"/path/to/workspace; echo hacked"`).  
  2. Trigger the “open project” command and verify whether the extra command executes (e.g., by checking for the output of `echo hacked`).  
  3. After applying input sanitization or switching to a non–shell API, re-test to ensure the injection vector is closed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** HTML Injection via Unsanitized Configuration in Panel Webview  
  **Description:**  
  • The extension’s panel webview (in `/code/src/panelWebView/PanelProvider.ts`) incorporates dynamic HTML from configuration settings.  
  • Specific configuration properties (such as the “experimental” setting) are injected directly into the HTML markup without proper HTML escaping.  
  • An attacker controlling the workspace configuration could supply a payload like `"><script>alert('XSS')</script>` that is rendered and executed when the dashboard loads.  
  **Impact:**  
  • Injected HTML/JavaScript in the dashboard webview can lead to cross–site scripting (XSS), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the webview context and possibly access sensitive APIs or data.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • A strict Content Security Policy is applied, but it does not sanitize configuration–derived HTML string values.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • All configuration–derived values inserted into the HTML should be properly HTML escaped to prevent injection of malicious code.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must have the ability to modify the workspace configuration (for example, via a compromised settings file), resulting in injected values in the webview markup.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `/code/src/panelWebView/PanelProvider.ts`, the HTML is generated as:  
  ```html
  <div id="app" ... ${experimental ? `data-experimental="${experimental}"` : ''} ...></div>
  ```  
  • Since the `experimental` value is inserted directly without escaping, an attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Modify the workspace configuration so that the “experimental” property is set to a payload such as `"><script>alert('XSS')</script>`.  
  2. Open the panel webview and observe whether an alert appears (indicating XSS).  
  3. After implementing proper HTML escaping, re-run the test to confirm that the payload is rendered as plain text.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Disclosure via openFileInEditor  
  **Description:**  
  • The helper function `openFileInEditor` (in `/code/src/helpers/openFileInEditor.ts`) opens any file specified by a file path using `workspace.openTextDocument(Uri.file(filePath))` without checking that the file is within an approved location.  
  • An attacker who can supply an arbitrary file path (for example, via a crafted message or command) could cause sensitive files (such as `/etc/passwd`) to be opened in VSCode.  
  **Impact:**  
  • Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive files may occur, leading to information leakage and potential further exploitation.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The function opens the file directly without verifying that it lies within a “safe” directory.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • The file path should be validated to ensure it is within an allowed directory (for example, under the workspace directory) before it is opened in the editor.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must be able to trigger the `openFileInEditor` command with a controlled file path (e.g., through a manipulated panel command or message).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `/code/src/helpers/openFileInEditor.ts`, the code does:  
  ```ts
  const doc = await workspace.openTextDocument(Uri.file(filePath));
  await window.showTextDocument(doc, 1, false);
  ```  
  • No checks ensure that `filePath` falls within an authorized location.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a test environment, invoke the `openFileInEditor` command with a sensitive file path such as `/etc/passwd`.  
  2. Verify that the contents of the sensitive file are displayed in the editor.  
  3. After implementing input validation to restrict file access, ensure that such attempts are blocked.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Write via Dashboard Data File Update  
  **Description:**  
  • The dashboard exposes a command (`DashboardMessage.putDataEntries`) handled in `/code/src/listeners/dashboard/DataListener.ts`.  
  **Impact:**  
  • This vulnerability can allow an attacker to write or overwrite files arbitrarily, leading to potential data corruption or remote code execution.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • The file path is computed using `Folders.getAbsFilePath(file)` without enforcing that it lies within an authorized directory.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Input validation and sanitization of the file parameter should be added to ensure the computed path remains confined within the intended directory.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must be able to send a malformed or malicious payload via the dashboard messaging channel.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `/code/src/listeners/dashboard/DataListener.ts`, the code extracts the file parameter and then computes:  
  `const absPath = Folders.getAbsFilePath(file);`  
  • The lack of validation on the computed path lets an attacker leverage directory traversal sequences.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Simulate sending a message to the dashboard with a payload containing `"file": "../../malicious.txt"`.  
  2. Verify that a file named `malicious.txt` is created outside the intended folder and that its contents match the serialized payload.  
  3. After applying the proper input validation (rejecting "../" sequences), re-run the test to ensure that the file write is blocked.

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Write via Template Generation  
  **Description:**  
  • The extension’s template generation command (`Template.generate()` in `/code/src/commands/Template.ts`) prompts the user for a template title via `vscode.window.showInputBox`.  
  • The user–supplied title is concatenated with a file extension to form a file name, which is then used with `writeFileAsync` to create a new template file.  
  • Because no sanitization or validation is performed on the template title, an attacker can supply a string containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `"../../maliciousTemplate"`) to write files outside the intended directory.  
  **Impact:**  
  • Exploitation may allow an attacker to write or overwrite files at arbitrary locations within the file system, leading to data corruption, unauthorized file modification, or further compromise.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • No input sanitization or normalization is applied to the template title before it is used to create the file name.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Input validation should be implemented to reject directory traversal patterns (such as "../") and to enforce a whitelist of acceptable characters in file names.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must be able to trigger the Template Generation command (for example, by using the extension UI or tricking a user) and supply a specially crafted template title.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • In `/code/src/commands/Template.ts`, the title value is obtained as follows:  
  ```ts
  const titleValue = await vscode.window.showInputBox({ … });
  ```  
  • The file path is then constructed by directly concatenating the user–supplied title as:  
  ```ts
  const templateFile = path.join(templatePath.fsPath, `${titleValue}.${fileType}`);
  ```  
  • The absence of sanitization allows the injection of directory traversal characters.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a test environment, trigger the “Create Template” command from the command palette.  
  2. When prompted, supply a malicious template title such as `"../../maliciousTemplate"`.  
  3. Verify that a file named `../../maliciousTemplate.<fileType>` is created in an unauthorized location.  
  4. After applying input validation to reject directory traversal patterns, re-run the test to ensure that the malicious input is blocked.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Directory Traversal in Media File Upload  
  **Description:**  
  • In `/code/src/helpers/MediaHelpers.ts`, the `saveFile` function is responsible for writing an uploaded file to disk.  
  • The function computes an absolute folder path using the workspace folder and static folder settings (or an explicitly provided folder) and then constructs the file path by concatenating this folder path with the user–supplied `fileName` using Node’s `join()` function.  
  • No sanitization or validation is performed on the `fileName` parameter. Therefore, if the file name contains directory traversal sequences (for example, `"../malicious.txt"`), the resulting path may escape the intended directory.  
  **Impact:**  
  • An attacker who can control or influence the file name may force the extension to write a file outside the designated static folder. This could lead to unauthorized file creation or overwriting of critical files on the system.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • There is no sanitization or input validation performed on the `fileName` parameter in the `saveFile` function.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Validate and sanitize the `fileName` to strip out or reject directory traversal sequences such as "../".  
  • Normalize the file path and enforce that the final path remains within the allowed static folder.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must be able to supply a file with a crafted file name (e.g., via a manipulated file drop or by altering file metadata) when the file upload functionality is triggered.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • The function begins by determining the base folder:  
  ```ts
  const wsFolder = Folders.getWorkspaceFolder();
  const staticFolder = Folders.getStaticFolderRelativePath();
  const wsPath = wsFolder ? wsFolder.fsPath : '';
  let absFolderPath = join(wsPath, staticFolder || '');
  if (folder) {
    absFolderPath = folder;
  }
  ```  
  • It then computes the complete file path as follows:  
  ```ts
  const staticPath = join(absFolderPath, fileName);
  ```  
  • Since `fileName` is used without inspection, a value like `"../malicious.txt"` causes `join()` to resolve to a path outside `absFolderPath`.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. In a controlled test environment where the VSCode extension is active, simulate a file upload operation that calls `MediaHelpers.saveFile`.  
  2. Supply a file with a file name such as `"../malicious.txt"` containing benign content.  
  3. Verify, by inspecting the file system, that the file is written outside the intended static folder.  
  4. Implement input sanitization to reject or normalize file names with directory traversal components and re-run the test to confirm that the file write is confined to the proper folder.

- **Vulnerability Name:** YAML Deserialization Vulnerability in Data File Processing  
  **Description:**  
  • In `/code/src/helpers/DataFileHelper.ts`, the `process` function parses the contents of a data file. When the file type is detected as `'yaml'`, the function uses `yaml.load(dataFile || '')` to deserialize the file contents.  
  • The use of `yaml.load` (instead of a safe variant like `yaml.safeLoad`) does not restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized.  
  • An attacker who can control or inject a malicious YAML file may supply a payload that leverages YAML deserialization to perform prototype pollution or trigger unexpected behavior.  
  **Impact:**  
  • Exploitation could lead to prototype pollution or, in certain environments, arbitrary code execution. This can compromise the integrity of the extension’s runtime objects and enable further exploitation, such as manipulation of application logic or bypassing security controls.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • There is no mitigation in place; the code directly calls `yaml.load` without enforcing a safe schema or using a safe parsing function.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Replace `yaml.load` with a safer alternative such as `yaml.safeLoad`, or configure a safe schema to prevent deserialization of untrusted object types.  
  • Validate and sanitize the contents of YAML files before processing.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  • The attacker must be able to supply or modify a YAML data file that the extension will process (for example, by compromising the project repository or through local file manipulation).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  • The critical snippet in `/code/src/helpers/DataFileHelper.ts` is:  
  ```ts
  if (fileType === 'yaml') {
      return yaml.load(dataFile || '');
  } else {
      return dataFile ? JSON.parse(dataFile) : undefined;
  }
  ```  
  • Because `yaml.load` is used without restrictions, malicious YAML payloads may be deserialized in a dangerous manner.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Create a test YAML file containing a malicious payload—for example, one that attempts to set a `__proto__` property or otherwise manipulate the object prototype.  
  2. Place this file in the appropriate data folder and ensure its file type is recognized as `'yaml'`.  
  3. Trigger the extension functionality that processes data files (thus calling `DataFileHelper.process` on the malicious file).  
  4. Inspect the application’s objects to determine if the prototype has been polluted or if any unintended behavior occurs.  
  5. After applying mitigation (by switching to a safe parsing method), re-run the test to confirm that the deserialization no longer processes the malicious payload.
