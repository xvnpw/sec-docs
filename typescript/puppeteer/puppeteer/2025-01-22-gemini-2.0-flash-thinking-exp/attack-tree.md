## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Goal: Compromise Application Using Puppeteer [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_goal_compromise_application_using_puppeteer__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, disrupting functionality, or achieving code execution within the application using Puppeteer.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Puppeteer API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_puppeteer_api_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target weaknesses within the Puppeteer library itself. This can include exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific versions or discovering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation can lead to control over Puppeteer's behavior and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Abuse Puppeteer API Misuse in Application Code [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__abuse_puppeteer_api_misuse_in_application_code__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This is a broad category focusing on how developers might incorrectly use the Puppeteer API, leading to vulnerabilities.  It's a high-risk path because developer errors in API usage are common and can have significant security implications.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Command Injection via Puppeteer API [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__command_injection_via_puppeteer_api__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node and high-risk path focuses on injecting malicious commands or code through Puppeteer API functions. This is a direct result of improper handling of user input when interacting with Puppeteer.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Inject Malicious URLs into `page.goto()` [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__inject_malicious_urls_into__page_goto_____high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application takes user-provided URLs and directly passes them to `page.goto()` without validation, an attacker can inject malicious URLs. Examples include:
*   `file:///etc/passwd` (local file access)
*   URLs pointing to malicious websites (redirection, phishing, drive-by downloads)
*   Internal URLs (Server-Side Request Forgery - SSRF)
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to information disclosure, redirection to malicious sites, or SSRF vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.3. Inject Malicious JavaScript via `page.evaluate()` [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_3__inject_malicious_javascript_via__page_evaluate_____critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  `page.evaluate()` executes JavaScript code within the browser context. If user input is incorporated into the code string passed to `page.evaluate()` without proper sanitization, it becomes a direct JavaScript injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  This is a severe vulnerability. Attackers can:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser context (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
    *   Steal sensitive data from the page.
    *   Manipulate the page content and behavior.
    *   Potentially achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the browser process.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.4. Control Browser Actions via API to Trigger Server-Side Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_4__control_browser_actions_via_api_to_trigger_server-side_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers can manipulate browser actions through Puppeteer API calls to trigger vulnerabilities in the server-side application logic. This happens when server-side code processes data or events generated by Puppeteer actions without proper validation or security considerations.
*   **Impact:** Can trigger various server-side vulnerabilities, including:
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if Puppeteer actions cause the server to make requests to attacker-controlled or internal resources.
    *   Business logic flaws if specific Puppeteer-driven workflows exploit weaknesses in the application's logic.
    *   Data manipulation if Puppeteer actions can be used to bypass server-side validation or authorization checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Resource Exhaustion via Puppeteer [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__resource_exhaustion_via_puppeteer__high_risk_path_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by exhausting server resources through improper Puppeteer usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1. Launch Excessive Browser Instances [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1__launch_excessive_browser_instances__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  If the application doesn't limit the number of concurrent Puppeteer browser instances, an attacker can trigger the creation of a large number of instances, quickly overwhelming server resources (CPU, memory, connections).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), making the application unavailable or severely impacting performance.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.2. Memory Leaks in Puppeteer Usage [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_2__memory_leaks_in_puppeteer_usage__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Memory leaks in the application's Puppeteer code (e.g., failing to properly close pages or browsers) can lead to gradual resource depletion over time.
*   **Impact:** Gradual degradation of application performance, eventually leading to application crashes and Denial of Service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.3. CPU Exhaustion via Complex Browser Tasks [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_3__cpu_exhaustion_via_complex_browser_tasks__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Performing computationally intensive tasks within the browser using Puppeteer (e.g., complex JavaScript execution, rendering very large or complex pages) can lead to high CPU usage and resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown, and potential instability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Chromium/Browser Vulnerabilities via Puppeteer [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_chromiumbrowser_vulnerabilities_via_puppeteer__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node and high-risk path highlights the risks associated with vulnerabilities in the underlying Chromium browser that Puppeteer controls. Exploiting Chromium vulnerabilities can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Exploit Known Chromium Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__exploit_known_chromium_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This focuses on exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Chromium.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Target Outdated Chromium Version (Bundled with Puppeteer or System) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__target_outdated_chromium_version__bundled_with_puppeteer_or_system___critical_node___high_ris_6454ca8d.md)

**Attack Vector:** Using an outdated version of Chromium (either the bundled version with Puppeteer or a system-installed version) exposes the application to known Chromium vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed and potentially have readily available exploits.
*   **Impact:**  Chromium vulnerabilities can be severe and lead to:
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the browser process.
    *   Browser sandbox escape, potentially leading to system-level compromise.
    *   Data breaches by exploiting browser vulnerabilities to access sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Insecure Application Configuration with Puppeteer [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_insecure_application_configuration_with_puppeteer__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node and high-risk path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations in how the application is set up and how Puppeteer is integrated.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Running Puppeteer with Excessive Privileges [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__running_puppeteer_with_excessive_privileges__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Puppeteer Process Has Unnecessary System Access [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__puppeteer_process_has_unnecessary_system_access__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Running the Puppeteer process with unnecessarily high privileges (e.g., root or administrator) increases the potential damage if the process is compromised.
*   **Impact:** If an attacker gains control of a Puppeteer process running with excessive privileges, they can leverage those privileges to:
    *   Gain full control of the server.
    *   Access sensitive system resources and data.
    *   Install malware or establish persistence on the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Exposing Puppeteer Functionality to Untrusted Users (Indirectly) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__exposing_puppeteer_functionality_to_untrusted_users__indirectly___high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Application Allows User-Controlled Input to Influence Puppeteer Actions [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1__application_allows_user-controlled_input_to_influence_puppeteer_actions__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Even if the Puppeteer API is not directly exposed, if the application allows untrusted user input to indirectly control or influence Puppeteer's actions (e.g., by providing URLs, selectors, or other parameters used by Puppeteer), it can create vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the exposed functionality and the level of control user input has, this can lead to:
    *   Command injection vulnerabilities (as described in 1.2.1).
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    *   Data manipulation or unauthorized access to data.
    *   Abuse of application features for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Dependencies of Puppeteer [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_dependencies_of_puppeteer__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

This critical node and high-risk path highlights the risks associated with vulnerabilities in the dependencies of Puppeteer, including Node.js itself and other npm packages.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Vulnerabilities in Node.js Runtime [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__vulnerabilities_in_node_js_runtime__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Target Outdated Node.js Version [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__target_outdated_node_js_version__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Using an outdated version of Node.js exposes the application to known vulnerabilities in the Node.js runtime.
*   **Impact:** Node.js vulnerabilities can be severe and lead to:
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   Information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2. Vulnerabilities in other npm Packages used alongside Puppeteer [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2__vulnerabilities_in_other_npm_packages_used_alongside_puppeteer__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1. Exploit Vulnerable npm Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1__exploit_vulnerable_npm_dependencies__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Applications using Puppeteer often rely on other npm packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies, even if indirectly used by Puppeteer, can be exploited.
*   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the npm dependency, but can range from:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   Information disclosure.
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE).
