# Threat Model Analysis for puppeteer/puppeteer

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Puppeteer API Vulnerability](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_puppeteer_api_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Puppeteer library itself or its direct dependencies (within the Puppeteer package, not just Node.js or Chromium in general) to execute arbitrary code on the server running the Puppeteer application. This could be achieved by sending crafted input to the Puppeteer API or exploiting a flaw in the library's code execution paths.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, complete control over the server, data breach, service disruption, ability to perform any action on the server.
    *   **Puppeteer Component Affected:** Puppeteer library core, specifically API endpoints and internal modules handling input and execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Priority:** Immediately update Puppeteer to the latest version upon release of security patches.
        *   Proactively monitor Puppeteer's security advisories and release notes for reported vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data directly passed to Puppeteer API functions, especially if originating from external or untrusted sources.
        *   Consider employing a sandboxed environment or containerization to limit the blast radius of potential RCE exploits, restricting the attacker's access even if RCE is achieved within the Puppeteer process.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the Puppeteer integration points in your application.

## Threat: [Unintended Browser Actions due to Script Vulnerabilities](./threats/unintended_browser_actions_due_to_script_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or logic flaws within the *user-written Puppeteer scripts* to cause the controlled browser to perform unintended and malicious actions. This could involve manipulating target websites in harmful ways, exfiltrating sensitive data from websites the browser interacts with, or using the browser as a proxy for further attacks. The vulnerability lies in the script logic, but the execution and impact are directly facilitated by Puppeteer.
    *   **Impact:** Data leaks from target websites, unauthorized modifications on external websites, reputational damage, potential legal liabilities, use of browser for malicious activities (e.g., spam, DDoS).
    *   **Puppeteer Component Affected:** `page.evaluate()`, `page.goto()`, `page.click()`, and other Puppeteer API functions used within user-written scripts to control browser behavior. The vulnerability is in the *script*, but Puppeteer is the execution engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Priority:** Implement rigorous code review and security testing for all Puppeteer scripts before deployment.
        *   Apply secure coding principles when writing Puppeteer scripts, including proper input validation, output encoding, and error handling within the script logic.
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege in script design: only grant the browser the necessary permissions and actions required for the intended task. Avoid overly permissive scripts.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools to scan Puppeteer scripts for potential vulnerabilities and insecure coding patterns.
        *   Implement thorough testing, including penetration testing, of the application's Puppeteer-driven functionalities to identify and remediate script-level vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Browser Context](./threats/data_leakage_through_browser_context.md)

*   **Description:**  Puppeteer interacts with and manages the browser context, including cookies, local storage, session storage, and in-memory data within the browser. If not handled securely in Puppeteer scripts, sensitive data accessed or generated within this browser context can be inadvertently leaked or exposed. This could occur through insecure logging, improper data handling in scripts, or failure to clear sensitive data from the browser context after use.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, leakage of application secrets or internal information accessed by the browser, privacy violations, reputational damage, potential compliance breaches.
    *   **Puppeteer Component Affected:** Browser context management features, `page.cookies()`, `page.localStorage()`, `page.sessionStorage()`, `browserContext` API, and script logic handling data within the browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Priority:** Implement strict and secure browser context management within Puppeteer scripts.
        *   **Crucial:** Explicitly clear sensitive browser data (cookies, local storage, session storage) after each Puppeteer task, especially when handling sensitive information, using functions like `browserContext.clearCookies()` and JavaScript execution within `page.evaluate()` to clear storage.
        *   Minimize the storage of sensitive data within the browser context whenever possible. Consider alternative secure storage mechanisms outside the browser if feasible.
        *   Thoroughly review and audit Puppeteer scripts to ensure they are not unintentionally logging, persisting, or exposing sensitive data from the browser context.
        *   Implement data masking or anonymization techniques for sensitive data processed by Puppeteer within the browser to reduce the impact of potential leaks.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Browser Navigation](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_browser_navigation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages Puppeteer's `page.goto()` or similar navigation functions, providing maliciously crafted URLs (often through user-controlled input that is not properly validated). This forces the Puppeteer-controlled browser to make requests to unintended internal resources or external services. This can bypass firewalls, access internal APIs, or probe internal network infrastructure, leading to information disclosure or further exploitation. The vulnerability is in the *application's URL handling* when using Puppeteer's navigation, but Puppeteer is the tool that executes the SSRF.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, data exfiltration from internal systems, potential exploitation of internal services and APIs, information disclosure about internal infrastructure, security policy bypass.
    *   **Puppeteer Component Affected:** `page.goto()`, `page.gotoAndWaitForNavigation()`, and other navigation-related API functions that accept URLs as input. The vulnerability is in the *usage* of these functions with untrusted URLs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Priority:** Implement extremely strict validation and sanitization for *all* URLs used in Puppeteer's navigation functions (`page.goto()`, etc.), especially if any part of the URL is derived from user input or external sources.
        *   **Strongly Recommended:** Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns for browser navigation. Only permit navigation to explicitly approved and safe destinations.
        *   Employ network segmentation to restrict the browser instance's network access, limiting its ability to reach internal resources even if an SSRF vulnerability is present.
        *   Consider using a proxy server to mediate and monitor all outbound requests originating from Puppeteer browser instances, providing an additional layer of control and logging for navigation attempts.
