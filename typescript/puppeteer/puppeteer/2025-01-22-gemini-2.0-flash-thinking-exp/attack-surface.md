# Attack Surface Analysis for puppeteer/puppeteer

## Attack Surface: [Code Execution via `evaluate` and related APIs](./attack_surfaces/code_execution_via__evaluate__and_related_apis.md)

### 1. Code Execution via `evaluate` and related APIs

*   **Description:**  **Critical Risk:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser context directly controlled by Puppeteer, stemming from the use of `evaluate`, `evaluateHandle`, and similar APIs.
*   **How Puppeteer Contributes:** Puppeteer's core functionality allows injecting and executing JavaScript code via APIs like `page.evaluate()`.  This becomes a critical vulnerability when untrusted input is used to construct the JavaScript code, directly enabled by Puppeteer's design.
*   **Example:** An application uses `page.evaluate()` to process user-provided website content. If an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the user-provided content, Puppeteer will execute this code within the controlled browser context. This could lead to data exfiltration from the application's environment, session hijacking within the Puppeteer browser, or further exploitation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Remote Code Execution within the Puppeteer controlled browser environment.
    *   **Critical:** Potential for data exfiltration of sensitive information processed by Puppeteer.
    *   **High:** Session hijacking and unauthorized actions within the controlled browser context.
    *   **High:** Indirect Server-Side Code Execution if malicious JavaScript interacts with vulnerable backend APIs.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Critical:** **Never** construct JavaScript code for `evaluate` and related APIs from untrusted sources (user input, external data).
    *   **High:**  If dynamic JavaScript execution is absolutely necessary, implement extremely rigorous input sanitization and validation. Consider using sandboxing techniques within the `evaluate` context if feasible.
    *   **High:**  Prefer Puppeteer APIs that do not involve arbitrary code execution if the task can be achieved through selectors and property access.
    *   **High:** Conduct thorough code reviews of all usages of `evaluate` and related APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal Functions via `exposeFunction`](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_functions_via__exposefunction_.md)

### 2. Exposure of Internal Functions via `exposeFunction`

*   **Description:** **High Risk:**  Unintentionally exposing sensitive Node.js functions to the browser's JavaScript context through Puppeteer's `page.exposeFunction()` API, leading to potential abuse from malicious scripts within the browser.
*   **How Puppeteer Contributes:** `exposeFunction` directly creates a bridge between the Node.js server-side environment and the browser context managed by Puppeteer. This feature, if misused, directly introduces the risk of exposing server-side functionalities to potentially compromised browser environments.
*   **Example:** An application uses `page.exposeFunction('deleteUser', serverSideDeleteUserFunction)`. If `serverSideDeleteUserFunction` lacks proper authorization checks, a malicious script injected into the browser context (e.g., via a compromised website scraped by Puppeteer) could call `deleteUser()` with arbitrary user IDs, leading to unauthorized data deletion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Unauthorized access and manipulation of server-side resources and data via exposed functions.
    *   **High:** Bypass of server-side security controls and access restrictions through exposed functionalities.
    *   **High:** Potential for escalation of privileges and further server-side exploitation depending on the capabilities of the exposed functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Critical:** **Minimize the use of `exposeFunction`**.  Re-evaluate if the desired browser-side functionality can be achieved without exposing server-side functions.
    *   **High:** Implement **strict authentication and authorization** checks within every exposed Node.js function to verify the legitimacy of browser-side requests.
    *   **High:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs received by exposed functions from the browser context to prevent injection attacks and unexpected behavior.
    *   **High:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege: expose functions with the minimal necessary permissions and capabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Puppeteer/Chromium and Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/outdated_puppeteerchromium_and_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

### 3. Outdated Puppeteer/Chromium and Dependency Vulnerabilities

*   **Description:** **Critical Risk:** Exploitation of known security vulnerabilities present in outdated versions of Puppeteer itself, the bundled Chromium browser, or underlying Node.js dependencies.
*   **How Puppeteer Contributes:** Puppeteer directly depends on Chromium and Node.js.  Using outdated versions directly inherits the vulnerabilities present in these components, making applications using Puppeteer susceptible to known exploits.
*   **Example:** A critical Remote Code Execution vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of Chromium. If an application uses an outdated version of Puppeteer that bundles this vulnerable Chromium, an attacker could craft malicious web content that, when processed by Puppeteer, exploits this Chromium vulnerability to gain control of the server or the Puppeteer environment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or within the Puppeteer environment.
    *   **Critical:** Full system compromise and control.
    *   **Critical:** Data breaches, information disclosure, and complete loss of confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Critical:** **Maintain a rigorous update schedule for Puppeteer.** Regularly update Puppeteer to the latest stable version to incorporate security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Critical:** Ensure the bundled Chromium or system-installed Chrome/Chromium used by Puppeteer is always up-to-date.
    *   **High:** Implement automated dependency management and vulnerability scanning to proactively identify and update outdated Node.js dependencies.
    *   **High:** Subscribe to security advisories for Puppeteer, Chromium, and Node.js to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and necessary updates.
