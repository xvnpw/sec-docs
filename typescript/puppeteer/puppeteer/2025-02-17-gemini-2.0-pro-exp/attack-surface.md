# Attack Surface Analysis for puppeteer/puppeteer

## Attack Surface: [Browser-Based Exploits (Zero-Days & Known Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/browser-based_exploits__zero-days_&_known_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the underlying Chromium/Chrome browser engine that Puppeteer uses. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system.
*   **How Puppeteer Contributes:** Puppeteer provides a programmatic interface to control the browser, making it easier for attackers to trigger vulnerable code paths and exploit vulnerabilities. It automates the interaction that would normally be required by a user.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious webpage that exploits a zero-day vulnerability in Chromium's JavaScript engine. When Puppeteer visits this page, the exploit triggers, giving the attacker control of the Puppeteer process.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker could gain access to sensitive data, install malware, or use the compromised system for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rapid Patching:** Keep Puppeteer and its bundled Chromium updated to the *absolute latest* version. Automate this process.
    *   **System-Level Browser:** Consider using `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to point to a system-managed Chrome/Chromium (if feasible and thoroughly tested).
    *   **Mandatory Sandboxing:** Run Puppeteer within a *strictly configured* sandbox (Docker, VM, etc.) with minimal privileges and network access. This is *non-negotiable*.
    *   **Least Privilege:** The Puppeteer process itself should run with the *lowest possible* operating system privileges. Never run as root/administrator.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the network where Puppeteer operates. Limit its ability to communicate with other sensitive systems.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Website Interaction (Client-Side Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_website_interaction__client-side_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious website visited by Puppeteer attempts to exploit browser vulnerabilities or leverage Puppeteer's API to gain control.
*   **How Puppeteer Contributes:** Puppeteer is designed to interact with websites, making it a direct conduit for attacks originating from malicious web content.
*   **Example:** A Puppeteer script is instructed to visit a URL controlled by an attacker. The website contains JavaScript that attempts to exploit a known vulnerability in an older version of Chromium, or it tries to trick Puppeteer into downloading a malicious file.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the Puppeteer process and potentially the host system, depending on the vulnerability and the level of sandboxing. Data theft, malware installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Whitelisting:** *Never* allow Puppeteer to visit arbitrary URLs. Use a strict whitelist of trusted domains.
    *   **Input Validation (URLs):** Rigorously validate any user-supplied input that might influence the URLs visited by Puppeteer.
    *   **Sandboxing:** (As above) is paramount.
    *   **Disable JavaScript (If Possible):** If your use case allows, disable JavaScript execution in Puppeteer (`page.setJavaScriptEnabled(false)`).
    *   **Request Interception & Blocking:** Use Puppeteer's request interception to block requests to known malicious domains or resources.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If you control the target website, use a strict CSP. (But this is *not* a primary defense against browser exploits.)

## Attack Surface: [`evaluate()` and `evaluateHandle()` Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/_evaluate____and__evaluatehandle____code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious JavaScript code into the browser context via Puppeteer's `evaluate()` or `evaluateHandle()` functions.
*   **How Puppeteer Contributes:** These functions are *designed* to execute JavaScript within the browser, providing a direct attack vector if input is not properly sanitized.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides input that is directly embedded into a string passed to `page.evaluate()`. This input contains malicious JavaScript that steals cookies or exfiltrates data.
    ```javascript
    // VULNERABLE:
    await page.evaluate(`console.log("${attackerControlledInput}")`);
    ```
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the browser context. The attacker can steal data, manipulate the DOM, or potentially leverage further browser vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Embed Untrusted Input:** *Never* directly embed user-supplied data into the code string passed to `evaluate()` or `evaluateHandle()`.
    *   **Use Argument Passing:** Pass data as *arguments* to the evaluated function, *not* as part of the code string.
        ```javascript
        // SAFER:
        await page.evaluate((arg) => { console.log(arg); }, attackerControlledInput);
        ```
    *   **Context Isolation:** Explore using `executionContext` for further isolation.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** While argument passing is preferred, sanitize any input *before* passing it as an argument, as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [File System Access (Downloads/Uploads)](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access__downloadsuploads_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of Puppeteer's ability to download or upload files to gain unauthorized file system access.
*   **How Puppeteer Contributes:** Puppeteer provides APIs for interacting with downloads and uploads, creating a potential pathway for malicious files to enter or leave the system.
*   **Example:** A malicious website tricks Puppeteer into downloading a malware executable, which is then executed on the host system (if sandboxing is inadequate). Or, an attacker influences the upload process to send sensitive files to a remote server.
*   **Impact:** Malware infection, data exfiltration, potential system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dedicated Download Directory:** Specify a *dedicated, isolated, and sandboxed* directory for downloads.
    *   **File Type Restrictions:** Limit the types of files that can be downloaded/uploaded.
    *   **Malware Scanning:** Scan *all* downloaded files with a reputable malware scanner *before* they are used.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Ensure the download directory is *within* the sandbox.
    *   **Input Validation (Uploads):** Strictly validate the content and metadata of uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Network Request Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/network_request_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages Puppeteer's request interception capabilities to redirect requests, inject malicious data, or exfiltrate sensitive information.
*   **How Puppeteer Contributes:** Puppeteer's `page.setRequestInterception()` provides a powerful mechanism for controlling network traffic, which can be misused.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a Puppeteer script and uses `setRequestInterception()` to redirect requests to a phishing site or to inject malicious JavaScript into responses.
*   **Impact:** Data theft, man-in-the-middle attacks, potential compromise of other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Interception:** Use `page.setRequestInterception()` only when *absolutely necessary*.
    *   **Strict Validation:** Thoroughly validate *any* modifications made to requests or responses during interception.
    *   **Domain Whitelisting:** Only allow requests to a predefined list of trusted domains.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all intercepted requests and modifications for security analysis.
