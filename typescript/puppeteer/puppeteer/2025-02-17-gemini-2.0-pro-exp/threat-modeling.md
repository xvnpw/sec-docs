# Threat Model Analysis for puppeteer/puppeteer

## Threat: [Chromium Zero-Day Exploitation](./threats/chromium_zero-day_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a previously unknown vulnerability (zero-day) in the Chromium browser engine used by Puppeteer. The attacker crafts a malicious webpage or payload that, when loaded by Puppeteer, triggers the vulnerability, allowing arbitrary code execution on the host system.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker could gain full control over the server running Puppeteer, potentially accessing sensitive data, installing malware, or using the server for further attacks.
*   **Affected Puppeteer Component:** The underlying Chromium browser instance (entire engine). All Puppeteer functions that interact with web content are potentially vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rapid Patching:** Monitor security advisories for Chromium and Puppeteer *very* closely. Apply updates immediately upon release. Automate the update process if possible.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run Puppeteer within a tightly controlled, isolated environment (e.g., Docker container with minimal privileges, a dedicated VM with restricted network access). This limits the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict resource limits (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, file system access) on the Puppeteer process. This can prevent some exploits from succeeding or limit their impact.
    *   **Minimal Chromium Build:** If feasible, use a custom, security-hardened Chromium build with unnecessary features disabled.

## Threat: [Malicious Website Interaction - Drive-by Download (or other browser-based exploits)](./threats/malicious_website_interaction_-_drive-by_download__or_other_browser-based_exploits_.md)

*   **Description:** Puppeteer is used to visit an attacker-controlled website. The website contains malicious JavaScript or exploits a *browser vulnerability* (even if not a zero-day) to trigger an automatic download of malware, execute arbitrary code, or otherwise compromise the system running Puppeteer. This relies on Puppeteer loading and rendering the malicious content.
*   **Impact:** Malware infection of the server. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, or the server being used in a botnet.
*   **Affected Puppeteer Component:** `page.goto()`, `page.setContent()`, any function that loads or interacts with web content. The underlying Chromium rendering engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Website Whitelisting:** Strictly limit the websites Puppeteer is allowed to visit to a pre-approved whitelist. *Never* allow Puppeteer to browse arbitrary URLs provided by users.
    *   **Disable JavaScript (When Possible):** If JavaScript execution is not strictly required for the task, disable it using `page.setJavaScriptEnabled(false)`. This is a *very* effective mitigation against many web-based attacks.
    *   **Resource Blocking:** Use `page.setRequestInterception(true)` and selectively block requests for potentially dangerous resources (e.g., executable files, scripts from untrusted domains).
    *   **Sandboxing:** (As described above).
    *   **Input Validation:** If data from the website *must* be used, rigorously validate and sanitize it before processing. This is a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Browser Instance Creation - Denial of Service](./threats/uncontrolled_browser_instance_creation_-_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application logic *that controls Puppeteer* or sends a flood of requests to trigger the creation of a large number of Puppeteer browser instances. This overwhelms server resources (CPU, memory, network), leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability is in *how* the application uses Puppeteer.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability. Legitimate users are unable to access the service.
*   **Affected Puppeteer Component:** `puppeteer.launch()`, `browser.newPage()`. The overall management of browser instances *within the application*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Instance Limits:** Implement a strict limit on the maximum number of concurrent Puppeteer instances.
    *   **Connection Pooling:** Use a connection pool or queue to manage browser instances efficiently, reusing existing instances whenever possible.
    *   **Timeouts:** Set aggressive timeouts for browser launch and page operations. Terminate unresponsive instances.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or functions *that trigger Puppeteer actions*.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitor server resource usage and alert on unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Screenshot/Content Scraping (Application Misuse)](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_screenshotcontent_scraping__application_misuse_.md)

*   **Description:** The application *itself* uses Puppeteer to access internal applications or websites containing sensitive data.  Due to a flaw in the *application's logic or authorization*, an attacker can cause Puppeteer to capture screenshots (`page.screenshot()`) or scrape content (`page.content()`, `page.evaluate()`) from areas they should not have access to, exfiltrating the data. This is a misuse of Puppeteer *by the application*.
*   **Impact:** Data breach. Exposure of confidential information.
*   **Affected Puppeteer Component:** `page.screenshot()`, `page.content()`, `page.evaluate()`, `page.$$eval()`, `page.$eval()`, and any other functions used to extract data from the page.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement strong authentication and authorization *within the application* for all internal resources accessed *via* Puppeteer. Use the principle of least privilege.
    *   **URL Whitelisting:** Only allow Puppeteer to access a pre-approved list of internal URLs, *enforced by the application*.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all Puppeteer actions, including URLs visited, data accessed, and screenshots taken. Regularly review these logs.
    *   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Consider DLP tools.
    *   **Input Sanitization (within the application):** If user input influences what data is accessed *by Puppeteer*, sanitize that input thoroughly *within the application*.

## Threat: [Unsafe JavaScript Evaluation - Code Injection (Application Misuse)](./threats/unsafe_javascript_evaluation_-_code_injection__application_misuse_.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows users to provide input that is then *unsafely* used within a `page.evaluate()` call in Puppeteer. An attacker provides malicious JavaScript code that is executed within the browser context, allowing them to manipulate the page, access data, or potentially exploit browser vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is in *how the application uses* `page.evaluate()`.
*   **Impact:** Varies; could range from minor UI manipulation to data theft or (with a browser vulnerability) system compromise.
*   **Affected Puppeteer Component:** `page.evaluate()`, `page.evaluateOnNewDocument()`, `page.$$eval()`, `page.$eval()`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User Input in `evaluate()`:** The best mitigation is to *completely avoid* using user-provided input directly within `page.evaluate()`.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** If user input *must* be used, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization. Use a whitelist approach. *Never* trust user input.
    *   **Context Isolation:** If possible, use a separate, sandboxed JavaScript environment.
