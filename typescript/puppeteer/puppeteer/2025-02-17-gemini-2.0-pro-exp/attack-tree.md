## Attack Tree Path: [1. SSRF via Navigation](./attack_tree_paths/1__ssrf_via_navigation.md)

*   **Description:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) occurs when an attacker can control the URLs that the server-side application (in this case, the application using Puppeteer) makes requests to. Puppeteer's navigation functions (like `page.goto()`) are the primary mechanism for this attack.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Access Internal Resources](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__access_internal_resources.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses Puppeteer to access resources that are only accessible from within the internal network (e.g., internal APIs, databases, metadata services). These resources are often less protected than publicly exposed services.
*   **Example:**  An attacker might provide a URL like `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (an AWS metadata service endpoint) to Puppeteer, hoping to retrieve sensitive information about the server's configuration.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Fingerprint Internal Services](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__fingerprint_internal_services.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses Puppeteer to probe internal network locations and ports to identify running services and their versions. This information can be used to plan further attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker might try various internal IP addresses and ports (e.g., `http://10.0.0.1:8080`, `http://10.0.0.2:27017`) to see if any services respond, revealing their presence and potentially their software versions.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Unsafe Target Selection](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_unsafe_target_selection.md)

*   **Description:** This is a configuration/usage vulnerability where the application allows user-supplied input to directly or indirectly control the URLs or resources that Puppeteer interacts with.
    * **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Load Arbitrary URLs [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__load_arbitrary_urls__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical vulnerability. If the application allows an attacker to specify the URL that Puppeteer loads *without proper validation*, the attacker can direct it to any location, including malicious websites or internal resources. This opens the door to SSRF, XSS, and a wide range of other attacks.
*   **Example:** If the application has a feature like "Generate PDF from URL," and the URL is taken directly from user input without sanitization, an attacker could provide `file:///etc/passwd` (to read a system file) or `http://internal-api.example.com/admin` (to access an internal API).
*   **Likelihood:** High to Very High
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Node.js Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__node_js_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Node.js runtime itself can be exploited to compromise the server.  These vulnerabilities are independent of Puppeteer but affect the environment in which Puppeteer runs.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Exploit Known Node.js Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1__exploit_known_node_js_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in Node.js (e.g., buffer overflows, denial-of-service, remote code execution) to gain control of the server.  The specific attack depends on the vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  An attacker might exploit a known vulnerability in a specific version of Node.js to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to data exfiltration or complete system takeover.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
