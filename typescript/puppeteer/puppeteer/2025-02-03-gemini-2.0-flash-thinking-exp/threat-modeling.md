# Threat Model Analysis for puppeteer/puppeteer

## Threat: [Compromised Puppeteer Script or Dependencies](./threats/compromised_puppeteer_script_or_dependencies.md)

#### Description:
If the Node.js application code using Puppeteer or its dependencies is compromised (e.g., via supply chain attack, vulnerable dependency), an attacker can inject malicious code that executes when the Puppeteer script runs. This could allow the attacker to control the Puppeteer instance, access server resources, or perform other malicious actions.

#### Impact:
Full compromise of the Puppeteer instance and potentially the server, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and further attacks.

#### Puppeteer Component Affected:
Puppeteer module, Node.js application code, project dependencies.

#### Risk Severity:
Critical

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security tools.
*   Dependency Updates: Keep Puppeteer and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Code Review: Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and prevent vulnerabilities in the application code that uses Puppeteer.
*   Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities in the application.
*   Supply Chain Security: Implement measures to secure the software supply chain and verify the integrity of dependencies.

## Threat: [Unsanitized Input in `page.evaluate()`](./threats/unsanitized_input_in__page_evaluate___.md)

#### Description:
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `page.evaluate()` function if user-provided or external data is not properly sanitized before being passed as arguments. This code will be executed within the Chromium browser context controlled by Puppeteer. The attacker might execute arbitrary JavaScript, steal cookies, manipulate the DOM, or exfiltrate data from the page.

#### Impact:
Arbitrary code execution within the browser context can lead to data breaches, session hijacking, and further exploitation of the application or server.

#### Puppeteer Component Affected:
`page.evaluate()`, `page.addScriptTag()`, `page.addStyleTag()`, and similar functions that execute JavaScript in the browser context.

#### Risk Severity:
High

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   Input Sanitization:  Never directly pass unsanitized user input or external data into `page.evaluate()` or similar functions.
*   Serialization/Deserialization: Use structured data serialization (e.g., JSON.stringify/parse) to pass data safely between Node.js and the browser context.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP in pages loaded by Puppeteer to restrict inline scripts and external resources, limiting the impact of injected code.
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Run Puppeteer with minimal necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Puppeteer Actions](./threats/data_leakage_through_puppeteer_actions.md)

#### Description:
Puppeteer is used to extract data from web pages. If not handled carefully, sensitive data extracted by Puppeteer (screenshots, scraped content, network requests) can be unintentionally logged, stored insecurely, or exposed. An attacker might gain access to these logs or storage locations to steal sensitive information.

#### Impact:
Exposure of sensitive data (personal information, API keys, internal application details) leading to privacy violations, compliance breaches, and potential further attacks.

#### Puppeteer Component Affected:
`page.screenshot()`, `page.content()`, `page.evaluate()`, `page.on('response')`, and data handling logic in the application.

#### Risk Severity:
High

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   Minimize Data Extraction: Extract only the necessary data with Puppeteer. Avoid extracting sensitive information if not required.
*   Secure Data Storage: Implement strict access control and encryption for any data extracted and stored by Puppeteer.
*   Avoid Plain Text Logging: Do not log sensitive data in plain text. Use secure logging practices.
*   Regular Audits: Regularly review Puppeteer scripts and data handling logic to ensure no inadvertent data leakage.
*   Data Retention Policies: Implement data retention policies to remove sensitive data when it is no longer needed.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Puppeteer Navigation](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_puppeteer_navigation.md)

#### Description:
If the application uses Puppeteer to navigate to URLs based on user input or external data without proper validation, an attacker can manipulate the URL to make Puppeteer access internal resources or services from the server-side. The attacker might access internal APIs, read internal files, or interact with internal systems.

#### Impact:
Bypassing firewalls, accessing internal services, reading internal files, and potentially executing commands on internal systems.

#### Puppeteer Component Affected:
`page.goto()`, `page.url()`, navigation functions.

#### Risk Severity:
High

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   URL Validation and Sanitization: Strictly validate and sanitize all URLs before using them with `page.goto()` or similar navigation functions.
*   URL Whitelisting: Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns for Puppeteer navigation.
*   Network Isolation: Consider network isolation for the Puppeteer process to limit its access to internal networks.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Puppeteer Instances Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/uncontrolled_puppeteer_instances_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

#### Description:
Running many Puppeteer instances concurrently or interacting with resource-intensive web pages without proper management can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, network). An attacker might intentionally trigger excessive Puppeteer usage to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

#### Impact:
Application slowdown, service unavailability, and potential server crashes due to resource exhaustion.

#### Puppeteer Component Affected:
Puppeteer process management, browser instances.

#### Risk Severity:
High

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   Resource Limits and Quotas: Implement resource limits and quotas for Puppeteer instances (e.g., using process managers, containerization, resource limits in cloud environments).
*   Performance Optimization: Optimize Puppeteer scripts for performance to minimize resource consumption.
*   Rate Limiting and Throttling: Implement rate limiting and throttling for Puppeteer operations to prevent abuse.
*   Resource Monitoring and Alerts: Monitor server resource usage and implement alerts for excessive Puppeteer activity.
*   Puppeteer Service/Pool: Use a dedicated Puppeteer service or pool to manage and isolate Puppeteer instances.

## Threat: [Running Puppeteer with Excessive Privileges](./threats/running_puppeteer_with_excessive_privileges.md)

#### Description:
Running Puppeteer processes with unnecessarily high privileges (e.g., as root) increases the impact of a compromise. If a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker gains elevated privileges on the server.

#### Impact:
Increased risk of system-wide compromise and privilege escalation if Puppeteer or the application is compromised.

#### Puppeteer Component Affected:
Puppeteer process execution environment, operating system permissions.

#### Risk Severity:
High

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Run Puppeteer processes with the least necessary privileges.
*   Dedicated User Accounts: Use dedicated user accounts with restricted permissions for Puppeteer processes.
*   Process Isolation/Sandboxing: Implement process isolation and sandboxing for Puppeteer instances.

## Threat: [Exposing Puppeteer Debugging Interfaces or Ports](./threats/exposing_puppeteer_debugging_interfaces_or_ports.md)

#### Description:
Puppeteer can expose debugging interfaces or remote debugging ports. If these are unintentionally exposed to the network, attackers can connect and gain control over the Puppeteer instance or browser context.

#### Impact:
Unauthorized access to Puppeteer control, potential code execution within the browser context, and information disclosure.

#### Puppeteer Component Affected:
Chromium browser debugging interface, Puppeteer configuration.

#### Risk Severity:
High

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   Network Isolation: Ensure debugging interfaces and remote debugging ports are not exposed to the public network.
*   Disable Debugging in Production: Disable debugging features in production environments unless absolutely necessary and properly secured.
*   Firewall and Access Control: Use network firewalls and access control lists to restrict access to debugging ports if debugging is required in non-production environments.
