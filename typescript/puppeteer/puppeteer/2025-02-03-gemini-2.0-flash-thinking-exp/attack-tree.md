```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Puppeteer API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_puppeteer_api_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   This is a critical area because vulnerabilities within the Puppeteer library itself could have widespread impact on all applications using it.
*   **Focus:** Regularly update Puppeteer and monitor security advisories.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Abuse Puppeteer API Misuse in Application Code [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__abuse_puppeteer_api_misuse_in_application_code__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   This is a high-risk path because developers can easily misuse the Puppeteer API, leading to vulnerabilities even if Puppeteer itself is secure.
*   **Focus:** Secure coding practices, input validation, and careful review of Puppeteer integration code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Command Injection via Puppeteer API [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__command_injection_via_puppeteer_api__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   This is a critical node and high-risk path because it directly leads to command injection vulnerabilities through various Puppeteer API functions.
*   **Focus:** Strict input validation and sanitization for all inputs used with Puppeteer APIs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Inject Malicious URLs into `page.goto()` [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__inject_malicious_urls_into__page_goto_____high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If user-supplied URLs are directly passed to `page.goto()` without validation, attackers can inject malicious URLs.
*   **Example:** `page.goto('user_input_url')` where `user_input_url` is `file:///etc/passwd` (for local file access) or a link to a malicious website (for redirection or SSRF).
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (local file access), redirection to phishing sites, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Mitigation:** Sanitize and validate URLs. Use URL parsing libraries and allowlists of permitted domains.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.3. Inject Malicious JavaScript via `page.evaluate()` [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_3__inject_malicious_javascript_via__page_evaluate_____critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If user input is incorporated into the JavaScript code string passed to `page.evaluate()` without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript.
*   **Example:** `page.evaluate('let userInput = "' + user_input + '"; console.log(userInput);')` where `user_input` is `"; maliciousCode(); //`.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within the browser context controlled by Puppeteer, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or further exploitation. In some scenarios, it could even be leveraged for Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the browser process.
*   **Mitigation:** Avoid using `page.evaluate()` with unsanitized user input. If necessary, use sandboxed environments or very strict input validation. Consider alternative approaches to dynamic code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.4. Control Browser Actions via API to Trigger Server-Side Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_4__control_browser_actions_via_api_to_trigger_server-side_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can manipulate browser actions through Puppeteer API calls to trigger vulnerabilities in the server-side application logic that processes data or events generated by Puppeteer.
*   **Example:**  Crafting specific browser interactions (clicks, form submissions) via Puppeteer to exploit race conditions, business logic flaws, or API vulnerabilities on the server.
*   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), business logic bypass, data manipulation, or triggering other server-side vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test server-side logic triggered by Puppeteer actions. Implement rate limiting, input validation, and proper authorization on server endpoints.

*   **Example:** Repeatedly calling an application endpoint that spawns a new browser for each request.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to server resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, connections).
*   **Mitigation:** Implement resource limits for Puppeteer processes. Use browser pools or queueing mechanisms to control concurrent browser instances.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.2. Memory Leaks in Puppeteer Usage [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_2__memory_leaks_in_puppeteer_usage__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Memory leaks in the application's Puppeteer code (e.g., not closing pages or browsers) can lead to gradual resource depletion.
*   **Example:**  Repeatedly creating pages and browsers without properly closing them, leading to memory accumulation over time.
*   **Impact:** Gradual performance degradation, eventual application crash and Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Mitigation:** Implement proper browser and page disposal using `browser.close()` and `page.close()` in `finally` blocks or resource management patterns. Regularly monitor memory usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.3. CPU Exhaustion via Complex Browser Tasks [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_3__cpu_exhaustion_via_complex_browser_tasks__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Performing computationally intensive tasks within the browser using Puppeteer can lead to CPU exhaustion.
*   **Example:**  Using Puppeteer to render very complex web pages, execute heavy JavaScript, or perform extensive scraping operations without optimization.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to CPU overload, application slowdown.
*   **Mitigation:** Optimize Puppeteer scripts for performance. Limit the complexity of browser tasks. Implement timeouts and resource limits for CPU usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Chromium/Browser Vulnerabilities via Puppeteer [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_chromiumbrowser_vulnerabilities_via_puppeteer__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)
