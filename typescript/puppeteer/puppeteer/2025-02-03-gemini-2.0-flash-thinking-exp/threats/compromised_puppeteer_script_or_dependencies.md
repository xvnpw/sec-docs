#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Exploitation Methods

An attacker can compromise the Puppeteer script or its dependencies through several attack vectors:

*   **Supply Chain Attacks:**
    *   **Compromised Dependency Packages:** Attackers can inject malicious code into popular npm packages that Puppeteer or the application depends on. This code gets installed when developers install or update dependencies.
    *   **Typosquatting:**  Attackers create packages with names similar to legitimate dependencies, hoping developers will mistakenly install the malicious package.
    *   **Compromised Package Registry:** In a more sophisticated attack, the npm registry itself could be compromised, allowing attackers to modify legitimate packages.

*   **Vulnerable Dependencies:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Puppeteer and its dependencies may contain known vulnerabilities (e.g., in underlying libraries like Chromium, Node.js modules). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they are not patched in a timely manner.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting unknown vulnerabilities in Puppeteer or its dependencies before patches are available.

*   **Compromised Development Environment:**
    *   **Malware on Developer Machines:**  If a developer's machine is infected with malware, attackers could inject malicious code into the application codebase or development tools.
    *   **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:**  Attackers could compromise the CI/CD pipeline to inject malicious code during the build or deployment process.

*   **Insider Threats:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection:**  A disgruntled or compromised insider with access to the codebase could directly inject malicious code into the Puppeteer script or related files.

*   **Direct Code Modification (Less Likely in Production):**
    *   In less secure environments or during development, attackers might gain unauthorized access to the server and directly modify the Puppeteer script or related files.

**Exploitation Methods:**

Once a malicious script or dependency is in place, the attacker can leverage Puppeteer's capabilities to perform various malicious actions:

*   **Browser Manipulation:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Use Puppeteer to navigate to sensitive pages, extract data (e.g., user credentials, personal information, financial data) from the DOM, and send it to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Form Submission:**  Automate form submissions to perform actions on behalf of users, potentially leading to unauthorized transactions or account manipulation.
    *   **Screenshotting/Recording:** Capture screenshots or recordings of sensitive pages to steal information or monitor user activity.
    *   **Bypassing Security Controls:**  Use Puppeteer to bypass client-side security controls like CAPTCHAs or rate limiting.

*   **Server-Side Actions:**
    *   **Access Server Resources:**  If the compromised Puppeteer script has access to server-side resources (e.g., databases, file system, internal APIs), the attacker can leverage this access to perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Command Execution:**  In some scenarios, vulnerabilities in the application or Puppeteer itself might allow for arbitrary command execution on the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overload server resources by launching numerous Puppeteer instances or performing resource-intensive operations.
