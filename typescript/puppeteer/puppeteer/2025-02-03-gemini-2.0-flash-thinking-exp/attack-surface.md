# Attack Surface Analysis for puppeteer/puppeteer

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Puppeteer API Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unintended_puppeteer_api_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Parts of the Puppeteer API or control over the browser instance are exposed to untrusted entities (users, networks).
*   **Puppeteer Contribution:** Puppeteer provides a powerful API to control a browser. If this API is not properly secured and accessible from outside the intended scope, it becomes a direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** A web application exposes an endpoint `/puppeteer-control` without authentication, allowing anyone to send commands directly to the Puppeteer instance running on the server. An attacker could use this to navigate to internal URLs, extract data, or cause a DoS.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the browser, data exfiltration, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict API Access:**  Never expose the raw Puppeteer API directly to the internet or untrusted networks.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for any API endpoints that interact with Puppeteer.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users or services interacting with the Puppeteer API.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs to API endpoints that control Puppeteer actions to prevent command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Browser Instance Vulnerabilities (Chromium Exploits)](./attack_surfaces/browser_instance_vulnerabilities__chromium_exploits_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the underlying Chromium browser that Puppeteer controls.
*   **Puppeteer Contribution:** Puppeteer relies on Chromium. If the Chromium version used by Puppeteer is outdated or vulnerable, it directly inherits those vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific Chromium version allows for remote code execution. An attacker crafts a malicious webpage that exploits this vulnerability. When Puppeteer navigates to this page (e.g., for rendering or scraping), the attacker gains control of the browser process and potentially the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, browser sandbox escape, data exfiltration, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Puppeteer Updated:** Regularly update Puppeteer to the latest version, which typically includes the latest stable Chromium version with security patches.
    *   **Monitor Chromium Security Advisories:** Stay informed about Chromium security advisories and update Puppeteer promptly when critical vulnerabilities are announced.
    *   **Isolate Puppeteer Environment:** Run Puppeteer in a sandboxed or isolated environment (e.g., containers, VMs) to limit the impact of a browser compromise.

## Attack Surface: [HTML/JavaScript Injection via Puppeteer Actions](./attack_surfaces/htmljavascript_injection_via_puppeteer_actions.md)

*   **Description:**  Injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into Puppeteer actions (e.g., `page.setContent`, `page.evaluate`, `page.type`) due to improper input sanitization.
*   **Puppeteer Contribution:** Puppeteer provides APIs that allow setting page content and executing JavaScript. If user-provided data is directly used in these APIs without sanitization, it directly creates an injection vulnerability within the Puppeteer controlled browser context.
*   **Example:** A user provides input intended to be displayed on a generated PDF. This input is directly passed to `page.setContent()` without sanitization. An attacker injects `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in the input. When Puppeteer generates the PDF, the JavaScript executes, demonstrating XSS in the generated output.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in generated outputs (screenshots, PDFs), data manipulation, potential session hijacking if interacting with authenticated sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided data before using it in Puppeteer actions like `page.setContent`, `page.evaluate`, and `page.type`. Use context-aware output encoding based on where the data will be used (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in JavaScript Execution:**  Minimize the use of `page.evaluate` with user-provided code. If necessary, carefully sandbox or restrict the execution environment.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Generated Content:**  Apply CSP to generated HTML content to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Puppeteer and Transitive)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__puppeteer_and_transitive_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Puppeteer itself or its dependencies that can be exploited by attackers.
*   **Puppeteer Contribution:** Puppeteer, like any software, relies on dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can directly affect applications using Puppeteer.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a dependency used by Puppeteer for network communication. An attacker exploits this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the Puppeteer application, potentially leading to RCE or DoS.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan Puppeteer and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated vulnerability scanners.
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep Puppeteer and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use dependency pinning (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
