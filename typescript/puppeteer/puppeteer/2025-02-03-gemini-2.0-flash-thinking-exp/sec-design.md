# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, the Puppeteer library, aims to provide a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It enables developers to automate browser actions, generate screenshots and PDFs, perform UI testing, and scrape web content.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a stable and reliable API for browser automation.
- Ensure compatibility with the latest Chrome/Chromium versions.
- Maintain ease of use and developer-friendliness.
- Foster a strong community and provide good documentation.
- Ensure performance and efficiency of browser automation tasks.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the Puppeteer library itself could be exploited by malicious actors to compromise applications that depend on it. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.
- Unintended or malicious use of Puppeteer by developers could result in security issues in their applications, such as exposing sensitive data or creating vulnerabilities through insecure automation scripts.
- Supply chain risks associated with dependencies of the Puppeteer library. Compromised dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities into Puppeteer and subsequently into applications using it.
- Performance issues or instability in Puppeteer could disrupt critical business processes that rely on browser automation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code reviews are likely performed by maintainers and contributors as part of the open-source development process, although not explicitly documented in the repository. Location: GitHub Pull Request review process.
- security control: Automated testing (unit and integration tests) is implemented to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. Location: GitHub Actions workflows defined in `.github/workflows`.
- security control: Dependency management is handled using `npm` and `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent dependency versions. Location: `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files in the repository.
- security control: Regular updates of dependencies are likely performed to address known vulnerabilities in underlying libraries, although specific policy is not documented. Location: Project maintainers' responsibility.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: As an open-source project, vulnerability disclosure might be public before a patch is available, creating a window of opportunity for exploitation.
- accepted risk: Security of applications using Puppeteer is the responsibility of the application developers, not the Puppeteer project itself. Misuse of Puppeteer in applications can introduce security vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities during development.
- security control: Integrate Dependency Vulnerability Scanning tools to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies and alert maintainers to update them.
- security control: Consider incorporating fuzzing techniques to proactively discover potential security vulnerabilities by testing Puppeteer with a wide range of inputs.
- security control: Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential security weaknesses in the codebase and architecture.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the Puppeteer library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of applications that utilize Puppeteer to secure their own functionalities.
- Authorization: Similarly, authorization is managed by applications using Puppeteer. Applications must ensure that Puppeteer is used in an authorized manner and does not perform actions beyond its intended scope within the application's security context.
- Input Validation: Puppeteer API inputs should be validated to prevent unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. This includes validating arguments passed to Puppeteer functions and handling responses from the browser in a secure manner. Web pages loaded and interacted with by Puppeteer should be treated as untrusted inputs, and appropriate security measures should be taken to mitigate risks from malicious web content.
- Cryptography: Puppeteer itself does not directly handle cryptography. However, applications using Puppeteer might interact with web pages that use cryptography. Puppeteer should support secure communication protocols like HTTPS when interacting with web pages to protect sensitive data in transit. Applications using Puppeteer should ensure they handle any cryptographic operations securely and adhere to best practices for key management and data protection.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code, make changes, and commit them to the GitHub repository.
2. Code Commit (GitHub): Code changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, triggering the CI/CD pipeline.
3. GitHub Actions CI: GitHub Actions workflows are configured to automatically run the build process upon code commits and pull requests.
4. Build Process (npm install, compile, test): The build process involves:
    - Installing dependencies using `npm install`.
    - Compiling TypeScript code to JavaScript.
    - Running unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
5. Security Checks (SAST, Dependency Scan): Security checks are integrated into the build process:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning tools check for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
6. Build Artifacts (npm package): If the build and security checks are successful, build artifacts are created, typically an npm package ready for publishing.
7. npm Registry: The build artifacts (npm package) are published to the npm registry, making the Puppeteer library available for developers to download and use in their projects.

Security Controls in Build Process:
- security control: Automated build process using GitHub Actions ensures consistency and repeatability of builds.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) integrated into the build pipeline helps identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning ensures that project dependencies are checked for known vulnerabilities, reducing supply chain risks.
- security control: Automated testing (unit and integration tests) helps prevent regressions and ensures code quality, indirectly contributing to security.
- security control: Code review process on GitHub pull requests provides an additional layer of security review before code is merged.
- security control: Secure access control to GitHub repository and npm registry to protect against unauthorized modifications and publishing of malicious packages.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- For the Puppeteer project itself, the critical business process is maintaining and providing a secure, stable, and reliable browser automation library for the open-source community and commercial users.
- For applications using Puppeteer, critical business processes depend on the application's purpose. Examples include:
    - Automated UI testing pipelines.
    - Web scraping and data extraction processes.
    - PDF and screenshot generation for reporting or archiving.
    - Server-side rendering for SEO and performance optimization.

Data Sensitivity:
- The Puppeteer library itself does not directly handle or store sensitive data.
- However, applications using Puppeteer might handle sensitive data depending on their use case. This could include:
    - User credentials and personal information if automating login processes or interacting with user accounts.
    - Financial data if scraping e-commerce sites or processing financial transactions.
    - Proprietary or confidential information if scraping internal web applications or generating reports containing sensitive data.
- The sensitivity of data handled by applications using Puppeteer is determined by the application's context and data processing activities. Applications must implement appropriate data protection measures based on the sensitivity of the data they handle.
