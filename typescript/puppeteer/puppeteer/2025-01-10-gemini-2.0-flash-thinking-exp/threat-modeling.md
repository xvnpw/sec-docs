# Threat Model Analysis for puppeteer/puppeteer

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via `evaluate()` or `addScriptTag()`](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via__evaluate____or__addscripttag___.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the controlled browser context. This can happen if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate input used in `page.evaluate()`, `page.evaluateHandle()`, `page.addScriptTag()`, or related functions. The attacker might craft malicious input that, when passed to these functions, executes unintended code within the browser. This directly leverages Puppeteer's API for interacting with the browser's JavaScript environment.

**Impact:**
*   Data exfiltration from the target page or the Puppeteer environment.
*   Manipulation of the browser state and actions, potentially leading to further attacks.
*   Remote code execution on the server hosting the Puppeteer instance if the injected code interacts with the server.
*   Compromise of user sessions or data if the browser context contains sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Unintended Navigation and Actions](./threats/unintended_navigation_and_actions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application logic controlling Puppeteer to force the browser to navigate to unintended URLs or perform actions that were not intended. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles user input or internal state that dictates Puppeteer's behavior. This directly involves using Puppeteer's navigation and interaction functions in an insecure way.

**Impact:**
*   Access to internal or administrative URLs, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionalities.
*   Triggering unintended workflows or actions on external systems.
*   Denial of service on external systems if the browser is forced to make numerous requests.
*   Exposure of sensitive information if the browser navigates to a malicious site and submits data.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exposure of Browser State and Data](./threats/exposure_of_browser_state_and_data.md)

**Description:** If the application doesn't properly manage the lifecycle and state of the Puppeteer-controlled browser, sensitive information like cookies, local storage, session data, or cached data from previous interactions might be accessible to subsequent requests or users. This directly relates to how the application uses and reuses Puppeteer's browser and page objects.

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of sensitive user data or application secrets.
*   Session hijacking or impersonation of other users.
*   Compliance violations related to data privacy.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of Puppeteer](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_puppeteer.md)

**Description:** Running Puppeteer with insecure flags or configurations (e.g., disabling security features in Chromium) can introduce significant security risks. This directly involves the configuration options provided by Puppeteer during browser launch.

**Impact:**
*   Bypassing security measures like the same-origin policy.
*   Increased attack surface for exploiting browser vulnerabilities.
*   Potential for privilege escalation if the Puppeteer process runs with elevated privileges.

**Risk Severity:** High
