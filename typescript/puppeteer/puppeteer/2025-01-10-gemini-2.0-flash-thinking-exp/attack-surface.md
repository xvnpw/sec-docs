# Attack Surface Analysis for puppeteer/puppeteer

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via `evaluate()` and related methods](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via__evaluate____and_related_methods.md)

* **Code Injection via `evaluate()` and related methods:**
    * Description: Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed within the controlled browser context by Puppeteer.
    * How Puppeteer Contributes: Puppeteer's `page.evaluate()`, `page.evaluateHandle()`, `frame.evaluate()` methods allow executing arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser. If the code passed to these methods incorporates unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources, it becomes vulnerable.
    * Example: An application takes user input for a website URL and then uses `page.evaluate()` with string interpolation to extract data. If a user provides a URL like `'"`; alert("XSS"); //'`, this malicious script will be executed in the browser controlled by Puppeteer.
    * Impact: Full control over the browser context, including access to cookies, local storage, and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the user. This can lead to data theft, session hijacking, and further exploitation of the target application or other systems.
    * Risk Severity: Critical
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * **Never construct code strings dynamically using user-provided data.**
        * **Prefer passing arguments to the evaluated function instead of embedding data in the code string.**  Use the second argument of `page.evaluate()` to pass data safely.
        * **If dynamic code generation is absolutely necessary, implement robust input sanitization and validation.** However, this is generally discouraged.
        * **Follow the principle of least privilege and avoid running Puppeteer with elevated permissions if possible.**

## Attack Surface: [Navigation to Malicious URLs](./attack_surfaces/navigation_to_malicious_urls.md)

* **Navigation to Malicious URLs:**
    * Description: Attackers force the Puppeteer-controlled browser to navigate to malicious websites.
    * How Puppeteer Contributes: Puppeteer's navigation methods like `page.goto()`, `page.goBack()`, `page.goForward()` can be exploited if the target URL is derived from untrusted sources without proper validation.
    * Example: An application allows users to provide a URL for automated scraping. If a malicious user provides a link to a phishing site or a site hosting malware, the Puppeteer browser will navigate to it, potentially exposing the server or the application to risks.
    * Impact: Exposure to phishing attacks, drive-by downloads, exploitation of browser vulnerabilities on the server running Puppeteer, potential compromise of the server itself.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * **Implement strict URL validation, including checking the protocol (e.g., `http://`, `https://`), domain, and path.**
        * **Utilize allow-lists of trusted domains where possible.**
        * **Sanitize user-provided URLs by encoding special characters.**
        * **Consider using a web security API or service to check the reputation of URLs before navigating to them.**

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Browser Context and State](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_browser_context_and_state.md)

* **Manipulation of Browser Context and State:**
    * Description: Attackers manipulate browser features like cookies, local storage, and network requests to gain unauthorized access or inject malicious content.
    * How Puppeteer Contributes: Puppeteer provides methods to interact with the browser's context, such as `page.setCookie()`, `page.evaluate()` (for local storage manipulation), and `page.setRequestInterception()`. If these are used with untrusted data, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    * Example: An application uses Puppeteer to automate login processes and sets cookies based on user input. If an attacker can manipulate this input, they might be able to set arbitrary cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
    * Impact: Session hijacking, bypassing authentication, injecting malicious content into the page, manipulating network requests to redirect or intercept data.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * **Avoid using user-provided data directly to manipulate browser context elements like cookies or local storage.**
        * **If manipulation is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of the data.**
        * **Be cautious when intercepting and modifying network requests. Ensure that any modifications are based on trusted logic and validated data.**
        * **Follow secure coding practices for managing session and authentication data.**

## Attack Surface: [File System Access via Downloads](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access_via_downloads.md)

* **File System Access via Downloads:**
    * Description: Attackers exploit Puppeteer's download functionality to write files to arbitrary locations on the server or overwrite existing files.
    * How Puppeteer Contributes: Puppeteer allows configuring download behavior, and if the download path or filename is not properly controlled, it can be abused.
    * Example: An application uses Puppeteer to download reports and allows users to specify a filename. A malicious user could provide a path like `/etc/cron.d/malicious_job` to overwrite system files or schedule malicious tasks.
    * Impact: Server compromise through arbitrary file write, denial of service by overwriting critical files, introduction of malware onto the server.
    * Risk Severity: Critical
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * **Never allow user-provided input to directly determine the download path or filename.**
        * **Use a predefined, secure directory for downloads.**
        * **Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for downloads.**
        * **Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user-provided information related to downloads (if absolutely necessary).**
        * **Run Puppeteer with the least privileged user account possible to limit the impact of potential file system access vulnerabilities.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information through Screenshots and PDF Generation](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through_screenshots_and_pdf_generation.md)

* **Exposure of Sensitive Information through Screenshots and PDF Generation:**
    * Description: Sensitive information displayed in the browser during screenshot or PDF generation is unintentionally exposed.
    * How Puppeteer Contributes: Puppeteer's `page.screenshot()` and `page.pdf()` methods capture the current state of the browser. If sensitive data is visible at that moment, it will be included in the output.
    * Example: An application uses Puppeteer to generate reports containing sensitive customer data. If the output files are not properly secured, they could be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    * Impact: Data breaches, privacy violations, compliance issues.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * **Ensure that sensitive data is masked or redacted before taking screenshots or generating PDFs.**
        * **Implement access controls and encryption for the storage and transmission of generated files.**
        * **Avoid storing sensitive information in the browser's visible content if it's not necessary for the screenshot or PDF generation process.**

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Puppeteer or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_puppeteer_or_its_dependencies.md)

* **Vulnerabilities in Puppeteer or its Dependencies:**
    * Description: Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities in the Puppeteer library itself or its dependencies (Node.js, Chromium).
    * How Puppeteer Contributes:  Using an outdated or vulnerable version of Puppeteer or its dependencies exposes the application to known exploits.
    * Example: A known vulnerability in a specific version of Chromium allows remote code execution. If the application uses a Puppeteer version that bundles this vulnerable Chromium, it becomes susceptible.
    * Impact: Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution on the server running Puppeteer.
    * Risk Severity: Varies (can be Critical)
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * **Keep Puppeteer and its dependencies (Node.js, npm, Chromium) up-to-date with the latest security patches.**
        * **Regularly review security advisories for Puppeteer and its dependencies.**
        * **Use a dependency management tool (like npm or yarn) to track and update dependencies.**

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Browser Extensions (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_browser_extensions__if_enabled_.md)

* **Untrusted Browser Extensions (if enabled):**
    * Description: Malicious browser extensions, if enabled within the Puppeteer controlled browser, can introduce vulnerabilities.
    * How Puppeteer Contributes: While generally discouraged, if extensions are enabled, they operate within the browser context controlled by Puppeteer.
    * Example: A compromised or malicious extension could intercept network requests, steal cookies, or execute arbitrary code within the browser.
    * Impact: Data theft, manipulation of browser behavior, potential compromise of the server if the extension interacts with the local system.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * **Avoid enabling browser extensions in production environments unless absolutely necessary.**
        * **If extensions are required, carefully vet their source and permissions.**
        * **Implement strict policies regarding extension installation and management.**
