Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Blueprint, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe Component Properties**
    *   **Description:**  Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the application and executed in the user's browser, often by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles user input or external data.
    *   **How Blueprint Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Blueprint components often accept data as properties, including strings that might be rendered as HTML. If the application passes unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources directly to these properties (especially those like `content`, `title`, or within components rendering children), it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses the `<Tooltip>` component and sets the `content` prop directly from a URL parameter without sanitization: `<Tooltip content={unsafeUrlParameter}>Hover me</Tooltip>`. A malicious actor could craft a URL with JavaScript in the parameter, leading to script execution when the tooltip is rendered.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application, and execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Always sanitize and escape user-provided data and data from external sources before passing it as properties to Blueprint components that render HTML. Utilize browser built-in functions or dedicated sanitization libraries. Be cautious with properties that accept JSX or render arbitrary content.
        *   **Users:**  Cannot directly mitigate this. Rely on developers to implement secure coding practices.

*   **Attack Surface: DOM-Based XSS through Dynamic Blueprint Rendering**
    *   **Description:**  XSS vulnerability where the malicious script is injected into the page due to client-side scripts manipulating the DOM based on attacker-controlled input.
    *   **How Blueprint Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Blueprint components dynamically update the DOM based on application state and user interactions. If the application logic uses unsanitized input to determine how Blueprint components are rendered or modified, it can create opportunities for DOM-based XSS.
    *   **Example:** An application uses user input to dynamically construct the `className` prop of a Blueprint component: `<div className={\`bp3-icon-\${userInput}\`}></div>`. A malicious user could input values that inject malicious HTML or JavaScript through CSS injection techniques or by manipulating other attributes.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to reflected XSS, can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection, and arbitrary code execution within the user's browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Avoid directly using user input to control structural aspects of Blueprint components like `className` or `style` without careful validation and sanitization. Use data binding frameworks securely and avoid direct DOM manipulation where possible.
        *   **Users:** Cannot directly mitigate this.
