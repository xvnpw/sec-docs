# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for palantir/blueprint

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Blueprint Component Usage Guidelines](./mitigation_strategies/strict_blueprint_component_usage_guidelines.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Blueprint-Specific Document:** Create a document detailing the correct usage of *each* BlueprintJS component used.
    2.  **Component-Specific Rules (Blueprint Focus):** For each Blueprint component:
        *   **Allowed Props:** List allowed Blueprint props and types.
        *   **Prop Value Restrictions:** Specify restrictions on Blueprint prop values (e.g., "must be a valid `IconName`," "must be one of the `Intent` values").
        *   **Blueprint Nesting Restrictions:** State if a Blueprint component should *not* be nested within other *specific* Blueprint components, or if Blueprint-specific nesting patterns are required (e.g., `MenuItem` within `Menu`, `Popover` target/content).
        *   **Security-Relevant Blueprint Configurations:** Document Blueprint props with security implications (e.g., `Popover`'s `interactionKind`, `Dialog`'s `canEscapeKeyClose`, `canOutsideClickClose`).
        *   **Blueprint Examples:** Provide examples of correct/incorrect usage, focusing on Blueprint-specific aspects.
    3.  **Regular Review (Blueprint Updates):** Review guidelines with each BlueprintJS version update, as props and behavior can change.
    4.  **Code Reviews (Blueprint Focus):** Reviewers check Blueprint component usage against the guidelines.
    5.  **Training (Blueprint Components):** Train developers on the Blueprint-specific guidelines.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Blueprint Component Misuse Leading to XSS (Severity: High):** Incorrectly handling user data in Blueprint props (e.g., `Tooltip` content, `Tag` values) could lead to XSS.
    *   **Blueprint Component Misconfiguration (Severity: Medium):** Improperly configured Blueprint components (e.g., a `Dialog` that shouldn't be closable) could lead to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Blueprint Component Misuse Leading to Client-Side DoS (Severity: Medium):** Incorrect nesting or prop usage (e.g., excessively large `Tree` or `Table`) could cause performance issues.
    *   **Blueprint Accessibility Issues (Severity: Medium):** Incorrect Blueprint ARIA attribute usage or focus management within Blueprint components.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Reduces risk by promoting safe handling of user input within Blueprint components.
    *   **Misconfiguration:** Reduces risk by ensuring Blueprint components are configured as intended.
    *   **Client-Side DoS:** Reduces risk by preventing common Blueprint performance pitfalls.
    *   **Accessibility:** Reduces risk by promoting correct usage of Blueprint's accessibility features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially in component documentation; examples for some Blueprint components, but not all. Prop type validation, but not comprehensive custom validation for Blueprint-specific types.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive guidelines for *all* used Blueprint components. Centralized document needed.
    *   Formal code review enforcement (Blueprint-focused).
    *   Developer training (Blueprint-specific).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhanced Blueprint Prop Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/enhanced_blueprint_prop_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Beyond Blueprint's Defaults:** Go beyond Blueprint's built-in prop validation.
    2.  **Custom Validation (Blueprint Types):** For Blueprint props accepting complex data or specific Blueprint types (e.g., `IconName`, `Intent`, `Position`), create custom validation functions. These should:
        *   Validate against Blueprint's allowed values (e.g., check if an `IconName` is valid).
        *   Validate format/content (e.g., if a prop expects a specific string format).
    3.  **Sanitization (Blueprint Context):** If a Blueprint prop value might contain user-provided text (e.g., `Tooltip` content, `Tag` input, `NonIdealState` description), sanitize it *before* rendering within the Blueprint component. Use a library like `dompurify`. Do this within the component's lifecycle methods, *after* validation.  This is crucial for Blueprint components that render HTML directly from props.
    4.  **Runtime Type Checking (Optional, Blueprint Integration):** Consider `io-ts` or `zod` for runtime checking, especially for complex Blueprint props. Define codecs for Blueprint-specific types.
    5. **Integration with Guidelines:** Link validation/sanitization to the Blueprint component usage guidelines.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Blueprint Component Misuse Leading to XSS (Severity: High):** Robust validation/sanitization prevents malicious code injection through Blueprint props.
    *   **Blueprint Component Misconfiguration (Severity: Medium):** Validation prevents unexpected data in Blueprint components.
    *   **Blueprint Component Misuse Leading to Client-Side DoS (Severity: Low):** Validation can prevent excessively large/malformed data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Very high impact; significantly reduces XSS risk within Blueprint components.
    *   **Misconfiguration:** Moderate impact; prevents unintended data.
    *   **Client-Side DoS:** Low impact; some protection.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic `propTypes` used.
    *   Some components have basic sanitization, but it's inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Custom validation functions for most Blueprint components with complex props.
    *   Consistent sanitization using a library.
    *   Runtime type checking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Performance Optimization for Blueprint Components](./mitigation_strategies/performance_optimization_for_blueprint_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Profiling (Blueprint Focus):** Profile application performance, focusing on Blueprint component rendering/update times (especially `Table`, `Tree`, `Select`, `Popover`, `Overlay`).
    2.  **Identify Blueprint Bottlenecks:** Use profiling data to pinpoint specific Blueprint components causing performance issues.
    3.  **Blueprint-Specific Optimization:**
        *   **`memo` and `useMemo` (Blueprint Context):** Use these to prevent re-renders of expensive Blueprint components.
        *   **`shouldComponentUpdate` (Blueprint Context):** Implement for class-based Blueprint components.
        *   **Blueprint's `VirtualizedList`:** Use for large lists within Blueprint.
        *   **Lazy Loading (Blueprint Components):** Load Blueprint components only when needed.
        *   **Debouncing/Throttling (Blueprint Interactions):** Limit updates for Blueprint components responding to frequent input (e.g., `Suggest`, `InputGroup`).
        * **Blueprint Data Limits:** Set reasonable limits on data displayed in Blueprint components (e.g., `Table` rows). Use pagination/filtering with Blueprint components.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) from Blueprint (Severity: Medium):** Reduces risk of browser freezes/crashes caused by poorly performing Blueprint components.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side DoS:** Medium impact; reduces likelihood of Blueprint-related performance DoS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Occasional profiling, but not regular.
    *   Some `memo` usage, but inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular, scheduled profiling (Blueprint-focused).
    *   Comprehensive optimization (virtualization, lazy loading, debouncing/throttling) for all relevant Blueprint components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Blueprint Accessibility Audits and Remediation](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_blueprint_accessibility_audits_and_remediation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automated Testing (Blueprint Focus):** Integrate accessibility testing tools (Axe, Lighthouse) into CI/CD, focusing on Blueprint component usage.
    2.  **Manual Audits (Blueprint Components):** Conduct manual audits with assistive technologies (screen readers), testing Blueprint components specifically:
        *   **Keyboard Navigation (Blueprint):** Ensure all interactive Blueprint elements are keyboard-accessible.
        *   **Focus Management (Blueprint):** Verify focus within Blueprint modals, dialogs, popovers, etc.
        *   **Blueprint ARIA Attributes:** Check correct usage of ARIA attributes *within* Blueprint components.
        *   **Color Contrast (Blueprint):** Ensure sufficient contrast in Blueprint components.
    3.  **Remediation (Blueprint Issues):** Address accessibility issues in Blueprint component usage.
    4.  **Training (Blueprint Accessibility):** Train developers on Blueprint's accessibility features and best practices.
    5. **WAI-ARIA Compliance (Blueprint):** Ensure custom components using Blueprint adhere to WAI-ARIA guidelines. Specifically check Blueprint components that allow custom rendering or composition.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Blueprint Accessibility Issues (Severity: Medium):** Ensures Blueprint components are usable by people with disabilities.
     *   **Accessibility Exploits via Blueprint (Severity: Medium):** Prevents assistive technologies from bypassing security or accessing unintended information *through Blueprint components*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accessibility-Related Security:** Medium impact; reduces exploit risk.
    *   **General Blueprint Accessibility:** High impact; improves Blueprint component usability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Lighthouse checks, not in CI/CD.
    *   Some ARIA attributes, but inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated testing in CI/CD (Blueprint-focused).
    *   Regular manual audits (Blueprint components).
    *   Comprehensive developer training (Blueprint accessibility).
    *   Full WAI-ARIA compliance verification (Blueprint usage).
