# Threat Model Analysis for palantir/blueprint

## Threat: [XSS through Unsanitized Input in `Text` Component](./threats/xss_through_unsanitized_input_in__text__component.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user input fields. If this input is then rendered using the Blueprint `Text` component without proper sanitization, the script will be executed in the victim's browser. The attacker might steal cookies, session tokens, redirect the user to a malicious website, or deface the application. This threat is directly related to how developers *use* the `Text` component and fail to sanitize data before rendering it *with* Blueprint.

Impact: High - Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.

Affected Blueprint Component: `Text` component (specifically when misused to render unsanitized user or external data).

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Always sanitize and escape user-provided data *before* rendering it with the `Text` component.
*   Utilize secure templating practices that automatically escape HTML entities when rendering data within Blueprint components.
*   Consider using Blueprint components designed for specific content types (e.g., `CodeBlock` for code snippets) instead of directly rendering raw text when appropriate.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks, acting as a defense-in-depth measure even if developers make mistakes in sanitization.

## Threat: [DOM-Based XSS in a Vulnerable Blueprint `Button` Component](./threats/dom-based_xss_in_a_vulnerable_blueprint__button__component.md)

Description: A hypothetical vulnerability exists within the Blueprint `Button` component itself. An attacker crafts a specific input or interaction that exploits this vulnerability, causing the `Button` component to render malicious JavaScript into the DOM. This script executes when the button is interacted with or when the component is rendered, leading to XSS. This is a direct vulnerability *within* Blueprint's code.

Impact: Critical - Full compromise of the application within the user's browser, potentially leading to remote code execution in the browser context, data theft, and account takeover.

Affected Blueprint Component: `Button` component (or potentially other interactive components within Blueprint).

Risk Severity: Critical (if vulnerability exists and is exploitable within Blueprint itself)

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Keep Blueprint and all dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. This is crucial as this threat is directly related to Blueprint's code.
*   Regularly monitor Blueprint's security advisories and release notes for vulnerability disclosures.
*   Implement CSP to limit the impact of potential DOM-based XSS, even if the vulnerability is in Blueprint itself.
*   Participate in or monitor community security discussions related to Blueprint to stay informed about potential issues.
*   Consider contributing to Blueprint's security by reporting potential vulnerabilities if discovered.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability in React (Underlying Blueprint) Exploited Through Blueprint](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_in_react__underlying_blueprint__exploited_through_blueprint.md)

Description: A security vulnerability is discovered in React, the core dependency of Blueprint. This vulnerability is exploitable *through* the way Blueprint components utilize React's functionalities. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability via interaction with Blueprint components to perform actions like XSS or denial of service. While the vulnerability is in React, the *exploit path* is through Blueprint.

Impact: High - Depending on the nature of the React vulnerability and how Blueprint utilizes the affected functionality, impact could range from XSS to denial of service, potentially affecting application availability and security.

Affected Blueprint Component:  Indirectly affects all Blueprint components as they are built on React, but the *exploit* would likely target specific components that utilize the vulnerable React feature.

Risk Severity: High (depending on the severity of the React vulnerability and its exploitability through Blueprint)

Mitigation Strategies:

*   Keep React and all other dependencies of Blueprint updated to the latest versions. This is critical as the vulnerability is in a dependency.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for React and other relevant libraries.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies, including React.
*   Test Blueprint components after React updates to ensure no regressions or new vulnerabilities are introduced due to the dependency update.
*   Have a plan in place to quickly update dependencies and redeploy the application in case of critical vulnerability disclosures in React or other core dependencies.
