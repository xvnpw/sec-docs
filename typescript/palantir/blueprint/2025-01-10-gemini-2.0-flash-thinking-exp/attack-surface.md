# Attack Surface Analysis for palantir/blueprint

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/client-side_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that Blueprint depends on (directly or transitively).

**How Blueprint Contributes:** Blueprint relies on various npm packages for its functionality. If these dependencies have known security flaws, applications using Blueprint are potentially vulnerable.

**Example:** A vulnerable version of `react-popper` (a dependency of some Blueprint components) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact:** Ranges from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Denial of Service (DoS) or even Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Blueprint to the latest version, which often includes updates to its dependencies.
* Utilize tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the project's dependency tree.
* Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in the development pipeline for continuous monitoring of dependency vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Blueprint Component-Specific Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/blueprint_component-specific_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within Blueprint's own component implementations that allow attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

**How Blueprint Contributes:** If Blueprint components don't properly sanitize or escape user-provided data before rendering it in the DOM, it can create an XSS vulnerability.

**Example:** A user-provided label for a Blueprint `Tooltip` component is not properly escaped, allowing an attacker to inject `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which executes when the tooltip is displayed.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application, and execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Blueprint is updated to the latest version, as security patches are often included.
* Carefully review how user-provided data is used within Blueprint components, especially when rendering dynamic content.
* Follow secure coding practices for handling user input and output encoding.
* Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Client-Side Code Related to Blueprint](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_client-side_code_related_to_blueprint.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information being inadvertently exposed in the client-side JavaScript code related to Blueprint component configurations or data handling.

**How Blueprint Contributes:** Developers might embed sensitive data or API keys directly in the client-side code when configuring or using Blueprint components.

**Example:** An API key is hardcoded within the configuration of a Blueprint component that fetches data from a backend service.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, API keys, or other confidential information that can be misused by attackers.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never hardcode sensitive information in client-side code.**
* Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management systems to store and manage sensitive data.
* Implement proper authorization and authentication mechanisms on the backend to protect sensitive resources.
