# Threat Model Analysis for palantir/blueprint

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Input in `Text` Component](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_input_in__text__component.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code by providing unsanitized input that is then rendered by a `Text` component. The attacker might manipulate user input fields or data sources to include `<script>` tags or other malicious HTML, which will then be executed in the victim's browser when the component renders. This is a direct consequence of how the `Text` component handles and renders content.
* **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the application.
* **Affected Blueprint Component:** `@blueprintjs/core` - `Text` component. Specifically, when the `Text` component renders content without proper escaping of HTML entities.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Sanitization:**  Always sanitize user-provided data before passing it to the `Text` component or any other component that renders user-controlled content. Use appropriate escaping mechanisms for HTML entities.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of successful XSS attacks.
    * **Use Safer Alternatives:** If displaying rich text is necessary, consider using a dedicated rich text editor component with built-in sanitization or carefully sanitize the HTML before rendering.

## Threat: [DOM-Based XSS through Misuse of `HTMLSelect` or Similar Components](./threats/dom-based_xss_through_misuse_of__htmlselect__or_similar_components.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the options or content of a `HTMLSelect` component (or similar components that dynamically generate HTML based on data) through client-side scripting vulnerabilities. This could involve injecting malicious scripts into the options array or manipulating the component's state in a way that leads to script execution. The vulnerability arises from how Blueprint's `HTMLSelect` dynamically renders HTML based on the provided data.
* **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the application.
* **Affected Blueprint Component:** `@blueprintjs/select` - `HTMLSelect` component, and potentially other components that dynamically render HTML based on data, such as `Suggest`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Data Handling:** Ensure that data used to populate the options of `HTMLSelect` or similar components is properly sanitized and validated on the server-side.
    * **Avoid Dynamic HTML Generation with User Input:** Minimize the use of client-side logic that dynamically generates HTML based on user-provided input without proper sanitization when working with these Blueprint components.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase to identify potential DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities related to Blueprint's dynamic HTML rendering.
