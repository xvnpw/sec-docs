## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities Introduced by Blueprint](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_blueprint.md)

**Description:** Attackers target weaknesses in how Blueprint components handle user input or manage client-side logic, potentially leading to the execution of malicious scripts or unintended actions.

**Actionable Insight:** Implement robust input sanitization, secure coding practices, and server-side validation to mitigate client-side vulnerabilities. Regularly update Blueprint to benefit from security patches.

**Mitigation:** Employ output encoding/escaping, implement server-side validation, and conduct thorough security testing.

    *   **1.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Blueprint Components**
        *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into a Blueprint component, which is then executed in other users' browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Rigorously sanitize all user-provided data before rendering it within Blueprint components. Utilize secure coding practices and consider using browser-level XSS protection mechanisms.
        *   **Mitigation:** Employ output encoding/escaping appropriate for the context (HTML, JavaScript). Regularly update Blueprint to benefit from potential security patches.

            *   **1.1.1. Inject Malicious Script via Unsanitized Input in Blueprint Components**
                *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input to a Blueprint component (e.g., `<TextInput>`, `<EditableText>`) that is not properly sanitized, resulting in the execution of the injected script in the victim's browser.
                *   **Actionable Insight:** Developers must meticulously sanitize all user inputs before displaying them using Blueprint components.
                *   **Mitigation:** Utilize browser APIs for escaping and sanitizing output, implement Content Security Policy (CSP), and regularly update the Blueprint library.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Dependencies or Third-Party Integrations Related to Blueprint](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_dependencies_or_third-party_integrations_related_to_blueprint.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the libraries that Blueprint depends on or in how Blueprint is integrated with other third-party services or frameworks.

**Actionable Insight:** Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all dependencies, regularly update them to the latest secure versions, and implement security checks for third-party integrations.

**Mitigation:** Utilize dependency management tools, implement vulnerability scanning processes, and follow secure integration patterns.

    *   **3.1. Vulnerabilities in Blueprint's Dependencies**
        *   **Description:** Blueprint relies on other libraries (e.g., React). If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, applications using Blueprint can be indirectly affected.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Regularly update Blueprint and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories for Blueprint and its dependencies.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies. Implement a vulnerability scanning process.
