# Threat Model Analysis for palantir/blueprint

## Threat: [XSS via Unsafe HTML Rendering in `HTMLTable` Component](./threats/xss_via_unsafe_html_rendering_in__htmltable__component.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through user-controlled data that is rendered unsafely within the Blueprint `HTMLTable` component. This occurs when developers use methods like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar unsafe practices to render dynamic content in table cells without proper sanitization. The injected script executes in the victim's browser upon rendering the table.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Account takeover through session cookie or credential theft.
    *   Data exfiltration by accessing sensitive information on the page or making unauthorized API calls.
    *   Website defacement, altering the application's appearance and functionality.
    *   Malicious redirects, sending users to attacker-controlled websites.
*   **Blueprint Component Affected:** `HTMLTable` component, specifically when rendering dynamic or user-provided HTML content within table cells.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:**  Refrain from using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or equivalent methods for rendering user-supplied content within `HTMLTable` or any Blueprint component.
    *   **Employ Safe Rendering Practices:** Utilize React's default JSX escaping for text content. For rich text needs, integrate a dedicated, security-focused HTML sanitization library.
    *   **Server-Side Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided data on the server before sending it to the client and rendering it in `HTMLTable`. Use a robust HTML sanitization library to neutralize malicious HTML tags and attributes.
    *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** Enforce a strict CSP to minimize the impact of XSS attacks. CSP can restrict script sources and prevent inline script execution, acting as a crucial defense layer.
