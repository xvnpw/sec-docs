# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Blueprint UI framework, aims to provide a comprehensive and reusable set of React UI components for building web applications, particularly complex, data-dense interfaces.

- Business priorities:
  - Accelerate development of user interfaces.
  - Ensure consistency and quality of user interfaces across applications.
  - Provide a robust and well-tested UI component library.
  - Foster a strong developer community around the framework.
- Business goals:
  - Increase developer productivity by providing ready-to-use UI components.
  - Reduce development costs and time by simplifying UI development.
  - Improve user experience through consistent and well-designed interfaces.
  - Establish Blueprint as a leading React UI framework for enterprise applications.
- Business risks:
  - Adoption risk: Developers may not adopt Blueprint if it doesn't meet their needs or is difficult to use.
  - Quality risk: Bugs or performance issues in Blueprint components can negatively impact applications using it.
  - Security risk: Security vulnerabilities in Blueprint components can expose applications to attacks.
  - Maintenance risk: Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates can lead to Blueprint becoming outdated and less useful.
  - Dependency risk: Reliance on external dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities or instability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Blueprint, as an open-source UI component library, likely incorporates standard security practices for open-source projects.

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely performed for contributions to the project. (Location: GitHub pull request review process)
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are in place to ensure component functionality and stability. (Location: Test suites within the repository)
  - security control: Dependency management using package managers like NPM or Yarn. (Location: `package.json` and lock files in the repository)
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Mitigation is likely through dependency updates and vulnerability scanning, but complete elimination is difficult.
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the codebase. Open-source nature and community review help mitigate this, but cannot eliminate it entirely.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Consider signing releases and artifacts to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.
  - security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI component library itself. Authentication is handled by the applications that use Blueprint.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a UI component library itself. Authorization is handled by the applications that use Blueprint.
  - Input validation: Blueprint components that handle user input (e.g., forms, inputs) must implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS).
  - Cryptography: Blueprint itself is unlikely to directly implement cryptography. If applications using Blueprint require cryptography, they should use secure and well-vetted cryptographic libraries. Blueprint components should be designed to handle encrypted data securely if necessary (e.g., displaying encrypted data after decryption in the application).

# DESIGN

Blueprint is a React UI component library. Its design is centered around providing reusable and composable UI elements for web application development.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process:
  - Software development using Blueprint UI framework. The availability, integrity, and security of Blueprint directly impact the efficiency and security of applications built with it.
- Data being protected:
  - Source code of Blueprint UI framework: Sensitivity is moderate as it is open source, but integrity and availability are crucial. Unauthorized modification or loss of source code can disrupt development and introduce vulnerabilities.
  - Build artifacts (NPM packages): Sensitivity is moderate, integrity and availability are critical. Tampered or unavailable packages can lead to supply chain attacks and prevent developers from using Blueprint.
- Data sensitivity:
  - Source code: Publicly available, but integrity is paramount.
  - Build artifacts: Publicly available, but integrity is paramount.
  - Configuration data for build and deployment: Confidentiality is important to prevent unauthorized modifications to the build and deployment process.
