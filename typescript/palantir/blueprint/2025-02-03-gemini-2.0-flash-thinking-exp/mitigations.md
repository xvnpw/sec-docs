## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Blueprint](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_blueprint.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Update Blueprint

Here are mitigation strategies specifically focused on threats related to the Blueprint UI framework.

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Check for Blueprint Updates:** Regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly) check for new versions of the `blueprintjs` packages (core, icons, datetime2, etc.) using package management commands (e.g., `npm outdated @blueprintjs/core`, `yarn outdated @blueprintjs/core`).
    *   Step 2: **Review Blueprint Release Notes and Security Advisories:** Before updating, carefully review the release notes and security advisories specifically for Blueprint. Pay close attention to any mentioned security fixes. Blueprint's GitHub repository and npm/yarn package pages are the primary sources for this information.
    *   Step 3: **Update Blueprint Packages:** Update Blueprint packages to the latest stable versions using package management commands (e.g., `npm update @blueprintjs/core`, `yarn upgrade @blueprintjs/core`). Update packages incrementally and test after each update to minimize risks of introducing regressions.
    *   Step 4: **Regression Testing (Blueprint Focus):** After updating Blueprint, perform regression testing specifically focusing on areas of the application that utilize Blueprint components. Ensure the updates haven't broken Blueprint component functionality or introduced visual regressions.
    *   Step 5: **Automate Blueprint Dependency Checks:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for outdated or vulnerable Blueprint packages and alert developers to update them.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Blueprint - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Blueprint: High - Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities specifically within the Blueprint UI framework.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Project Dependency Management (Blueprint): Yes, using `npm` and `package.json` for Blueprint packages.
    *   Manual Blueprint Updates: Partially, developers update Blueprint packages periodically, but not on a strict schedule.
    *   Blueprint Focused Regression Testing: Yes, basic regression testing is performed after major Blueprint updates, but may not be comprehensive for Blueprint specific components.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated Blueprint Dependency Checks: No automated dependency scanning tools are currently specifically configured to focus on Blueprint packages in the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Scheduled Blueprint Updates: No formal schedule or process for regularly checking and updating Blueprint packages.
    *   Formal Blueprint Security Advisory Monitoring: No dedicated process for actively monitoring Blueprint security advisories specifically.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Especially within Blueprint Components)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__especially_within_blueprint_components_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Input Validation and Sanitization (Especially within Blueprint Components)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Identify Blueprint Input Components:** Identify all instances in the application where Blueprint input components (e.g., `InputGroup`, `TextArea`, `Select`, `RadioGroup`, `Slider`, `NumericInput`, etc.) are used to handle user input.
    *   Step 2: **Define Validation Rules for Blueprint Inputs:** For each Blueprint input component, define clear validation rules based on the expected data type, format, length, and allowed characters *relevant to how the input is used within the Blueprint component and application logic*.
    *   Step 3: **Implement Client-Side Validation using Blueprint Features:** Utilize Blueprint's form handling capabilities or React's state management in conjunction with Blueprint components to implement client-side validation. Provide immediate feedback to users directly within the Blueprint component's UI. *Remember client-side validation is for user experience, not primary security.*
    *   Step 4: **Implement Server-Side Validation for Blueprint Inputs:**  Crucially, implement robust server-side validation for all user inputs received from Blueprint components. This is the primary security measure. Validate data again on the server before processing or storing it, ensuring it aligns with expectations defined for the Blueprint input's purpose.
    *   Step 5: **Sanitize User Input Rendered by Blueprint Components:** When displaying user input back to the user or using it in dynamic content rendered by Blueprint components (e.g., displaying user-entered text in a `Text` component, or using input in a `Tooltip`'s content), sanitize the input to prevent XSS. Use appropriate sanitization techniques based on the output context of the Blueprint component.
    *   Step 6: **Context-Specific Sanitization for Blueprint Output:** Apply context-specific sanitization tailored to the Blueprint component being used for output. For example, HTML escape text displayed in a Blueprint `Text` component, or URL encode input used to construct links within a Blueprint `AnchorButton`.
    *   Step 7: **Regularly Review Validation and Sanitization Logic for Blueprint Inputs:** As the application evolves and Blueprint input components are added or modified, regularly review and update the validation and sanitization logic to ensure it remains comprehensive and effective for all Blueprint input handling.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High
    *   Data Integrity Issues - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High - Significantly reduces the risk of XSS by preventing injection of malicious scripts through user input handled by Blueprint components.
    *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium - Improves data integrity by ensuring data entered through Blueprint components conforms to expected formats and constraints.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Client-Side Validation (Blueprint Components): Partially implemented in some forms using Blueprint components and React state for user experience.
    *   Server-Side Validation (Blueprint Inputs): Partially implemented for some critical input fields originating from Blueprint components, but not consistently across all Blueprint input points.
    *   Output Sanitization (Blueprint Rendering): Inconsistently implemented for content rendered by Blueprint components, some areas sanitize output, others do not.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive Server-Side Validation for Blueprint Inputs: Missing robust server-side validation for all user input points originating from Blueprint components.
    *   Consistent Output Sanitization in Blueprint Components: Missing consistent output sanitization across the entire application, especially when rendering user-provided content using Blueprint components.
    *   Context-Specific Sanitization for Blueprint Output: Not always applying context-specific sanitization techniques when using Blueprint components to display user input.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of Blueprint Components](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_blueprint_components.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Configuration of Blueprint Components

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Review Blueprint Component Documentation (Security Focus):** Thoroughly review the documentation for each Blueprint component used in the application, specifically focusing on configuration options that have security implications, data handling aspects, and access control related settings.
    *   Step 2: **Minimize Exposed Functionality in Blueprint Components:** Configure Blueprint components to expose only the necessary functionality and minimize potentially risky features if they are not required for the intended use case. For example, disable free-form input in a `Select` component if only predefined options should be selectable.
    *   Step 3: **Implement Access Control with Blueprint Routing (if used):** If using Blueprint's routing components or integrating with a routing library in conjunction with Blueprint UI, ensure proper access control and authorization are implemented to restrict access to sensitive application sections rendered using Blueprint components, based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Step 4: **Secure Data Handling in Blueprint Components:** When using Blueprint components to display or handle sensitive data, ensure that data is properly secured and access is controlled *within the component's context*. Avoid accidentally exposing sensitive information through component configurations, props, or event handlers.
    *   Step 5: **Disable Unnecessary Features in Blueprint Components:** Disable any optional features or props of Blueprint components that are not needed and could potentially introduce security risks or increase the attack surface. For example, carefully consider the use of features that allow dynamic HTML rendering or script execution within components.
    *   Step 6: **Regular Security Reviews of Blueprint Component Configurations:** Periodically review the configurations of Blueprint components to ensure they are still secure and aligned with the application's security requirements, especially after Blueprint updates or application changes that involve Blueprint component usage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access - Severity: Medium to High (depending on the component and misconfiguration)
    *   Information Disclosure - Severity: Medium
    *   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: Medium to High - Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to application features or data rendered by Blueprint components due to misconfigured routing or component access controls.
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Reduces the risk of accidental information disclosure through insecure Blueprint component configurations or improper data handling within components.
    *   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities: Medium - Reduces the overall attack surface by ensuring Blueprint components are configured securely and minimizing unnecessary features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Blueprint Component Configuration: Basic configuration of Blueprint components is done for functionality, but security aspects of Blueprint component configuration are not always explicitly considered.
    *   Access Control (Blueprint Context): Access control is primarily implemented at the backend API level, and not consistently enforced or considered at the Blueprint component level in the frontend.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Security-Focused Blueprint Component Configuration Reviews: No systematic reviews of Blueprint component configurations specifically from a security perspective.
    *   Frontend Access Control Enforcement within Blueprint: Limited enforcement of access control within the frontend Blueprint components themselves, relying primarily on backend security.
    *   Documentation of Secure Blueprint Component Configurations: Lack of documentation or guidelines on secure configuration practices specifically for Blueprint components within the project.
