# Attack Surface Analysis for palantir/blueprint

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Input Components](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_input_components.md)

*   **Description:**  XSS vulnerabilities occur when malicious scripts are injected into web applications and executed in users' browsers. Input components, designed to handle user input, are common entry points.
*   **Blueprint Contribution:** Blueprint provides input components like `InputGroup` and `TextArea`. If developers use these components to render user-provided data without proper sanitization, XSS vulnerabilities can be introduced. Blueprint components are directly involved as they are used to display potentially unsafe user input.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into an `InputGroup` field. If the application then renders this input value directly onto the page using a Blueprint component without escaping, the script will execute in the victim's browser.
*   **Impact:**  Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user inputs on the server-side before storing or displaying them. Use appropriate encoding functions (e.g., HTML entity encoding) to prevent script execution.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Encode output based on the context where it's being rendered (HTML, JavaScript, URL).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed, reducing the impact of XSS even if it occurs.
    *   **Use React's JSX Safely:** React, and by extension Blueprint, generally escapes values rendered in JSX. However, be cautious with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and ensure its input is extremely well-controlled and sanitized if absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Menu and Select Components](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_menu_and_select_components.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to input components, menus and select lists that dynamically render data from user-controlled sources can be vulnerable to XSS if not handled carefully.
*   **Blueprint Contribution:** Blueprint's `Menu`, `Select`, and `MultiSelect` components are used to display lists of options. If menu items are generated dynamically from unsanitized user input and rendered using Blueprint components, XSS can occur. Blueprint components are directly involved in rendering these potentially unsafe menu items.
*   **Example:**  A menu item label is dynamically generated from a database field that contains `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`. When a Blueprint `Menu` component renders this item, the image tag with the `onerror` event will execute the JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Sanitization:** Sanitize data used to populate menu items on the server-side before rendering.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Encode menu item labels appropriately for HTML rendering.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate the data used to generate menu items to ensure it conforms to expected formats and doesn't contain malicious code.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Applications depend on external libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect the application's security.
*   **Blueprint Contribution:** Blueprint depends on React and other JavaScript libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies, including React itself, will directly impact applications using Blueprint.  Blueprint's dependency chain is directly involved in this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of React, which Blueprint depends on. Applications using that version of Blueprint are then vulnerable to RCE.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and other vulnerabilities depending on the specific dependency vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep Blueprint and all its dependencies (including React) updated to the latest versions. Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, yarn audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) as part of the development and deployment pipeline.
    *   **Dependency Pinning & Review:** Consider pinning dependency versions in production for stability, but establish a process to regularly review and update pinned dependencies, especially for security patches. Prioritize security updates for dependencies.
    *   **Stay Informed:** Subscribe to security advisories for React and Blueprint's other major dependencies to be aware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and recommended updates.
