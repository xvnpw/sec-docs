# PHP Debug Adapter for VSCode Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via Malicious Repository Path

### Description
The PHP Debug Adapter extension contains a command injection vulnerability in its terminal execution mechanism. When a user opens a malicious repository with this extension, an attacker can craft file paths that, when used by the extension to launch PHP processes, escape the intended command and execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system.

The vulnerability occurs in the terminal.ts implementation, which is responsible for launching processes in the terminal. When handling paths for PHP script execution, the code doesn't properly sanitize or escape the path arguments, allowing command injection.

### Impact
An attacker can achieve remote code execution on a victim's machine. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the VSCode process, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or installation of malware.

### Vulnerability Rank
Critical

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
The code attempts to use platform-specific terminal launching mechanisms, but doesn't properly sanitize or escape path arguments.

### Missing Mitigations
1. Proper validation and sanitization of file paths before passing them to terminal execution functions
2. Use of shell escaping functions for all user-provided or file system-derived inputs
3. Implementation of a safe subprocess execution model that prevents command injection

### Preconditions
1. Victim must open a malicious repository using VSCode with the PHP Debug extension installed
2. Victim must start a debugging session on a PHP file from that repository

### Source Code Analysis
The vulnerability is primarily in the terminal.ts file. Let's analyze the execution flow:

1. When a debugging session is started, the extension uses the Terminal class to launch processes
2. In WindowsTerminalService.launchInTerminal, the command is constructed with:
   ```javascript
   const command = `""${args.join('" "')}" & pause"`
   ```
   This joins the array of arguments with quotes and spaces, but doesn't properly escape special characters

3. The arguments (args) come from the debug configuration and include the file path to be debugged
4. An attacker can create a malicious file with a name like: `test.php" & calc.exe & echo "`
5. When this path is inserted into the command string, it would become:
   ```
   ""test.php" & calc.exe & echo "" & pause"
   ```
6. This effectively injects the `calc.exe` command, which would execute when the terminal is launched

Similar issues exist in LinuxTerminalService and MacTerminalService where bash commands are constructed with:
```javascript
const bashCommand = `cd "${dir}"; "${args.join('" "')}"; echo; read -p "${LinuxTerminalService.WAIT_MESSAGE}" -n1;`
```

This allows for command injection if the args contain shell metacharacters.

### Security Test Case
1. Create a malicious repository with a PHP file named: `exploit.php"; rm -f "/tmp/test" > "/tmp/test" & echo "`
2. Share this repository with the victim
3. When the victim opens it in VSCode and starts debugging this file, the command injection will occur
4. Verify that the command injection worked by checking if /tmp/test was created
5. For a real attack, this could be modified to download and execute a malicious payload

## Vulnerability 2: Code Execution via Malicious Xdebug Responses

### Description
The PHP Debug Adapter is vulnerable to remote code execution through malicious Xdebug responses. When a user connects to a malicious PHP environment configured with a rogue Xdebug server, the extension doesn't properly validate responses before processing them, allowing attackers to inject code that gets executed on the victim's machine.

### Impact
An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by serving specially crafted Xdebug responses that exploit this vulnerability. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or installation of malware.

### Vulnerability Rank
High

### Currently Implemented Mitigations
The extension implements basic XML parsing and error handling, but doesn't sufficiently validate the structure and content of Xdebug responses before processing them.

### Missing Mitigations
1. Strict validation of Xdebug responses against a schema
2. Input sanitization for all data extracted from Xdebug responses
3. Proper sandboxing to limit the impact of malicious responses

### Preconditions
1. Victim must connect to a PHP environment controlled by an attacker
2. The malicious environment must be configured with a compromised Xdebug server
3. Victim must start a debugging session connecting to this environment

### Source Code Analysis
The vulnerability is in how phpDebug.ts handles Xdebug responses:

1. In the evaluate request handling, user expressions are executed via the Xdebug connection:
   ```typescript
   protected async evaluateRequest(
       response: VSCodeDebugProtocol.EvaluateResponse,
       args: VSCodeDebugProtocol.EvaluateArguments
   ): Promise<void> {
       // ...
       if (args.context === 'repl') {
           const uuid = randomUUID()
           await connection.sendEvalCommand(`$GLOBALS['eval_cache']['${uuid}']=${args.expression}`)
           // ...
       } else {
           const response = await connection.sendEvalCommand(args.expression)
           // ...
       }
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. When processing Xdebug responses like property values, the extension doesn't sufficiently validate the data:
   ```typescript
   function formatPropertyValue(property: xdebug.BaseProperty): string {
       let displayValue: string
       if (property.hasChildren || property.type === 'array' || property.type === 'object') {
           // ...
       } else {
           displayValue = property.value || property.type === 'string' ? property.value : property.type
           // ...
       }
       return displayValue
   }
   ```

3. The extension trusts data from the Xdebug server without sufficient validation, allowing a malicious server to send crafted responses that could trigger vulnerabilities in the processing logic.

### Security Test Case
1. Set up a malicious PHP environment with a compromised Xdebug server
2. Create a repository with a launch.json configuration pointing to this environment:
   ```json
   {
       "configurations": [{
           "type": "php",
           "request": "launch",
           "name": "Connect to malicious server",
           "port": 9003,
           "pathMappings": {
               "/var/www": "${workspaceFolder}"
           }
       }]
   }
   ```
3. Configure the malicious Xdebug server to return crafted responses with payloads designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities
4. When the victim opens this repository and starts debugging, the malicious responses will be processed by the extension
5. Verify that the malicious responses trigger code execution on the victim's machine
