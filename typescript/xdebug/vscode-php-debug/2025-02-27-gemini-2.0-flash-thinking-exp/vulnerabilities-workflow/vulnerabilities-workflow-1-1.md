### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Command Injection in `terminateProcess.sh`

* Description:
    1. The `terminateProcess.sh` script is designed to terminate a process and its child processes using `pgrep` and `kill -9`.
    2. The script takes process IDs (PIDs) as command-line arguments.
    3. The script iterates through each PID provided and calls the `terminateTree` function.
    4. The `terminateTree` function recursively finds child processes using `pgrep -P $1` and then terminates the process using `kill -9 $1`.
    5. If a malicious PID argument like `1 & malicous_command &` is passed, `pgrep -P` and `kill -9` will be executed in a way that injects the `malicous_command`.
    6. An attacker can control the PID argument through the VS Code debug configuration `runtimeExecutable` or `program` when `externalConsole` is true, by injecting the malicious PID as part of these paths, which are then passed to `terminateProcess.sh`.

* Impact:
    * Arbitrary command execution on the developer's machine running the VS Code extension.
    * An attacker could potentially gain full control over the developer's machine, steal sensitive information, or cause further damage.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The `terminateProcess.sh` script directly uses the provided PID arguments in shell commands without any sanitization.

* Missing mitigations:
    * Input validation and sanitization for PIDs in `terminateProcess.sh`.
    * Avoid using shell scripts for process management where possible, or use safer alternatives for process termination.
    * Ensure that PIDs are handled as numerical values and not directly incorporated into shell command strings without proper escaping or parameterization.

* Preconditions:
    * The user must be using the "Launch in external console" feature of the VS Code extension (i.e., `externalConsole: true` in `launch.json`).
    * An attacker needs to find a way to control the PID that is passed to `terminateProcess.sh`. This could potentially be achieved by manipulating parts of the debug configuration that influence process execution and termination, such as `runtimeExecutable` or `program` paths when `externalConsole` is true.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/terminateProcess.sh`
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    terminateTree() {
        for cpid in $(pgrep -P $1); do
            terminateTree $cpid
        done
        kill -9 $1 > /dev/null 2>&1
    }

    for pid in $*; do
        terminateTree $pid
    }
    ```
    2. The script receives PIDs as arguments (`$*`).
    3. The `terminateTree` function uses command substitution `$(pgrep -P $1)` which is vulnerable to command injection if `$1` is not sanitized.
    4. The `kill -9 $1` is also vulnerable if `$1` is not a valid PID.
    5. **File:** `/code/src/terminal.ts`
    ```typescript
    class DefaultTerminalService implements ITerminalService {
        public killTree(pid: number): Promise<any> {
            return new Promise<any | void>((resolve, reject) => {
                try {
                    const cmd = Path.join(__dirname, './terminateProcess.sh')
                    const result = CP.spawnSync(cmd, [pid.toString()])
                    if (result.error) {
                        reject(result.error)
                    } else {
                        resolve(undefined)
                    }
                } catch (err) {
                    reject(err)
                }
            })
        }
    }
    ```
    6. The `DefaultTerminalService.killTree` function calls `terminateProcess.sh` with `pid.toString()`. If `pid` is somehow manipulated before reaching this function and contains malicious shell commands, it can lead to command injection.

* Security test case:
    1. Create a PHP file `test.php` with simple content like `<?php echo "Hello"; ?>`.
    2. Create a `launch.json` configuration with `externalConsole: true` and try to manipulate `runtimeExecutable` or `program` to inject a malicious PID argument.
    3. For example, try setting `runtimeExecutable` to `/path/to/php '1 & touch /tmp/pwned &'` (this is just an example, actual injection point and method may require more investigation to pinpoint in VSCode debug flow).
    4. Start debugging the `test.php` file using the created configuration.
    5. Observe if the command `touch /tmp/pwned` is executed on the system. If a file `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms the command injection vulnerability.
    6. A more realistic attack could involve more sophisticated commands for reverse shell or data exfiltration.

#### 2. Command Injection in `MacTerminalService.launchInTerminal` via AppleScript

* Description:
    1. The `MacTerminalService.launchInTerminal` function uses AppleScript to open a new Terminal window and execute a command within it.
    2. The arguments to be executed in the terminal are passed to the AppleScript as separate arguments (`-pa`) and then concatenated within the AppleScript.
    3. If the `args` array, which contains the command and its arguments, is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious AppleScript or shell commands.
    4. By crafting a malicious argument, an attacker can break out of the intended command execution and run arbitrary commands on the user's system.
    5. This can be triggered if an attacker can influence the `args` array in `launchInTerminal`, which might be possible through carefully crafted debug configurations, especially when dealing with workspace paths or external inputs.

* Impact:
    * Arbitrary command execution on macOS systems where the VS Code extension is running.
    * Allows an attacker to compromise the developer's machine.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The arguments are directly passed to the AppleScript without sanitization.

* Missing mitigations:
    * Proper sanitization and escaping of arguments passed to the AppleScript in `MacTerminalService.launchInTerminal`.
    * Consider using safer methods for launching terminal commands that avoid AppleScript or ensure robust argument escaping.

* Preconditions:
    * The user must be running macOS.
    * The "Launch in external console" feature is used.
    * An attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious commands into the `args` array passed to `MacTerminalService.launchInTerminal`. This might involve manipulating debug configuration settings that control the command being executed in the external terminal.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/terminal.ts`
    ```typescript
    class MacTerminalService extends DefaultTerminalService {
        private static OSASCRIPT = '/usr/bin/osascript' // osascript is the AppleScript interpreter on OS X

        public launchInTerminal(
            dir: string,
            args: string[],
            envVars: { [key: string]: string }
        ): Promise<CP.ChildProcess | undefined> {
            return new Promise<CP.ChildProcess | undefined>((resolve, reject) => {
                const osaArgs = [
                    Path.join(__dirname, './TerminalHelper.scpt'),
                    '-t',
                    MacTerminalService.TERMINAL_TITLE,
                    '-w',
                    dir,
                ]

                for (const a of args) {
                    osaArgs.push('-pa')
                    osaArgs.push(a)
                }

                if (envVars) {
                    for (const key in envVars) {
                        osaArgs.push('-e')
                        osaArgs.push(key + '=' + envVars[key])
                    }
                }

                let stderr = ''
                const osa = CP.spawn(MacTerminalService.OSASCRIPT, osaArgs)
                osa.on('error', reject)
                osa.stderr.on('data', (data: Buffer) => {
                    stderr += data.toString()
                })
                osa.on('exit', (code: number) => {
                    if (code === 0) {
                        resolve(undefined)
                    } else {
                        if (stderr) {
                            reject(new Error(stderr))
                        } else {
                            reject(new Error(`exit code: ${code}`))
                        }
                    }
                })
            })
        }
    }
    ```
    2. The `MacTerminalService.launchInTerminal` function constructs `osaArgs` to be passed to `osascript`.
    3. Arguments in `args` are added to `osaArgs` with `-pa` prefix, without any sanitization.
    4. **File:** `/code/src/TerminalHelper.scpt` (AppleScript) - Example content (not provided in PROJECT FILES, needs to be retrieved from repository if available, or reverse engineered from usage):
    ```applescript
    on run argv
        set terminalTitle to item 2 of argv
        set workingDirectory to item 4 of argv
        set programArguments to rest of rest of rest of argv

        tell application "Terminal"
            activate
            tell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal" to keystroke "t" using {command down}
            delay 0.1
            tell window 1
                set name to terminalTitle
                set current settings to first settings set whose name is "Basic"
                do script "cd " & quoted form of workingDirectory & "; " & programArguments
            end tell
        end tell
    end run
    ```
    5. In `TerminalHelper.scpt`, `programArguments` is directly concatenated into the `do script` command. If `programArguments` contains malicious AppleScript or shell commands, it will be executed.

* Security test case:
    1. Create a PHP file `test.php`.
    2. Create a `launch.json` configuration with `externalConsole: true`.
    3. Modify `runtimeArgs` or `program` in `launch.json` to include a malicious argument that will be passed to `MacTerminalService.launchInTerminal`. For example, try setting `runtimeArgs` to `['-dxdebug.start_with_request=yes', '; touch /tmp/pwned;']`. The exact injection method may require experimentation.
    4. Start debugging `test.php`.
    5. Check if the command `touch /tmp/pwned` is executed on the macOS system. If `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms the vulnerability.

#### 3. Command Injection in `LinuxTerminalService.launchInTerminal` via `bash -c`

* Description:
    1. The `LinuxTerminalService.launchInTerminal` function uses `gnome-terminal` (or similar) to launch an external terminal on Linux.
    2. It constructs a bash command using `bash -c` to execute the debug program and arguments in the specified directory.
    3. The arguments to the program are joined using `" "` and embedded within the `bash -c` command string.
    4. If the `args` array is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious shell commands into the `bash -c` command.
    5. This can be exploited if an attacker can control the contents of the `args` array, potentially through debug configurations or workspace settings, leading to arbitrary command execution when the external console is launched.

* Impact:
    * Arbitrary command execution on Linux systems where the VS Code extension is running.
    * Allows an attacker to compromise the developer's Linux machine.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. Arguments are directly embedded in the `bash -c` command without sanitization.

* Missing mitigations:
    * Proper sanitization and escaping of arguments when constructing the `bash -c` command in `LinuxTerminalService.launchInTerminal`.
    * Consider using safer methods for launching terminal commands or ensure robust argument escaping to prevent command injection.

* Preconditions:
    * The user must be running Linux.
    * The "Launch in external console" feature is enabled.
    * An attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious commands into the `args` array that is passed to `LinuxTerminalService.launchInTerminal`. This could involve manipulating debug configuration settings that influence the command executed in the external terminal.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/terminal.ts`
    ```typescript
    class LinuxTerminalService extends DefaultTerminalService {
        private static LINUX_TERM = '/usr/bin/gnome-terminal' // private const string LINUX_TERM = "/usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator";
        private static WAIT_MESSAGE = 'Press any key to continue...'

        public launchInTerminal(
            dir: string,
            args: string[],
            envVars: { [key: string]: string }
        ): Promise<CP.ChildProcess | undefined> {
            return new Promise<CP.ChildProcess | undefined>((resolve, reject) => {
                if (!FS.existsSync(LinuxTerminalService.LINUX_TERM)) {
                    reject(
                        new Error(
                            `Cannot find '${LinuxTerminalService.LINUX_TERM}' for launching the node program. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkID=534832#_20002`
                        )
                    )
                    return
                }

                const bashCommand = `cd "${dir}"; "${args.join('" "')}"; echo; read -p "${
                    LinuxTerminalService.WAIT_MESSAGE
                }" -n1;`

                const termArgs = [
                    '--title',
                    `"${LinuxTerminalService.TERMINAL_TITLE}"`,
                    '-x',
                    'bash',
                    '-c',
                    `''${bashCommand}''`, // wrapping argument in two sets of ' because node is so "friendly" that it removes one set...
                ]

                const cmd = CP.spawn(LinuxTerminalService.LINUX_TERM, termArgs)
                cmd.on('error', reject)
                cmd.on('exit', (code: number) => {
                    if (code === 0) {
                        resolve(undefined)
                    } else {
                        reject(new Error(`exit code: ${code}`))
                    }
                })
            })
        }
    }
    ```
    2. The `LinuxTerminalService.launchInTerminal` function constructs `bashCommand` which is then passed to `bash -c`.
    3. `args.join('" "')` directly joins the arguments with spaces and quotes but does not properly escape shell metacharacters, leading to potential command injection.

* Security test case:
    1. Create a PHP file `test.php`.
    2. Create a `launch.json` configuration with `externalConsole: true`.
    3. Modify `runtimeArgs` or `program` in `launch.json` to inject a malicious argument into the `args` array. For example, try setting `runtimeArgs` to `['-dxdebug.start_with_request=yes', '; touch /tmp/pwned;']`.
    4. Start debugging `test.php`.
    5. Verify if the command `touch /tmp/pwned` is executed on the Linux system. If `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms the command injection vulnerability.

#### 4. Code Injection via Logpoints

* Description:
    1. The VS Code extension supports Logpoints, which allow developers to log messages to the debug console without stopping execution.
    2. Log messages can contain expressions enclosed in curly braces `{}` which are evaluated by the debugger.
    3. When a logpoint is hit, the extension extracts the expressions from the log message using a regular expression `/\{(.*?)\}/gm`.
    4. For each extracted expression, the extension uses `connection.sendEvalCommand(expr)` to evaluate the expression in the context of the debugged PHP application.
    5. The result of the evaluation is then formatted and included in the log message displayed in the debug console.
    6. If an attacker can control the log message of a logpoint, they can inject arbitrary PHP code within the curly braces. This code will be executed by the `eval` command in the PHP application's context when the logpoint is hit.
    7. An attacker might be able to control log messages by manipulating workspace settings, debug configurations, or by contributing malicious code to a project that sets up logpoints.

* Impact:
    * Arbitrary PHP code execution within the context of the debugged application.
    * This can lead to various malicious activities, including data exfiltration, application compromise, or further exploitation of the developer's environment.

* Vulnerability Rank: critical

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The log message expressions are directly evaluated using Xdebug's `eval` command without any sanitization or restrictions.

* Missing mitigations:
    * Input sanitization and validation for log messages to prevent injection of arbitrary code.
    * Consider alternative, safer methods for expression evaluation in logpoints that do not involve executing arbitrary code, or restrict the capabilities of the evaluation to safe operations.
    * Implement a warning or confirmation mechanism when logpoints with expressions are set, to alert users about the potential risks.

* Preconditions:
    * The user must set a logpoint with an expression in the log message.
    * An attacker needs to find a way to influence the log message content of a breakpoint. This could be through:
        *  Directly modifying workspace settings if the attacker has access to the workspace.
        *  Contributing malicious code to a project that includes a `.vscode/launch.json` or workspace settings file with pre-defined logpoints containing malicious expressions.
        *  Exploiting a separate vulnerability to modify the user's workspace settings or debug configurations.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/logpoint.ts` - `LogPointManager.resolveExpressions`
    ```typescript
    import stringReplaceAsync from 'string-replace-async'
    import { isWindowsUri } from './paths'

    export class LogPointManager {
        // ...
        public async resolveExpressions(
            fileUri: string,
            lineNumber: number,
            callback: (expr: string) => Promise<string>
        ): Promise<string> {
            // ...
            const expressionRegex = /\{(.*?)\}/gm
            return await stringReplaceAsync(
                this._logpoints.get(fileUri)!.get(lineNumber)!,
                expressionRegex,
                function (_: string, group: string) {
                    return group.length === 0 ? Promise.resolve('') : callback(group)
                }
            )
        }
    }
    ```
    2. The `resolveExpressions` function uses regex `/\{(.*?)\}/gm` to extract expressions from the log message.
    3. It then calls the `callback` function for each extracted expression.
    4. **File:** `/code/src/phpDebug.ts` - `PhpDebugSession._processLogPoints`
    ```typescript
    private async _processLogPoints(response: xdebug.StatusResponse): Promise<boolean> {
        const connection = response.connection
        if (this._logPointManager.hasLogPoint(response.fileUri, response.line)) {
            const logMessage = await this._logPointManager.resolveExpressions(
                response.fileUri,
                response.line,
                async (expr: string): Promise<string> => {
                    const evaluated = await connection.sendEvalCommand(expr) // Vulnerable call
                    return formatPropertyValue(evaluated.result)
                }
            )

            this.sendEvent(new vscode.OutputEvent(logMessage + '\n', 'console'))
            return true
        }
        return false
    }
    ```
    5. In `_processLogPoints`, the `callback` passed to `resolveExpressions` is defined as `async (expr: string): Promise<string> => { const evaluated = await connection.sendEvalCommand(expr); ... }`.
    6. This callback directly uses `connection.sendEvalCommand(expr)` to evaluate the extracted expression `expr`.
    7. **File:** `/code/src/xdebugConnection.ts` - `Connection.sendEvalCommand`
    ```typescript
    export class Connection extends DbgpConnection {
        // ...
        /** sends an eval command */
        public async sendEvalCommand(expression: string): Promise<EvalResponse> {
            return new EvalResponse(await this._enqueueCommand('eval', undefined, expression), this)
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    8. `connection.sendEvalCommand` calls `_enqueueCommand` with 'eval' command name, which eventually leads to sending `eval` command to Xdebug, which executes the provided PHP code within the debugged application.
    9. Therefore, any code injected into the log message expression will be executed by the PHP interpreter via Xdebug's `eval` command.
    10. The file `/code/src/test/logpoint.ts` contains tests for `LogPointManager`, which confirms the logic of expression resolving in log messages, and thus reinforces the vulnerability described above.

* Security test case:
    1. Create a PHP file `test_logpoint.php` with simple content like `<?php echo "Hello Logpoint"; ?>`.
    2. Open the file in VS Code and set a logpoint on line 1 (or any line).
    3. In the log message for the logpoint, enter a malicious PHP expression, for example: `Log: {system('touch /tmp/pwned_logpoint');}`.
    4. Start debugging `test_logpoint.php`.
    5. Once the logpoint is hit, check if the command `touch /tmp/pwned_logpoint` has been executed on the system. If a file `/tmp/pwned_logpoint` is created, it confirms the code injection vulnerability via logpoints.
    6. A more realistic attack could involve more sophisticated PHP code for reverse shell or data exfiltration, executed when the developer triggers the logpoint during debugging.

#### 5. Code Injection via Evaluate Request

* Description:
    1. The VS Code extension allows developers to evaluate expressions in the debug console using the "Evaluate" feature.
    2. The `evaluateRequest` in `phpDebug.ts` handles these evaluation requests.
    3. It receives an expression string from VS Code and uses `connection.sendEvalCommand(args.expression)` to evaluate it within the debugged PHP application's context.
    4. The result of the evaluation is then sent back to VS Code to be displayed in the debug console or variable views.
    5. If an attacker can somehow influence the `args.expression` in `evaluateRequest`, they can inject arbitrary PHP code. This code will be executed by the `eval` command in the PHP application's context.
    6. While direct external manipulation of `evaluateRequest` is less likely, if there's another vulnerability that allows an attacker to control debug session or configuration, or if a developer unknowingly pastes malicious code into the evaluate window, it can lead to code execution.

* Impact:
    * Arbitrary PHP code execution within the context of the debugged application.
    * Similar to Logpoints, this can lead to data exfiltration, application compromise, or further exploitation of the developer's environment.
    * Although less directly exposed to external attackers compared to logpoints or command injection, it still represents a significant risk if other vulnerabilities are present or due to developer error.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None. The expression from the evaluate request is directly passed to Xdebug's `eval` command without sanitization.

* Missing mitigations:
    * Input sanitization and validation for expressions in `evaluateRequest`.
    * Implement a warning or confirmation mechanism before executing arbitrary code via the evaluate feature, especially if the expression is complex or originates from an untrusted source.
    * Consider restricting the capabilities of the `eval` command or using safer alternatives if possible.

* Preconditions:
    * A debug session must be active and connected to Xdebug.
    * An attacker needs to find a way to influence the expression sent in the `evaluateRequest`. This is less likely to be directly from an external attacker but could be exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities or through social engineering against developers.
    * A developer might unknowingly paste and evaluate malicious PHP code provided by an attacker.

* Source code analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/phpDebug.ts` - `PhpDebugSession.evaluateRequest`
    ```typescript
    protected async evaluateRequest(
        response: VSCodeDebugProtocol.EvaluateResponse,
        args: VSCodeDebugProtocol.EvaluateArguments
    ): Promise<void> {
        try {
            if (!args.frameId) {
                throw new Error('Cannot evaluate code without a connection')
            }
            if (!this._stackFrames.has(args.frameId)) {
                throw new Error(`Unknown frameId ${args.frameId}`)
            }
            const stackFrame = this._stackFrames.get(args.frameId)!
            const connection = stackFrame.connection
            let result: xdebug.BaseProperty | null = null
            if (args.context === 'hover') {
                // ... (hover context logic)
            } else if (args.context === 'repl') {
                // ... (repl context logic)
            } else {
                const response = await connection.sendEvalCommand(args.expression) // Vulnerable call
                if (response.result) {
                    result = response.result
                }
            }
            // ... (response handling)
        } catch (error) {
            response.message = (error as Error).message
            response.success = false
            this.sendResponse(response)
        }
    }
    ```
    2. In `evaluateRequest`, for contexts other than 'hover' and 'repl' (which includes the standard "Evaluate in Debug Console" scenario), the code directly calls `connection.sendEvalCommand(args.expression)`.
    3. As analyzed in vulnerability "Code Injection via Logpoints", `sendEvalCommand` leads to the execution of arbitrary PHP code via Xdebug's `eval` command.
    4. Therefore, if an attacker can inject malicious PHP code into `args.expression`, it will be executed by the PHP interpreter.

* Security test case:
    1. Create a PHP file `test_evaluate.php` with simple content like `<?php echo "Hello Evaluate"; ?>`.
    2. Start debugging `test_evaluate.php` and pause execution at any line (e.g., by setting a breakpoint).
    3. Open the Debug Console in VS Code.
    4. In the input field of the Debug Console (where you can type expressions to evaluate), enter a malicious PHP expression, for example: `system('touch /tmp/pwned_evaluate');`.
    5. Press Enter to evaluate the expression.
    6. Check if the command `touch /tmp/pwned_evaluate` has been executed on the system. If a file `/tmp/pwned_evaluate` is created, it confirms the code injection vulnerability via evaluate requests.
    7. A more realistic attack could involve more sophisticated PHP code for reverse shell or data exfiltration, executed when the developer evaluates the malicious expression during debugging.
