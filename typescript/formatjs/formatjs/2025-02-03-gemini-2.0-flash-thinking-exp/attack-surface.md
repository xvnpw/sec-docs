# Attack Surface Analysis for formatjs/formatjs

## Attack Surface: [Message String Injection (Indirect XSS/Injection) - High Severity](./attack_surfaces/message_string_injection__indirect_xssinjection__-_high_severity.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious content is injected into message strings that are subsequently processed and rendered by `formatjs`, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection vulnerabilities. While the vulnerability originates from the message source, `formatjs` plays a crucial role in rendering the potentially malicious content.
*   **How formatjs Contributes to Attack Surface:** `formatjs` is designed to format message strings for internationalization. If these message strings are compromised *before* being passed to `formatjs`, the library will faithfully process and output the malicious content as part of the formatted message, which can then be interpreted by the browser.  `formatjs`'s formatting process doesn't inherently sanitize or escape HTML or JavaScript within message strings.
*   **Example:** A message string intended to be "Welcome, {username}!" is maliciously modified in the message source to become "Welcome, <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>!". When `formatjs` formats this string and it is rendered in the application's HTML, the JavaScript code within the `<img>` tag executes, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including:
    *   Session hijacking and account takeover.
    *   Information disclosure and data theft.
    *   Website defacement and reputation damage.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Installation of malware on the user's machine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure and Trusted Message Source:**  Ensure message strings are loaded from secure and trusted sources. Treat any external or user-editable message source as potentially untrusted.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization for Message Strings (at the Source):** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all message strings *before* they are used by `formatjs`. This should be done at the point where message strings are created or loaded, not just before passing them to `formatjs`.  Consider using templating languages or mechanisms that inherently escape HTML by default, or implement a strict sanitization process.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks. CSP can restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.), mitigating the ability of injected scripts to execute or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Message Content:** Conduct regular security audits and reviews of message strings to proactively identify and remove any potentially malicious or unintended content. This is especially important if message strings are managed by content editors or loaded from external systems.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Message Management:** Limit access to message string management systems to only authorized personnel and implement access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of message content.
