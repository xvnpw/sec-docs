## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Message Formatting Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_message_formatting_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Message [CRITICAL]
    *   **Sub-Vector:** Inject Malicious HTML in Message String [CRITICAL]
        *   **Detailed Attack Step:** User-Controlled Message String Contains Unescaped HTML [CRITICAL]
            *   **Description:** The application uses `formatjs` to format messages that include user-provided strings directly without proper HTML escaping. An attacker can inject malicious HTML code within these user-controlled strings. When `formatjs` formats and the application renders this message in a web browser, the injected HTML is executed, leading to XSS.
            *   **Example:** A user comment field is used in a formatted message. If the comment is not escaped and contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, this script will execute in the victim's browser.
    *   **Sub-Vector:** Exploit Placeholders for XSS [CRITICAL]
        *   **Detailed Attack Step:** Inject Malicious HTML in Placeholder Value [CRITICAL]
            *   **Further Attack Step:** User-Controlled Placeholder Value Not Properly Sanitized [CRITICAL]
                *   **Description:** `formatjs` uses placeholders to insert dynamic values into messages. If these placeholder values are derived from user input and are not properly sanitized before being passed to `formatjs`, an attacker can inject malicious HTML through these placeholders. When the formatted message is rendered, the injected HTML executes, causing XSS.
                *   **Example:** A user's name is used as a placeholder in a welcome message. If the name is not sanitized and is set to `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, this image tag with the `onerror` event will execute JavaScript when the message is displayed.
    *   **Sub-Vector:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) XSS [CRITICAL]
        *   **Detailed Attack Step:** Vulnerable SSR Implementation Fails to Escape Formatted Output [CRITICAL]
            *   **Description:** If the application uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to pre-render pages containing `formatjs` formatted messages, the SSR process itself must ensure proper HTML escaping of the formatted output. If the SSR implementation fails to escape the output before sending it to the client, an attacker can inject malicious HTML that will be rendered and executed in the user's browser, leading to XSS.
            *   **Example:** An SSR framework might not automatically escape the output from `formatjs`. If the developer directly inserts the formatted message into the HTML template without manual escaping, XSS can occur if the message contains malicious HTML.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit formatjs Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_formatjs_library_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Known formatjs Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]
    *   **Sub-Vector:** Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities in formatjs Library [CRITICAL]
        *   **Detailed Attack Step:** Application Uses Vulnerable Version of formatjs [CRITICAL]
            *   **Description:**  `formatjs`, like any software, might have publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities in specific versions. If the application uses an outdated and vulnerable version of `formatjs`, attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This could lead to various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including XSS, Remote Code Execution (RCE), or Denial of Service (DoS).
            *   **Example:** A publicly known XSS vulnerability exists in `formatjs` version X.Y.Z. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability if the application is still using version X.Y.Z.
*   **Attack Vector:** Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]
    *   **Sub-Vector:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in formatjs Dependencies [CRITICAL]
        *   **Detailed Attack Step:** Application Uses Vulnerable Versions of formatjs Dependencies [CRITICAL]
            *   **Description:** `formatjs` relies on other JavaScript libraries as dependencies. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities and the application uses vulnerable versions of these dependencies (indirectly through `formatjs`), attackers can exploit these dependency vulnerabilities to compromise the application. The impact can range from XSS to RCE, depending on the specific dependency vulnerability.
            *   **Example:** A dependency of `formatjs`, library 'ABC', has a known RCE vulnerability in version 1.0. If the application uses a version of `formatjs` that depends on vulnerable 'ABC' 1.0, the application is indirectly vulnerable to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration or Misuse of formatjs [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_or_misuse_of_formatjs__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Misuse of formatjs API [CRITICAL]
    *   **Sub-Vector:** Incorrect Usage of formatjs API Leading to Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]
        *   **Detailed Attack Step:** Developer Fails to Properly Sanitize Inputs Before Passing to formatjs Formatting Functions [CRITICAL]
            *   **Description:** Even if `formatjs` itself is secure, developers can misuse its API in ways that introduce vulnerabilities. A common mistake is failing to properly sanitize user-provided inputs before passing them to `formatjs` formatting functions. This can lead to vulnerabilities like XSS if the formatted output is rendered in a web browser.
            *   **Example:** Developers might assume that `formatjs` automatically sanitizes all inputs, which is incorrect. If they directly pass user input to a formatting function without escaping HTML, they are misusing the API and creating an XSS vulnerability.
