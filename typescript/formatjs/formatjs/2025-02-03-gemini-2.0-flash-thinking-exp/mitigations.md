# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for formatjs/formatjs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Provided Message Components](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-provided_message_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all places in your application where user-provided data is incorporated as variables within `formatjs` message formats (ICU Message Syntax).
    2.  Before passing user input to `formatjs` formatting functions, implement sanitization logic.
    3.  Apply contextual output encoding based on where the formatted message will be displayed. Use HTML escaping for HTML contexts, URL encoding for URLs, etc.
    4.  Consider using a sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify for HTML) or implement robust escaping functions manually. Ensure all relevant characters are handled for the target output context.
    5.  Test sanitization with various malicious inputs (e.g., XSS payloads, HTML injection attempts).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High Severity - Prevents execution of malicious scripts injected through user input within `formatjs` messages.
    *   HTML Injection: Medium Severity - Prevents unintended HTML structures from being injected and altering page layout or user perception.
    *   Format String Vulnerabilities (related to user input in formats): Medium Severity - Reduces potential for unexpected behavior or information disclosure from improper handling of user input within message formats.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High Reduction - Effectively eliminates XSS risks from user-provided data in `formatjs` messages.
    *   HTML Injection: High Reduction - Prevents unintended HTML injection.
    *   Format String Vulnerabilities: Medium Reduction - Reduces risks related to format string-like issues in `formatjs` usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Implemented in the frontend component for user comments and names using a custom HTML escaping function.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in the admin panel's notification system, which uses `formatjs` and can include user-provided names. Needs to be implemented in the admin panel.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Allowed Message Format Features](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_allowed_message_format_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review all usages of `formatjs` with user-provided or partially user-provided message formats.
    2.  Determine if complex `formatjs` features like `select`, `plural`, `selectordinal`, or custom formatters are necessary when user input is involved.
    3.  If not essential, simplify message formats to use only basic interpolation or simpler features.
    4.  If complex features are needed, strictly validate and control the structure and content of user-provided parts of the message format.
    5.  Consider whitelisting allowed message format features for stricter control.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Complexity-Based DoS: Medium Severity - Prevents potential denial of service attacks caused by overly complex message formats consuming excessive resources during parsing and formatting.
    *   Unintended Logic Execution (related to format complexity): Low Severity - Minimizes potential risks from exploiting subtle parsing or formatting logic flaws in `formatjs` through complex formats.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Complexity-Based DoS: Medium Reduction - Reduces the attack surface for DoS attacks based on format complexity.
    *   Unintended Logic Execution: Low Reduction - Minimally reduces risks related to parsing flaws.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - User-facing messages use basic interpolation. Complex features are used in internal system messages.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Review internal system messages to ensure complex features are only used when necessary and not exposed to external user influence. Simplify internal messages where possible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Bundle Locale Data Statically](./mitigation_strategies/bundle_locale_data_statically.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Bundle all required locale data files directly into application build artifacts instead of dynamic loading.
    2.  Include necessary locale data files from `formatjs` packages (e.g., `@formatjs/intl-pluralrules/locale-data`, `@formatjs/intl-datetimeformat/locale-data`) during the build process.
    3.  Configure `formatjs` to load locale data from these bundled files within the application.
    4.  Remove any code that dynamically fetches locale data from external sources or user-provided paths.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Locale Data Injection: High Severity - Prevents injection of malicious locale data if loaded dynamically from untrusted sources, which could lead to code execution or data manipulation.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (if loading over HTTP): Medium Severity - Eliminates MITM risks if locale data was fetched over insecure HTTP.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Locale Data Injection: High Reduction - Completely eliminates the risk of malicious locale data injection from external sources.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High Reduction - Removes network requests for locale data, eliminating MITM risks related to locale data loading.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Locale data is bundled statically using Webpack for the frontend application.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Implemented across the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Complexity Limits for Message Formats (If User-Influenced)](./mitigation_strategies/complexity_limits_for_message_formats__if_user-influenced_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If users can define or influence `formatjs` message formats, implement limits on format complexity.
    2.  Define metrics for format complexity (e.g., nesting depth, number of format specifiers, format string length).
    3.  Enforce these limits during message format processing or validation. Reject or simplify formats exceeding limits.
    4.  Provide clear error messages to users if formats are rejected due to complexity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   DoS through Format Complexity: Medium Severity - Prevents denial of service attacks from users crafting overly complex message formats to consume excessive resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS through Format Complexity: Medium Reduction - Reduces the attack surface for DoS attacks based on overly complex formats.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - No explicit limits on message format complexity, even where user influence is possible (e.g., custom notification templates).

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement complexity limits for user-influenced message formats, especially in custom notification templates. Define metrics and limits based on performance testing.
