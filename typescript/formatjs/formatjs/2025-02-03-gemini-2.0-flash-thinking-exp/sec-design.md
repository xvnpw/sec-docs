# BUSINESS POSTURE

The formatjs project aims to provide a comprehensive set of internationalization (i18n) tools and libraries for JavaScript. It focuses on formatting messages, dates, numbers, and currencies for different locales, enabling developers to build applications that are accessible and user-friendly for a global audience.

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide accurate and reliable internationalization functionalities for JavaScript applications.
  - Offer a performant and efficient library to minimize impact on application performance.
  - Maintain a widely adopted and community-supported i18n solution.
  - Ensure compatibility with various JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, React Native, etc.).
  - Facilitate easy integration and usage for developers.

- Business Goals:
  - Become the leading i18n library in the JavaScript ecosystem.
  - Expand the library's features and functionalities to cover a broader range of i18n needs.
  - Foster a strong and active community of contributors and users.
  - Ensure long-term sustainability and maintenance of the project.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to application security issues (e.g., injection attacks through format strings).
  - Performance bottlenecks in the library could negatively impact application user experience.
  - Lack of community support or maintainership could lead to project stagnation and obsolescence.
  - Incompatibility issues with new JavaScript environments or frameworks could limit adoption.
  - Incorrect or incomplete locale data could result in inaccurate internationalization.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions (GitHub Pull Requests). Implemented via GitHub workflow and project maintainers.
  - security control: Unit and integration testing. Implemented via Jest and GitHub Actions.
  - security control: Linting and code formatting. Implemented via ESLint, Prettier and GitHub Actions.
  - security control: Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities. Implemented via Dependabot and GitHub Security Advisories.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. Mitigated by dependency scanning and updates.
  - accepted risk: Risk of vulnerabilities introduced by community contributions. Mitigated by code review and testing.
  - accepted risk: Denial of service if library is used to process untrusted user input without proper validation and rate limiting in consuming application.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Introduce fuzz testing to identify edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in parsing and formatting logic.
  - security control: Establish a clear security vulnerability reporting process and response plan.
  - security control: Consider signing releases to ensure authenticity and integrity of distributed packages.
  - security control: Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities and update them promptly.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a JavaScript library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using the library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a JavaScript library. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using the library.
  - Input Validation:
    - The library must handle potentially malicious or unexpected input gracefully without causing crashes or unexpected behavior.
    - Format strings and locale data should be validated to prevent injection attacks or other vulnerabilities.
    - Input validation should be performed on all external data sources, including user-provided format strings and locale data.
  - Cryptography:
    - Cryptography is not a primary requirement for this library. However, if future features involve handling sensitive data or secure communication, appropriate cryptographic measures must be implemented.
    - If cryptography is used, ensure usage of well-vetted and standard cryptographic libraries and algorithms.
