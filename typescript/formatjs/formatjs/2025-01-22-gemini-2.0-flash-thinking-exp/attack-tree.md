## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Message Formatting Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_message_formatting_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Message [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Inject Malicious HTML in Message String [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **User-Controlled Message String Contains Unescaped HTML [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows user input to directly form part of the message string passed to `formatjs` without proper HTML escaping, an attacker can inject malicious HTML code. When `formatjs` formats and the application renders this message in a web browser, the injected HTML will be executed, leading to XSS.
            *   **Example:** A user provides the message string `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` which is used directly in `formatjs` formatting and then rendered on the page.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Always treat user-provided message strings as untrusted. Sanitize or escape HTML entities in user-provided message strings before using them with `formatjs`.

    *   **Exploit Placeholders for XSS [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Inject Malicious HTML in Placeholder Value [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **User-Controlled Placeholder Value Not Properly Sanitized [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  `formatjs` uses placeholders to insert dynamic values into messages. If these placeholder values are derived from user input and are not properly sanitized before being passed to `formatjs`, an attacker can inject malicious HTML through these values. When the formatted message is rendered, the injected HTML executes as XSS.
                *   **Example:** A message format is defined as `Hello {name}`. The `name` value is taken directly from user input, e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`. When formatted and rendered, the XSS payload executes.
                *   **Mitigation:** Sanitize or escape user-provided placeholder values before passing them to `formatjs`. Understand how `formatjs` handles different data types in placeholders and ensure HTML is properly escaped if the output is rendered in HTML contexts.

    *   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) XSS [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Vulnerable SSR Implementation Fails to Escape Formatted Output [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** In applications using Server-Side Rendering (SSR), the formatted output from `formatjs` is generated on the server and sent to the client as HTML. If the SSR implementation fails to properly escape the formatted output before sending it to the client, and if the formatted message contains user-controlled data (directly or via placeholders), XSS vulnerabilities can arise.
            *   **Example:** The server-side code formats a message using `formatjs` that includes user input. The resulting formatted string is directly embedded into the HTML response without escaping. If the user input contains malicious HTML, it will be executed in the user's browser.
            *   **Mitigation:** Ensure proper HTML escaping in your SSR implementation. Review SSR code to guarantee all dynamic content, including `formatjs` formatted messages, is correctly escaped before being rendered on the client-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit formatjs Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_formatjs_library_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Known formatjs Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities in formatjs Library [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Application Uses Vulnerable Version of formatjs [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Like any software, `formatjs` might have publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated, vulnerable version of the `formatjs` library.
            *   **Example:** A publicly disclosed XSS vulnerability exists in `formatjs` version X. The application uses version X, making it vulnerable to exploitation using readily available exploit code.
            *   **Mitigation:** Keep the `formatjs` library updated to the latest stable version. Regularly check for security advisories and release notes for `formatjs` and apply updates promptly. Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable versions.

*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in formatjs Dependencies [CRITICAL]::**
        *   **Application Uses Vulnerable Versions of formatjs Dependencies [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** `formatjs` relies on other JavaScript libraries as dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect applications using `formatjs`. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in these dependencies if the application uses outdated versions.
            *   **Example:** A dependency of `formatjs` has a known security vulnerability. By exploiting this dependency vulnerability, an attacker can compromise the application using `formatjs`.
            *   **Mitigation:** Keep `formatjs` dependencies updated. Use dependency management tools (like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`) to identify and update vulnerable dependencies of `formatjs`. Regularly review and update project dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration or Misuse of formatjs [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_or_misuse_of_formatjs__critical_.md)

*   **Misuse of formatjs API [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Incorrect Usage of formatjs API Leading to Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Developer Fails to Properly Sanitize Inputs Before Passing to formatjs Formatting Functions [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Developers might misuse the `formatjs` API by failing to properly sanitize user inputs before passing them to `formatjs` formatting functions. This can lead to vulnerabilities, primarily XSS, even if `formatjs` itself is secure.
            *   **Example:** Developers might directly pass user input to `formatjs`'s `formatMessage` function without any prior sanitization or encoding, assuming `formatjs` will handle security automatically. This assumption is incorrect and can lead to XSS if the formatted output is rendered in a browser.
            *   **Mitigation:** Educate developers on secure usage of the `formatjs` API. Provide clear guidelines and code examples demonstrating secure usage, especially regarding handling user inputs and HTML escaping. Conduct code reviews to identify and correct potential misuse of the `formatjs` API.
