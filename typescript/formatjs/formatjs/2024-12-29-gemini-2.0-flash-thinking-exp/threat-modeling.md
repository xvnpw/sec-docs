Here's the updated threat list, focusing only on high and critical threats directly involving the `formatjs` library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Locale Data Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted or malicious locale data to the application, which is then processed by `formatjs`. This could involve injecting data with unexpected structures, excessively long strings, or patterns that exploit vulnerabilities in `formatjs`'s parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Maliciously crafted locale data with excessively complex patterns could consume significant resources within `formatjs` during processing, leading to application slowdown or crashes.
        *   **Client-Side Injection (Indirect):** Malicious locale data could be crafted to produce output that, when rendered by the application's frontend, leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if not properly handled by the application *after* `formatjs` processing. The vulnerability lies in the data processed by `formatjs`.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `@formatjs/intl` (core internationalization functionalities)
        *   Locale data parsing logic within `@formatjs/intl`
        *   Message parsing and formatting functions within `@formatjs/intl` when processing locale-specific data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate and Sanitize Locale Data *Before* `formatjs` Processing:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of all locale data received from external sources or user input *before* it is passed to `formatjs` functions. Ensure data conforms to expected formats and does not contain unexpected or malicious characters.
        *   **Use Trusted Locale Data Sources:** Rely on well-established and trusted sources for locale data. Avoid allowing users or untrusted external sources to directly provide or modify locale data that will be used by `formatjs`.
        *   **Regularly Update `formatjs`:** Keep the `formatjs` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that might address vulnerabilities in locale data parsing.

*   **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Locale Data or Message Parsing
    *   **Description:** `formatjs` relies on regular expressions for parsing locale data and message formats. An attacker could provide input (either as part of locale data or within messages) that causes catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine used by `formatjs`. This leads to excessive CPU consumption *within the `formatjs` library* and can effectively cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to high CPU usage caused by `formatjs`'s parsing operations.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Locale data parsing logic within `@formatjs/intl` (specifically the regular expressions used)
        *   Message parsing logic within `@formatjs/intl` (specifically the regular expressions used)
        *   Potentially pluralization rule parsing within `@formatjs/intl` (if vulnerable regexes are used there)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review and Optimize `formatjs` Usage and Configuration:** While you can't directly modify `formatjs`'s internal regexes, understand how it processes data and avoid patterns or large inputs that might trigger ReDoS.
        *   **Input Length Limits:** Implement reasonable limits on the length of input strings that are processed by `formatjs`, especially for message content and potentially locale data, to reduce the potential for triggering ReDoS.
        *   **Timeouts for `formatjs` Operations (If Possible):** If the application architecture allows, consider implementing timeouts for `formatjs` parsing operations to prevent excessively long processing times caused by ReDoS.
        *   **Regularly Update `formatjs`:** Newer versions of `formatjs` may contain fixes or improvements to their internal regular expressions to prevent ReDoS vulnerabilities.
