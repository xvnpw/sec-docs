* **Locale Data Injection/Manipulation**
    * **Description:** An attacker injects or manipulates locale data used by `formatjs` to influence the application's behavior or display malicious content.
    * **How `formatjs` Contributes:** `formatjs` relies on external locale data (often JSON files) to format messages. If the application loads this data from untrusted sources or doesn't validate it, malicious data can be introduced and processed by `formatjs`.
    * **Example:** An attacker replaces a legitimate locale file with one containing a specially crafted message that, when rendered by `formatjs`, includes a malicious script tag.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), information disclosure, denial of service (if the malicious data causes parsing errors or resource exhaustion within `formatjs`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Sourcing:** Load locale data from trusted sources only (e.g., bundled with the application, reputable CDNs with integrity checks).
        * **Input Validation:** If loading locale data dynamically, rigorously validate the structure and content of the data before using it with `formatjs`.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

* **Injection Attacks via Message Formatting**
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious input into the message format string or the values passed to the formatter, leading to unintended behavior or information disclosure through `formatjs`.
    * **How `formatjs` Contributes:** `formatjs` uses ICU Message Syntax for formatting. If user-provided data is directly embedded into the format string without sanitization, attackers can manipulate the output generated by `formatjs` or potentially trigger errors within the `formatjs` processing.
    * **Example:** A format string like `formatjs.formatMessage({ id: 'greeting' }, { name: '<script>alert("XSS")</script>' })` could lead to XSS if the `name` is not properly sanitized before being used in the message defined in the locale file and processed by `formatjs`.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), information disclosure (through error messages or manipulated output from `formatjs`), potential for logic errors in how the application uses the formatted output.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Parameterization:** Always use parameterized formatting with `formatjs`. Define the message structure in the locale file and pass user-provided data as separate arguments to `formatjs.formatMessage`. Avoid constructing format strings dynamically with user input.
        * **Output Encoding:** Ensure that the output of `formatjs` is properly encoded for the context where it's being used (e.g., HTML escaping for web pages) *after* `formatjs` has processed it.
        * **Strict CSP:** Implement a strict CSP to further limit the impact of potential XSS.
