### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Command Injection via Online Help Feature

* **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Online Help Feature
* **Description:**
    1. The user triggers the "CMake: Online Help" command in VSCode.
    2. The extension prompts the user to enter a search term for the CMake online documentation.
    3. The user enters a malicious search term containing shell command injection payload, for example, `$(calc)`.
    4. The extension constructs a URL based on the user-provided search term.
    5. The extension uses the `opener` npm package to open this URL in the default web browser.
    6. If the `opener` package internally uses `child_process.exec` (or a similar function that executes commands through a shell) and doesn't sanitize the URL, the shell command embedded in the URL (e.g., `calc` in `$(calc)`) will be executed.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the machine where VSCode is running with the privileges of the VSCode process. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code directly uses user input to construct URLs and passes them to the `opener` function without any sanitization.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    * Input sanitization: Sanitize the user-provided search term to remove or escape shell-sensitive characters before constructing the URL. This could involve URL encoding the search term or using a more robust sanitization method to prevent command injection.
    * Use a safer method to open URLs: Instead of relying on `opener`, which might use `child_process.exec`, consider using a safer built-in VSCode API or a more secure library for opening URLs that avoids shell execution. For example, VSCode API `vscode.env.openExternal` might be a safer alternative if it doesn't involve shell execution.
* **Preconditions:**
    * The user must have the CMake extension for VSCode installed.
    * The user must execute the "CMake: Online Help" command.
    * The `opener` npm package must be vulnerable to command injection when handling URLs (specifically, if it uses `child_process.exec` internally).
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **`extension.ts:148`**: The `cmake_online_help` function is called with the user-provided `result` from the input box.
    2. **`extension.ts:150-183`**: Inside `cmake_online_help`, a URL is constructed based on `cmake_help_url()` and the `search` term (which is the `result` from input box).
    3. **`extension.ts:152`**: `var opener = require("opener");` - The `opener` package is loaded.
    4. **`extension.ts:160`, `extension.ts:165`, `extension.ts:175`, `extension.ts:180`**:  The `opener()` function is called with URLs that are constructed using the unsanitized `search` input. For example: `opener(url + 'search.html?q=' + search + '&check_keywords=yes&area=default');`
    5. The `opener` package, if it uses `child_process.exec` internally and doesn't sanitize the URL, will pass the constructed URL to the shell for execution. If the `search` string contains shell command injection payload like `$(command)`, the command will be executed.

        H --> I[Command from payload executed e.g., calc.exe];
        G -- No --> J[URL opened in browser normally];
    ```

* **Security Test Case:**
    1. Install the "CMake for Visual Studio Code" extension in VSCode.
    2. Open any CMakeLists.txt file or create a new one and set the language mode to CMake.
    3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the command palette.
    4. Type and select "CMake: Online Help".
    5. An input box will appear at the top of VSCode. In the input box, enter the following payload: `` `$(calc)` `` (for Windows, use `` `$(start calc.exe)` ``) or `` `$(touch /tmp/pwned)` `` (for Linux/macOS). Note: backticks are used here to enclose the payload for markdown, in the actual test case, use `$(calc)`.
    6. Press Enter.
    7. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable):**
        * On Windows, the Calculator application should open.
        * On Linux/macOS, a file named `pwned` should be created in the `/tmp/` directory.
    8. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated):**
        * The CMake online help page should open in the default web browser, and no command injection should occur. The calculator should not open, and the file `/tmp/pwned` should not be created.

#### Command Injection via `cmake.cmakePath` setting

* **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via `cmake.cmakePath` setting
* **Description:**
    1. The extension retrieves the CMake executable path from the `cmake.cmakePath` setting, which can be configured in user or workspace settings.
    2. The `commandArgs2Array` function attempts to parse the `cmake.cmakePath` string into an array of arguments. However, this parsing is insufficient to prevent command injection.
    3. The extension uses `child_process.spawn` to execute CMake commands. The first element of the parsed arguments array from `commandArgs2Array` is used as the command, and the rest are used as arguments.
    4. By crafting a malicious string in the `cmake.cmakePath` setting, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands. When the extension executes any CMake related feature (like hover information, completion, or online help), the injected commands will be executed.
* **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - Potential for data exfiltration, malware installation, or complete system compromise depending on the injected commands.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
* **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code uses `commandArgs2Array` to parse the path, but this does not prevent command injection.
* **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization for the `cmake.cmakePath` setting to prevent injection of shell metacharacters.
    - Use `child_process.spawn` with the `shell: false` option. This option prevents the shell from interpreting shell metacharacters in the command and arguments, executing the command directly.
    - Validate that the provided path in `cmake.cmakePath` points to a legitimate CMake executable.
* **Preconditions:**
    * The user must have the "CMake for Visual Studio Code" extension installed and activated.
    * An attacker must be able to influence the user to set a malicious `cmake.cmakePath` setting. This could be achieved through:
        - Social engineering, tricking the user into manually changing their user or workspace settings.
        - Contributing a malicious workspace configuration to a public repository that a user might clone and open in VS Code.
* **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Configuration Loading:** The `config<T>('cmakePath', 'cmake')` function in `extension.ts` retrieves the value of the `cmake.cmakePath` setting.
    ```typescript
    function config<T>(key: string, defaultValue?: any): T {
        const cmake_conf = workspace.getConfiguration('cmake');
        return cmake_conf.get<T>(key, defaultValue);
    }
    ```
    2. **Argument Parsing:** The `commandArgs2Array` function is used to split the `cmakePath` string into an array of arguments. This function is intended to handle quoted arguments but does not sanitize for shell command injection.
    ```typescript
    function commandArgs2Array(text: string): string[] {
        // ... (argument parsing logic) ...
    }
    ```
    3. **Command Execution:** The `cmake` function uses `child_process.spawn` to execute the CMake command. It takes the first element of the array returned by `commandArgs2Array` as the command and the rest as arguments.
    ```typescript
    let cmake = (args: string[]): Promise<string> => {
        return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            let cmake_config = config<string>('cmakePath', 'cmake');
            let cmake_args = commandArgs2Array(cmake_config)
            let cmd = child_process.spawn(cmake_args[0], cmake_args.slice(1, cmake_args.length)
                .concat(args.map(arg => { return arg.replace(/\r/gm, ''); })));
            // ...
        });
    }
    ```
    - **Vulnerability Point:** If a user sets `cmake.cmakePath` to a malicious string like `"malicious; echo vulnerable > /tmp/pwned"`, the `commandArgs2Array` function might parse `"malicious;` as the command and `echo vulnerable > /tmp/pwned"` as an argument, or it might not correctly split at all, leading `child_process.spawn` to execute `malicious; echo vulnerable > /tmp/pwned` via the shell. Because `shell: true` is not explicitly set to false, it defaults to the platform default (true on Windows, false on others but behavior is still shell-like). Even on platforms where shell is false by default, certain characters like `;` might still be interpreted by `spawn` depending on the underlying system call. It is safer to assume shell injection is possible given the current code.

* **Security Test Case for Workspace Setting:**
    1. Create a malicious workspace:
        a. Create a folder named `cmake-injection-test`.
        b. Inside `cmake-injection-test`, create a folder named `.vscode`.
        c. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
        ```json
        {
            "cmake.cmakePath": "cmake && touch /tmp/cmake-extension-pwned"
        }
        ```
        d. Create an empty file named `CMakeLists.txt` in `cmake-injection-test`.
    2. Open VSCode.
    3. Open the `cmake-injection-test` folder as a workspace in VSCode.
    4. Open the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the opened workspace. This action should trigger the CMake extension to become active and potentially execute CMake commands.
    5. After a short delay (to allow the extension to initialize and potentially execute cmake), check if the file `/tmp/cmake-extension-pwned` has been created.
    6. If the file `/tmp/cmake-extension-pwned` exists, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed. This indicates that the malicious command part of `cmake.cmakePath` setting was executed.

* **Security Test Case for User Setting:**
    1. Install the "CMake for Visual Studio Code" extension in VS Code.
    2. Open VS Code without opening any workspace.
    3. Open User Settings (`File > Preferences > Settings` or `Code > Settings` on macOS).
    4. Search for `cmake.cmakePath`.
    5. Click on "Edit in settings.json" under the "User" tab to open `settings.json`.
    6. Add or modify the `cmake.cmakePath` setting to the following malicious command:
    ```json
    {
        "cmake.cmakePath": "bash -c 'touch /tmp/pwned && cmake'"
    }
    ```
    7. Save the `settings.json` file.
    8. Open any folder as workspace, and create or open a `CMakeLists.txt` file.
    9. Trigger any CMake extension feature, for example, hover over a CMake command in `CMakeLists.txt`.
    10. Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created. If yes, command injection via user setting is confirmed.
