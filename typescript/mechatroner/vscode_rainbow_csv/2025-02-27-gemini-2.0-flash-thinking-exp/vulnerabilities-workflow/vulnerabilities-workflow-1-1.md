- Vulnerability name: Path Traversal in RBQL JOIN Table Path
- Description: An attacker could craft a malicious RBQL query with a `JOIN` clause that includes path traversal characters (e.g., `../`) in the table path. When the extension attempts to resolve this path using `find_table_path` function, it might access files or directories outside the intended workspace directory, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized file access.
    1. User opens a CSV file in VSCode and activates the Rainbow CSV extension.
    2. User opens the RBQL console and enters a query that includes a `JOIN` clause.
    3. In the `JOIN` clause, the user specifies a table path that contains path traversal characters, such as `JOIN ../../../sensitive_file.csv ON a1 == b1`.
    4. When the RBQL query is executed, the `VSCodeFileSystemCSVRegistry` attempts to resolve the table path using the `find_table_path` function in `rainbow_utils.js`.
    5. Due to insufficient validation, `find_table_path` resolves the path with traversal characters, potentially leading to access of `sensitive_file.csv` outside the workspace directory.
- Impact: An external attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the user's file system that the VSCode process has access to, by crafting a malicious RBQL query and tricking the user into executing it against a CSV file opened in VSCode. This could lead to information disclosure of sensitive data.
- Vulnerability rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None in the provided code related to path traversal prevention for RBQL JOIN table paths. Analysis of `rainbow_utils.js`, `rbql_suggest.js`, `rbql_client.js`, `fast_load_utils.js` and `extension.js`, `dialect_select.js`, `contrib/textarea-caret-position/index.js`, `contrib/wcwidth/index.js`, `contrib/wcwidth/combining.js`, `rbql_core/rbql-js/csv_utils.js`, `rbql_core/rbql-js/cli_parser.js`, `rbql_core/rbql-js/cli_rbql.js`, and `rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql.js`, and `test/suite/unit_tests.js` did not reveal any implemented mitigations in addition to previously analyzed files.
- Missing mitigations: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for the `table_id` parameter in the `find_table_path` function in `rainbow_utils.js`. Ensure that resolved paths are always within the intended workspace or a predefined safe directory. Consider using secure path resolution methods that prevent traversal outside allowed boundaries.
- Preconditions:
    1. The Rainbow CSV extension is installed and active in VSCode.
    2. The user has opened a CSV file in VSCode.
    3. The user executes an RBQL query that includes a `JOIN` clause.
    4. The attacker can influence the `table_id` used in the `JOIN` clause, either by social engineering or by pre-configuring a malicious CSV file or query.
- Source code analysis:
    1. In `rainbow_utils.js`, the `find_table_path` function is responsible for resolving table paths for JOIN clauses.
    2. The function uses `expanduser(table_id)` and `path.join(main_table_dir, candidate_path)` to construct file paths.
    3. It checks for file existence using `fs.existsSync` but does not sanitize `table_id` for path traversal characters like `../` before path construction.
    ```javascript
    function find_table_path(vscode_global_state, main_table_dir, table_id) {
        // If table_id is a relative path it could be relative either to the current directory or to the main table dir.
        var candidate_path = expanduser(table_id);
        if (fs.existsSync(candidate_path)) {
            return candidate_path;
        }
        if (main_table_dir && !path.isAbsolute(candidate_path)) {
            candidate_path = path.join(main_table_dir, candidate_path);
            if (fs.existsSync(candidate_path)) {
                return candidate_path;
            }
        }
        let table_path = vscode_global_state ? vscode_global_state.get(make_table_name_key(table_id)) : null;
        if (table_path && fs.existsSync(table_path)) {
            return table_path;
        }
        return null;
    }
    ```
    4. The `rbql_query_node` function in `rainbow_utils.js` creates a `VSCodeFileSystemCSVRegistry` instance, which uses `find_table_path` to resolve table paths during query execution. This confirms that the path traversal vulnerability can be triggered in Node.js backend.
- Security test case:
    1. Create two CSV files in separate directories: `workspace_dir/data.csv` and `sensitive_dir/sensitive.csv`. Place some sensitive data in `sensitive_dir/sensitive.csv`.
    2. Open `workspace_dir/data.csv` in VSCode.
    3. Open the RBQL console in VSCode (using command "Rainbow CSV: RBQL").
    4. In the RBQL console, enter the following query, assuming `sensitive_dir` is in the parent directory of `workspace_dir`:
       `SELECT * JOIN ../sensitive_dir/sensitive.csv ON a1 == b1`
    5. Execute the query.
    6. Observe if the query successfully executes and retrieves data from `sensitive.csv`. If it does, this confirms the path traversal vulnerability. An attacker could then attempt to access more sensitive files by adjusting the path in the `JOIN` clause.

- Vulnerability name: Potential Code Injection via RBQL Query `eval`
- Description: The RBQL query engine uses `eval` or similar dynamic code execution mechanisms to process user-defined expressions within RBQL queries (e.g., in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY` clauses). If an attacker can inject malicious code into these expressions, they could achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the VSCode extension.
    1. User opens a CSV file in VSCode and activates the Rainbow CSV extension.
    2. User opens a CSV file in VSCode.
    3. User opens the RBQL console and enters a malicious RBQL query.
    4. The malicious query contains code designed to be executed by the RBQL engine's `eval` mechanism. For example, in JavaScript backend: `SELECT a1, eval('process.exit()') FROM input`. Or in Python backend: `SELECT a1, __import__('os').system('calc') FROM input`.
    5. When the RBQL query is executed, the RBQL engine processes the malicious expression using `eval` or similar function.
    6. The injected code is executed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
- Impact: Critical. Successful code injection can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine, allowing a malicious actor to take complete control of the user's system, steal data, install malware, or perform other harmful actions.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None in the provided code. The design of RBQL, as described in `rbql_core/README.md` (from previous analysis) and confirmed by `rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql.js` (from previous analysis), explicitly relies on `eval` for query execution, without any apparent sandboxing or security measures. Analysis of `rainbow_utils.js`, `rbql_suggest.js`, `rbql_client.js`, `fast_load_utils.js` and `extension.js`, `dialect_select.js`, `contrib/textarea-caret-position/index.js`, `contrib/wcwidth/index.js`, `contrib/wcwidth/combining.js`, `rbql_core/rbql-js/csv_utils.js`, `rbql_core/rbql-js/cli_parser.js`, `rbql_core/rbql-js/cli_rbql.js`, `rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql.js` and `test/suite/unit_tests.js` did not reveal any implemented mitigations in addition to previously analyzed files.
- Missing mitigations: Implement robust sandboxing for RBQL query execution to prevent arbitrary code execution.  Instead of `eval`, consider using a safer approach for expression evaluation, such as a secure JavaScript/Python sandbox environment or a different query processing architecture that does not rely on dynamic code execution of user-provided expressions in a potentially unsafe manner. Input sanitization is unlikely to be sufficient because the intended functionality of RBQL is to allow flexible and powerful expressions.
- Preconditions:
    1. The Rainbow CSV extension is installed and active in VSCode.
    2. The user has opened a CSV file in VSCode.
    3. The user executes an RBQL query.
    4. The attacker can craft a malicious RBQL query containing injectable code. This could be achieved through social engineering (tricking a user into running a malicious query) or by embedding the malicious query in a CSV file that a user might open and query.
- Source code analysis:
    1. The `rbql_query_node` and `rbql_query_web` functions in `rainbow_utils.js` are used to execute RBQL queries.
    2. Both functions call `rbql.query` from `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql.js`.
    3. The file `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql.js` confirms this by using `eval(main_loop_body)` in the `compile_and_run` function to execute the generated query code.
    ```javascript
    async function compile_and_run(query_context) {
        let main_loop_body = generate_main_loop_code(query_context);
        try {
            let main_loop_promise = eval(main_loop_body); // Vulnerable line: Using eval to execute dynamically generated code
            await main_loop_promise;
        } catch (e) {
            // ... error handling ...
            throw e;
        }
    }
    ```
- Security test case:
    1. Open a CSV file in VSCode.
    2. Open the RBQL console (using command "Rainbow CSV: RBQL").
    3. In the RBQL console, enter the following query (for JavaScript backend):
       `SELECT a1, eval('process.exit()') FROM input`
       or (for Python backend):
       `SELECT a1, __import__('os').system('calc') FROM input`
    4. Execute the query.
    5. If the query with `eval('process.exit()')` causes the VSCode extension host process to terminate (or the entire VSCode in web version), it confirms code injection. If the Python query with `__import__('os').system('calc')` opens a calculator application, it also confirms code injection in Python backend. These are just examples; more sophisticated malicious code can be injected.
