- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via RBQL JOIN Query  
  **Description:**  
  An attacker can supply a malicious CSV file containing an embedded RBQL query with a JOIN clause that uses a specially crafted join table identifier (for example, an absolute or traversal‑manipulated path). The extension uses an insecure file‑resolution routine that simply performs tilde‑expansion and checks for existence using fs.existsSync without normalizing or restricting the resolved path to trusted directories. In this update the same unsafe resolution logic is found not only in extension.js and core RBQL modules but also in the RBQL CSV parsing module (rbql_csv.js), further increasing the attack surface.  
  **Impact:**  
  If a user opens a CSV file containing such a malicious RBQL query, the extension may read (and possibly expose) arbitrary files from the local file system. This could result in the disclosure of sensitive system or user data.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The file–resolution logic simply expands the tilde (via the expanduser() function) and confirms file existence with fs.existsSync.  
  - No additional checks (such as path normalization, allow‑list enforcement, or sandboxing) are performed.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Normalize and validate the user‑supplied join table identifiers before using them in file‑system calls.  
  - Enforce a strict allow‑list or sandboxing mechanism so that file paths must reside in pre‑approved directories.  
  - Centralize file‑resolution logic into a module with bounds checking and proper error handling.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker can supply (or trick the user into opening) a CSV file containing an embedded RBQL query with a JOIN clause.  
  - The join table identifier is manipulated (for example, as an absolute path or using directory‑traversal sequences) to point to a sensitive file that actually exists and is readable on the target’s system.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In **rbql_csv.js** the function `find_table_path(main_table_dir, table_id)` first calls `expanduser(table_id)` which only substitutes a leading tilde without additional sanitization.  
  - It then checks if the candidate path exists using fs.existsSync. If not, and if a main table directory is available, the routine attempts to resolve the path relative to that directory—all without normalization or allow‑listing.  
  - Finally, it may fall back to looking up file names from a settings index (stored in the user’s home directory); again, no checks are made on whether the resolved path is acceptable.  
  - Similar insecure logic is duplicated in other modules (such as extension.js and the RBQL core code), meaning that an attacker needs only to compromise one entry point to access arbitrary files.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Craft a CSV file containing an RBQL query with a JOIN clause. In the JOIN clause, supply a join table identifier that is an absolute path to a sensitive file (for example, `/etc/passwd` on a Unix‐like system or a critical system file on Windows).  
  2. Open the CSV file in VSCode with the Rainbow CSV extension installed.  
  3. Execute the RBQL query (or invoke the command that triggers join‑table resolution).  
  4. Verify (for example, by examining logs or query output) that the extension attempts to open the file at the supplied path and that the sensitive contents of that file are processed or exposed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Predictable Temporary File Creation in Unsaved Documents  
  **Description:**  
  When a user runs an RBQL query on an unsaved (“untitled”) CSV document, the extension saves the document’s contents to a temporary file so that it can be processed. The temporary file name is generated by concatenating a fixed prefix with a Math.random()‑based number (with limited entropy) and an extension (such as “.txt”). Because Math.random() is not cryptographically secure and no atomic temporary‑file creation API is used, an attacker or a locally running malicious process may be able to pre‑calculate the temporary file’s name, pre‑create it, or otherwise interfere with its creation.  
  **Impact:**  
  A local attacker (or malicious process running on the same system) could race to pre‑create or modify the temporary file, potentially intercepting or altering the sensitive contents of a document before the RBQL query processes it. This may result in data leakage or manipulation.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - Temporary file names for unsaved documents are generated via Math.random() and are written using fs.writeFileSync without utilizing atomic or cryptographically secure functions.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Use a cryptographically secure source of randomness (for example, crypto.randomBytes) to generate unpredictable file name suffixes.  
  - Use an atomic temporary‑file creation API (for example, fs.mkdtemp or a dedicated temp‑file library) to safely create temporary files with correct permissions.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The user initiates an RBQL query on an unsaved (“untitled”) CSV document.  
  - The attacker (or a malicious local process) has local access and can predict or race to pre‑create the temporary file using the predictable naming scheme.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - Although the main code for temporary file creation (typically in the extension’s command handler) is not shown in this batch, our earlier review and references in the test files confirm that unsaved documents are written to temporary locations using a name constructed by appending a Math.floor(Math.random() * [limit]) value.  
  - This low‑entropy scheme (approximately one million possible values) may allow an attacker to guess the name of the file.  
  - In addition, the file is created using a non‑atomic call (e.g. fs.writeFileSync), meaning there is a window during which a race condition can occur.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. Open an unsaved (“untitled”) CSV document containing sensitive information in VSCode.  
  2. Run an RBQL query so that the extension attempts to write the document’s contents to a temporary file using the predictable naming scheme.  
  3. Simulate an attacker (or run a local helper process) that calculates the potential temporary file names based on the known fixed prefix and limited range of Math.random().  
  4. Attempt to pre‑create or monitor one of these file names.  
  5. Verify that the temporary file creation is intercepted or that the file contents are exposed or modifiable, thereby confirming that an attacker may exploit the predictability.
