- Vulnerability Name: RBQL Query Code Injection

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious RBQL query that includes JavaScript code.
  2. The user executes this query within the Rainbow CSV RBQL console.
  3. Due to the eval-based nature of RBQL in `rbql.js`, the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the query is executed within the extension's context.

- Impact:
  - **High**: Arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension's context. This could allow an attacker to:
    - Read or modify files accessible to the VSCode extension.
    - Exfiltrate sensitive information.
    - Potentially escalate privileges or compromise the user's VSCode environment.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - None apparent in the provided code. The core logic in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql.js` relies on `eval` to execute dynamically generated JavaScript code from RBQL queries. This design is confirmed by the presence of `eval(main_loop_body)` within the `compile_and_run` function.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Input sanitization for RBQL queries to prevent code injection.
  - Sandboxing or isolation of RBQL execution environment to limit the impact of code execution vulnerabilities.
  - Ideally, move away from `eval` based execution to a safer parsing and execution strategy for RBQL queries, if feasible.

- Preconditions:
  - The user must execute a malicious RBQL query provided by the attacker.
  - The attacker needs to convince the user to copy and paste or manually type in a malicious RBQL query into the RBQL console.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - The file `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql.js` contains the vulnerable code.
  - The `compile_and_run` function uses `eval(main_loop_body)` to execute the generated JavaScript code.
  - The `main_loop_body` is generated by the `generate_main_loop_code` function. This function embeds user-controlled expressions from the RBQL query into predefined JavaScript code templates.
  - For example, the `PROCESS_SELECT_COMMON`, `PROCESS_SELECT_SIMPLE`, and `PROCESS_SELECT_JOIN` templates in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql.js` show placeholders like `__RBQLMP__select_expression` and `__RBQLMP__where_expression` which are replaced with user-provided RBQL expressions without sanitization before being passed to `eval`.
  - The function `generate_main_loop_code` in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql.js` shows how these templates are used and how user-provided expressions are embedded using functions like `embed_expression` and `embed_code`.
  - No input validation or sanitization is performed on the RBQL query before it's processed and executed using `eval`.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Open a CSV file in VSCode with the Rainbow CSV extension activated.
  2. Execute the "RBQL" command to open the RBQL console.
  3. In the RBQL input field, enter the following malicious query:
     ```rbql
     SELECT a1, a2, (() => { const fs = require('fs'); fs.writeFileSync('pwned.txt', 'Successfully executed malicious code!'); return 'pwned'; })() AS a3 FROM input
     ```
  4. Click the "Run" button or press Enter.
  5. After the query execution, check if a file named `pwned.txt` has been created in the extension's workspace or a predictable location. If the file exists and contains the expected content, the code injection vulnerability is confirmed.
  6. **Expected Result:** The file `pwned.txt` is created, demonstrating arbitrary code execution.

- Vulnerability Name: RBQL JOIN Query File Path Traversal

- Description:
  1. An attacker crafts a malicious RBQL JOIN query that specifies a relative file path for the join table, attempting to traverse directories outside the intended workspace.
  2. When the user executes this query, the extension uses the provided relative path without proper validation.
  3. The `FileSystemCSVRegistry` in `rbql_csv.js` uses `find_table_path` (defined in `/code/rbql_csv.js`) to resolve the join table path. If `find_table_path` or the underlying file access mechanisms don't prevent path traversal, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the user's file system.

- Impact:
  - **High**: Arbitrary file read vulnerability. An attacker can potentially read sensitive files from the user's system that the VSCode extension process has access to.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
  - The code in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql_csv.js` includes `expanduser` and `find_table_path`. `expanduser` expands the `~` to the user's home directory, which is not a mitigation for path traversal.
  - The `find_table_path` function in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql_csv.js` checks for the existence of the file in the current workspace and home directory, and also in a pre-defined table names index, but it does not prevent path traversal using relative paths like `../../../sensitive_data.txt`.

- Missing Mitigations:
  - Strict validation and sanitization of file paths provided in RBQL JOIN queries within the `find_table_path` function in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql_csv.js`.
  - Implement path canonicalization to resolve symbolic links and prevent traversal using ".." sequences in the `find_table_path` function in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql_csv.js`.
  - Restrict file access for JOIN operations to a designated workspace or a whitelist of allowed directories in the `find_table_path` function in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql_csv.js`.

- Preconditions:
  - The user must execute a malicious RBQL JOIN query provided by the attacker.
  - The attacker needs to convince the user to use a crafted RBQL JOIN query with a malicious relative path.
  - The target file must be readable by the VSCode extension process.

- Source Code Analysis:
  - In `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql_csv.js`, the `FileSystemCSVRegistry` class is used for resolving table paths for JOIN operations.
  - The `get_iterator_by_table_id` method in `FileSystemCSVRegistry` calls `find_table_path` (defined in the same file) to resolve the table path.
  - The `find_table_path` function in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql_csv.js` attempts to find the table path by checking:
    - If the provided `table_id` is an absolute path and exists.
    - If the provided `table_id` is a relative path, it tries to resolve it relative to the `main_table_dir` (workspace directory) and checks if it exists.
    - It also checks a pre-defined table names index file in the user's home directory (`~/.rbql_table_names`).
  - While `find_table_path` checks for file existence using `fs.existsSync`, it lacks proper path traversal sanitization or checks to prevent accessing files outside the intended workspace or allowed directories. It uses `expanduser` which expands `~` but does not prevent path traversal.
  - The code in `FileSystemCSVRegistry` directly uses the resolved path to create a read stream using `fs.createReadStream(this.table_path)` in `/code/rbql_core/rbql-js/rbql_csv.js`, without any further validation.

- Security Test Case:
  1. Open a CSV file in VSCode with the Rainbow CSV extension activated.
  2. Create a sensitive file (e.g., `sensitive_data.txt`) in a directory outside your workspace, but accessible by your user account. For example, in your home directory.
  3. Execute the "RBQL" command to open the RBQL console.
  4. In the RBQL input field, enter the following malicious JOIN query, replacing `/path/to/your/workspace` with the absolute path to your current VSCode workspace and `/path/to/sensitive_data.txt` with the absolute path to the sensitive file created in step 2:
     ```rbql
     SELECT a1, b1 FROM input INNER JOIN ../../../../../path/to/sensitive_data.txt ON a1 == b1
     ```
     Or using relative path if workspace structure allows:
     ```rbql
     SELECT a1, b1 FROM input INNER JOIN ../../../sensitive_data.txt ON a1 == b1
     ```
  5. Click the "Run" button or press Enter.
  6. Examine the RBQL output. If the query executes without error and attempts to process data from `sensitive_data.txt`, it indicates a potential file path traversal vulnerability, even if the join condition doesn't produce any results.
  7. To confirm file read, modify the sensitive file to contain a unique string and check if this string appears in the RBQL output or error messages if the join operation tries to parse it as CSV.
  8. **Expected Result:** The extension attempts to read and process `sensitive_data.txt` from outside the workspace, confirming the path traversal vulnerability. Error messages indicating file access or parsing errors from the sensitive file would also confirm the vulnerability.
