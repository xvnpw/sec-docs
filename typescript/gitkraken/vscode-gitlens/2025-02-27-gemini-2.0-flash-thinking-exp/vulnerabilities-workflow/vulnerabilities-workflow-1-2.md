- vulnerability name: Terminal Link Command Injection
- description: The `GitTerminalLinkProvider` in `/code/src/terminal/linkProvider.ts` parses terminal output to create clickable links that execute GitLens commands. It uses regular expressions (`commandsRegexShared`, `refRegexShared`) to identify Git commands, references (branches, tags, SHAs). If an attacker can inject specially crafted text into the terminal output, they might be able to manipulate the regex matching and trigger unintended GitLens commands. For example, by crafting a terminal output line that includes a Git command and malicious arguments disguised as a legitimate reference, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary Git commands via the GitLens extension by tricking a user to click on the generated terminal link. The vulnerability lies in the potential for regex-based parsing to be bypassed by carefully crafted terminal output, leading to unintended command execution when a user clicks a seemingly benign terminal link. An attacker can influence terminal output by running scripts or commands that generate specific output.
- impact: High. Successful command injection via terminal links could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary GitLens commands within the context of the user's VSCode environment. This could lead to information disclosure (e.g., `git log`, `git show`), or potentially even more harmful actions depending on the available GitLens commands and their arguments if more complex injection is possible. While direct harmful actions via Git commands are limited due to VSCode's security model, unexpected or unintended command execution is still a significant security concern and can lead to user confusion and potential misuse.
- vulnerability rank: high
- currently implemented mitigations: Unknown. Based on the provided files in this and previous batches, there are no explicit input sanitization or validation mechanisms in command files: `/code/src/commands/git/branch.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/coauthors.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/rebase.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/log.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/worktree.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/push.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/cherry-pick.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/reset.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/fetch.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/switch.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/remote.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/revert.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/show.ts`, `/code/src/commands/diffWith.ts`, `/code/src/commands/browseRepoAtRevision.ts`, `/code/src/commands/diffFolderWithRevision.ts`, `/code/src/commands/switchAIModel.ts`, `/code/src/commands/quickWizard.base.ts`, `/code/src/commands/closeUnchangedFiles.ts`, `/code/src/commands/quickCommand.buttons.ts`, `/code/src/commands/createPullRequestOnRemote.ts`, `/code/src/commands/diffWithNext.ts`, `/code/src/commands/showQuickFileHistory.ts`, `/code/src/commands/logging.ts`, `/code/src/commands/stashSave.ts`, `/code/src/commands/commandContext.ts`, `/code/src/commands/quickCommand.ts`, `/code/src/commands/openAssociatedPullRequestOnRemote.ts`, `/code/src/commands/showQuickCommit.ts`, `/code/src/commands/addAuthors.ts`, `/code/src/commands/openFileAtRevision.ts`, `/code/src/commands/refreshHover.ts`, `/code/src/commands/stashApply.ts`, `/code/src/commands/copyShaToClipboard.ts`, `/code/src/commands/remoteProviders.ts`, `/code/src/commands/openBranchOnRemote.ts`, `/code/src/commands/openComparisonOnRemote.ts`, `/code/src/commands/toggleFileAnnotations.ts`, `/code/src/commands/openFileAtRevisionFrom.ts`, `/code/src/commands/ghpr/openOrCreateWorktree.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/tag.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/pull.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/search.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/merge.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/stash.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/status.ts` or `quickCommand.buttons.ts` or integration files: `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/azure/models.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/azure/azure.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/bitbucket/bitbucket.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/bitbucket/models.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/github.utils.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/models.ts`, `/code/src/integrations/providers/github/githubGitProvider.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/github.ts`, `/code/src/integrations/providers/github/utils/-webview/search.utils.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/__tests__/github.utils.test.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/sub-providers/contributors.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/sub-providers/revision.ts` or git related files in current batch: `/code/src/git/gitProviderService.ts`, `/code/src/git/search.ts`, `/code/src/git/errors.ts`, `/code/src/git/queryResults.ts`, `/code/src/git/commandOptions.ts`, `/code/src/git/gitUri.utils.ts`, `/code/src/git/cache.ts`, `/code/src/git/actions.ts`, `/code/src/git/gitProvider.ts`, `/code/src/git/gitUri.ts`, `/code/src/git/fsProvider.ts`, `/code/src/git/gitUri.authority.ts`, `/code/src/git/location/repositorylocationProvider.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/tag.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/revision.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/pullRequest.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/mergeConflict.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/remoteResource.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/patch.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/issueOrPullRequest.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/repository.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/reference.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/author.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/stash.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/status.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/branch.ts` to prevent command injection in `GitTerminalLinkProvider`. The parsing relies on regular expressions, which can be vulnerable to bypasses if not carefully constructed and if the input is attacker-controlled.
- missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: Terminal output should be sanitized before being parsed by the `GitTerminalLinkProvider`.  Specifically, the parts of the terminal output that are used to construct commands or arguments should be validated against a strict whitelist.
    - Command validation: Before executing a command based on a terminal link, the extension should validate that the command and its arguments are expected and safe. A whitelist of allowed commands and argument patterns should be implemented.
    - User confirmation: For terminal links that could potentially execute commands with side effects (e.g., commands other than simple information retrieval), a user confirmation prompt should be displayed before executing the command.
- preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the text output to the VSCode terminal. This could be achieved by:
        - Running a malicious script or program in the terminal.
        - Injecting text into the terminal's output stream if the user is using a compromised or malicious terminal integration.
    - The user must click on the maliciously crafted terminal link generated by the `GitTerminalLinkProvider`.
- source code analysis:
    - `/code/src/terminal/linkProvider.ts`: This file contains the `GitTerminalLinkProvider` class, responsible for parsing terminal output and creating terminal links. (file not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
    - The `provideTerminalLinks` method uses regular expressions `commandsRegexShared` and `refRegexShared` to find potential Git commands and references in the terminal output (`context.line`). (code not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
    - `commandsRegexShared = /\b(g(?:it)?\b\s*)\b(branch|checkout|cherry-pick|fetch|grep|log|merge|pull|push|rebase|reset|revert|show|stash|status|tag)\b/gi;` - This regex captures git commands. (regex definition from previous analysis)
    - `refRegexShared = /\b((?!.*\/\.)(?!.*\.\.)(?!.*\/\/)(?!.*@\{)[^\x00-\x1F\x7F ,~^:?*[\\]+[^ ./])\b/gi;` - This regex captures references (branches, tags, SHAs). (regex definition from previous analysis)
    - When a command or reference is matched, a `GitTerminalLink` object is created with a `command` property. This `command` property contains the GitLens command to be executed and its arguments, derived from the matched text. (code not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
    - The `handleTerminalLink` method simply executes the command specified in the `GitTerminalLink` using `commands.executeCommand(link.command.command, link.command.args);`. (code not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
    - **Vulnerability Point**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of the extracted command and arguments before execution. If the regular expressions can be manipulated to extract malicious commands or arguments from attacker-controlled terminal output, arbitrary GitLens commands could be executed. For example, if `refRegexShared` can be tricked into matching a string like `branch --delete -f malicious-branch`, and if `GlCommand.ShowQuickBranchHistory` can be triggered with arbitrary branch names, then clicking the link could lead to unexpected actions.

    ```

- security test case:
    1. **Preparation**:  Set up a VSCode workspace with GitLens extension enabled and open a terminal in VSCode.
    2. **Craft Malicious Terminal Output**: In the terminal, echo a string that is designed to be parsed by `GitTerminalLinkProvider` as a legitimate Git command and reference, but contains malicious intent. For example, try to inject a command that might be parsed as a branch name but includes command options. A simple test case is to try to trigger `GlCommand.ShowQuickBranchHistory` with a malicious branch name. Try echoing a line like: `git branch malicious-branch --delete -f`.
    3. **Trigger Link Generation**: Ensure that the terminal output containing the malicious string is processed by the `GitTerminalLinkProvider`. This should happen automatically as terminal output is rendered. Look for a generated terminal link in the output line.
    4. **Examine Generated Link**: Hover over the generated terminal link. Check the tooltip and if possible, examine the actual command and arguments that would be executed if the link is clicked. The goal is to see if the malicious part of the crafted terminal output is being incorporated into the command arguments.
    5. **Click the Link**: Click on the generated terminal link.
    6. **Observe Behavior**: Observe the behavior of GitLens extension and VSCode. Check if any GitLens commands are executed, and if they are the intended commands or if the injected malicious parts are being executed. For this test case, check if a branch history view is opened, and if the branch name is as expected or contains the malicious injected parts.
    7. **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, clicking the link might execute a GitLens command with unintended or malicious arguments derived from the crafted terminal output. For example, in our test case with `git branch malicious-branch --delete -f`, if clicking the link attempts to show branch history for a branch named `malicious-branch --delete -f` (or something similar), it indicates a potential vulnerability. A successful exploitation would mean that the attacker can influence the arguments of the executed GitLens command through terminal output injection and user interaction (clicking the link). If no unexpected behavior is observed, and the link either does nothing malicious or is not generated at all, it suggests that there might be some level of mitigation or the injection attempt was not successful.

This test case focuses on demonstrating potential command injection by manipulating terminal output and leveraging the `GitTerminalLinkProvider`. Further research and more complex crafted outputs might be needed to fully explore the extent of this potential vulnerability.

- vulnerability name: Potential Git Command Injection in `git.ts` via `run` and `spawn` functions
- description: The `git.ts` file contains core functions `exec` and `spawn` that execute Git commands. These functions take command arguments as an array. However, there's a potential vulnerability if these arguments are constructed using user-controlled input without proper sanitization. An attacker might be able to inject malicious Git command options or subcommands by manipulating the arguments passed to `exec` or `spawn`. While the provided code doesn't directly show user input being used to construct these arguments, the *potential* exists wherever these functions are called with dynamically built arguments. For example, if a feature in the extension allows users to specify parts of a Git command (e.g., branch name, commit SHA) which are then incorporated into the arguments array for `exec` or `spawn` without validation, command injection could be possible. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious input that gets interpreted as Git command options, leading to unintended or harmful Git commands being executed. This vulnerability is relevant to all Git command execution logic in the provided files: `/code/src/commands/git/branch.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/coauthors.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/rebase.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/log.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/worktree.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/push.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/cherry-pick.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/reset.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/fetch.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/switch.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/remote.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/revert.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/show.ts` and also related to search functionality via `/code/src/git/search.ts`.
- impact: High. Successful Git command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Git commands within the context of the user's VSCode environment. This could lead to information disclosure, modification of Git repositories, or potentially other harmful actions depending on the injected commands. Although VSCode's security model limits the direct harm from Git commands, unexpected or unintended command execution is a significant security concern.
- vulnerability rank: high
- currently implemented mitigations: Unknown. Based on the provided command files: `/code/src/commands/git/branch.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/coauthors.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/rebase.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/log.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/worktree.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/push.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/cherry-pick.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/reset.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/fetch.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/switch.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/remote.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/revert.ts`, `/code/src/commands/git/show.ts` and `quickCommand.buttons.ts` and integration files: `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/azure/models.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/azure/azure.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/bitbucket/bitbucket.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/bitbucket/models.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/github.utils.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/models.ts`, `/code/src/integrations/providers/github/githubGitProvider.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/github.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/utils/-webview/search.utils.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/__tests__/github.utils.test.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/sub-providers/contributors.ts`, `/code/src/plus/integrations/providers/github/sub-providers/revision.ts` and git related files in current batch: `/code/src/git/gitProviderService.ts`, `/code/src/git/search.ts`, `/code/src/git/errors.ts`, `/code/src/git/queryResults.ts`, `/code/src/git/commandOptions.ts`, `/code/src/git/gitUri.utils.ts`, `/code/src/git/cache.ts`, `/code/src/git/actions.ts`, `/code/src/git/gitProvider.ts`, `/code/src/git/gitUri.ts`, `/code/src/git/fsProvider.ts`, `/code/src/git/gitUri.authority.ts`, `/code/src/git/location/repositorylocationProvider.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/tag.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/revision.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/pullRequest.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/mergeConflict.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/remoteResource.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/patch.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/issueOrPullRequest.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/repository.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/reference.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/author.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/stash.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/status.ts`, `/code/src/git/models/branch.ts`, there are no explicit input sanitization or validation mechanisms visible in the code that calls `exec` and `spawn` functions in `git.ts` to prevent command injection. The security relies on the assumption that the arguments passed to these functions are always constructed safely within the extension's codebase.
- missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: Any user-controlled input that contributes to the Git command arguments in `exec` or `spawn` calls must be rigorously validated and sanitized.
    - Argument whitelisting: Implement a whitelist of allowed Git commands and argument patterns for scenarios where user input is involved in command construction.  Ensure that only expected and safe commands and arguments can be formed.
    - Secure argument construction: Use secure methods for constructing command arguments, avoiding string concatenation or other methods that can easily lead to injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly handled.
- preconditions:
    - A feature or code path in the extension must exist where user-controlled input (e.g., from settings, commands, webview interactions, or potentially URIs) is used to construct the arguments for `git.ts`'s `exec` or `spawn` functions.
    - This user-controlled input must not be properly validated or sanitized before being incorporated into the Git command arguments.
- source code analysis:
    - `/code/src/env/node/git/git.ts`: This file contains the `Git` class with `exec` and `spawn` functions. (file not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
    - `exec<T extends string | Buffer>(options: GitCommandOptions, ...args: unknown[]): Promise<T>` and `spawn(options: GitSpawnOptions, ...args: any[]): Promise<ChildProcess>`: These functions are the core of Git command execution. They take `...args` which are passed directly to the `execFile` or `spawn` commands. (code not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
    - **Vulnerability Point**: The vulnerability lies in the potential for unsafe construction of the `args` array in calls to `exec` and `spawn` throughout the extension. If user input is incorporated into this `args` array without validation, it can lead to command injection. For example, if a function uses user-provided branch names or file paths directly in the `args` array without sanitization.

    ```
- security test case:
    1. **Preparation**: This test case requires identifying a code path within the GitLens extension where user input could potentially influence the arguments passed to `git.ts`'s `exec` or `spawn` functions. This requires broader code analysis beyond the provided files to find such a point of interaction. For this test case, we will *assume* there's a hypothetical command or setting that takes a user-provided string and uses it as part of a Git command argument.
    2. **Identify Injection Point (Hypothetical)**:  Imagine a command like `GitLens: Run Custom Git Command` which takes user input as a command argument.  Let's assume this command (hypothetically) constructs a Git command using the user input and calls `git.exec`.
    3. **Craft Malicious Input**:  For our hypothetical command, provide an input string designed to inject a malicious Git command option. For example, if the command is intended to run `git log <user_input>`, try providing input like `--author='attacker' --format='%H %an %ae %s'`.  The goal is to see if `--author` and `--format` are interpreted as Git options instead of being treated as part of a branch name or other expected argument.
    4. **Trigger Command Execution**: Execute the hypothetical `GitLens: Run Custom Git Command` with the crafted malicious input.
    5. **Observe Behavior**: Monitor the executed Git command (if possible, through logs or by observing the side effects). Check if the injected options (`--author`, `--format`) are indeed executed by Git, indicating command injection.  For instance, in our example, check if the output of `git log` is formatted according to `%H %an %ae %s` and filtered by the author 'attacker'.
    6. **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, the injected options will be executed by Git, demonstrating that user input can manipulate the Git command.  For example, the output of `git log` will be different from the expected output without the injected options. If no injection occurs, the Git command will behave as intended, ignoring or escaping the malicious input.
    7. **Code Review (if injection is successful)**: If the test case is successful, perform a code review to identify the exact code path where user input is unsafely incorporated into Git command arguments. Then, implement proper input validation and sanitization at that point.

This test case, while hypothetical, illustrates the *potential* for command injection in `git.ts` if user input is not carefully handled when constructing Git command arguments.  Real-world validation requires identifying actual code paths that use user input in this way and crafting specific injection payloads relevant to those contexts.

- vulnerability name: Potential Format String Vulnerability in `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate`
- description: The `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` function is used in `/code/src/webviews/settings/settings.ts` to generate a preview of configuration formats based on user-provided input in settings, and in `/code/src/webviews/commitDetails/commitDetailsWebview.ts` for rendering commit messages. If `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` is vulnerable to format string attacks, and if the user-provided format strings or commit data are not properly sanitized before being passed to this function, an attacker could potentially inject malicious format strings. This could lead to information disclosure, unexpected behavior, or potentially even code execution depending on the nature of the format string vulnerability and the capabilities of `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate`. The vulnerability is triggered when the extension renders commit details or settings previews that utilize user-controlled or externally influenced format strings.
- impact: High. A format string vulnerability in `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` could lead to information disclosure, unexpected behavior, or potentially code execution. The impact depends on the specific capabilities of `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` and the extent to which an attacker can control the format string.

Deeper source code analysis of `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` is needed to determine if it is vulnerable to format string attacks and if any internal sanitizations are implemented within this function.
- missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization:  User-provided format strings in settings and any external data used in commit messages that are processed by `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` should be rigorously sanitized before being passed to `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate`. Implement input validation to ensure that only expected formatting directives are allowed and that malicious format string sequences are escaped or removed.
    - Secure formatting function: Ensure that `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` itself is implemented using secure formatting practices that are not susceptible to format string injection vulnerabilities. If using template literals or similar string interpolation, ensure proper escaping or validation of user-provided format strings.
- preconditions:
    - For settings preview, the attacker needs to be able to control the format string in GitLens settings (e.g., Commit Format settings, Status Bar Format settings). This is directly achievable through VSCode settings UI.
    - For commit details, the attacker would need to influence the commit message content, which is generally harder for direct external attacks but could be relevant in scenarios where commit messages are processed from external sources or manipulated indirectly.
    - The `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` function must be vulnerable to format string attacks.
- source code analysis:
    - `/code/src/webviews/settings/settings.ts`: This file handles settings input and preview generation. It uses `GenerateConfigurationPreviewRequest` which likely calls `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` to generate previews. (file not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
    - `/code/src/webviews/commitDetails/commitDetailsWebview.ts`: This file uses `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` in the `getFormattedMessage` function to format commit messages for display in the commit details webview. (file not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
    - `/code/src/git/formatters/formatter.ts` and `/code/src/git/formatters/commitFormatter.ts`: These files contain the implementation of `Formatter` class and `CommitFormatter` class, including `fromTemplate` and `fromTemplateAsync` static methods. The `fromTemplateCore` and `fromTemplateCoreAsync` methods in `Formatter` class use `interpolate` and `interpolateAsync` functions from `/code/src/system/string.ts` to perform string interpolation based on templates and formatter objects. Review of these files does not reveal any explicit sanitization of the template strings or the interpolated values against format string vulnerabilities. The security relies on the assumption that the templates are predefined and controlled by the extension developers, and the interpolated values are safe. However, if user-provided input can influence the template or the values being interpolated, a format string vulnerability could be exploited.
    - **Vulnerability Point**: The vulnerability lies in the potential for `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` to be vulnerable to format string injection if format strings from settings or commit messages are not sanitized. If `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` uses insecure string formatting techniques via `interpolate` and `interpolateAsync` without proper sanitization, a malicious format string could be exploited.

    ```
- security test case:
    1. **Preparation**: Open the GitLens settings in VSCode. Navigate to settings that use format string previews (e.g., Commit Format settings, Status Bar Format settings - identified from `GenerateConfigurationPreviewRequest.is(e)` handling logic in `/code/src/webviews/settings/settingsWebview.ts` from previous analysis and `/code/src/webviews/apps/settings/settings.ts` in current files).
    2. **Craft Malicious Format String**: In the settings input field for the format string, enter a known format string payload that could expose information or cause unexpected behavior if a format string vulnerability exists in `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate`. Common format string payloads to test for information disclosure include format specifiers like `%s`, `%p`, `%n`, `%x`, and format string vulnerabilities often involve using many `%s` specifiers to read from the stack or memory. A simple test payload to start with could be `%s%s%s%s%s`. More advanced payloads might involve format string directives that attempt to read memory addresses or execute code, if the formatting function is sufficiently vulnerable (less likely in JavaScript, but worth testing with more advanced payloads if simple ones show potential).
    3. **Trigger Preview Generation**: Modify the settings input field to trigger the generation of the configuration preview. This might happen automatically as you type, or when you focus out of the input field, or by clicking a "Preview" button, depending on how the settings UI is implemented.
    4. **Observe Preview Output and VSCode Behavior**: Examine the generated preview output. Look for any signs of unexpected output, errors, or information disclosure. If the format string vulnerability is successfully exploited, you might see parts of VSCode's memory or stack being printed in the preview, or VSCode might exhibit unexpected behavior or errors. Monitor VSCode's console for error messages.
    5. **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, the preview output will be corrupted or contain unexpected data, potentially revealing internal information or causing errors. VSCode might become unstable in severe cases. A successful test case demonstrates that user-controlled format strings can influence the output of `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate`, indicating a format string vulnerability. If the preview output looks normal and no errors are observed, it suggests that either `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` is not vulnerable or the input is properly sanitized.
    6. **Code Review (if injection is successful)**: If the test case is successful, perform a code review of `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` to identify the vulnerable code and implement proper sanitization of format strings in `/code/src/webviews/settings/settings.ts`, `/code/src/webviews/apps/settings/settings.ts` and `/code/src/webviews/commitDetails/commitDetailsWebview.ts` before calling `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate`.

This test case aims to validate the potential format string vulnerability in `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate`. The effectiveness of the payload and the observable impact will depend on the specific implementation of `CommitFormatter.fromTemplate` and the nature of any format string vulnerability present.

- vulnerability name: Potential Git Command Injection in Graph Webview Search (`SearchRequest`)
- description: The Graph webview (`/code/src/webviews/plus/graph/protocol.ts`, `/code/src/webviews/plus/graph/registration.ts`, `/code/src/webviews/plus/graph/graphWebview.ts` from previous analysis, and referenced in `/code/src/webviews/commitDetails/commitDetailsWebview.ts` via `ExecuteCommitActionCommand`) handles search requests via the `SearchRequest` IPC message. This request takes a `SearchParams` object, which includes a `search` property of type `SearchQuery`. The `GraphWebviewProvider` in `/code/src/webviews/plus/graph/graphWebview.ts` (from previous analysis) processes this `SearchRequest` in the `onSearchRequest` method, which calls `this.getSearchResults(msg.params)`. The `getSearchResults` method then calls `this.repository.git.graph().searchGraph(e.search, ...)` to execute the Git search. If this `SearchQuery` is directly or indirectly used to construct Git commands without proper sanitization in `searchGraph` method, it could lead to Git command injection. For example, if the search query is used in `git log` or `git grep` commands, and if special characters or command options within the `SearchQuery` are not escaped or validated, an attacker could inject malicious Git command options or subcommands. This could be triggered by an attacker crafting a malicious search query in the Graph webview's search input field, which is implemented by the `gl-search-input` component in `/code/src/webviews/apps/shared/components/search/search-input.ts`. The provided file `/code/src/webviews/commitDetails/commitDetailsWebview.ts` indirectly confirms the usage of Graph Webview via `ExecuteCommitActionCommand`'s `graph` action, reinforcing the relevance of this vulnerability if the graph view is indeed vulnerable.
- impact: High. Successful Git command injection in the Graph webview search functionality could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Git commands within the context of the user's VSCode environment. This could lead to information disclosure, modification of Git repositories, or potentially other harmful actions depending on the injected commands. Although VSCode's security model limits the direct harm from Git commands, unexpected or unintended command execution is a significant security concern.

Deeper source code analysis of the `searchGraph` method in the Git graph implementation is needed to determine if any mitigations are implemented in the backend when handling the `SearchQuery`.
- missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The `SearchQuery` received in `SearchRequest` should be rigorously sanitized before being used to construct Git commands. Implement input validation and escaping to neutralize any potentially malicious characters or command options within the search query.
    - Secure command construction: Ensure that Git commands are constructed securely, preferably using parameterized commands or argument arrays where user input is treated as data and not as executable code. Avoid string concatenation of user input directly into shell commands.
    - Query validation: Implement validation of the `SearchQuery` to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and does not contain unexpected or disallowed characters or command sequences.
- preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Graph webview and input a search query into the search input field, which is implemented by the `gl-search-input` component.
    - The Graph webview must process the `SearchRequest` message and use the provided `SearchQuery` to perform a Git search.
    - The Git search implementation in the backend must be vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `SearchQuery`.
- source code analysis:
    - `/code/src/webviews/plus/graph/protocol.ts`: Defines the `SearchRequest` IPC message and the `SearchParams` interface, which includes the `search: SearchQuery` property. (file from previous analysis)
    - `/code/src/webviews/plus/graph/graphWebview.ts`: Implements the `GraphWebviewProvider` and the `onSearchRequest` method that handles `SearchRequest` messages. The `onSearchRequest` method calls `this.getSearchResults(msg.params)` which then calls `this.repository.git.graph().searchGraph(e.search, ...)` passing the `e.search` parameter directly to the `searchGraph` method. (file from previous analysis)
    - `/code/src/webviews/commitDetails/commitDetailsWebview.ts`: Indirectly uses Graph webview functionality through `ExecuteCommitActionCommand`'s `graph` action, implying that if Commit Details view is active and user triggers "Show in Graph", the Graph webview might be invoked and potentially vulnerable search functionality could be used. (file from `PROJECT FILES`)
    - `/code/src/webviews/apps/shared/components/search/search-input.ts`: Implements the `gl-search-input` component which is used in webviews for search input, including potentially in the Graph webview. (file from previous analysis)
    - **Vulnerability Point**: The vulnerability lies in the potential for unsanitized use of `SearchQuery` in the backend Git search implementation within the Graph webview. The file `/code/src/webviews/plus/graph/graphWebview.ts` (from previous analysis) confirms that the `SearchQuery` from user input is passed to `this.repository.git.graph().searchGraph(e.search, ...)` without any visible sanitization within this file. If the `searchGraph` method, which is not provided in these files, does not sanitize the input before constructing and executing Git commands, it could lead to command injection. The `gl-search-input` component in `/code/src/webviews/apps/shared/components/search/search-input.ts` serves as a potential user input vector for this vulnerability.
    - **File `/code/src/git/search.ts` analysis**: The `getGitArgsFromSearchQuery` function in `/code/src/git/search.ts` is used to process the `SearchQuery`. It performs some sanitization by removing double quotes, but it might not be sufficient to prevent command injection, especially when combined with regex search or other operators. This file confirms that user provided search string is transformed into git arguments, increasing the risk of Git command injection if sanitization is insufficient in `getGitArgsFromSearchQuery` or in `searchGraph` method.

- security test case:
    1. **Preparation**: Open the Commit Graph webview in VSCode. Locate the search input field in the Graph webview, which is implemented using the `gl-search-input` component.
    2. **Craft Malicious Search Query**: In the search input field, enter a search query designed to inject malicious Git command options or subcommands. For example, to test for `git log` injection, try a query like `--author='attacker' --format='%H %an %ae %s'`. The goal is to see if `--author` and `--format` are interpreted as Git options instead of being treated as part of a search term. Another example could be to try injecting shell commands using backticks or similar shell injection techniques if the search is executed in a shell context. A simple test payload is `--oneline & whoami`.
    3. **Execute Search**: Trigger the search by pressing Enter or clicking a search button, depending on the UI.
    4. **Observe Search Results and VSCode Behavior**: Examine the search results displayed in the Graph webview. Look for any signs of unexpected output, errors, or information disclosure. If the command injection is successful, the search results might be different from expected, potentially showing output from the injected commands (e.g., output of `whoami`). Monitor VSCode's console for error messages.
    5. **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, the search results will be influenced by the injected command options, or VSCode might exhibit unexpected behavior or errors, potentially displaying output from injected commands in the search results or console. A successful test case demonstrates that user-controlled search queries can manipulate the executed Git commands, indicating a Git command injection vulnerability in the Graph webview search. If the search results are as expected and no errors are observed, it suggests that either the search implementation is not vulnerable or the input is properly sanitized.
    6. **Code Review (if injection is successful)**: If the test case is successful, perform a code review of the Graph webview's search implementation (likely in `graphWebview.ts` and related Git search functions from previous analysis) to identify the vulnerable code and implement proper sanitization and validation of the `SearchQuery` before constructing and executing Git commands. Ensure secure command construction practices are used to prevent command injection.

This test case aims to validate the potential Git command injection vulnerability in the Graph webview's search functionality. The effectiveness of the payload and the observable impact will depend on the specific implementation of the Git search and the level of sanitization applied to the search query.

- vulnerability name: Potential Git Command Injection in Patch Details Webview - Apply Patch Command
- description: The Patch Details webview (`/code/src/webviews/plus/patchDetails/patchDetailsWebview.ts` from previous analysis, and referenced in `/code/src/webviews/commitDetails/commitDetailsWebview.ts` via `CreatePatchFromWipCommand`) handles the `ApplyPatchCommand`. The `applyPatch` method in `PatchDetailsWebviewProvider` (from previous analysis) calls `this.container.git.patch(commit.repoPath)?.applyUnreachableCommitForPatch(commit.ref, ...)` to apply a patch. If the `commit.ref` or other arguments passed to `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` are constructed using user-controlled input without proper sanitization, it could lead to Git command injection. While the provided code doesn't directly show user input being used to construct these arguments in this specific file, the *potential* exists if the `commit` object or its properties (especially `ref`) are influenced by external or user-provided data during the patch application process. For example, if the `commit.ref` is derived from a user-provided patch file or a cloud patch description without sufficient validation, an attacker might be able to inject malicious Git command options or subcommands when a user attempts to apply the patch. `/code/src/webviews/commitDetails/commitDetailsWebview.ts` indirectly uses Patch Details Webview via `CreatePatchFromWipCommand`, reinforcing the relevance of this vulnerability if Patch Details View is indeed vulnerable.

The security relies on the assumption that the `commit.ref` and related arguments are constructed safely. However, if the source of the `commit` object or its `ref` property involves external or user-controlled data without proper validation, this assumption breaks down. Deeper source code analysis of how the `commit` object and its `ref` are derived and used in `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` is needed to determine if mitigations are implemented in the backend.
- missing mitigations:
    - Input validation: Any user-controlled input that contributes to the `commit.ref` or other arguments passed to `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` must be rigorously validated and sanitized. This is especially crucial if the patch content itself or metadata associated with the patch (e.g., description, filenames) are derived from external sources.
    - Secure command construction: Ensure that Git commands within `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` are constructed securely, preferably using parameterized commands or argument arrays where user input is treated as data and not as executable code. Avoid string concatenation of user input directly into shell commands.
    - Patch content validation: If the patch content itself is derived from an external source, implement validation of the patch file to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious commands or unexpected structures that could be exploited during application.
- preconditions:
    - A malicious patch file or cloud patch description is crafted by the attacker.
    - The GitLens extension processes this malicious patch in the Patch Details webview and attempts to apply it using the `ApplyPatchCommand`.
    - The `commit.ref` or other arguments used in the `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` call are derived from the malicious patch content or description without sufficient sanitization.
    - The user must trigger the application of the patch by clicking the "Apply" button or similar action in the Patch Details webview.

If the `commit` object or its `ref` property is influenced by user-controlled data (e.g., from a malicious patch file, cloud patch description, or user input fields in the Patch Details webview) without proper validation, it could lead to Git command injection within the `applyUnreachableCommitPatch` method. The provided code does not show explicit sanitization of `commit.ref` or related arguments within the `applyPatch` method.

This patch file should be crafted to inject Git command options or subcommands when applied. For example, the patch content could be designed to manipulate branch names or commit messages in a way that triggers unintended Git commands during the patch application process.
    2. **Import Malicious Patch (if applicable)**: If testing with cloud patches, attempt to import or create a cloud patch that incorporates the malicious payload in its description or associated data. If testing with local patches, have the malicious patch file ready.
    3. **Open Patch Details Webview**: Open the Patch Details webview in VSCode and load the malicious patch (either by viewing a cloud patch or attempting to create a patch from the malicious local patch file, depending on the attack vector being tested).
    4. **Examine Patch Details (Optional)**: Review the patch details in the webview, paying attention to any fields that might be used to construct Git commands or arguments during application (e.g., branch names, commit messages, filenames in the patch).
    5. **Trigger Patch Application**: Click the "Apply" button or similar action in the Patch Details webview to initiate the patch application process.
    6. **Observe Behavior**: Monitor VSCode's behavior and Git command execution during and after the patch application. Check if any unexpected Git commands are executed, errors are reported, or if the Git repository state is modified in unintended ways due to the injected commands. For example, check if branches are unexpectedly created or deleted, if Git configuration is changed, or if sensitive information is disclosed through Git commands.
    7. **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, applying the malicious patch will result in the execution of injected Git commands, demonstrating that user-controlled patch content or metadata can manipulate the Git commands executed by the extension during patch application. For example, you might observe unexpected Git errors related to injected options or side effects from malicious commands. A successful test case indicates that Git command injection is possible during patch application. If no unexpected behavior is observed, it suggests that mitigations are in place or the injection attempt was not successful.
    8. **Code Review (if injection is successful)**: If the test case is successful, perform a code review of the `applyPatch`, `getOrCreateCommitForPatch`, and `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` methods and related Git patch application code to identify the exact code paths where user input from the patch is unsafely incorporated into Git command arguments. Then, implement proper input validation and sanitization at those points to prevent command injection. Ensure secure patch application practices are used to mitigate the vulnerability.

- vulnerability name: Apply Patch Command Injection in `ApplyPatchFromClipboardCommand`
- description: The `ApplyPatchFromClipboardCommand` in `/code/src/commands/patches.ts` allows users to apply a patch directly from the clipboard. The command handler in `ApplyPatchFromClipboardCommand` retrieves patch content from the clipboard using `env.clipboard.readText()` and then calls `patchProvider?.applyUnreachableCommitForPatch(commit.sha, { stash: false })`. If the patch content read from the clipboard is not validated or sanitized before being passed to `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch`, a malicious attacker could craft a patch file containing malicious git commands, which could then be executed when a user pastes and applies this malicious patch from their clipboard. This vulnerability is triggered when a user applies a maliciously crafted patch from their clipboard using the `Apply Patch from Clipboard` command.
- impact: High. Successful Git command injection via a malicious patch from the clipboard could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Git commands within the context of the user's VSCode environment. This could lead to information disclosure, modification of Git repositories, or potentially other harmful actions depending on the injected commands. While VSCode's security model limits the direct harm from Git commands, unexpected or unintended command execution is a significant security concern.

The code checks if the clipboard content `patch` is valid using `patchProvider?.validatePatch(patch)`, but the details of `validatePatch` and whether it prevents command injection are not visible in the provided files. If `validatePatch` only checks for basic patch format and not for malicious commands, then this vulnerability remains unmitigated.
- missing mitigations:
    - Patch content validation: The patch content from the clipboard must be rigorously validated and sanitized before being passed to `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch`. This validation should go beyond basic format checks and specifically look for and neutralize any potentially malicious Git commands embedded within the patch.
    - Secure patch application: Ensure that the `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` method and any underlying Git command execution during patch application are implemented securely, avoiding shell execution of patch content and using parameterized commands or argument arrays where patch content is treated as data and not as executable code.
    - User confirmation: Before applying a patch from the clipboard, especially one that originates from an untrusted source (as is the case with clipboard content), a user confirmation prompt should be displayed, warning about the potential risks of applying patches from unknown sources and asking for explicit user consent.
- preconditions:
    - An attacker crafts a malicious patch file containing embedded Git commands.
    - The attacker somehow convinces a user to copy this malicious patch content to their clipboard. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by hosting the malicious patch on a website and instructing the user to copy it.
    - The user then executes the `Apply Patch from Clipboard` command in VSCode with the GitLens extension active.
- source code analysis:
    - `/code/src/commands/patches.ts`: This file contains the `ApplyPatchFromClipboardCommand` class. (file not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
    - `ApplyPatchFromClipboardCommand.execute()` method: (code not provided in `PROJECT_FILES`)
        - `const patch = await env.clipboard.readText();`: Reads patch content directly from the clipboard.
        - `const valid = patch.length ? await patchProvider?.validatePatch(patch) : false;`: Calls `validatePatch` to check validity, but the implementation of `validatePatch` is not provided in these files.
        - `await patchProvider?.applyUnreachableCommitForPatch(commit.sha, { stash: false });`: Directly passes the `patch` content to `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` for application.
    - **Vulnerability Point**: The vulnerability lies in the potential for insufficient validation of the `patch` content from the clipboard before it is processed by `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch`. If `validatePatch` does not effectively sanitize or neutralize malicious commands within the patch content, and if `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` executes Git commands in a way that is susceptible to injection from the patch content, then command injection is possible. The code in `ApplyPatchFromClipboardCommand` does not show explicit sanitization of the patch content beyond the `validatePatch` call, whose security effectiveness is unknown.

- security test case:
    1. **Preparation**: Set up a VSCode workspace with GitLens extension enabled. Create a malicious patch file. This patch file should be crafted to inject Git command options or subcommands when applied. A simple malicious patch can be crafted to create a new branch with a name that includes command injection. Example malicious patch (simplified for demonstration):

    ```diff
    --- a/dummy.txt
    +++ b/dummy.txt
    @@ -1,1 +1,1 @@
    -Initial content
    +Updated content
    \ No newline at end of file
    ```
    Add a malicious command in the patch description or within the file changes in a way that might be interpreted as a command during patch application. For a more direct test, try to inject commands via filenames in the patch, although this might be harder to control. For this test, focus on injecting commands via patch content. For example, try to insert a line in the patch that looks like a command execution.
    Example of malicious patch content (more complex, may require adjustments based on patch parsing logic):

    ```diff
    --- a/dummy.txt
    +++ b/dummy.txt
    @@ -1,1 +1,1 @@
    -Initial content
    +Updated content
    !/bin/bash -c "touch /tmp/pwned"  # Malicious command injection
    \ No newline at end of file
    ```

    Or, try to inject via branch name manipulation if the patch application process uses branch names from the patch:

    ```diff
    From: attacker@example.com
    Date: ...
    Subject: [PATCH] Malicious patch

     a/dummy.txt | 1 +
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

    ```

    2. **Copy Malicious Patch to Clipboard**: Copy the crafted malicious patch content to the system clipboard.
    3. **Execute "Apply Patch from Clipboard" Command**: In VSCode, execute the "GitLens: Apply Patch from Clipboard" command (or "Paste Patch from Clipboard" if available).
    4. **Observe Behavior**: Observe VSCode's behavior and the system. Check if the injected commands are executed. For example, in the test case with `touch /tmp/pwned`, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created after applying the patch. Monitor VSCode's console and terminal output for any unexpected errors or command executions.
    5. **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, applying the malicious patch will result in the execution of injected Git commands. For example, the file `/tmp/pwned` will be created, or other injected commands will be executed, demonstrating that user-controlled patch content from the clipboard can manipulate the Git commands executed by the extension during patch application. A successful test case indicates that Git command injection is possible via "Apply Patch from Clipboard". If no unexpected behavior is observed, it suggests that mitigations are in place or the injection attempt was not successful.
    6. **Code Review (if injection is successful)**: If the test case is successful, perform a code review of the `ApplyPatchFromClipboardCommand`, `validatePatch`, and `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` methods and related Git patch application code to identify the exact code paths where user input from the clipboard is unsafely incorporated into Git command arguments. Then, implement proper input validation and sanitization in `validatePatch` and secure command construction in `applyUnreachableCommitForPatch` to prevent command injection. Add user confirmation prompts before applying patches from the clipboard to mitigate the risk from untrusted patch sources.

- vulnerability name: Potential Git Command Injection in `remote add` command via Remote Name or URL
- description: The `RemoteGitCommand` in `/code/src/commands/git/remote.ts` handles adding new Git remotes. The `addCommandSteps` function uses `inputRemoteNameStep` and `inputRemoteUrlStep` to get the remote name and URL from user input. If these user inputs are not properly sanitized before being used in the `state.repo.git.remotes().addRemoteWithResult?.(state.name, state.url, ...)` function, it could lead to Git command injection. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by providing a crafted remote name or URL that, when processed by the `addRemoteWithResult` function (likely using `git remote add`), could execute arbitrary Git commands. This vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to add a new remote and an attacker provides malicious input for the remote name or URL during the input steps.
- impact: High. Successful Git command injection in the `remote add` command could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Git commands within the context of the user's VSCode environment. This could lead to information disclosure, modification of Git repositories, or potentially other harmful actions depending on the injected commands. While VSCode's security model limits the direct harm from Git commands, unexpected or unintended command execution is a significant security concern.
- vulnerability rank: high
- currently implemented mitigations: Unknown. Based on the provided files in this and previous batches, there are no explicit input sanitization or validation mechanisms in `RemoteGitCommand` in `/code/src/commands/git/remote.ts` for the remote name or URL obtained from `inputRemoteNameStep` and `inputRemoteUrlStep` before calling `addRemoteWithResult`. The code checks if the remote name already exists, but this is not a security mitigation against command injection.
- missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The remote name and URL obtained from user input must be rigorously validated and sanitized before being used in Git commands. Implement input validation to ensure that the remote name and URL conform to expected patterns and do not contain any potentially malicious characters or command options. Specifically, escape or remove shell-sensitive characters from the remote name and URL before passing them as arguments to Git commands.
    - Secure command construction: Ensure that Git commands within `addRemoteWithResult` are constructed securely, preferably using parameterized commands or argument arrays where user input is treated as data and not as executable code. Avoid string concatenation of user input directly into shell commands.
- preconditions:
    - The user must attempt to add a new remote using the "GitLens: Remote" command and select "add" subcommand.
    - The attacker must provide a malicious string as either the remote name or remote URL during the input steps.
    - The GitLens extension must execute the `git remote add` command using the unsanitized remote name or URL.

        - `const remote = await state.repo.git.remotes().addRemoteWithResult?.(state.name, state.url, ...)`: Calls `addRemoteWithResult` with `state.name` and `state.url` obtained from user input.

    3. **Craft Malicious Remote Name**: When prompted for the remote name, enter a malicious name designed to inject Git command options or subcommands. For example, try: `test-remote" && touch /tmp/pwned && "test-remote`. The goal is to see if the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` is executed during the `git remote add` command. Alternatively, try backticks or other shell injection techniques.
    4. **Provide Remote URL**: Provide a valid remote URL (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo`) when prompted.
    5. **Confirm and Execute**: Confirm the remote addition if prompted and allow the command to execute.
    6. **Observe Behavior**: Observe the system and check if the injected command was executed. For example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created in the `/tmp` directory after executing the command. Monitor VSCode's console and terminal output for any unexpected errors or command executions. Also, check if the remote was successfully added (even if the injection is successful, the remote might still be added).
    7. **Expected Result**: If the vulnerability exists, the injected command (`touch /tmp/pwned`) will be executed, demonstrating that user-controlled remote names can manipulate the Git commands executed by the extension during remote addition.
