## Vulnerability List for GitLens VSCode Extension

### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Potential XSS in Graph Hover Markdown Rendering
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Git repository or commit message containing a payload in Markdown format. This payload could include JavaScript code disguised as a link, image, or other Markdown elements.
    2. A user clones or opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the GitLens extension enabled.
    3. The user navigates to the GitLens Graph view and hovers over a commit that contains the malicious Markdown payload.
    4. The `GlGraphHover` component fetches and renders the Markdown content using `gl-markdown`.
    5. If the markdown rendering is not properly sanitized, the malicious JavaScript code within the Markdown payload gets executed in the context of the GitLens extension when the hover tooltip is displayed.
* Impact:
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the VSCode extension's context. This could lead to:
    - Data theft: Access to sensitive information within the VSCode workspace, including files, settings, and environment variables.
    - Session hijacking: Potential to gain control over the user's VSCode session.
    - Further exploitation: Use the extension's context to perform actions within VSCode, potentially escalating privileges or compromising the user's system.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    The project uses `gl-markdown` component to render markdown. It is assumed that `gl-markdown` component is responsible for sanitizing the markdown content to prevent XSS. However, without further investigation of `gl-markdown` component, it's not possible to confirm if it's sufficient.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - **Strict Markdown Sanitization:** Implement and enforce robust markdown sanitization within the `gl-markdown` component to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML code embedded in the markdown content. Verify that `gl-markdown` is using a secure markdown rendering library and is configured with appropriate sanitization options.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy for the webview context where the graph hover is rendered to further restrict the execution of inline scripts and other potentially malicious content.
* Preconditions:
    1. A user must clone or open a malicious Git repository or encounter a malicious commit message in a repository they are working with.
    2. The GitLens extension must be active and the Graph view must be utilized.
    3. The user must hover over a commit node in the graph view that contains the malicious markdown payload.
* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/webviews/apps/plus/graph/hover/graphHover.ts`
    2. The `GlGraphHover` component is responsible for displaying commit information in a popover when hovering over nodes in the Git Graph.
    3. The component uses a `@property markdown?: Promise<PromiseSettledResult<string>> | string;` to store the markdown content.
    4. The `render()` method uses `gl-markdown` component to render this markdown content:
    ```typescript
    return html`<gl-popover
        ?open=${this.open}
        .anchor=${this.anchor}
        .distance=${this.distance}
        .skidding=${this.skidding}
        .placement=${this.placement}
        trigger="manual"
        @gl-popover-hide=${() => this.hide()}
        @sl-reposition=${() => this.onReposition()}
    >
        <div slot="content">
            <gl-markdown .markdown=${until(this.markdown, 'Loading...')}></gl-markdown>
        </div>
    </gl-popover>`;
    ```
    5. The markdown content is fetched using `requestMarkdown` function:
    ```typescript
    markdown = this.requestMarkdown(row).then(params => { ... });
    ```
    6. The `requestMarkdown` function and `gl-markdown` component need to be further analyzed to ensure proper sanitization. If `requestMarkdown` fetches content from external source, sanitization on backend side should be checked as well.
    7. Files `lineHoverController.ts` and `hovers.ts` are related to rendering hover information, potentially including markdown rendering in `detailsMessage` and `changesMessage` functions. These components should also be checked for proper markdown sanitization to prevent XSS, although the primary concern remains with `GlGraphHover` in the Graph view based on the current vulnerability description.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Create a Git repository and initialize it.
    2. Modify a file and create a commit with a malicious Markdown payload in the commit message. For example:
    ```
    \`\`\`html
    <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')" />
    \`\`\`
    ```
    or
    ```
    [Click Me](javascript:alert('XSS Vulnerability'))
    ```
    3. Open the repository in VSCode with GitLens extension enabled.
    4. Open the GitLens Graph view.
    5. Hover over the commit node with the malicious commit message.
    6. Observe if the alert (`alert('XSS Vulnerability')`) is triggered, indicating successful XSS exploitation.
    7. Additionally, create a malicious commit message and check if hovering over lines annotated with blame or using line hover feature triggers the XSS, to cover potential vulnerabilities in `lineHoverController.ts` and `hovers.ts`.
