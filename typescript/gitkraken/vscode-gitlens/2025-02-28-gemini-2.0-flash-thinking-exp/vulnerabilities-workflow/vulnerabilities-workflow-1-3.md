## Vulnerability List

* Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Markdown Rendering
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts malicious markdown content containing JavaScript code.
    2. The attacker injects this malicious markdown into a Git repository, for example, as part of a commit message, branch name, tag name, or issue description.
    3. A user opens the GitLens Commit Graph or Patch Details view within VSCode.
    4. The VSCode extension renders the malicious markdown content using the `gl-markdown` component in either the graph hover or draft details view.
    5. If the `gl-markdown` component is vulnerable and does not properly sanitize the input, the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the markdown is executed within the VSCode webview context.
- Impact:
    - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., user tokens, credentials).
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user within the VSCode extension.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Unknown. It is not evident from the provided code if input sanitization is implemented in the `gl-markdown` component.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust input sanitization within the `gl-markdown` component to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Thoroughly audit and test the `gl-markdown` component to ensure all user-provided markdown inputs are properly sanitized before rendering.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must view markdown content rendered by the `gl-markdown` component in the VSCode extension.
    - The markdown content must be from an attacker-controlled source or modifiable by an attacker (e.g., Git repository metadata).
- Source code analysis:
    1. Files `/code/src/webviews/apps/plus/graph/hover/graphHover.ts` and `/code/src/webviews/apps/plus/patchDetails/components/gl-draft-details.ts` utilize the `gl-markdown` component for rendering markdown content.
    2. In `graphHover.ts`, the markdown source is fetched dynamically using `this.requestMarkdown(row)`.
    3. In `gl-draft-details.ts`, the markdown source is derived from `this.renderPatchMessage()`.
    4. The source code for `gl-markdown` is not provided, requiring further investigation to determine if input sanitization is implemented.
- Security test case:
    1. Open VSCode with the GitLens extension enabled.
    2. Open a Git repository.
    3. Create a commit with the following malicious markdown message:
    ```
    feat: Add feature with XSS vulnerability

    This commit contains a malicious payload: <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability')">
    ```
    4. Checkout to the commit created in step 3.
    5. Open the GitLens Commit Graph view (`GitLens: Show Commit Graph`).
    6. Hover over the commit node with the malicious message in the Commit Graph.
    7. Verify if an alert dialog with the message "XSS Vulnerability" is displayed. If the alert appears, the vulnerability is confirmed.

* Potential GraphQL Injection in Workspace Creation
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace name or description containing GraphQL injection payloads.
    2. The attacker uses the GitLens UI to create a new cloud workspace and inputs the malicious payload in the workspace name or description field.
    3. The VSCode extension sends a GraphQL mutation request to the backend API with the unsanitized workspace name and description.
    4. The backend API executes the GraphQL query, which is vulnerable to injection due to lack of input sanitization.
- Impact:
    - Unauthorized data access or modification in the backend GraphQL API.
    - Potential escalation of privileges depending on the backend API's vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. User inputs for workspace name and description are directly embedded into the GraphQL query.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement input sanitization for workspace name and description before constructing the GraphQL query in `/code/src/plus/workspaces/workspacesApi.ts`.
    - Utilize parameterized GraphQL queries or prepared statements to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    - Implement backend-side validation and sanitization to further protect against malicious payloads.
- Preconditions:
    - User must have the ability to create cloud workspaces in the GitLens extension.
    - Attacker needs to be able to input text into the workspace name or description fields in the GitLens UI.
- Source code analysis:
    1. File `/code/src/plus/workspaces/workspacesApi.ts` in `createWorkspace` function directly embeds `options.name` and `options.description` into a GraphQL query string without sanitization.
    ```typescript
    const rsp = await this.fetch({
        query: `
            mutation createWorkspace {
                create_project(
                    input: {
                        type: GK_PROJECT
                        name: "${options.name}" // Potential injection point
                        description: "${options.description}" // Potential injection point
                        provider: ${options.provider}
                        ...
                    }
                ) {
                    id,
                    name,
                    description,
                    organization {
                        id
                    }
                    provider
                    azure_organization_id
                    azure_project
                    repo_relation
                }
            }
        `,
    });
    ```
    2. The `fetch` function in `WorkspacesApi` then sends this raw GraphQL query to the backend.
- Security test case:
    1. Open VSCode with the GitLens extension enabled and signed in.
    2. Trigger the "Create Cloud Workspace" command.
    3. In the "Create Cloud Workspace" input box for workspace name, enter the following malicious payload:
    ```
    test_workspace_name") { id } mutation { delete_project(id: "test_workspace_id") { id } project(id: "
    ```
    Replace `test_workspace_id` with an actual workspace ID that the attacker wants to delete (if known or can be obtained). If not, a generic or non-existent ID can be used to test for injection.
    4. Fill in other required fields for workspace creation (description, provider, etc.).
    5. Create the workspace.
    6. Observe the backend logs or application behavior to see if the `delete_project` mutation was executed, indicating a successful GraphQL injection.
    7. Alternatively, observe if the workspace creation fails in an unexpected way, which might also indicate an injection attempt disrupted the normal query execution.
