## Combined Vulnerability List for GitLens VSCode Extension

This document outlines the combined list of vulnerabilities identified in the GitLens VSCode extension, merging information from multiple reports and removing duplicates to provide a consolidated view of security concerns.

### Vulnerability: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Markdown Rendering

**Description:**
1. An attacker crafts malicious markdown content containing JavaScript code. This payload could be disguised as a link, image, or other Markdown elements.
2. The attacker injects this malicious markdown into a Git repository. This can be achieved through various means, such as including it in a commit message, branch name, tag name, or issue description.
3. A user clones or opens this malicious repository in VSCode with the GitLens extension enabled.
4. The user navigates to areas within the GitLens extension that render markdown content, such as the GitLens Graph view, Patch Details view, or hovers over commit information in the Git Graph or line annotations.
5. Components like `GlGraphHover` and `gl-draft-details` fetch and render the Markdown content using the `gl-markdown` component.
6. If the `gl-markdown` component is vulnerable and does not properly sanitize the input, the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the markdown is executed within the VSCode webview context when the content is rendered, for example, when a hover tooltip is displayed or the Patch Details view is opened.

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the VSCode extension's context. This could lead to:
    - **Data theft:** Access to sensitive information within the VSCode workspace, including files, settings, user tokens, credentials and environment variables.
    - **Session hijacking:** Potential to gain control over the user's VSCode session, allowing actions to be performed on behalf of the user within the VSCode extension.
    - **Further exploitation:** Use the extension's context to perform actions within VSCode, potentially escalating privileges or compromising the user's system.
    - **Redirection to malicious websites:** Redirecting the user to attacker-controlled external websites for phishing or further exploitation.
    - **Performing actions on behalf of the user:**  Executing commands or modifications within the VSCode extension or the user's workspace without explicit user consent.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
The project uses the `gl-markdown` component to render markdown content. It is assumed that `gl-markdown` component is responsible for sanitizing the markdown content to prevent XSS. However, without further investigation of the `gl-markdown` component's implementation and configuration, it's not possible to confirm if the sanitization is robust and sufficient to prevent all potential XSS attacks.  The current mitigations are considered unknown until proven effective through code review and testing of `gl-markdown`.

**Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Strict Markdown Sanitization:** Implement and enforce robust markdown sanitization within the `gl-markdown` component to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious JavaScript or HTML code embedded in the markdown content. Verify that `gl-markdown` is using a secure markdown rendering library and is configured with appropriate sanitization options. The sanitization should be applied to all user-provided markdown inputs before rendering.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy for the webview context where markdown is rendered. This CSP should restrict the execution of inline scripts and other potentially malicious content, adding a layer of defense in depth.
    - **Regular Security Audits and Testing:** Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting markdown rendering components to identify and address any bypasses or weaknesses in the sanitization implementation.

**Preconditions:**
    1. A user must clone or open a malicious Git repository or encounter malicious markdown content (e.g., in commit messages, branch names, etc.) in a repository they are working with.
    2. The GitLens extension must be active and the relevant views or features that render markdown content must be utilized (e.g., Graph view, Patch Details view, line hover).
    3. The user must trigger the rendering of the malicious markdown content, such as by hovering over a commit node in the graph view, opening patch details, or interacting with line annotations containing malicious markdown.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. **File:** `/code/src/webviews/apps/plus/graph/hover/graphHover.ts`
    - The `GlGraphHover` component is responsible for displaying commit information in a popover when hovering over nodes in the Git Graph.
    - It uses a `@property markdown?: Promise<PromiseSettledResult<string>> | string;` to store the markdown content.
    - The `render()` method uses `gl-markdown` component to render this markdown content:
    ```typescript
    return html`<gl-popover ... >
        <div slot="content">
            <gl-markdown .markdown=${until(this.markdown, 'Loading...')}></gl-markdown>
        </div>
    </gl-popover>`;
    ```
    - The markdown content is fetched using the `requestMarkdown` function.

2. **File:** `/code/src/webviews/apps/plus/patchDetails/components/gl-draft-details.ts`
    - This file also utilizes the `gl-markdown` component within the `renderPatchMessage()` method to display patch details, indicating another potential rendering context for markdown content.

3. **Files:** `lineHoverController.ts` and `hovers.ts`
    - These files are related to rendering hover information on code lines, potentially including markdown rendering in functions like `detailsMessage` and `changesMessage`. These components also need to be checked for proper markdown sanitization.

4. **Component:** `gl-markdown` (Source code not provided)
    - The security of markdown rendering heavily relies on the implementation of the `gl-markdown` component. It is crucial to analyze its source code to understand how it handles markdown sanitization. If `gl-markdown` relies on an external library, the configuration and security posture of that library need to be reviewed. If `requestMarkdown` fetches content from an external source, sanitization on the backend side should be considered as well.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Create a Git repository and initialize it.
2. Modify a file and create a commit with a malicious Markdown payload in the commit message. Examples of malicious payloads:
    ```markdown
    \`\`\`html
    <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability in Commit Graph Hover')" />
    \`\`\`
    ```
    or
    ```markdown
    [Click Me](javascript:alert('XSS Vulnerability in Commit Graph Hover'))
    ```
    or in commit message body:
    ```markdown
    feat: Add feature with potential XSS

    This commit contains a malicious payload: <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS in Commit Message Body')">
    ```
    or in commit message title:
    ```markdown
    feat(xss): <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS in Commit Message Title')">
    ```
3. Open the repository in VSCode with GitLens extension enabled.
4. Open the GitLens Commit Graph view (`GitLens: Show Commit Graph`).
5. Hover over the commit node with the malicious commit message.
6. Verify if an alert dialog with the message "XSS Vulnerability in Commit Graph Hover", "XSS in Commit Message Body", or "XSS in Commit Message Title" (depending on the payload used) is displayed. If the alert appears, the XSS vulnerability in the Graph Hover is confirmed.
7. Additionally, create a malicious commit message and open the Patch Details view for that commit. Check if the XSS payload in the commit message is executed in the Patch Details view.
8. Furthermore, test line hover and blame annotations with malicious markdown payloads to cover potential XSS vulnerabilities in `lineHoverController.ts` and `hovers.ts`.

### Vulnerability: Deep Link Command Injection

**Description:**
An attacker could craft a malicious deep link that, when clicked by a VSCode user with the GitLens extension installed, could execute arbitrary commands within the VSCode environment. This vulnerability arises if the deep link handler in GitLens improperly sanitizes or validates the command parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious commands.

**Steps to trigger:**
1. An attacker crafts a malicious deep link specifically targeting the GitLens extension's command handling mechanism.
2. The attacker distributes this malicious deep link via email, chat, websites, or any other communication channel to potential victims (VSCode users with GitLens installed).
3. The victim, believing the link to be legitimate or out of curiosity, clicks the deep link.
4. If GitLens' deep link handler is vulnerable, the malicious code embedded within the link's command parameter is executed within the victim's VSCode environment.

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the victim's VSCode environment. This could lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    - Accessing or exfiltrating sensitive data from the victim's workspace.
    - Modifying or deleting files within the victim's workspace, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
    - Installing malicious extensions or software, further compromising the user's VSCode environment and potentially the system.
    - Potentially gaining further access to the victim's system depending on the privileges of the VSCode process, leading to a broader system compromise.
    - Running resource-intensive commands, causing denial of service or performance degradation within VSCode.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
Based on the provided files, there is no explicit mention of mitigations against deep link command injection in the code or documentation. A review of files like `/code/src/uris/uriService.ts` and related code does not reveal any input validation or sanitization for deep link command parameters.  Therefore, it's assumed that there are currently no implemented mitigations specifically addressing this vulnerability.

**Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input validation and sanitization for deep link command parameters:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all parameters extracted from deep links, especially those intended to be used as commands or arguments to commands.  This should include whitelisting allowed characters, commands, and argument structures.
    - **Use of a safe command execution mechanism:** Avoid directly executing commands constructed from deep link parameters. Instead, use a safe command execution mechanism that prevents arbitrary code execution. This could involve using a predefined set of allowed commands and mapping deep link parameters to specific, safe actions within the extension.
    - **Principle of least privilege:** Execute commands triggered by deep links with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running commands with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary and after careful security consideration.
    - **Security review of deep link handling logic:** Conduct a comprehensive security review of the deep link handling logic, particularly focusing on the `createCommandLink` function and its usages, as well as the `UriService` and any components that process and execute commands based on deep links.

**Preconditions:**
    - The victim user must have VSCode with the GitLens extension installed and activated.
    - The victim must click on a malicious deep link crafted by the attacker. This often relies on social engineering to trick the user into clicking the link.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. **File:** `/code/src/uris/uriService.ts`
    - The `UriService` registers a URI handler and calls the `handleUri` function when VSCode receives a URI that matches the extension's URI scheme (`vscode://eamodio.gitlens`).
    - The `handleUri` function processes the URI path, extracts the `type` from the path, and fires events based on this type using `this._onDidReceiveUri.fire(uri)`. This generic event handling is a potential area of concern if the event handlers don't properly validate the URI content.
    ```typescript
    // File: /code/src/uris/uriService.ts
    handleUri(uri: Uri): void {
        const [, type] = uri.path.split('/');
        if (type === AuthenticationUriPathPrefix) { // ... other type checks ... }
        this._onDidReceiveUri.fire(uri); // Generic event fired for non-specific URI types
    }
    ```

2. **File:** `/code/src/webviews/apps/plus/home/components/merge-target-status.ts`
    - This file uses `createCommandLink` to generate URIs for various GitLens commands, such as `gitlens.home.rebaseCurrentOnto`, `gitlens.home.mergeIntoCurrent`, `gitlens.home.openMergeTargetComparison`, and `gitlens.home.fetch`.
    - Examples of `createCommandLink` usage:
    ```typescript
    href="${createCommandLink('gitlens.home.rebaseCurrentOnto', this.targetBranchRef)}"
    href="${createCommandLink('gitlens.home.mergeIntoCurrent', this.targetBranchRef)}"
    ```
    - This indicates that `createCommandLink` is responsible for constructing URIs that trigger specific GitLens commands. If `createCommandLink` or the handlers for these commands do not sanitize inputs, command injection is possible.

3. **Function:** `createCommandLink` (Implementation not provided in snippets)
    - The implementation of `createCommandLink` is crucial. If it naively constructs URIs by embedding command names and arguments without proper encoding or validation, it could be vulnerable.  For instance, if it creates URIs like `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/command/{command}?{args}`, and the handler directly executes `{command}` with `{args}`, injection is highly likely.

4. **DeepLinkService (Hypothetical):**
    - It's assumed that a `DeepLinkService` or similar component handles the `_onDidReceiveUri` event and processes the URI to execute the intended GitLens commands. The security of this service is paramount. If it directly uses parts of the URI to construct and execute shell commands or VSCode commands without validation, it is vulnerable to command injection.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Install the GitLens extension in VSCode.
2. Craft a malicious deep link that attempts to execute a harmful command. This requires some reverse engineering or knowledge of how `createCommandLink` and the deep link handling mechanism are implemented.
3. As a hypothetical test case, assume `createCommandLink` creates URIs like `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/{command}` and the `DeepLinkService` (or URI handler) directly executes the `{command}` part without validation.
4. Create a deep link like: `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/workbench.action.openSettings`.
5. Paste this deep link into a markdown file in VSCode or send it to the victim through another channel (email, chat, etc.).
6. Ask the victim to click the deep link.
7. Observe if the injected command `workbench.action.openSettings` is executed, i.e., if the VSCode settings panel opens. This would indicate a potential vulnerability.
8. For a more impactful test, attempt to execute a more harmful command. For example, try to execute a command that lists directory contents or attempts to write a file to the workspace, but always ensure testing is done in a safe, controlled environment and with explicit permission. A potentially harmful command could be something like `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/extension.gitlens.runCommandInTerminal?command=ls -al`. (Note: The exact command structure depends on how GitLens handles commands and arguments in deep links).

**Important Note:**  Testing deep link command injection requires careful experimentation and understanding of the target application's deep link handling logic. Always perform security testing in a controlled environment and with appropriate ethical considerations.

### Vulnerability: Potential GraphQL Injection in Workspace Creation

**Description:**
An attacker could exploit a GraphQL injection vulnerability during the creation of cloud workspaces. This occurs when user-provided input, specifically the workspace name or description, is directly embedded into a GraphQL query without proper sanitization. By crafting malicious input containing GraphQL syntax or commands, an attacker can manipulate the GraphQL query executed by the backend API.

**Steps to trigger:**
1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace name or description containing GraphQL injection payloads. This payload could include additional GraphQL operations, field selections, or mutations.
2. The attacker uses the GitLens UI to initiate the creation of a new cloud workspace.
3. In the workspace creation dialog, the attacker inputs the malicious payload into either the workspace name or description field.
4. The VSCode extension, specifically the `WorkspacesApi`, constructs a GraphQL mutation request. Critically, it directly embeds the unsanitized workspace name and description from user input into the GraphQL query string.
5. The GitLens extension sends this GraphQL query to the backend API.
6. The backend API, if vulnerable to GraphQL injection due to a lack of input sanitization, executes the attacker-crafted GraphQL query.

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    - **Unauthorized data access:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive data from the backend GraphQL API by injecting queries to retrieve information beyond what they are authorized to see.
    - **Data modification or deletion:** Attackers might be able to inject mutations to modify or delete data in the backend database, leading to data integrity issues or denial of service.
    - **Privilege escalation:** In certain scenarios, attackers could potentially escalate their privileges within the backend system depending on the nature of the GraphQL schema and the backend's authorization mechanisms.
    - **Backend service disruption:** Maliciously crafted GraphQL queries could potentially cause errors or performance issues on the backend GraphQL service, leading to denial of service.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
Based on the source code analysis of `/code/src/plus/workspaces/workspacesApi.ts`, there are currently **no implemented mitigations** against GraphQL injection in the workspace creation process. The code directly concatenates user inputs (`options.name` and `options.description`) into the GraphQL query string without any sanitization or validation.

**Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for the workspace name and description fields within the `createWorkspace` function in `/code/src/plus/workspaces/workspacesApi.ts`. Sanitize user inputs before they are embedded into the GraphQL query to neutralize any potentially malicious GraphQL syntax or operators.
    - **Parameterized GraphQL Queries or Prepared Statements:** Utilize parameterized GraphQL queries or prepared statements instead of string concatenation to construct GraphQL queries. This is the most effective way to prevent GraphQL injection as it separates the query structure from user-provided data, ensuring that user inputs are treated as data values and not executable code.
    - **Backend-Side Validation and Sanitization:** Implement backend-side validation and sanitization of all inputs received from the GitLens extension. This provides a second layer of defense, ensuring that even if sanitization is missed on the client-side, the backend can still prevent injection attacks.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege for API Access:** Ensure that the API credentials used by the GitLens extension have the minimum necessary privileges required for workspace creation and related operations. This limits the potential impact of a successful GraphQL injection attack.

**Preconditions:**
    - The user must have an account and be signed into the GitLens extension with the ability to create cloud workspaces.
    - The attacker needs to be able to input text into the workspace name or description fields in the GitLens UI during the workspace creation process.

**Source Code Analysis:**
1. **File:** `/code/src/plus/workspaces/workspacesApi.ts`
    - The `createWorkspace` function is responsible for sending a GraphQL mutation to create a new cloud workspace.
    - **Vulnerable Code Snippet:** The function directly embeds `options.name` and `options.description` into the GraphQL query string using template literals without any sanitization:
    ```typescript
    const rsp = await this.fetch({
        query: `
            mutation createWorkspace {
                create_project(
                    input: {
                        type: GK_PROJECT
                        name: "${options.name}" // Potential injection point
                        description: "${options.description}" // Potential injection point
                        provider: ${options.provider}
                        ...
                    }
                ) {
                    id, name, description, organization { id } provider, azure_organization_id, azure_project, repo_relation
                }
            }
        `,
    });
    ```
    - The `"${options.name}"` and `"${options.description}"` parts are direct injection points. An attacker can inject malicious GraphQL code within these strings, which will be executed by the backend GraphQL API.
    - The `fetch` function (implementation not provided in the snippet) is assumed to send this raw GraphQL query to the backend.

**Security Test Case:**
1. Open VSCode with the GitLens extension enabled and sign in with a user account that has permissions to create cloud workspaces.
2. Trigger the "Create Cloud Workspace" command in GitLens.
3. In the "Create Cloud Workspace" input box for the workspace name, enter the following malicious GraphQL payload:
    ```
    test_workspace_name") { id } mutation { delete_project(id: "PROJECT_ID_TO_DELETE") { id } project(id: "
    ```
    **Important:** Replace `PROJECT_ID_TO_DELETE` with the actual ID of a workspace that you have permission to delete *and are willing to risk deleting for testing purposes*.  **Exercise extreme caution and only use a test workspace ID or a workspace you are authorized to delete.** If you do not know a valid project ID or do not want to risk deletion, use a non-existent or invalid ID to test for injection without causing harm.  For safer testing, you can try injecting a simple query to fetch data you shouldn't normally access, if you know the GraphQL schema.
4. Fill in other required fields for workspace creation (description, provider, etc.) with valid values.
5. Create the workspace.
6. **Observe the outcome:**
    - **If the workspace with ID `PROJECT_ID_TO_DELETE` is deleted (or if an error related to deletion is observed in backend logs), it indicates a successful GraphQL injection.** This is a critical finding.
    - If the workspace creation fails in an unexpected manner (e.g., GraphQL error responses in the console), it might also indicate that the injection attempt disrupted the normal query execution, further suggesting a vulnerability.
    - Monitor backend logs for any unusual GraphQL operations, errors, or access attempts related to the injected payload.
7. **Alternative Test (Safer):** If you don't want to risk deletion, try injecting a payload that attempts to retrieve data. For example, if you know there's a `users` query, you could try:
    ```
    test_workspace_name") { id } query { users { id name } } mutation { create_project(input: { ... rest of input ... }) {
    ```
    Then check if the response (or backend logs) contains any user data that shouldn't be accessible during workspace creation.

**Warning:** Performing GraphQL injection testing, especially with destructive payloads like `delete_project`, should be done with extreme caution and only in controlled testing environments with proper authorization and ethical considerations. Always ensure you have explicit permission to test and potentially modify or delete data in the target system. Use non-destructive tests or test with non-production accounts and data whenever possible.
