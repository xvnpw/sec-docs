### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in External Stylesheet Fetching

**Description:**

The VSCode extension is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to insecure handling of external stylesheets. The extension parses HTML files within a workspace to identify CSS class definitions for autocompletion and other features. When processing an HTML file, the extension scans for `<link>` tags with the attribute `rel="stylesheet"`. If such a tag is found and its `href` attribute points to a URL starting with "http", the extension attempts to fetch the content from this URL. This fetching process is performed using the `request` library without proper validation or sanitization of the URL.

An attacker who can influence the content of HTML files within a workspace opened in VSCode can exploit this vulnerability. By inserting a crafted `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">` tag into an HTML file, the attacker can specify an arbitrary URL. When the extension parses this HTML file, either automatically upon file change or manually triggered by the "Cache CSS class definitions" command, it will make an HTTP GET request to the attacker-specified URL.

This allows an attacker to force the VSCode extension, running on the user's machine, to make requests to locations of the attacker's choosing. These locations can be:

1.  **External, attacker-controlled servers:**  This allows the attacker to track when a user opens a workspace containing the malicious HTML file, potentially gathering information about the user's IP address and other request details.
2.  **Internal network resources:** By specifying URLs like `http://localhost:<port>`, `http://<internal_IP>:<port>`, or even cloud metadata endpoints (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/`), the attacker can probe internal services, access internal network resources, or potentially extract sensitive information from services that are accessible from the user's machine but not directly from the internet.

**Impact:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information from internal services or endpoints that are accessible from the user's machine. If internal services respond to requests made by the extension, they might reveal configuration details, internal API responses, or other confidential data.
*   **Internal Port Scanning and Network Mapping:** The attacker can use the extension as a proxy to scan internal networks and identify open ports and running services. By providing a range of URLs targeting different ports on internal IPs or `localhost`, the attacker can map out internal network infrastructure.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Successful SSRF can be a stepping stone to more severe vulnerabilities. Depending on the nature and security of the targeted internal services, an attacker might be able to leverage SSRF to perform further attacks, such as interacting with internal APIs, triggering actions on internal systems, or even gaining unauthorized access in certain scenarios.

**Vulnerability Rank:** high

**Currently implemented mitigations:**

*   None. The code in `/code/src/parse-engines/types/html-parse-engine.ts` includes a basic check to see if the URL starts with "http" (`value.indexOf("http") === 0`). However, this is fundamentally insufficient and provides no meaningful security against SSRF attacks. It does not validate the hostname, protocol scheme beyond "http", path, or any other part of the URL to ensure it is safe or intended. There is no domain whitelisting, protocol enforcement (like requiring HTTPS), or restrictions on accessing internal networks.

**Missing mitigations:**

*   **Robust URL Validation and Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive URL validation and sanitization in `/code/src/parse-engines/types/html-parse-engine.ts` before making any external requests using `request.get(url)`. This should go beyond a simple "http" prefix check.
*   **Domain/IP Address Whitelisting or Blacklisting:** Introduce a mechanism to control which domains or IP ranges are permitted for external stylesheet fetching.
    *   Implement a whitelist of trusted domains from which stylesheets can be fetched.
    *   Alternatively, implement a blacklist to explicitly deny requests to private IP ranges (e.g., `127.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) and other potentially sensitive internal addresses. By default, fetching from private IP ranges should be disabled.
*   **Protocol Restrictions:** Enforce the use of HTTPS for external stylesheets.  Ideally, completely block fetching from "http://" URLs unless explicitly configured otherwise by the user.
*   **User Confirmation or Configuration Option:** Implement a user-configurable setting to control external stylesheet fetching.
    *   Provide an option to disable external stylesheet fetching entirely.
    *   If external fetching is enabled, consider prompting the user for confirmation before fetching stylesheets from new or untrusted domains, especially when the URL points to a non-standard port or a private IP address.
*   **Use a Safer HTTP Request Library:** Consider migrating away from the deprecated `request` library to a more actively maintained and secure alternative such as `axios` or `node-fetch`. These libraries often offer better security defaults and more robust features.
*   **Timeouts and Rate Limits:** Implement timeouts for HTTP requests to prevent excessively long requests and to mitigate potential denial-of-service if an attacker points to a slow-responding server. Consider rate limiting the number of external requests made in a short period to further protect against abuse.

**Preconditions:**

*   The victim must have the VSCode extension installed and activated.
*   The victim opens a workspace in VSCode that contains at least one HTML file.
*   The attacker must be able to place or modify an HTML file within this workspace. This could be achieved through various means:
    *   The attacker contributes to a shared workspace or repository.
    *   The attacker exploits another vulnerability to write files into the workspace.
    *   The attacker socially engineers the victim into opening a malicious workspace or HTML file.
*   The malicious HTML file must contain a `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">` tag where the `href` attribute points to the attacker's desired target URL (external or internal).
*   The caching process must be triggered. This can happen automatically when the extension parses HTML files upon file changes or manually when the user executes the "Cache CSS class definitions" command.

**Source code analysis:**

*   Vulnerable code is located in `/code/src/parse-engines/types/html-parse-engine.ts`.
*   The `parse` function in `HtmlParseEngine` is responsible for parsing HTML documents and extracting CSS class definitions.
*   Within the `parse` function, the code uses the `htmlparser2` library to parse the HTML content. Event handlers are set up to process HTML tags and attributes.
    *   The `onattribute` event handler checks for `rel="stylesheet"` attributes. If found, a flag `isRelStylesheet` is set.  In the same handler, if the tag is `<link>` and the attribute is `href` and its value starts with "http", the `href` value is stored in the `linkHref` variable.
    *   The `onclosetag` event handler is triggered when a closing tag is encountered. If the closing tag is `</link>`, and `isRelStylesheet` is true, and a `linkHref` has been captured, the `linkHref` URL is added to the `urls` array.
*   After parsing the HTML, the code uses `Bluebird.map` to iterate over the collected `urls` array. For each `url` in the array, the following asynchronous operation is performed:
    ```typescript
    await Bluebird.map(urls, async (url) => {
        const content = await request.get(url);
        definitions.push(...CssClassExtractor.extract(css.parse(content)));
    }, { concurrency: 10 });
    ```
*   **Vulnerability:** The critical line is `const content = await request.get(url);`.  This line directly fetches the content from the `url` without any validation of the URL itself beyond checking if it starts with "http" during attribute parsing. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs, leading to the SSRF vulnerability. The fetched `content` is then parsed as CSS, but the SSRF occurs before this step, during the `request.get(url)` call.

        K --> L[CSS Class Definitions Output];
```

**Security test case:**

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Ensure you have VSCode with the vulnerable extension installed.
    *   Set up a tool to monitor HTTP requests. This could be:
        *   `requestbin.com` or a similar online service to capture external HTTP requests.
        *   A local HTTP server (e.g., using `python -m http.server 8000`) to monitor requests to `localhost`.
        *   A network proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept and examine HTTP traffic from VSCode.

2.  **Create a malicious HTML file:**
    *   Create a new workspace or open an existing one in VSCode.
    *   Create a new HTML file (e.g., `ssrf_test.html`) in the workspace.
    *   Insert the following HTML code into `ssrf_test.html`.

        *   **For External SSRF Test (using RequestBin):** Replace `<YOUR_REQUESTBIN_URL>` with your RequestBin URL.
            ```html
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://<YOUR_REQUESTBIN_URL>.requestbin.net/ssrf-test-external">
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>SSRF Test</h1>
            </body>
            </html>
            ```

        *   **For Internal SSRF Test (using localhost):**
            ```html
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://localhost:1337/ssrf-test-internal">
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>SSRF Test</h1>
            </body>
            </html>
            ```
            (Ensure no critical service is running on port 1337 on your localhost during testing, or set up a simple HTTP listener on port 1337 to observe the request.)

3.  **Trigger CSS Class Caching:**
    *   Open the Command Palette in VSCode (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    *   Execute the command "Cache CSS class definitions". This will trigger the extension to parse HTML files and attempt to fetch external stylesheets.

4.  **Observe HTTP Requests:**
    *   **For External SSRF Test:** Check your RequestBin URL. You should see an incoming GET request to `http://<YOUR_REQUESTBIN_URL>.requestbin.net/ssrf-test-external` originating from your machine where VSCode is running.
    *   **For Internal SSRF Test:** If you are using a local HTTP server or network proxy, observe for an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:1337/ssrf-test-internal` originating from VSCode. If you have a listener on port 1337, check its logs for connection attempts.

5.  **Verification:**
    *   The presence of the HTTP request to the specified URL (either external or internal) confirms the SSRF vulnerability. The extension is making an outbound request to a URL controlled or specified within the HTML file, demonstrating that an attacker can influence the extension to make requests to arbitrary locations.
