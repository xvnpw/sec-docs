### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External Stylesheet Fetching

* Description:
    1. The VSCode extension parses HTML files to find CSS class definitions.
    2. When parsing an HTML file, the extension looks for `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">` tags.
    3. For each such tag with an `href` attribute starting with `http`, the extension uses the `request` library to fetch the content of the URL.
    4. The fetched content is then parsed as CSS to extract CSS class names.
    5. If an attacker can control the content of an HTML file opened by the user (e.g., through a malicious file), they can insert a `<link>` tag with a crafted `href` pointing to an internal resource (e.g., `http://localhost:internal-service`).
    6. When the user opens this malicious HTML file in VSCode, the extension will attempt to fetch content from the attacker-specified internal URL.
    7. This allows the attacker to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, potentially probing internal services or accessing sensitive information that is accessible from the user's machine.

* Impact:
    An attacker can potentially:
    - Probe internal network services that are accessible from the user's machine. This can be used to discover running services and open ports.
    - Access sensitive information from internal services that do not require authentication from the user's machine but are accessible via HTTP requests from the user's local network (e.g., internal configuration pages, unprotected APIs).
    - In some scenarios, depending on the internal service and its actions based on HTTP requests, it might be possible to trigger unintended actions on internal systems.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The extension directly fetches and processes external stylesheets without any URL validation or restrictions.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - **URL Validation and Sanitization:** Implement validation to ensure that URLs in `<link href>` tags are safe and intended external resources. Sanitize URLs to prevent manipulation.
    - **Domain/IP Address Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Implement a configuration setting to whitelist or blacklist domains or IP ranges from which external stylesheets can be fetched. By default, restrict fetching from private IP ranges (e.g., `127.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`).
    - **User Confirmation:** Before fetching external resources, especially from non-standard ports or private IP ranges, prompt the user for confirmation.
    - **Use a safer HTTP request library:** Consider replacing the deprecated `request` library with a more secure and actively maintained alternative, such as `axios` or `node-fetch`.

* Preconditions:
    1. The VSCode extension is installed and activated.
    2. The user opens an HTML file that is within a workspace folder that is being processed by the extension.
    3. The HTML file contains a `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">` tag with an `href` attribute pointing to a URL that the attacker wants to probe or access.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. File: `/code/src/parse-engines/types/html-parse-engine.ts`
    2. Function: `HtmlParseEngine.parse(textDocument: ISimpleTextDocument)`
    3. Code snippet:
    ```typescript
    await Bluebird.map(urls, async (url) => {
        const content = await request.get(url);
        definitions.push(...CssClassExtractor.extract(css.parse(content)));
    }, { concurrency: 10 });
    ```
    4. The `urls` array is populated by extracting `href` values from `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags in the parsed HTML.
    5. The code iterates over `urls` and directly calls `request.get(url)` for each URL without any validation or sanitization.
    6. The response from `request.get(url)` is then parsed as CSS using `css.parse()`.
    7. The extracted CSS classes are added to the `definitions` array.
    8. **Vulnerability:** The lack of validation on the `url` variable before using `request.get(url)` allows an attacker to control the target of the HTTP request, leading to SSRF.

    graph LR
        A[Start HtmlParseEngine.parse] --> B{Parse HTML Document};
        B --> C{Find <link rel="stylesheet"> tags};
        C --> D{Extract href attribute value as URL};
        D --> E{request.get(URL)};
        E --> F{Fetch content from URL};
        F --> G{css.parse(content)};
        G --> H{CssClassExtractor.extract()};
        H --> I[Add definitions];
        I --> J[Return definitions];
    ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Pre-requisites:**
        - Install the VSCode extension.
        - Have a simple HTTP server running on `http://localhost:8000` that serves a plain text response (e.g., "This is an internal service"). You can use `python -m http.server 8000` in a directory with an `index.html` file, but ensure the server responds even for non-existing files.
    2. **Create a malicious HTML file:**
        - Create a file named `malicious.html` with the following content:
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://localhost:8000/secret-internal-data">
        </head>
        <body>
            <div class="test-class">Hello</div>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
    3. **Open the malicious HTML file in VSCode:**
        - Open VSCode and open the `malicious.html` file you created. Ensure the file is part of an opened workspace for the extension to process it.
    4. **Observe Network Activity:**
        - Use a network monitoring tool (like Wireshark, tcpdump, or browser developer tools network tab if you proxy VSCode through it) to observe network requests originating from VSCode.
    5. **Expected Result:**
        - You should observe an HTTP GET request from VSCode to `http://localhost:8000/secret-internal-data`.
        - This confirms that the extension is attempting to fetch content from the internal URL specified in the malicious HTML file, demonstrating the SSRF vulnerability.
        - You may also observe logs in your simple HTTP server indicating a request to `/secret-internal-data`.

This test case demonstrates that the extension can be tricked into making requests to internal resources, confirming the SSRF vulnerability.
