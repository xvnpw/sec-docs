- **Vulnerability Name:** SSRF via Unvalidated External Stylesheet Fetching  
  **Description:**  
  An attacker who is able to seed the workspace with a crafted HTML file can trigger a server‐side request forgery (SSRF). When the extension caches CSS classes it parses HTML files and – using the htmlparser2 events in the HTML parse engine – collects all `<link>` elements that have a `rel="stylesheet"` attribute. If the `<link>` tag’s `href` attribute starts with `"http"`, its value is added to an array of URLs. Later, the extension iterates over these URLs and unconditionally calls `request.get(url)`, downloading the external resource. By simply placing a malicious HTML file in the workspace (for example, in a public project clone), an attacker can cause the extension to retrieve resources from attacker-controlled servers or even internal network addresses.  
  **Impact:**  
  - **Information Disclosure:** The extension’s backend may forward data about the internal network or reveal sensitive internal endpoints if an internal service responds.  
  - **Internal Network Scanning/Access:** If an attacker points the `<link>` element to an internal IP or to a cloud metadata service (e.g. `http://169.254.169.254/`), they might be able to probe internal resources or extract sensitive information.  
  - **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on the targeted internal resource, the attacker may leverage the SSRF as a stepping stone for further attacks.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - **No significant URL validation or domain whitelisting is implemented.**  
    The code directly examines the `href` value by checking only that it begins with `"http"`. No further checks are made before unconditionally performing an HTTP GET using the request-promise library.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - **URL/Domain Whitelisting:** The extension should validate that remote URLs come from trusted domains (or even disallow remote retrieval entirely without explicit user permission).  
  - **Protocol Restrictions:** Enforce the use of HTTPS (or even block any external URL) unless the user has explicitly opted in.  
  - **User Confirmation or Configuration Option:** Require the user to enable or confirm that external resources may be fetched.  
  - **Timeouts/Rate Limits:** Although a concurrency limit is set, additional safeguards should be considered so that accidental or malicious triggering does not overwhelm the network.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The workspace contains at least one HTML file with a crafted `<link>` element similar to:  
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://attacker-controlled.example/evil.css">
    ```  
  - The user (or an attacker controlling the workspace repository) triggers the caching process (e.g. by running the "Cache CSS class definitions" command or by introducing the file into a workspace that is then automatically scanned).  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - **File:** `src/parse-engines/types/html-parse-engine.ts`  
    - In the `parse` method, the parser is configured with event handlers:
      - **`onattribute` event:** When a tag attribute is encountered, if the attribute name is `"rel"` and its value equals `"stylesheet"`, a flag (`isRelStylesheet`) is raised. In the same event, if the current tag is a `<link>` and the attribute name is `"href"` and the value begins with `"http"`, the variable `linkHref` is set.
      - **`onclosetag` event:** When a `<link>` tag is closed, if `isRelStylesheet` is true and a valid `linkHref` was recorded, that URL is pushed into the `urls` array.
    - After parsing, a `Bluebird.map` call iterates over the collected URLs. For each URL, the code performs an unvalidated `await request.get(url)`. This unguarded external HTTP request is where an attacker-controlled URL can lead to SSRF.
    - **Visualization:**  
      1. **Input HTML:** `<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://malicious.example/evil.css">`  
      2. **Parsing Process:**  
         - `onattribute` sets `isRelStylesheet = true` and records `linkHref = "http://malicious.example/evil.css"`.  
         - On closing the tag, the URL is stored in the `urls` list.
      3. **Fetching Process:**  
         - The Bluebird map iterates over `urls` and calls `request.get("http://malicious.example/evil.css")` without further checks.
  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Preparation:**  
     - Set up a controlled HTTP server (or use a tool like Burp Suite) to listen on an address (e.g. `http://attacker-controlled.example/evil.css`). Ensure that the server can log incoming requests.
     - In a test workspace, create an HTML file (e.g. `test.html`) containing:  
       ```html
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>
         <head>
           <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://attacker-controlled.example/evil.css">
         </head>
         <body>
           <p>Test file for SSRF vulnerability.</p>
         </body>
       </html>
       ```
  2. **Execution:**  
     - Open the test workspace in VS Code with the extension installed.  
     - Trigger the caching process either manually (by executing the command "Cache CSS class definitions" via the command palette) or by performing an action that re-initiates caching.
  3. **Observation:**  
     - Check the logs on the controlled HTTP server. A request should be recorded originating from the machine running the extension, confirming that the URL from the malicious HTML file was fetched.
  4. **Result:**  
     - If the remote server logs the request to `/evil.css`, the SSRF vulnerability is confirmed.
