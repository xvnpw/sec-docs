### Combined Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in External Stylesheet Fetching

- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious HTML file.
    2. The malicious HTML file includes a `<link rel="stylesheet">` tag.
    3. The `href` attribute of the `<link>` tag contains a URL controlled by the attacker (e.g., `http://attacker.com/malicious.css` or `http://localhost:8080/`) or points to an internal resource (e.g., `http://internal.example.com/sensitive-data.css`, `http://localhost:22`, `http://192.168.1.1/admin`).
    4. The user opens a workspace in VSCode that contains this malicious HTML file, or opens the malicious HTML file directly in VSCode within a workspace where the extension is active.
    5. The VSCode extension "HTML CSS Class Completion" or "IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML" is activated and starts caching CSS class definitions, either automatically on workspace load or when triggered manually by the user via the "Cache CSS class definitions" command.
    6. The extension's `HtmlParseEngine` (`/code/src/parse-engines/types/html-parse-engine.ts`) parses the HTML file and identifies the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">` tag.
    7. The parser extracts the URL from the `href` attribute of the `<link>` tag. The code checks if the `href` attribute starts with `http` to identify external stylesheets.
    8. The extension uses the `request` library to send an HTTP GET request to the extracted URL without proper validation or sanitization.
    9. The `request` library sends an HTTP GET request to the attacker-controlled URL or internal resource.
    10. If the URL points to an internal resource, the extension can access and potentially leak sensitive information from the internal network. If the URL points to a malicious server, the attacker can potentially gain information about the extension's environment, stage further attacks, or log the request to confirm the SSRF.

- Impact:
    - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can cause the VSCode extension (running on the user's machine) to make requests to arbitrary URLs. This can be exploited to:
        - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information from internal network resources if the VSCode instance is running within a network that has internal resources accessible. For example, they might be able to access internal configuration files, API endpoints, or other sensitive data.
        - **Port Scanning:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to perform port scanning on internal networks, identifying open ports and services running on internal machines (e.g., by targeting URLs like `http://localhost:22`, `http://192.168.1.1:80`).
        - **Internal Service Access:** Access internal services or APIs that are not publicly accessible but are reachable from the user's machine's network, potentially accessing admin panels or unprotected endpoints.
        - **Exfiltration of Workspace Files (in some scenarios, limited):** If an attacker can control a server that the VSCode instance can reach, they might be able to exfiltrate contents of files by crafting responses that trigger specific behaviors in the extension or VSCode itself. While direct exfiltration is limited because the response from the URL is parsed for CSS classes, an attacker could potentially encode small amounts of data in URLs and observe the requested URLs on their server.
        - **Denial of Service (Indirect):** Overload internal or external services with requests originating from the user's machine, potentially causing disruption.

- Vulnerability Rank: High

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code directly uses `request.get(url)` without any URL validation or sanitization in `/code/src/parse-engines/types/html-parse-engine.ts`.

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **URL Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust URL validation and sanitization to ensure that only external stylesheets from trusted domains or within the workspace are fetched.
        - **Protocol Whitelisting:** Allow only `https://` protocol, or at least restrict to `http://` and `https://`.
        - **Domain Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Consider whitelisting or blacklisting specific domains based on security policies. For example, restricting requests to only workspace-relative URLs or known safe domains. A whitelist of allowed domains or protocols could be used.
        - **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the URL string to prevent injection attacks if URL construction is done dynamically.
        - **Preventing Network Requests to Internal Resources:** Implement checks to prevent requests to `localhost` and private network ranges (e.g., `127.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) and potentially reserved IP ranges.
    - **User Confirmation/Warning:** Before making external requests, especially to non-HTTPS URLs or URLs pointing to different domains than the workspace, the extension could prompt the user for confirmation or display a warning message, especially if the URL is not from a trusted domain.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the "HTML CSS Class Completion" or "IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML" extension installed and activated in VSCode.
    - The user must open a workspace in VSCode or open an HTML file in VSCode within a workspace.
    - The workspace or opened HTML file must contain a malicious HTML file or a HTML file that includes a `<link rel="stylesheet">` tag with an `href` attribute pointing to a malicious external stylesheet or an internal resource.
    - The user's VSCode instance must have network connectivity to the attacker-controlled URL or the internal resource the attacker wants to access.
    - The extension's CSS class caching mechanism must be triggered, either automatically or manually.

- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/parse-engines/types/html-parse-engine.ts`
    2. **Function:** `HtmlParseEngine.parse`
    3. **Code Snippet:**
    ```typescript
    await Bluebird.map(urls, async (url) => {
        try {
            const content = await request.get(url); // Vulnerable line: No URL validation
            definitions.push(...CssClassExtractor.extract(css.parse(content)));
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Failed to fetch or parse stylesheet from ${url}:`, error);
        }
    }, { concurrency: 10 });
    ```
    4. **Vulnerability Flow:**
        - The `HtmlParseEngine.parse` function is responsible for parsing HTML files to extract CSS class definitions.
        - During parsing, it looks for `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">` tags.
        - The code identifies potential external stylesheets by checking if the `href` attribute of a `<link>` tag starts with "http". This check is located in the `onattribute` handler of the HTML parser.
        - Extracted URLs are stored in the `urls` array.
        - The code iterates through the `urls` array using `Bluebird.map` to process URLs concurrently.
        - For each `url` in `urls`, `request.get(url)` is called to fetch the content of the URL.
        - **Vulnerability:** The `url` variable, which comes directly from the `href` attribute of the `<link>` tag in the HTML file, is passed directly to `request.get()` without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to control the URL that `request.get()` fetches, leading to SSRF. The `request.get` function will attempt to fetch content from any provided URL, including those pointing to internal network resources or attacker-controlled servers.
    5. **Visualization:**
    ```
    [Malicious HTML File] -->  HtmlParseEngine.parse() --> [Extracts URLs from <link rel="stylesheet">] --> urls[] --> Bluebird.map(urls, ...) --> request.get(url) [NO VALIDATION] --> [External/Internal Server]
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install the "HTML CSS Class Completion" or "IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML" extension in VSCode.
        - Install `node.js` and `npm` if not already installed (if you need to run a local server with `npm`).
        - Choose a method to set up an attacker-controlled server to observe requests. You can use:
            - **Python's `http.server`:**  `python -m http.server 8000` in a directory. This is simple and will log requests to the console.
            - **`netcat`:** `nc -l -p 8080` (or `ncat -lvp 8080`). This will listen on port 8080 and you can observe raw requests. For more detailed logging with `netcat` you can use: `mkfifo req; while true; do nc -l -p 8080 < req | tee -a req | grep "^Host: " ; done > req` (for logging Host header).
        - Start your chosen server on port 8000 (or another port if you adjust the test case). For Python `http.server`, navigate to an empty directory in your terminal and run the command. For `netcat`, simply run the command in a terminal.
    2. **Craft Malicious HTML:**
        - Create a new workspace in VSCode, or open an existing one.
        - Create a new HTML file named `ssrf_test.html` (or `malicious.html`) in the workspace.
        - Add the following content to `ssrf_test.html`:
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://localhost:8000/malicious.css"> <--- Attacker controlled URL (localhost:8000)
        </head>
        <body>
            <div class="container">Hello World</div>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
        - If testing internal network access, replace `http://localhost:8000/malicious.css` with a URL to an internal resource (e.g., `http://internal.example.com/`, `http://192.168.1.1/`). For the basic test, `http://localhost:8000/malicious.css` is sufficient.
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:**
        - Open the `ssrf_test.html` file in VSCode within the created workspace.
        - To ensure the extension parses the file, you can either:
            - Manually trigger caching: Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`), type "Cache CSS class definitions", and execute the command.
            - Simply opening the HTML file in a workspace where the extension is active might be enough to trigger caching, depending on the extension's settings and workspace events.
    4. **Observe Network Traffic (Attacker Server Logs):**
        - Monitor the logs of your attacker-controlled server (either the console output of `python -m http.server`, or the terminal where `netcat` is running).
        - **Expected Result:** You should observe an HTTP GET request originating from VSCode to `http://localhost:8000/malicious.css`.
            - With `python -m http.server`, you will see log lines in the console indicating a GET request.
            - With `netcat`, you will see the raw HTTP request headers printed in the terminal, including `GET /malicious.css HTTP/1.1` and `Host: localhost:8000`.
        - The presence of this logged request confirms that the extension is fetching the external stylesheet from the attacker-specified URL, demonstrating the SSRF vulnerability.
