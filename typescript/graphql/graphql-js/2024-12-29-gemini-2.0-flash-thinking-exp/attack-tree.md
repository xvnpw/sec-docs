## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using graphql-js - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to data, disrupt application availability, or execute malicious actions by exploiting vulnerabilities in the graphql-js library or its usage.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   Compromise Application via GraphQL-js Exploitation
    *   Exploit Validation Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)
        *   Bypass Authorization Checks (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)
        *   Exploit Schema Introspection (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)
    *   Exploit Execution Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)
        *   Trigger Resource Intensive Resolvers (High-Risk Path)
    *   Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Indirectly related to graphql-js) (High-Risk Path)
        *   GraphQL Injection via Client-Side Manipulation

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Validation Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    *   Description: Target weaknesses in the process of verifying if a GraphQL query adheres to the defined schema. Successful exploitation can lead to bypassing security measures or causing resource exhaustion.

*   **Bypass Authorization Checks (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
    *   Description: Craft a GraphQL query that bypasses intended authorization rules due to flaws in the schema definition or validation logic within graphql-js or the application's implementation.

*   **Exploit Schema Introspection (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
    *   Description: Utilize GraphQL's introspection feature to discover sensitive information about the schema (e.g., internal types, deprecated fields) that can be used to craft more targeted attacks.

*   **Exploit Execution Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
    *   Description: Target weaknesses in the process of resolving the data requested in a GraphQL query. Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service, data manipulation, or information leakage.

*   **Trigger Resource Intensive Resolvers (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Description: Craft a GraphQL query that forces the execution of resolvers that are computationally expensive or perform inefficient database queries, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). While the resolver logic is application-specific, the ability to trigger them via GraphQL is a key aspect.

*   **Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Indirectly related to graphql-js) (High-Risk Path):**
    *   Description: Exploit vulnerabilities in the client-side application that lead to the construction of malicious GraphQL queries. While the vulnerability resides on the client-side, the `graphql-js` powered backend processes these malicious queries.

*   **GraphQL Injection via Client-Side Manipulation:**
    *   Description: If the client-side application constructs GraphQL queries based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker might manipulate the input to inject malicious GraphQL fragments, potentially bypassing server-side validation or authorization (though the core vulnerability lies in the client-side logic, the impact is on the graphql-js powered backend).
