# Threat Model Analysis for graphql/graphql-js

## Threat: [Query Depth Attack](./threats/query_depth_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a deeply nested GraphQL query, exceeding reasonable limits.  They exploit the hierarchical nature of GraphQL to create a query that requires the server to traverse many levels of relationships, consuming excessive resources. `graphql-js` does not inherently limit query depth.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to server resource exhaustion (CPU, memory). Legitimate users are unable to access the service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `graphql-js` core execution engine (`execute` function and related query processing logic). The vulnerability is the *lack* of built-in depth limiting in the core execution process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a maximum query depth limit using a custom validation rule within the `validate` function of `graphql-js`. Reject queries exceeding this limit *before* execution.
        *   Use a dedicated library like `graphql-depth-limit` to simplify depth limiting.
        *   Monitor server resource usage.

## Threat: [Query Complexity/Cost Attack](./threats/query_complexitycost_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a query that, while not deeply nested, requests a large number of fields or fields that are computationally expensive to resolve. `graphql-js` executes the query as provided without inherent cost analysis.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or significant performance degradation. High database load. Increased operational costs.
    *   **Affected Component:** `graphql-js` execution engine (`execute` function). The core issue is the lack of built-in cost limitation or awareness during query execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query cost analysis. Assign a "cost" to each field and limit the total query cost. Use libraries like `graphql-cost-analysis`.
        *   Combine cost analysis with depth limiting.
        *   Monitor database query performance.

## Threat: [Batching/List Amplification Attack](./threats/batchinglist_amplification_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a field that returns a list, requesting an extremely large number of items. `graphql-js` does not inherently limit the size of lists returned by resolvers.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), excessive database load, potential memory exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `graphql-js` execution engine. The vulnerability is the lack of built-in limits on the size of list results during execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement *mandatory* pagination on all list fields.
        *   Enforce strict, reasonable limits on pagination arguments.
        *   Set a hard, server-side limit on the maximum number of items returned in *any* list.
        *   Monitor list sizes.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass in Resolvers (Indirectly related to `graphql-js`)](./threats/authorization_bypass_in_resolvers__indirectly_related_to__graphql-js__.md)

*   **Description:**  While primarily a resolver logic issue, GraphQL's flexibility, facilitated by `graphql-js`, makes it easier to *accidentally* create authorization bypasses if resolvers don't meticulously check permissions. The attacker crafts a query to access unauthorized data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Indirectly, `graphql-js`'s execution engine, as it executes the (flawed) resolver logic. The core issue is the lack of *enforced* authorization mechanisms at the `graphql-js` level, relying entirely on resolver implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization logic *within each resolver*.
        *   Use a consistent authorization framework.
        *   Thoroughly test resolvers.
        *   Consider schema directives for declarative authorization.

## Threat: [Outdated `graphql-js` Version](./threats/outdated__graphql-js__version.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of `graphql-js` that contains known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, leading to various security issues (DoS, data breaches, etc.).
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `graphql-js` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `graphql-js` to the latest stable version.
        *   Use dependency management tools.
        *   Monitor security advisories.

## Threat: [Circular Dependencies in Schema (Directly related to `graphql-js`)](./threats/circular_dependencies_in_schema__directly_related_to__graphql-js__.md)

* **Description:** The GraphQL schema is designed with circular dependencies between types. This can lead to infinite recursion during query resolution, which `graphql-js` might not fully prevent during schema building or execution.
    * **Impact:** Server crash (stack overflow), Denial of Service (DoS).
    * **Affected Component:** `graphql-js` schema validation and execution. The `buildSchema` function might not detect all circularities, and the `execute` function could crash.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design the schema to avoid circular dependencies.
        *   Use schema validation tools and linters.
