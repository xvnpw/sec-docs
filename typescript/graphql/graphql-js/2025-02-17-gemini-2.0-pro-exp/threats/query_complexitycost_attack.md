Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Query Complexity/Cost Attack" threat for a GraphQL application using `graphql-js`.

## Deep Analysis: Query Complexity/Cost Attack in `graphql-js`

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of a Query Complexity/Cost attack against a `graphql-js` based GraphQL API, identify the specific vulnerabilities within `graphql-js` that enable this attack, and evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers to secure their applications.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses on:

*   The `graphql-js` library itself, specifically the `execute` function and related query processing components.
*   The interaction between `graphql-js` and a typical backend data source (e.g., a relational database, but the analysis will be general enough to apply to other data sources).
*   The attack vector of overly complex queries, *excluding* deeply nested queries (which are covered by a separate threat analysis).  We focus on queries that request a large number of fields or computationally expensive fields.
*   The impact on server resources (CPU, memory, database load) and operational costs.
*   Evaluation of the effectiveness and practicality of mitigation strategies, including `graphql-cost-analysis` and other approaches.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the relevant sections of the `graphql-js` source code (primarily the `execute` function and related modules) to understand how queries are processed and executed without inherent cost limitations.
2.  **Literature Review:**  Review existing documentation, articles, and security advisories related to GraphQL query complexity attacks and mitigation techniques.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Apply threat modeling principles to identify potential attack scenarios and their impact.
4.  **Experimental Analysis (Conceptual):**  Describe how one could conceptually set up a test environment to demonstrate the vulnerability and the effectiveness of mitigations.  (We won't actually execute the tests here, but we'll outline the approach.)
5.  **Comparative Analysis:**  Compare and contrast different mitigation strategies, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Threat Description and Mechanics:**

A Query Complexity/Cost attack exploits the fact that `graphql-js`, in its default configuration, does not inherently limit the computational cost of a query.  An attacker can craft a query that, while syntactically valid and potentially not deeply nested, requests a large number of fields or fields that are expensive to resolve.  This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or significant performance degradation.

**Example (Conceptual):**

Consider a GraphQL schema for an e-commerce application:

```graphql
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  price: Float!
  reviews: [Review!]!
  relatedProducts: [Product!]! # Potentially expensive
  inventory: Inventory!
  images: [Image!]!
  # ... many other fields ...
}

type Query {
  products(filter: ProductFilter): [Product!]!
}
```

An attacker could craft a query like this:

```graphql
query {
  products {
    id
    name
    description
    price
    reviews {
      id
      text
      rating
    }
    relatedProducts { # First level of related products
      id
      name
      price
      relatedProducts{ #Second level
        id
        name
        price
      }
    }
    inventory {
      quantity
      location
    }
    images {
      url
      width
      height
    }
    # ... request many other fields ...
  }
}
```

Even if `relatedProducts` only returns a small number of items at each level, requesting many fields, and especially *multiple levels* of `relatedProducts`, can quickly become computationally expensive.  The database might need to perform numerous joins or complex calculations to resolve these fields.  If the `products` query itself returns a large number of results, the problem is amplified.

**2.2  `graphql-js` Vulnerability:**

The core vulnerability lies in the `execute` function of `graphql-js`.  This function is responsible for:

1.  **Parsing:**  Converting the query string into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
2.  **Validation:**  Checking the query against the schema for syntactic and semantic correctness.
3.  **Execution:**  Traversing the AST and calling the resolver functions for each field.

Crucially, the `execute` function, *in its default implementation*, performs *no* cost analysis or limitation during the execution phase.  It simply executes the resolvers as requested by the query, regardless of how computationally expensive they might be.  There's no built-in mechanism to:

*   Assign a "cost" to each field.
*   Calculate the total cost of a query.
*   Reject queries that exceed a predefined cost threshold.

This lack of cost awareness is the fundamental reason why `graphql-js` is vulnerable to Query Complexity/Cost attacks.

**2.3 Impact Analysis:**

The impact of a successful Query Complexity/Cost attack can be severe:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The server can become overwhelmed by the computational demands of the malicious query, causing it to become unresponsive to legitimate requests.
*   **Performance Degradation:**  Even if a complete DoS doesn't occur, the server's performance can be significantly degraded, leading to slow response times for all users.
*   **Database Overload:**  Expensive queries can put a heavy load on the database, potentially leading to database crashes or slowdowns.
*   **Increased Operational Costs:**  If the application is hosted on a cloud platform, the increased resource consumption (CPU, memory, database I/O) can lead to significantly higher operational costs.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The server might run out of memory or other resources, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior.

**2.4 Risk Severity:**

The risk severity is classified as **High** due to the potential for:

*   Complete service disruption (DoS).
*   Significant financial impact (increased operational costs).
*   Relative ease of exploitation (crafting a complex query is often easier than finding other vulnerabilities).

### 3. Mitigation Strategies

**3.1 Query Cost Analysis (Recommended):**

This is the most robust and recommended mitigation strategy.  It involves:

1.  **Assigning Costs:**  Assigning a numerical "cost" to each field in the schema.  This cost should reflect the computational expense of resolving that field.  For example:
    *   Simple scalar fields (e.g., `id`, `name`) might have a cost of 1.
    *   Fields that require database lookups might have a cost of 5 or 10.
    *   Fields that involve complex calculations or external API calls might have a cost of 20 or higher.
    *   Fields that return lists should have their cost multiplied by the expected number of items in the list (or a reasonable upper bound).
2.  **Calculating Query Cost:**  Calculating the total cost of a query by summing the costs of all requested fields.  This can be done by traversing the query's AST.
3.  **Enforcing a Cost Limit:**  Rejecting queries that exceed a predefined cost threshold.

**`graphql-cost-analysis` Library:**

The `graphql-cost-analysis` library provides a convenient way to implement query cost analysis in `graphql-js`.  It allows you to:

*   Define cost directives in your schema.
*   Specify a maximum query cost.
*   Automatically calculate the cost of each query and reject those that exceed the limit.

**Example (using `graphql-cost-analysis`):**

```javascript
const { graphql } = require('graphql');
const { createCostAnalysis } = require('graphql-cost-analysis');

const costAnalysis = createCostAnalysis({
  maximumCost: 1000, // Set a maximum cost
  defaultCost: 1,    // Default cost for fields
  costMap: {        // Override costs for specific fields
    'Product.relatedProducts': 20,
  },
});

const schema = ... // Your GraphQL schema

async function executeQuery(query, variables) {
  const result = await graphql({
    schema,
    source: query,
    variableValues: variables,
    validationRules: [costAnalysis], // Add the cost analysis rule
  });

  if (result.errors) {
    // Handle errors, including cost limit exceeded
    console.error(result.errors);
  } else {
    // Process the result
    console.log(result.data);
  }
}
```

**3.2 Combining Cost Analysis with Depth Limiting:**

While this analysis focuses on complexity *not* related to depth, it's highly recommended to combine cost analysis with query depth limiting.  This provides a more comprehensive defense against malicious queries.  Depth limiting prevents attackers from crafting deeply nested queries that can also cause performance issues.

**3.3 Monitoring Database Query Performance:**

Regularly monitoring database query performance is crucial for identifying potential attacks and tuning your cost analysis parameters.  Use database monitoring tools to:

*   Identify slow queries.
*   Analyze query execution plans.
*   Track resource consumption (CPU, memory, I/O).

This monitoring data can help you:

*   Refine your cost estimates for each field.
*   Adjust your cost limit to an appropriate level.
*   Detect attacks that might not be immediately obvious.

**3.4  Timeout:**
Setting timeout for resolving query.

**3.5 Pagination:**
Using pagination for limiting amount of data that can be returned.

### 4. Conclusion and Recommendations

The Query Complexity/Cost attack is a serious threat to GraphQL APIs built with `graphql-js`.  The lack of built-in cost limitation in `graphql-js` makes it vulnerable to this type of attack.  Implementing query cost analysis, using a library like `graphql-cost-analysis`, is the most effective mitigation strategy.  Combining cost analysis with query depth limiting and database monitoring provides a robust defense against malicious queries.  Developers should prioritize these security measures to protect their GraphQL APIs from DoS attacks and performance degradation. Setting timeout and using pagination are good practices too.
