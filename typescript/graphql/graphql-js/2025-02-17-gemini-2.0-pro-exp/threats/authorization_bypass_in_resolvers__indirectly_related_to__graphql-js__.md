Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Authorization Bypass in Resolvers" threat for a `graphql-js` based application.

## Deep Analysis: Authorization Bypass in Resolvers (graphql-js)

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:** To thoroughly understand the "Authorization Bypass in Resolvers" threat, identify its root causes, explore potential attack vectors, analyze its impact, and refine mitigation strategies specifically within the context of a `graphql-js` application.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable guidance to developers to prevent this vulnerability.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses on:
    *   How `graphql-js`'s design and execution model contribute to (or fail to prevent) authorization bypasses.
    *   Common patterns in resolver implementation that lead to authorization vulnerabilities.
    *   Specific attack vectors exploiting these vulnerabilities.
    *   Practical mitigation techniques applicable to `graphql-js` based systems.
    *   The analysis *excludes* general GraphQL concepts unrelated to `graphql-js` or authorization.  It also excludes vulnerabilities in *external* authorization services (e.g., a flawed OAuth provider), focusing instead on how authorization is *handled within the GraphQL layer itself*.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examine the initial threat description and refine it based on `graphql-js` specifics.
    2.  **Code Analysis (Hypothetical & Examples):**  Construct hypothetical `graphql-js` resolver code snippets demonstrating vulnerable and secure patterns. Analyze existing open-source `graphql-js` projects (if available and relevant) for potential vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Attack Vector Exploration:**  Develop concrete GraphQL queries that could exploit identified vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Detail specific, actionable steps developers can take to prevent or mitigate the threat, including code examples and best practices.
    5.  **Tooling and Framework Consideration:** Evaluate how existing tools and frameworks (e.g., authorization libraries, schema directive implementations) can assist in mitigating the threat.

### 2. Threat Modeling Review (Refined)

*   **Threat:** Authorization Bypass in Resolvers
*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious GraphQL queries that, due to insufficient authorization checks within `graphql-js` resolvers, allow them to access data or perform actions they should not be permitted to.  `graphql-js` itself does not enforce authorization; it relies entirely on the resolver logic implemented by developers. This makes it crucial that developers understand and implement authorization correctly.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data, financial records, internal documents, etc.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Unauthorized changes or deletion of data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining access to higher-level privileges within the application.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of user trust and potential legal consequences.
*   **Affected Component:**  `graphql-js` resolvers (the application code that fetches data and performs actions).  While `graphql-js` executes the query, the vulnerability lies in the *application's* resolver logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (High impact and potentially high likelihood if authorization is not carefully implemented).
*   **Attacker Profile:**  Could be an unauthenticated user, an authenticated user with limited privileges, or even an insider with some level of access.

### 3. Code Analysis and Vulnerable Patterns

Let's illustrate with hypothetical examples.  Assume a simple schema:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String! @auth(requires: "USER") # Hypothetical directive
  secretData: String @auth(requires: "ADMIN")
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  allUsers: [User!]!
}
```

**Vulnerable Resolver (Example 1: No Authorization Check):**

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
      // VULNERABLE: No authorization check!  Any user can fetch any other user.
      return await db.getUserById(args.id);
    },
    allUsers: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
        return await db.getAllUsers();
    }
  },
};
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  The `user` resolver doesn't check if the requesting user (typically available in the `context`) has permission to access the requested user's data.  An attacker could simply provide any user ID and retrieve their information. The `allUsers` resolver is also vulnerable.

**Vulnerable Resolver (Example 2: Inconsistent Authorization):**

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
      // Partially VULNERABLE: Checks only for the 'email' field, not other sensitive fields.
      if (info.fieldNodes[0].selectionSet.selections.some(sel => sel.name.value === 'email')) {
        if (!context.user || context.user.id !== args.id) {
          throw new Error("Unauthorized");
        }
      }
      return await db.getUserById(args.id);
    },
  },
};
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  The resolver attempts authorization but only checks if the `email` field is requested.  An attacker could request `id`, `username`, and `secretData` (if they know the field exists) without triggering the authorization check. This highlights the difficulty of implementing authorization based on requested fields.

**Vulnerable Resolver (Example 3: Incorrect Context Usage):**

```javascript
const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        user: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
            //VULNERABLE: context is not properly checked or is missing
            if(context){ //context can be {}
                return await db.getUserById(args.id);
            }
            throw new Error("Unauthorized");
        },
    },
};
```

*   **Vulnerability:**  The resolver attempts authorization but context is not properly checked. Attacker can send empty context `{}` and bypass authorization.

**Secure Resolver (Example):**

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
      // SECURE:  Uses a centralized authorization function.
      if (!context.user) {
        throw new Error("Authentication required");
      }
      const requestedUser = await db.getUserById(args.id);
      if (!canAccessUser(context.user, requestedUser)) {
        throw new Error("Unauthorized");
      }
      return requestedUser;
    },
     allUsers: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
        if (!context.user || context.user.role !== 'ADMIN') {
            throw new Error("Unauthorized");
        }
        return await db.getAllUsers();
    }
  },
};

// Centralized authorization logic (example)
function canAccessUser(currentUser, requestedUser) {
  // Check if the current user is the same as the requested user, or if they have admin privileges.
  return currentUser.id === requestedUser.id || currentUser.role === 'ADMIN';
}
```

*   **Security:** This resolver uses a dedicated `canAccessUser` function to encapsulate the authorization logic. This promotes consistency and reduces the risk of errors.  It also checks for authentication *before* fetching data, preventing unnecessary database calls. The `allUsers` resolver is protected by role check.

### 4. Attack Vector Exploration

Based on the vulnerable examples above, here are some potential attack queries:

*   **Attack 1 (Against Example 1):**

    ```graphql
    query {
      user(id: "admin_user_id") {
        id
        username
        email
        secretData
      }
    }
    ```

    This query attempts to retrieve all information about a user with a specific ID (potentially an administrator).  Since there's no authorization check, the query will succeed.

*   **Attack 2 (Against Example 2):**

    ```graphql
    query {
      user(id: "some_user_id") {
        id
        username
        secretData
      }
    }
    ```

    This query avoids requesting the `email` field, bypassing the flawed authorization check and potentially retrieving `secretData`.

* **Attack 3 (Against Example 3):**
    ```graphql
        query {
          user(id: "admin_user_id") {
            id
            username
            email
            secretData
          }
        }
    ```
    This query will be send with empty context `{}`.

*   **Attack 4 (Brute-Force/Enumeration):**

    ```graphql
    query {
      user(id: "1") { id username }
    }
    query {
      user(id: "2") { id username }
    }
    query {
      user(id: "3") { id username }
    }
    ...
    ```

    An attacker could iterate through user IDs, attempting to enumerate existing users and potentially discover sensitive information.  Even if only `id` and `username` are returned, this can be valuable for further attacks.

### 5. Mitigation Strategy Refinement

Here are refined mitigation strategies, with specific recommendations for `graphql-js`:

1.  **Centralized Authorization Logic:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Implement a dedicated authorization layer *separate* from your resolvers.  This could be a set of functions, a class, or a dedicated library.
    *   **Example:**  Use a function like `canAccessUser(currentUser, requestedResource, action)` that encapsulates all authorization rules.  Call this function at the *beginning* of each resolver.
    *   **Benefits:**  Consistency, easier testing, reduced code duplication, and easier auditing.

2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Adopt a well-defined access control model. RBAC (assigning permissions to roles) is often sufficient, but ABAC (using attributes of the user, resource, and environment) provides more fine-grained control.
    *   **Example:**  Define roles like "USER", "ADMIN", "MODERATOR" and assign permissions accordingly.  In your authorization logic, check the user's role against the required role for the requested resource.
    *   **Benefits:**  Structured and manageable authorization rules.

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  While not directly authorization, validate all inputs to resolvers to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
    *   **Example:**  Use a library like `joi` or `validator.js` to validate user IDs, email addresses, and other inputs.
    *   **Benefits:**  Reduces the attack surface and prevents unexpected behavior.

4.  **Schema Directives (with Caution):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Consider using schema directives (e.g., `@auth(requires: "ADMIN")`) for declarative authorization.  However, ensure the directive implementation is robust and thoroughly tested.  Directives can simplify the code but can also obscure the authorization logic if not used carefully.
    *   **Example (using a hypothetical `auth` directive):**

        ```javascript
        import { mapSchema, getDirective, MapperKind } from '@graphql-tools/utils';
        import { defaultFieldResolver } from 'graphql';

        function authDirectiveTransformer(schema, directiveName) {
          return mapSchema(schema, {
            [MapperKind.OBJECT_FIELD]: (fieldConfig) => {
              const authDirective = getDirective(schema, fieldConfig, directiveName)?.[0];

              if (authDirective) {
                const { requires } = authDirective;
                if (requires) {
                  const { resolve = defaultFieldResolver } = fieldConfig;
                  fieldConfig.resolve = async function (source, args, context, info) {
                    if (!context.user || context.user.role !== requires) {
                      throw new Error('Not authorized!');
                    }
                    return resolve(source, args, context, info);
                  };
                  return fieldConfig;
                }
              }
            },
          });
        }

        // Apply the directive transformer to your schema
        let schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });
        schema = authDirectiveTransformer(schema, 'auth');
        ```
    *   **Benefits:**  Can make authorization rules more explicit in the schema.
    *   **Cautions:**  Requires a well-implemented directive transformer.  Can make it harder to debug authorization issues if the logic is too complex.  Don't rely *solely* on directives; always have a fallback authorization mechanism in your resolvers.

5.  **Thorough Testing:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for your resolvers, specifically focusing on authorization scenarios.  Test with different user roles, invalid inputs, and edge cases.
    *   **Example:**  Create test cases that simulate unauthenticated users, users with limited privileges, and users attempting to access unauthorized data.
    *   **Benefits:**  Catches authorization bugs early in the development process.

6.  **Least Privilege Principle:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Ensure that users and services have only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    *   **Example:**  Don't grant all users "ADMIN" access by default.  Create specific roles with limited permissions.

7.  **Context Propagation:**
    *  **Recommendation:** Ensure that authentication information (user ID, roles, etc.) is reliably and securely propagated through the `context` object to all resolvers.
    * **Example:** Use middleware in your GraphQL server (e.g., Express middleware) to authenticate the user and populate the `context` object *before* the GraphQL execution begins.
    * **Benefits:** Consistent access to authentication data within resolvers.

8. **Avoid Field-Level Authorization (Generally):**
    * **Recommendation:** While technically possible, avoid implementing authorization logic that depends on which fields are requested in the query. This is brittle and error-prone. Instead, authorize access to the *entire resource* (e.g., the `User` object) based on the user's permissions.
    * **Example:** Instead of checking if the `email` field is requested, check if the user has permission to access *any* information about the requested user.
    * **Benefits:** Simpler, more robust authorization logic.

9. **Use of Libraries:**
    * **Recommendation:** Consider using libraries like `graphql-shield`, `@envelop/generic-auth`, or custom-built authorization middleware to help manage authorization logic.
    * **Benefits:** Can provide pre-built authorization mechanisms, reducing the need to write custom code.
    * **Cautions:** Carefully evaluate the security and maintainability of any third-party library before using it.

### 6. Tooling and Framework Consideration

*   **graphql-shield:** A popular library for implementing permission logic in GraphQL servers. It provides a rule-based system for defining authorization rules and applying them to resolvers.
*   **@envelop/generic-auth:** A plugin for the Envelop GraphQL framework that provides a generic authentication and authorization layer.
*   **Apollo Server / Express GraphQL:** These GraphQL server implementations provide mechanisms for adding middleware, which can be used to implement authentication and authorization logic before the GraphQL execution begins.
*   **GraphQL Inspector:** This tool can help identify potential security vulnerabilities in your GraphQL schema, including missing authorization checks.
* **GraphQL Armor:** Security suite for GraphQL servers.

### 7. Conclusion

Authorization bypass in `graphql-js` resolvers is a critical vulnerability that can lead to severe data breaches.  `graphql-js` itself does not enforce authorization, placing the responsibility entirely on developers.  By understanding the common vulnerable patterns, implementing robust authorization logic, and thoroughly testing resolvers, developers can effectively mitigate this threat.  Centralized authorization, RBAC/ABAC, input validation, and careful use of schema directives are key components of a secure `graphql-js` application.  Leveraging existing libraries and tools can further simplify and strengthen the authorization process.  Continuous monitoring and security audits are also essential to maintain a secure GraphQL API.
