## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise GraphQL-js Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_graphql-js_application__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal of the attacker, representing the successful compromise of the application by exploiting weaknesses within the GraphQL-js framework or its implementation. Successful exploitation of any of the child nodes contributes to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Structure [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_structure__critical_node_.md)

* This category of attacks focuses on manipulating the structure of GraphQL queries to overwhelm the server or trigger unintended behavior.

    * **Excessive Query Depth [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack:** Attackers craft deeply nested queries to exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, stack). `graphql-js` by default has no limit on query depth. Example: `query { a { b { c { d { e ... } } } } }` with many nested levels.
        * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to stack overflow or resource exhaustion, rendering the server unresponsive.
        * **Actionable Insights:** Implement Query Depth Limiting by configuring `graphql-js` to enforce a maximum query depth. Use Cost Analysis to calculate the cost of a query and reject overly expensive ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Excessive Query Complexity [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/excessive_query_complexity__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Excessive Query Complexity [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack:** Attackers create queries with many fields and connections, leading to high processing time and resource consumption.
        * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to CPU or memory exhaustion, causing performance degradation or server crashes.
        * **Actionable Insights:** Implement Query Complexity Analysis using libraries or custom logic to analyze query complexity and reject expensive queries. Enforce Pagination and Limiting on list fields to restrict the amount of data fetched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Directives (If Custom) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_directives__if_custom___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Malicious Directives (If Custom) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack:** If the application uses custom GraphQL directives, attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in their implementation by crafting queries that trigger unintended or malicious logic within the directives.
        * **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, or other malicious actions depending on the directive's functionality.
        * **Actionable Insights:** Secure Directive Implementation by thoroughly reviewing and testing custom directive code for vulnerabilities. Implement Input Validation within Directives to ensure proper validation of arguments passed to them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

* This category involves exploiting flaws in how the application validates input provided through GraphQL queries and mutations.

    * **Bypass Input Validation Rules [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack:** Attackers try to bypass validation rules defined in the GraphQL schema or resolvers by providing input that exploits weaknesses in validation logic (e.g., edge cases, incorrect regular expressions).
        * **Impact:** Injection of malicious data into resolvers, potentially leading to SQL injection, command injection, or other vulnerabilities depending on how the resolvers process the data.
        * **Actionable Insights:** Implement Robust Input Validation using schema definitions, custom validators, and sanitization techniques. Conduct Regular Security Audits of validation logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Rate Limiting on Mutations/Complex Queries [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_rate_limiting_on_mutationscomplex_queries__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Lack of Rate Limiting on Mutations/Complex Queries [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack:** Without rate limiting, attackers can send a large number of mutation requests or complex queries to overwhelm the server's resources.
        * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
        * **Actionable Insights:** Implement Rate Limiting based on IP address, user, or other relevant factors, especially for mutations and complex queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Introspection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_introspection__critical_node_.md)

* While not always directly exploitable for critical impact, introspection provides valuable information to attackers, enabling more targeted attacks.

    * **Discover Internal Type Names/Relationships:**
        * **Craft More Targeted Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH - ENABLER]:**
            * **Attack:** Attackers use introspection to map out the internal schema structure, including type names and relationships that might not be intended for public knowledge.
            * **Impact:** Enables attackers to craft more targeted and sophisticated attacks by understanding the underlying data model, increasing the likelihood of successful exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
            * **Actionable Insights:** Design Schema with Security in Mind, avoiding exposing unnecessary internal details. Consider Schema Stitching/Federation and carefully manage the exposure of underlying schemas.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Batching Vulnerabilities (If Implemented)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_batching_vulnerabilities__if_implemented_.md)

* This applies if the application implements GraphQL query batching.

    * **Send Malicious Batched Queries:**
        * **Introduce Inter-Query Dependencies for Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack:** Attackers send a batch of queries containing inter-dependencies that can be exploited to cause unintended side effects or extract sensitive information. This requires understanding how the batching mechanism processes and executes queries in relation to each other.
            * **Impact:** Potential for complex exploits, data manipulation, or unauthorized access by leveraging the dependencies between batched queries.
            * **Actionable Insights:** Secure Batching Implementation by carefully reviewing and testing the logic for processing batched queries. Implement Individual Query Validation, validating each query within a batch independently before execution. Limit Batch Size to restrict the number of queries in a single batch.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Resolvers (Enabled by GraphQL-js) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_resolvers__enabled_by_graphql-js___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* This category represents vulnerabilities within the custom resolver functions that handle the logic for fetching and manipulating data in response to GraphQL queries. While `graphql-js` itself doesn't contain these vulnerabilities, it provides the framework for their execution.

    * **Inject Malicious Payloads via GraphQL Input:**
        * **SQL Injection (if resolvers interact with databases) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack:** Attackers craft GraphQL queries with malicious input values that are then directly incorporated into SQL queries within resolvers without proper sanitization or parameterization.
            * **Impact:** Critical, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database compromise.
            * **Actionable Insights:** Implement Secure Resolver Implementation by using parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize user input before incorporating it into database queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection (if resolvers execute system commands) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__if_resolvers_execute_system_commands___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Command Injection (if resolvers execute system commands) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack:** Attackers provide malicious input through GraphQL that is then used by resolvers to execute system commands without proper sanitization.
            * **Impact:** Critical, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to take control of the system.
            * **Actionable Insights:** Avoid executing system commands based on user input if possible. If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize input before using it in system commands. Use secure alternatives to system calls where available.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Flaws in Custom Resolver Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/logic_flaws_in_custom_resolver_code__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Logic Flaws in Custom Resolver Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the custom logic of the resolvers, such as incorrect authorization checks, flawed business logic, or unhandled edge cases.
            * **Impact:** Medium to High, potentially leading to data corruption, unauthorized access to data or functionality, or unexpected application behavior.
            * **Actionable Insights:** Implement Secure Resolver Implementation by following secure coding practices. Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of resolver logic. Implement proper authorization and authentication mechanisms.
