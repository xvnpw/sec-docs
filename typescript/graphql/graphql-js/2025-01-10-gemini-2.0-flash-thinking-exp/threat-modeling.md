# Threat Model Analysis for graphql/graphql-js

## Threat: [Complex Query Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/complex_query_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Description: An attacker crafts a GraphQL query with excessive nesting, aliases, or arguments. This overwhelms the `graphql-js` parser, consuming excessive CPU and memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.
*   Impact: Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, causing service disruption and potentially impacting availability for legitimate users.
*   Affected Component: `graphql-js` parser module (specifically the parsing and tokenization functions).
*   Risk Severity: High
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement query complexity analysis and set a maximum allowed complexity score.
    *   Limit the maximum depth of queries.
    *   Limit the number of fields in a selection set.
    *   Implement timeouts for query parsing.

## Threat: [Insufficient Query Validation](./threats/insufficient_query_validation.md)

*   Description: An attacker crafts a syntactically valid but semantically malicious GraphQL query that bypasses intended restrictions or exploits logical flaws that the standard `graphql-js` validation doesn't catch. This could lead to unexpected behavior or resource consumption.
*   Impact: Unexpected application behavior, potential for resource exhaustion if invalid queries trigger expensive operations, and in some cases, could be a stepping stone for further exploitation.
*   Affected Component: `graphql-js` validation module (specifically the validation rules and schema definition processing).
*   Risk Severity: High
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement custom validation rules beyond the standard GraphQL specification using `graphql-js`'s validation API.
    *   Validate input arguments against expected types, formats, and ranges within custom validation logic.
    *   Enforce business logic constraints within custom validation rules.
    *   Regularly review and update validation rules as the schema evolves.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion Through Complex Resolvers (Triggered by `graphql-js`)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_complex_resolvers__triggered_by__graphql-js__.md)

*   Description: An attacker crafts queries that, when processed by `graphql-js`, trigger computationally expensive resolver executions or excessive data fetching. While the resolver logic is application-specific, `graphql-js` is the engine that initiates these calls based on the query.
*   Impact: Application slowdowns, crashes, and service disruption due to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, database connections) triggered by `graphql-js`'s execution of complex queries.
*   Affected Component: `graphql-js` executor (specifically the functions responsible for resolving fields and executing resolvers).
*   Risk Severity: High
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement query complexity analysis and set a maximum allowed complexity score to limit the scope of resolver execution.
    *   Implement data loader patterns in resolvers to batch and deduplicate data fetching requests, reducing the load triggered by `graphql-js`.
    *   Set timeouts for resolver execution within the `graphql-js` execution context.
    *   Monitor resource usage and identify expensive resolvers that can be targeted by malicious queries.
