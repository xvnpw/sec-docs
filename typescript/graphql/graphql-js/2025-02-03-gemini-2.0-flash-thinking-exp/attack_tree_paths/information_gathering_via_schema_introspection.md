### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Information Gathering via Schema Introspection

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting the GraphQL introspection feature, which is enabled by default in `graphql-js`.

GraphQL introspection is a powerful feature of GraphQL that allows clients to query the schema of a GraphQL API. This feature is enabled by default in `graphql-js` and is intended to be used by development tools like GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground to provide interactive API exploration and documentation. However, if left enabled in production environments without proper access control, it becomes a significant information disclosure vulnerability.

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **1. Exploit GraphQL Schema Introspection:**

    *   **Description:** This is the initial step in the attack path. The attacker recognizes that the target application is using GraphQL and attempts to leverage the introspection feature to gather information about the API. This step is predicated on the assumption that introspection is enabled and accessible.
    *   **Technical Details:**  GraphQL introspection is accessed through reserved fields within the GraphQL query language, primarily `__schema` and `__type`. These fields are part of the GraphQL specification and are implemented by `graphql-js` by default. An attacker simply needs to send a GraphQL query to the API endpoint that includes these introspection fields.
    *   **Example Query:**
        ```graphql
        query IntrospectionQuery {
          __schema {
            queryType { name }
            mutationType { name }
            subscriptionType { name }
            types {
              name
              description
              fields {
                name
                description
                type {
                  name
                  kind
                  ofType {
                    name
                    kind
                  }
                }
                args {
                  name
                  description
                  type {
                    name
                    kind
                    ofType {
                      name
                      kind
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
              interfaces {
                name
              }
              enumValues {
                name
                description
              }
              inputFields {
                name
                description
                type {
                  name
                  kind
                  ofType {
                    name
                    kind
                  }
                }
              }
              possibleTypes {
                name
              }
            }
            directives {
              name
              description
              locations
              args {
                name
                description
                type {
                  name
                  kind
                  ofType {
                    name
                    kind
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    *   **Attacker Perspective:**  The attacker's goal at this stage is simply to confirm if introspection is enabled and to initiate the process of retrieving the schema. No specialized tools are required; standard GraphQL clients or even `curl` can be used to send the introspection query.

*   **1.1. Discover Schema Details:**

    *   **Description:**  This node represents the core objective of the information gathering attack. Once introspection is confirmed to be enabled, the attacker proceeds to retrieve and analyze the schema details. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the API's structure, capabilities, and data model.
    *   **Technical Details:**  The introspection query (like the example above) returns a JSON response containing the complete schema definition. This includes:
        *   **Types:**  Definitions of all object types, interfaces, enums, scalars, and input object types.
        *   **Fields:**  For each type, the available fields, their types, descriptions, and arguments.
        *   **Queries, Mutations, Subscriptions:**  The root query, mutation, and subscription types, outlining the entry points for data retrieval and manipulation.
        *   **Directives:**  Custom directives defined in the schema.
    *   **Analysis by Attacker:**  The attacker will meticulously examine the schema details to:
        *   **Identify sensitive data fields:** Look for fields with names suggesting sensitive information (e.g., `userPassword`, `creditCardNumber`, `apiKey`, `secretKey`).
        *   **Understand data relationships:**  Analyze the connections between types to understand how data is structured and related within the application.
        *   **Discover available queries and mutations:**  Identify the operations the API supports, including how to query specific data and perform actions (mutations).
        *   **Map API endpoints:**  Understand the logical structure of the API, even if the physical endpoints are not directly exposed in the schema.
        *   **Identify potential vulnerabilities:**  Look for patterns or structures that might suggest authorization weaknesses, input validation issues, or other vulnerabilities. For example, overly complex queries or mutations might be targets for denial-of-service attacks or business logic flaws.

*   **1.1.1. Access Introspection Endpoint:**

    *   **Description:** This is the most direct and common method to retrieve the schema. It involves sending a standard GraphQL introspection query to the application's GraphQL endpoint.
    *   **Technical Details:**  As explained in node 1, accessing the introspection endpoint simply means sending a valid GraphQL query containing introspection fields (like `__schema`) to the standard GraphQL endpoint of the application.  No special endpoint is typically required; introspection is part of the GraphQL specification and is handled by the GraphQL server at the same endpoint used for regular queries and mutations.
    *   **Tools and Techniques:**  Attackers can use various tools to access the introspection endpoint:
        *   **GraphQL Clients (e.g., GraphiQL, GraphQL Playground, Altair GraphQL Client):** These tools are designed for interacting with GraphQL APIs and have built-in features for sending introspection queries.
        *   **`curl` or `wget`:**  Simple command-line tools can be used to send POST requests with the introspection query in the request body.
        *   **Custom Scripts:**  Attackers can write scripts in languages like Python or JavaScript to automate the process of sending introspection queries and parsing the response.
    *   **Ease of Exploitation:**  This method is extremely easy to exploit if introspection is enabled and not restricted. It requires minimal technical skill and can be performed quickly.

**Impact:**

While schema introspection itself is not a direct attack that immediately compromises the application, the information gained is invaluable for attackers to plan and execute more sophisticated and targeted attacks. The impact of successful schema introspection includes:

*   **Detailed API Blueprint:**  Attackers gain a complete blueprint of the API, understanding its structure, data models, and functionalities. This eliminates the need for blind probing and significantly reduces the effort required to understand the API.
*   **Targeted Attack Planning:**  With schema knowledge, attackers can craft highly targeted queries and mutations to:
    *   **Extract sensitive data:**  Knowing the field names and types allows for precise queries to retrieve specific sensitive information.
    *   **Bypass authorization:**  Understanding the schema can reveal authorization logic and potential weaknesses. Attackers can identify fields or mutations that might be improperly protected or have vulnerabilities in their authorization checks.
    *   **Manipulate data:**  Schema knowledge enables attackers to craft mutations to modify data in ways that might be harmful or unauthorized.
    *   **Exploit business logic flaws:**  Understanding the API's operations can reveal business logic vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:**  Exposing the schema effectively increases the attack surface of the application by providing attackers with detailed information about its internal workings.
*   **Faster Attack Development:**  Schema introspection significantly accelerates the reconnaissance phase of an attack, allowing attackers to quickly identify valuable targets and plan their next steps.

**Mitigation:**

To mitigate the risks associated with schema introspection, the following strategies are recommended for `graphql-js` applications:

*   **Disable introspection in production environments:**

    *   **Best Practice:** This is the most effective and highly recommended mitigation. In production, introspection is generally not needed for public clients and should be disabled to prevent information disclosure.
    *   **Implementation in `graphql-js`:**  When creating a GraphQL schema using `graphql-js`, you can disable introspection by setting the `introspection` option to `false` in the `graphql` function or schema configuration.
        ```javascript
        const { graphql, buildSchema } = require('graphql');

        const schema = buildSchema(`
          type Query {
            hello: String
          }
        `);

        // ... your resolvers ...

        // When executing a query, you can control introspection:
        graphql({
          schema,
          source: '{ __schema { queryType { name } } }',
          introspection: false, // Disable introspection for this execution
          // ... other options
        }).then(response => {
          console.log(response); // Will likely return an error related to introspection being disabled
        });

        // Alternatively, you might configure it at the schema building level (depending on your setup and schema construction method).
        // For example, if you are using a framework or library that wraps graphql-js, check its documentation for schema configuration options related to introspection.
        ```
    *   **Verification:** After disabling introspection, attempt to send an introspection query to your GraphQL endpoint. It should return an error or an empty response, indicating that introspection is no longer accessible.

*   **Restrict access to the introspection endpoint:**

    *   **Use Case:** In some scenarios, introspection might be required in production for specific purposes, such as internal monitoring tools, API gateways, or authorized development teams. In such cases, disabling it entirely might not be feasible.
    *   **Implementation Strategies:**
        *   **Network-level restrictions (Firewall/WAF):**  Restrict access to the GraphQL endpoint (and thus introspection) based on IP addresses or network segments. Allow only authorized IP ranges to access the endpoint.
        *   **Application-level Authentication/Authorization:** Implement authentication and authorization middleware for your GraphQL endpoint.  Require users to authenticate before they can access the GraphQL endpoint, and then authorize access to introspection based on roles or permissions. This can be implemented within your GraphQL server logic or using middleware provided by your framework.
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on the GraphQL endpoint to mitigate brute-force attempts to exploit introspection or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Complexity:** Restricting access is more complex than simply disabling introspection and requires careful implementation and maintenance of access control mechanisms.

**Best Practices Recommendation:**

For production environments, the **strongest recommendation is to disable GraphQL introspection entirely.**  This eliminates the information disclosure vulnerability and significantly reduces the attack surface. If introspection is absolutely necessary for specific internal tools, implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to only authorized users or systems.  Regularly review and audit access controls to ensure they remain effective.

By understanding the mechanics and impact of schema introspection, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly enhance the security of their `graphql-js` based GraphQL APIs.
