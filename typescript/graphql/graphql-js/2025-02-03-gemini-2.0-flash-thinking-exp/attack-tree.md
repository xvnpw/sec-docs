## Attack Tree Path: [Information Gathering via Schema Introspection](./attack_tree_paths/information_gathering_via_schema_introspection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the GraphQL introspection feature, which is enabled by default in `graphql-js`.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **1. Exploit GraphQL Schema Introspection:** The starting point of information gathering.
    *   **1.1. Discover Schema Details:** The goal of introspection - to understand the API structure.
    *   **1.1.1. Access Introspection Endpoint:** The most direct method to retrieve the schema using a standard GraphQL query.
*   **Impact:** While not directly causing immediate harm, schema introspection reveals the entire API structure, including types, fields, relationships, and mutations. This information is invaluable for attackers to plan and execute more targeted attacks, such as crafting complex queries, identifying sensitive data fields, and exploiting authorization weaknesses.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Disable introspection in production environments.** This is the most effective way to prevent schema exposure.
    *   **Restrict access to the introspection endpoint.** If introspection is needed for specific purposes (e.g., development tools), limit access to authorized users or IP addresses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Complexity](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_query_complexity.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting and sending complex GraphQL queries that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), leading to service disruption or outage.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **2. Exploit GraphQL Query Complexity:** The overall attack vector focusing on complex queries.
    *   **2.1. Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries:** The specific type of attack - DoS.
    *   **2.1.1. Craft Deeply Nested Queries:** Exploiting query depth to overload the server.
    *   **2.1.2. Craft Wide Queries (Large Selection Sets):** Exploiting large selection sets to retrieve excessive data and strain resources.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, slow response times, resource exhaustion, and potential server crashes. This can disrupt business operations and impact user experience.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement Query Depth Limiting:** Restrict the maximum depth of nested queries to prevent deeply nested attacks.
    *   **Implement Query Complexity Analysis and Cost Limits:** Analyze query complexity based on factors like depth, breadth, and field costs. Reject queries exceeding predefined complexity thresholds.
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a specific time frame to prevent rapid-fire DoS attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Batch Query Amplification DoS](./attack_tree_paths/batch_query_amplification_dos.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If GraphQL batching is implemented, attackers can send large batches of malicious or complex queries in a single request. This amplifies the impact of DoS attacks, as the server processes multiple queries at once.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **3. Exploit GraphQL Batching (If Implemented):** The overall attack vector leveraging batching.
    *   **3.1. Batch Query Amplification Attacks:** The specific type of attack - amplification through batching.
    *   **3.1. Batch Query Amplification Attacks:** (Repeated node for clarity in path)
*   **Impact:** Exacerbated DoS attacks, leading to more severe service disruption and resource exhaustion compared to single query DoS.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Limit Batch Size:** Restrict the maximum number of queries allowed in a single batch request.
    *   **Apply Complexity Analysis to Entire Batch:** Ensure query complexity analysis is applied to the *sum* of complexities of all queries within a batch, not just individual queries.
    *   **Combine with general DoS mitigations:** Implement rate limiting and resource monitoring as described in High-Risk Path 2.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authorization Bypass in Resolvers leading to Data Breach](./attack_tree_paths/authorization_bypass_in_resolvers_leading_to_data_breach.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in authorization logic within GraphQL resolvers. This can occur due to missing authorization checks or flawed authorization implementations, allowing attackers to access data they are not permitted to see or modify.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **4. Exploit Authorization/Authentication Weaknesses in Resolvers:** The overall attack vector targeting authorization.
    *   **4.1. Authorization Bypass in Resolvers:** The specific type of vulnerability - authorization bypass.
    *   **4.1.1. Missing Authorization Checks:** A common and critical developer error where resolvers directly access data without verifying user permissions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, data manipulation, and potential compromise of user accounts or the entire application. This is a high-impact vulnerability with severe consequences.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement Authorization Checks in Every Resolver:** Ensure that every resolver that accesses protected data includes robust authorization checks to verify user permissions before retrieving or modifying data.
    *   **Thoroughly Test and Review Authorization Logic:** Conduct comprehensive testing of authorization rules in resolvers to ensure they are correctly implemented, cover all access control scenarios, and prevent bypasses.
    *   **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to access data and perform actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Leakage via Verbose Error Messages](./attack_tree_paths/information_leakage_via_verbose_error_messages.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** GraphQL error responses, if not properly handled, can expose sensitive information about the server, application internals, or even data being processed. Verbose error messages can reveal stack traces, database details, internal paths, or other debugging information.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **5. Data Exposure via GraphQL Errors:** The overall attack vector related to error handling.
    *   **5.1. Verbose Error Messages:** The specific type of error handling issue.
    *   **5.1.1. Expose Internal Server Details in Errors:** The most common form of information leakage through error messages.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, which can aid attackers in understanding the application's architecture, identifying vulnerabilities, and planning further attacks. In some cases, error messages might even inadvertently leak sensitive data directly.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement Generic Error Messages in Production:** In production environments, configure GraphQL to return generic, user-friendly error messages that do not reveal internal details.
    *   **Log Detailed Errors Securely:** Log detailed error information (including stack traces and debugging data) securely on the server-side for debugging and monitoring purposes, but ensure these logs are not accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Sanitize Error Responses:** Avoid including sensitive data in error details, even in development environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code/Schema Injection in Dynamic GraphQL Scenarios](./attack_tree_paths/codeschema_injection_in_dynamic_graphql_scenarios.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the GraphQL schema or resolvers are dynamically generated based on user-controlled input (which is generally discouraged and uncommon), it becomes possible for attackers to inject malicious code or schema definitions.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **6. GraphQL Injection:** The overall attack vector related to injection.
    *   **6.1. Resolver Code Injection (If Dynamic Resolver Generation):** Injection into dynamically generated resolvers.
    *   **6.2. Schema Definition Injection (If Dynamic Schema Generation):** Injection into dynamically generated schema definitions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resolver Code Injection:** Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to completely compromise the server and application.
    *   **Schema Definition Injection:** Can allow attackers to manipulate the schema, potentially introducing new vulnerabilities, bypassing security measures, or causing unexpected behavior.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Schema/Resolver Generation from Untrusted Input:** The best mitigation is to avoid dynamically generating schemas or resolvers based on user-provided input. Design schemas and resolvers statically whenever possible.
    *   **Sanitize and Validate Inputs (If Dynamic Generation is Absolutely Necessary):** If dynamic generation is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate all user inputs used in the generation process to prevent injection attacks. Use secure coding practices to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Library Vulnerabilities in GraphQL-js](./attack_tree_paths/library_vulnerabilities_in_graphql-js.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the `graphql-js` library itself. This can occur if the application uses an outdated version of the library with known vulnerabilities or if undiscovered vulnerabilities exist in even the latest versions.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **7. Vulnerabilities in GraphQL-js Library Itself:** The overall attack vector related to library vulnerabilities.
    *   **7.1. Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs):** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities.
    *   **7.1.1. Outdated GraphQL-js Version:** Using an outdated version is the primary way to be vulnerable to known CVEs.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE), potentially leading to complete application compromise. Library vulnerabilities can have a wide-ranging impact, affecting all applications using the vulnerable version.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep `graphql-js` Updated:** Regularly update the `graphql-js` library to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and potential vulnerabilities related to `graphql-js` and GraphQL in general. Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor vulnerability databases.
    *   **Apply Patches Promptly:** When security patches are released for `graphql-js`, apply them to your application as quickly as possible.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to automatically detect outdated or vulnerable versions of `graphql-js` and other dependencies in your project.
