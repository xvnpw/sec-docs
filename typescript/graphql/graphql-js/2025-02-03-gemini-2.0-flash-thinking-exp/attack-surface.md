# Attack Surface Analysis for graphql/graphql-js

## Attack Surface: [1. Query Complexity Attacks (Denial of Service) - High Severity](./attack_surfaces/1__query_complexity_attacks__denial_of_service__-_high_severity.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit GraphQL's flexibility to construct computationally expensive queries.  The server, using `graphql-js` to parse and execute these queries, can be overwhelmed, leading to denial of service.
*   **GraphQL-JS Contribution:** `graphql-js` by default parses and executes all valid GraphQL queries without inherent limitations on their computational complexity. It does not provide built-in mechanisms to prevent or mitigate complex queries, making applications directly vulnerable if complexity management is not implemented externally.
*   **Example:** A malicious user sends a deeply nested query fetching related data multiple levels deep (e.g., `posts { comments { replies { ... } } }`) or a query with numerous aliased fields, forcing `graphql-js` to perform extensive data fetching and processing, consuming excessive server resources.
*   **Impact:** Server resource exhaustion, application slowdown, service unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement query complexity analysis middleware or functions *outside* of `graphql-js` to intercept and analyze incoming queries before execution.
        *   Define and enforce query complexity limits based on factors like query depth, field selections, and connection counts.
        *   Utilize libraries or custom code to calculate query complexity and reject queries exceeding predefined thresholds *before* they are processed by `graphql-js`'s execution engine.
        *   Consider rate limiting requests based on query complexity or frequency to further mitigate abuse.

## Attack Surface: [2. Introspection Exposure (Information Disclosure) - High Severity](./attack_surfaces/2__introspection_exposure__information_disclosure__-_high_severity.md)

*   **Description:** GraphQL introspection, a feature enabled by default in `graphql-js`, allows clients to query the schema and discover the entire API structure. If not secured, this exposes sensitive information about the API's data model and capabilities.
*   **GraphQL-JS Contribution:** `graphql-js`'s default configuration enables introspection, making the complete schema accessible through standard introspection queries (e.g., using `__schema` field). This default behavior directly contributes to the information disclosure attack surface if not explicitly disabled or secured.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses an introspection query to retrieve the full schema definition from a `graphql-js` powered endpoint. This reveals all types, fields, arguments, and directives, including potentially sensitive data fields, relationships, and mutation capabilities, even without needing prior knowledge of the API.
*   **Impact:** Full schema disclosure, enabling attackers to understand the API's structure, identify potential vulnerabilities, and craft targeted attacks. This knowledge significantly lowers the barrier for malicious exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Disable introspection in production environments.** This is the most direct mitigation for `graphql-js`'s default behavior. Configure your `graphql-js` setup to prevent introspection queries from being processed in production.
        *   If introspection is necessary for specific purposes (e.g., internal tooling), implement robust authorization checks *before* `graphql-js` processes the introspection query. Ensure only authorized users or roles can access introspection data.
        *   Consider schema stripping techniques *before* serving the schema via `graphql-js`. Remove sensitive or internal details from the schema that is exposed through introspection, even if introspection is enabled for authorized users.
