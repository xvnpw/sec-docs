# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for graphql/graphql-js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Depth Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_depth_limiting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `graphql-depth-limit` or Custom Logic:** Integrate a library like `graphql-depth-limit` (designed for `graphql-js`) or develop custom code that leverages `graphql-js`'s AST parsing capabilities to analyze query depth.
    2.  **Define Maximum Depth in `graphql-js` Context:** Determine a maximum query depth suitable for your application's schema and performance within your `graphql-js` server setup.
    3.  **Integrate into `graphql-js` Execution Pipeline:** Incorporate the depth limiting logic as middleware or directly within your `graphql-js` server's query execution flow, ensuring it's applied *before* `graphql-js` executes the query.
    4.  **Analyze Query AST with `graphql-js`:** Use `graphql-js`'s parsing functions to get the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the incoming query and calculate its depth programmatically.
    5.  **Reject Queries via `graphql-js` Error Handling:** If the depth exceeds the limit, use `graphql-js`'s error handling mechanisms to reject the query and return a GraphQL error to the client.
    6.  **Test within `graphql-js` Environment:** Test the depth limiting directly within your `graphql-js` setup to ensure it correctly intercepts and blocks overly deep queries.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Depth:** (Severity: High) - Malicious actors can craft deeply nested queries that, when parsed and executed by `graphql-js`, exhaust server resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Query Depth:** High reduction - Effectively prevents DoS attacks originating from excessive query nesting handled by `graphql-js`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in the GraphQL server using `graphql-depth-limit` middleware within the `graphql-js` execution pipeline. Configuration is within `graphql-server/middleware/depthLimit.js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation currently. Depth limiting is applied within the `graphql-js` server. Consider making the depth limit configurable per schema or operation type within `graphql-js` if more granular control is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Complexity Analysis](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_complexity_analysis.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Complexity Cost Function for `graphql-js` Schema:** Develop a complexity scoring system tailored to your `graphql-js` schema, assigning costs to fields, arguments, and operations that `graphql-js` will process.
    2.  **Set Complexity Threshold in `graphql-js` Server:** Determine a maximum allowed complexity score for queries processed by your `graphql-js` server, based on server capacity.
    3.  **Integrate `graphql-cost-analysis` or Custom Logic with `graphql-js`:** Use a library like `graphql-cost-analysis` (designed for `graphql-js`) or implement custom logic that integrates with `graphql-js`'s query parsing and execution.
    4.  **Analyze Query Complexity using `graphql-js` AST:**  Utilize `graphql-js`'s AST parsing to analyze incoming queries and calculate their complexity score based on your defined cost function *before* `graphql-js` executes the query.
    5.  **Reject Queries via `graphql-js` Error Handling:** If the complexity exceeds the threshold, use `graphql-js`'s error handling to reject the query and return a GraphQL error.
    6.  **Fine-tune Cost Function and Threshold within `graphql-js` Context:** Monitor server performance under `graphql-js` query load and adjust the cost function and complexity threshold to optimize performance and security within your `graphql-js` setup.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Complexity:** (Severity: High) - Attackers can craft complex queries that, when parsed and executed by `graphql-js`, consume excessive server resources due to the nature of operations within the `graphql-js` execution engine.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Query Complexity:** High reduction - Effectively prevents DoS attacks based on overall query complexity as evaluated and handled by `graphql-js`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic complexity analysis is in place using a custom function integrated into the `graphql-js` resolver layer (`graphql-server/utils/complexity.js`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to integrate a more robust library like `graphql-cost-analysis` within the `graphql-js` server for more comprehensive complexity scoring. Refine the cost function and dynamically adjust thresholds based on `graphql-js` server load.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Introspection in Production within `graphql-js` Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/disable_introspection_in_production_within__graphql-js__configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate `graphql-js` Server Configuration:** Find the configuration settings for your `graphql-js` server instance, typically within your server initialization code where you set up the `graphql-js` execution environment.
    2.  **Disable Introspection Setting in `graphql-js`:**  Identify the setting within your `graphql-js` configuration that controls GraphQL introspection (often a configuration option passed to `graphql-js`'s `graphql` function or schema constructor). Set this to `false` for production.
    3.  **Environment-Specific Configuration for `graphql-js`:** Ensure this setting is applied only in production environments where your `graphql-js` server is running, while keeping introspection enabled in development and staging for `graphql-js` schema exploration.
    4.  **Deploy `graphql-js` Configuration Change:** Deploy the updated `graphql-js` server configuration to your production environment.
    5.  **Verify Introspection Disabled via `graphql-js`:** After deployment, attempt to use introspection queries against your production `graphql-js` endpoint to confirm it is disabled by `graphql-js` and returns an error from `graphql-js`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Schema Introspection:** (Severity: Medium) - Exposing the full GraphQL schema generated and served by `graphql-js` allows attackers to understand the API structure defined in `graphql-js`, making it easier to find vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Schema Introspection:** Medium reduction - Significantly reduces the attack surface by preventing `graphql-js` from serving schema details to unauthorized users in production.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in production. Introspection is disabled via environment variable configuration passed to the `graphql-js` server setup (`graphql-server/server.js`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation for production. Consider more granular control for introspection in non-production environments within `graphql-js`, allowing access only to specific developers interacting with the `graphql-js` schema.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Field and Type Level Authorization within `graphql-js` Resolvers and Schema](./mitigation_strategies/implement_field_and_type_level_authorization_within__graphql-js__resolvers_and_schema.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Fields and Types in `graphql-js` Schema:** Determine which fields and types defined in your `graphql-js` schema contain sensitive data or require access control enforced by `graphql-js`.
    2.  **Choose Authorization Mechanism within `graphql-js`:** Select an authorization approach within the `graphql-js` context (e.g., custom directives defined in your `graphql-js` schema, resolver-level checks within `graphql-js` resolvers, or authorization libraries integrated with `graphql-js`).
    3.  **Implement Authorization Logic in `graphql-js` Resolvers or Directives:**
        *   **`graphql-js` Directives:** Create custom directives in your `graphql-js` schema that, when applied to fields or types, trigger authorization checks *before* `graphql-js` resolves the data.
        *   **`graphql-js` Resolver-Level Checks:**  Within the resolver functions defined in your `graphql-js` schema, implement authorization logic to verify user permissions *before* the resolver returns data to `graphql-js`.
    4.  **Define Access Policies for `graphql-js` Schema Elements:** Clearly define access policies for sensitive fields and types in your `graphql-js` schema, specifying roles or permissions required for access, enforced by your chosen `graphql-js` authorization mechanism.
    5.  **Test Authorization within `graphql-js` Execution:** Thoroughly test field and type-level authorization within your `graphql-js` setup to ensure it correctly restricts access to sensitive data based on policies enforced by `graphql-js`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Field and Type Level):** (Severity: High) - Users may be able to access sensitive data fields or entire types defined in your `graphql-js` schema that they are not authorized to view, if `graphql-js` doesn't enforce access control.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Field and Type Level):** High reduction - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data exposed through your `graphql-js` schema, ensuring data privacy at a granular level within the `graphql-js` API.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic field-level authorization is implemented using resolver-level checks within `graphql-js` resolvers for highly sensitive fields (`graphql-server/resolvers/user.js`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to expand field-level authorization across the `graphql-js` schema. Consider adopting a directive-based approach within `graphql-js` or a dedicated authorization library integrated with `graphql-js` for more consistent authorization logic across the `graphql-js` application. Type-level authorization within `graphql-js` is also missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Input Arguments in `graphql-js` Resolvers](./mitigation_strategies/validate_input_arguments_in__graphql-js__resolvers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Types and Arguments in `graphql-js` Schema:** Review your `graphql-js` schema and resolvers to identify all input types and arguments used in mutations and queries processed by `graphql-js`.
    2.  **Define Validation Rules for `graphql-js` Inputs:** For each input argument in your `graphql-js` schema, define validation rules based on expected data types, formats, and constraints that `graphql-js` resolvers should enforce.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic in `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Within each resolver function in your `graphql-js` schema that accepts input arguments:
        *   **Retrieve Input Data from `graphql-js` Context:** Access the input arguments passed to the resolver by `graphql-js`.
        *   **Apply Validation Rules within `graphql-js` Resolver:** Use validation libraries or custom validation functions within the resolver to check if the input data conforms to the defined rules *before* processing the data within `graphql-js`'s execution context.
        *   **Handle Validation Errors within `graphql-js` Error Handling:** If validation fails, use `graphql-js`'s error handling mechanisms to return appropriate GraphQL error messages to the client, indicating invalid input fields.
    4.  **Test Input Validation within `graphql-js` Environment:** Thoroughly test input validation for all input types and arguments in your `graphql-js` setup to ensure resolvers correctly identify and reject invalid input data processed by `graphql-js`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection):** (Severity: High) - Lack of input validation in `graphql-js` resolvers can allow attackers to inject malicious code through input arguments, potentially compromising backend systems accessed by `graphql-js`.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** (Severity: Medium) - Invalid input data processed by `graphql-js` resolvers can lead to data corruption and application errors within the `graphql-js` application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** High reduction - Significantly reduces injection attack risks by preventing malicious input from being processed by `graphql-js` resolvers and reaching backend systems.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium reduction - Improves data quality and application stability within the `graphql-js` application by ensuring input data conforms to expectations enforced by `graphql-js` resolvers.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic input validation is present in some `graphql-js` resolvers using manual checks and regular expressions (`graphql-server/resolvers/mutation.js`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need comprehensive input validation for all input types and arguments across all mutations and queries in the `graphql-js` schema. Adopt a validation library for more structured validation logic within `graphql-js` resolvers. Standardize error handling for validation failures within the `graphql-js` error reporting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Error Messages Generated by `graphql-js` in Production](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_error_messages_generated_by__graphql-js__in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `graphql-js` Error Formatting:** Locate the error formatting or error handling logic within your `graphql-js` server setup, which determines how `graphql-js` errors are presented to clients.
    2.  **Implement Error Sanitization for `graphql-js` Errors:** Modify the error handling logic to:
        *   **Generic Error Messages for Clients from `graphql-js`:** In production, ensure `graphql-js` returns generic, user-friendly error messages to clients when errors occur during `graphql-js` query execution. Avoid exposing detailed `graphql-js` error messages, stack traces, or internal server information originating from `graphql-js`.
        *   **Detailed Error Logging Server-Side for `graphql-js` Errors:** Log detailed error information server-side, including stack traces and context from `graphql-js` errors, for debugging and monitoring purposes.
    3.  **Environment-Specific Error Handling for `graphql-js`:** Ensure error sanitization is applied only in production for `graphql-js` errors. In development and staging, keep detailed `graphql-js` error messages enabled for debugging `graphql-js` schema and resolvers.
    4.  **Test `graphql-js` Error Handling:** Test error handling in both development and production to verify that detailed `graphql-js` errors are logged server-side and generic errors are returned to clients in production when `graphql-js` encounters issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages from `graphql-js`:** (Severity: Low to Medium) - Detailed error messages generated by `graphql-js` can reveal sensitive information about your application's internal workings, schema structure, and potentially vulnerabilities within your `graphql-js` setup.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages from `graphql-js`:** Low to Medium reduction - Prevents accidental information leakage through `graphql-js` error messages in production, making it harder for attackers to gather information about the `graphql-js` application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in production. Error handling middleware in the GraphQL server (`api-gateway/graphql/error-handler.js`) sanitizes error messages originating from `graphql-js` and logs detailed errors server-side.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation for production error sanitization of `graphql-js` errors. Review error logging practices to ensure logs are securely stored and access is restricted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Resolver Logic in `graphql-js`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_resolver_logic_in__graphql-js_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review and Security Audits of `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Conduct regular code reviews and security audits specifically focused on all resolver functions defined in your `graphql-js` schema to identify potential vulnerabilities within the `graphql-js` resolver layer.
    2.  **Follow Secure Coding Practices in `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Adhere to secure coding principles when writing resolvers that are part of your `graphql-js` schema:
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (as described previously) within `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data within `graphql-js` resolvers.
        *   **Parameterized Queries from `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions initiated from `graphql-js` resolvers to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Execution in `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Minimize or eliminate dynamic command execution based on user input within `graphql-js` resolvers.
        *   **Secure API Interactions from `graphql-js` Resolvers:** When `graphql-js` resolvers interact with external APIs, ensure secure communication, proper authentication, and secure handling of API responses within the resolver logic.
        *   **Error Handling in `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Implement robust error handling within `graphql-js` resolvers to prevent unexpected errors and information disclosure from resolver execution.
    3.  **Dependency Management for `graphql-js` Resolver Dependencies:** Keep dependencies used by your `graphql-js` resolvers up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities in libraries used within the `graphql-js` resolver context.
    4.  **Unit and Integration Testing for `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Write unit and integration tests specifically for `graphql-js` resolvers, including tests that target potential security vulnerabilities within the resolver logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection, XSS):** (Severity: High) - Vulnerabilities in `graphql-js` resolver logic can directly lead to injection attacks if resolvers are not securely implemented within the `graphql-js` schema.
    *   **Business Logic Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Medium to High) - Flaws in `graphql-js` resolver logic can lead to business logic vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass intended application behavior or access unauthorized data through the `graphql-js` API.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** (Severity: Medium) - Insecure `graphql-js` resolver logic can lead to data corruption or inconsistencies within the application data managed by `graphql-js`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** High reduction - Secure `graphql-js` resolver logic is crucial for preventing injection attacks at the core of the `graphql-js` application.
    *   **Business Logic Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High reduction - Reduces the risk of business logic vulnerabilities by ensuring `graphql-js` resolvers implement intended functionality securely.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium reduction - Improves data integrity by ensuring `graphql-js` resolvers handle data operations correctly and securely.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Code reviews are conducted periodically, and developers are generally aware of secure coding practices for `graphql-js` resolvers. Parameterized queries are used in some database interactions from `graphql-js` resolvers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need more rigorous security code reviews specifically focused on `graphql-js` resolvers. Enhance unit and integration testing to include security test cases for `graphql-js` resolvers. Implement automated static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities in `graphql-js` resolver code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits in `graphql-js` Resolvers](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_in__graphql-js__resolvers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Resource-Intensive `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Analyze your `graphql-js` resolvers to identify those that might be resource-intensive when executed by `graphql-js` (e.g., resolvers performing complex computations, large database queries, or external API calls from within `graphql-js`).
    2.  **Implement Timeouts in `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Set timeouts for resource-intensive operations within `graphql-js` resolvers, such as database queries, external API calls, or long-running computations performed by resolvers.
    3.  **Limit Data Fetching in `graphql-js` Resolvers:** For resolvers that fetch data from databases or APIs, implement limits on the amount of data fetched by `graphql-js` resolvers (e.g., limit records retrieved from databases, implement pagination for large datasets accessed by resolvers).
    4.  **Circuit Breakers for External Calls from `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Consider using circuit breaker patterns for external API calls or unreliable services accessed by `graphql-js` resolvers to prevent cascading failures originating from resolver execution.
    5.  **Resource Monitoring for `graphql-js` Resolver Execution:** Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, database connections) during `graphql-js` resolver execution to identify potential bottlenecks and resource exhaustion issues caused by resolvers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in `graphql-js` Resolvers:** (Severity: Medium to High) - Resource-intensive `graphql-js` resolvers without limits can be exploited to exhaust server resources when executed by `graphql-js`, leading to DoS.
    *   **Slow Performance and Application Unresponsiveness:** (Severity: Medium) - Unbounded resource usage in `graphql-js` resolvers can cause slow performance and application unresponsiveness for all users interacting with the `graphql-js` API.
    *   **Cascading Failures:** (Severity: Medium) - Unreliable external services or database issues encountered by `graphql-js` resolvers can lead to cascading failures if not handled properly within the resolver logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in `graphql-js` Resolvers:** Medium to High reduction - Prevents DoS attacks based on exploiting resource-intensive operations within `graphql-js` resolvers.
    *   **Slow Performance and Application Unresponsiveness:** Medium reduction - Improves application performance and responsiveness by limiting resource usage during `graphql-js` resolver execution.
    *   **Cascading Failures:** Medium reduction - Enhances application resilience and prevents cascading failures originating from `graphql-js` resolvers by implementing circuit breakers and timeouts.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Timeouts are set for some database queries within `graphql-js` resolvers (`graphql-server/data-access/db.js`). Data fetching limits are implemented in some resolvers using pagination.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to systematically review all `graphql-js` resolvers and implement timeouts and resource limits for all resource-intensive operations performed by resolvers. Consider implementing circuit breakers for external API calls made from `graphql-js` resolvers. Implement more comprehensive resource monitoring for `graphql-js` resolver execution to proactively identify and address resource exhaustion issues caused by resolvers.
