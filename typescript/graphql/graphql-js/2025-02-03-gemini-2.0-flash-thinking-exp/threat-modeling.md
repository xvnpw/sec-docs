# Threat Model Analysis for graphql/graphql-js

## Threat: [Query Complexity Attacks](./threats/query_complexity_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts complex GraphQL queries with deep nesting, excessive aliases, or large selections of fields. These queries are designed to exploit the way `graphql-js` parses and executes queries, leading to excessive server resource consumption (CPU, memory). By sending a large volume of these complex queries, an attacker can overload the server, leading to performance degradation, service unavailability, or even a complete denial of service. While complexity limits are a mitigation implemented *around* `graphql-js`, the core parsing and execution engine of `graphql-js` is what is being targeted by these attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), server performance degradation, service unavailability, resource exhaustion, potential for complete service outage, impacting legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** GraphQL Query Execution within `graphql-js` core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query complexity analysis and limits *before* query execution. This is typically done using libraries or custom logic that integrates with `graphql-js` but is not part of `graphql-js` itself.
        *   Define metrics like maximum query depth, complexity score based on field weights, and maximum number of fields per query.
        *   Reject queries exceeding defined complexity limits *before* they are passed to `graphql-js` for execution.
        *   Implement rate limiting at the GraphQL endpoint to restrict the number of requests.
        *   Set timeouts for query execution to prevent long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely within `graphql-js` execution.

## Threat: [Batching Attacks (If Batching is Enabled and Vulnerable)](./threats/batching_attacks__if_batching_is_enabled_and_vulnerable_.md)

*   **Description:** If GraphQL batching is enabled in the server implementation *around* `graphql-js`, and not properly secured, an attacker can send extremely large batches of queries in a single request. This can overwhelm the `graphql-js` query parsing and execution engine, even if individual queries are not overly complex. The sheer volume of queries processed by `graphql-js` in a short time can exhaust server resources and lead to denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), server performance degradation, service unavailability, resource exhaustion, especially if combined with complex queries in each batch, potentially more severe than single query DoS.
    *   **Affected Component:** GraphQL Batching implementation (around `graphql-js`), Query Parsing and Execution within `graphql-js` core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Limit the maximum size of batched requests (e.g., maximum number of queries per batch) *before* they are processed by `graphql-js`.
        *   Apply query complexity analysis and limits to each query *within* a batch before passing them to `graphql-js` for execution.
        *   Implement rate limiting for batched requests, potentially more aggressively than for single queries.
        *   Carefully consider the necessity of batching in production environments and disable it if not strictly required.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `graphql-js` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__graphql-js__library_itself.md)

*   **Description:**  `graphql-js`, like any software library, may contain security vulnerabilities in its code. These vulnerabilities could be in the core parsing engine, validation logic, or execution engine of `graphql-js`. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to critical impacts depending on the nature of the flaw, potentially ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) to information disclosure or even Remote Code Execution (RCE) *within the server running `graphql-js`*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) to information disclosure, Remote Code Execution (RCE), and complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `graphql-js` library itself (various modules depending on the specific vulnerability - parser, validator, executor).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE or major DoS), High (for information disclosure or less severe DoS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `graphql-js` library updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, GitHub security advisories) specifically for `graphql-js` and its dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for promptly applying security patches and updates to `graphql-js` and other dependencies.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in `graphql-js` and other project dependencies.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of `graphql-js` Leading to Unintended Behavior](./threats/misconfiguration_of__graphql-js__leading_to_unintended_behavior.md)

*   **Description:** While direct misconfiguration vulnerabilities in `graphql-js` itself are less common, improper configuration of server libraries *using* `graphql-js` or misunderstanding `graphql-js` configuration options can lead to unintended and potentially insecure behavior. For example, failing to properly configure error handling or enabling debug features in production that expose sensitive information through `graphql-js`'s error responses. This misconfiguration, while not a flaw *in* `graphql-js` code, directly relates to how developers use and configure `graphql-js` and its surrounding ecosystem.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the misconfiguration, potentially leading to information disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), or other security issues.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration of server libraries using `graphql-js`, understanding and application of `graphql-js` configuration options.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the misconfiguration, can lead to critical issues like information disclosure or DoS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices and official documentation for configuring server libraries that utilize `graphql-js`. Carefully review configuration guides and security recommendations.
        *   Review configuration settings carefully, especially before deploying to production. Double-check security-related settings and ensure they are configured according to security policies.
        *   Use security linters and static analysis tools to identify potential misconfigurations in server setup and GraphQL configuration.
        *   Minimize the attack surface by disabling or removing unnecessary features and modules in production. Only enable features that are strictly required for production functionality.
        *   Regularly review and audit configuration settings to ensure they remain secure and aligned with security best practices.
