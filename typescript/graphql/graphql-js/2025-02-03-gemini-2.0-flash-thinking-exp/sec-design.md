# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, graphql-js, provides a JavaScript implementation of GraphQL, a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

The primary business priority is to provide a robust, reliable, and performant reference implementation of the GraphQL specification in JavaScript. This enables developers to build GraphQL servers and clients in JavaScript environments, fostering the adoption and growth of the GraphQL ecosystem.

Key business goals include:
- Maintaining specification compliance to ensure interoperability within the GraphQL ecosystem.
- Providing a stable and well-documented API for developers to use.
- Ensuring high performance and efficiency for GraphQL operations.
- Fostering community contributions and maintaining an active project.

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:
- Security vulnerabilities in graphql-js could have a wide-reaching impact, affecting numerous applications that depend on it. This could damage the reputation of GraphQL and the project itself.
- Performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies could limit the scalability and usability of GraphQL APIs built with graphql-js.
- Lack of maintenance or slow response to issues, especially security vulnerabilities, could deter developers from using graphql-js and GraphQL in general.
- Breaking changes or API instability could disrupt existing applications and increase the cost of adoption and maintenance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open Source Community Review - The project is open source, allowing for broad community review of the code, which can help identify potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented through GitHub repository and public access to code.
- security control: Unit and Integration Testing - The project likely has unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code. This can indirectly contribute to security by reducing the likelihood of bugs that could be exploited. Implemented as part of the development process, details are in the repository's test suite.
- security control: Dependency Scanning - GitHub likely performs automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. Implemented by GitHub Dependabot and security features.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on Community for Security Fixes - As an open-source project, the project relies on the community to report and potentially contribute fixes for security vulnerabilities. Response time and availability of fixes can vary.
- accepted risk: Potential for Undiscovered Vulnerabilities - Like any software project, there is always a risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Implement automated SAST tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code during development.
- security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning - Enhance dependency scanning to include more comprehensive vulnerability databases and automated alerts.
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Security-Focused Code Reviews - Incorporate security considerations into code review processes, specifically looking for common vulnerability patterns.
- security control: Fuzzing - Implement fuzzing techniques to automatically test the GraphQL parser and execution engine for unexpected inputs and potential vulnerabilities.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: graphql-js itself does not handle authentication, but it should be designed to be easily integrated with authentication mechanisms implemented in applications using it.
    - Requirement: Provide clear guidance and examples in documentation on how to secure GraphQL APIs built with graphql-js, including authentication best practices.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: graphql-js should provide mechanisms for implementing fine-grained authorization logic within GraphQL resolvers.
    - Requirement: Ensure that authorization decisions are consistently enforced throughout the GraphQL execution process.
    - Requirement: Provide clear documentation and examples on how to implement authorization in GraphQL APIs using graphql-js.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: graphql-js must strictly adhere to the GraphQL specification for query parsing and validation to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Provide mechanisms for developers to define and enforce schema-based validation rules to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.
    - Requirement: Implement robust error handling for invalid inputs to avoid exposing sensitive information or causing unexpected application behavior.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: While graphql-js itself may not directly implement cryptographic functions, it should be designed to be compatible with and easily integrated with cryptographic libraries and best practices for securing sensitive data in GraphQL applications.
    - Requirement: Provide guidance and recommendations on how to use cryptography to protect sensitive data transmitted and processed by GraphQL APIs built with graphql-js.

2. GitHub Repository: The source code for graphql-js is hosted on GitHub.
3. GitHub Actions CI: Upon code changes (e.g., push, pull request), GitHub Actions CI is triggered via webhook.
4. Build & Test: GitHub Actions CI performs the following steps:
    - Checkout code from the GitHub repository.
    - Setup Node.js environment.
    - Install dependencies (npm install).
    - Run linters and code formatters.
    - Run static analysis security testing (SAST) tools.

5. Build Artifacts: If the build and tests are successful, build artifacts are created, which include:
    - JavaScript library files.
    - Type definition files.
    - Documentation.
    - npm package manifest (package.json).
6. npm Registry: The build artifacts are published to the npm Registry, making the graphql-js library available for download and use by developers.
