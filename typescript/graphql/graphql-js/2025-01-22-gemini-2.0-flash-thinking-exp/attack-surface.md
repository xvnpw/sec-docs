# Attack Surface Analysis for graphql/graphql-js

## Attack Surface: [Query Complexity Attacks (Denial of Service - DoS)](./attack_surfaces/query_complexity_attacks__denial_of_service_-_dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit the ability to construct arbitrarily complex GraphQL queries, sending deeply nested or wide queries that overwhelm server resources, leading to denial of service.
*   **graphql-js Contribution:** `graphql-js` itself parses and executes GraphQL queries without imposing inherent limits on query complexity. This design choice places the responsibility for complexity management entirely on the application developer.  Without explicit complexity controls implemented by the developer, `graphql-js` will process and attempt to resolve even extremely resource-intensive queries.
*   **Example:** A malicious user sends a GraphQL query with excessive nesting and field selections, like fetching nested relationships to a depth of 10 or more levels, or requesting a large number of fields within each level. This forces `graphql-js` to execute numerous resolvers and consume significant server resources (CPU, memory) to resolve the query, potentially crashing the server or making it unresponsive to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Server downtime, application unavailability, resource exhaustion, impacting all users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Query Complexity Analysis:**  Develop or integrate a library that analyzes incoming GraphQL queries *before* execution by `graphql-js`. This analysis should calculate a "cost" for each query based on factors like query depth, breadth, and the estimated cost of resolving each field (considering resolver complexity).
    *   **Set Complexity Limits:** Define thresholds for maximum allowed query complexity. Reject queries that exceed these limits *before* they are passed to `graphql-js` for execution.
    *   **Utilize `graphql-js` Execution Options (Indirectly):** While `graphql-js` doesn't have built-in complexity limits, you can use its execution options (like `context` and custom resolvers) to integrate with complexity analysis libraries and enforce limits within your resolver logic. However, the core responsibility of implementing the complexity analysis and enforcement lies outside of `graphql-js` itself.
    *   **Query Timeouts:** Set timeouts for GraphQL query execution. If a query takes longer than the defined timeout, terminate the execution to prevent resource exhaustion. This can be implemented using middleware or within the `graphql-js` execution context.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data within GraphQL query variables or arguments to exploit vulnerabilities in resolvers or backend systems. While GraphQL provides type safety for query structure, it does not automatically validate the *content* of input values.
*   **graphql-js Contribution:** `graphql-js` is responsible for parsing and validating the *structure* and *types* of the GraphQL query itself, ensuring it conforms to the schema. However, `graphql-js` explicitly *does not* validate the *content* of input values passed as variables or arguments. This leaves input validation entirely to the developer's resolver implementations. If resolvers do not perform proper input validation, applications are vulnerable to injection attacks.
*   **Example:** A GraphQL mutation takes a `userInput` variable intended for user registration. A resolver uses this `userInput` to construct a database query. An attacker crafts a malicious `userInput` containing SQL injection code. Because `graphql-js` only validates that `userInput` is of the expected type (e.g., String), and not its content, the malicious input is passed to the resolver. If the resolver doesn't sanitize this input before using it in the database query, SQL injection occurs.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential for remote code execution on the server depending on the backend vulnerability exploited (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Input Validation in Resolvers:**  Crucially, developers *must* implement robust input validation within each resolver that handles user-provided input. This validation should occur *before* the input is used in any backend operations (database queries, external API calls, etc.).
    *   **Sanitize and Validate Input Content:**  Use appropriate sanitization and validation techniques based on the expected data type and context. For example:
        *   For strings, sanitize against injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.). Validate length, format, and allowed characters.
        *   For numbers, validate ranges and formats.
        *   For complex objects, validate each field within the object.
    *   **Utilize Parameterized Queries/ORMs:** When interacting with databases, always use parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) that automatically handle parameterization. This is a primary defense against SQL injection and similar injection attacks.
    *   **Schema-Level Validation (Limited):** While `graphql-js` doesn't validate content, you can use schema directives or custom scalar types to enforce some basic content constraints at the schema level. However, this is often insufficient for comprehensive input validation and resolver-level validation remains essential.
