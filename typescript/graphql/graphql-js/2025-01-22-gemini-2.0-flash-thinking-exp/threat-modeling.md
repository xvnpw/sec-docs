# Threat Model Analysis for graphql/graphql-js

## Threat: [Query Complexity Attacks (DoS)](./threats/query_complexity_attacks__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts complex GraphQL queries with deep nesting, numerous aliases, or requests for computationally expensive fields. These queries are designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, database connections) during execution by `graphql-js`, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability for legitimate users. The attacker exploits the way `graphql-js` processes and executes arbitrarily complex queries without built-in limits.
*   **Impact:** Server overload, performance degradation, service disruption, denial of service for legitimate users, potential financial losses due to downtime.
*   **Affected GraphQL-JS Component:** `graphql-js/graphql` (query execution engine). While the vulnerability is in the application's lack of complexity control, `graphql-js` is the component that executes the complex query and consumes resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Query Complexity Analysis:** Use libraries or custom logic *outside* of `graphql-js` to analyze the complexity of incoming GraphQL queries *before* they are passed to `graphql-js` for execution.
    *   **Set Complexity Limits:** Define and enforce maximum query complexity thresholds. Reject queries that exceed these limits *before* they reach `graphql-js` execution engine.
    *   **Complexity Costing:** Assign cost values to different fields and query elements (depth, breadth, aliases) to accurately calculate query complexity.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a given timeframe, mitigating brute-force DoS attempts. This limits the number of queries `graphql-js` needs to process.
    *   **Query Timeout:** Set timeouts for query execution to prevent long-running queries processed by `graphql-js` from consuming resources indefinitely.

## Threat: [Batching Attacks (DoS - if Batching Enabled)](./threats/batching_attacks__dos_-_if_batching_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If GraphQL batching is implemented in the application (often around `graphql-js`), an attacker sends a single HTTP request containing a large batch of complex queries. This amplifies the impact of query complexity attacks, allowing attackers to quickly overwhelm the server by sending many complex queries to `graphql-js` in one go, exacerbating DoS conditions. The attacker leverages batching to multiply the resource consumption of complex queries processed by `graphql-js`.
*   **Impact:** Increased DoS potential compared to single query complexity attacks, faster resource exhaustion, more rapid service disruption.
*   **Affected GraphQL-JS Component:** `graphql-js/graphql` (query execution engine). While batching is often implemented externally, `graphql-js` is responsible for executing each query within the batch, and thus is directly involved in the resource consumption during a batching attack.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Batch Size:** Restrict the maximum number of queries allowed in a single batch request *before* processing by `graphql-js`.
    *   **Batch Complexity Analysis:** Apply query complexity analysis to the *entire batch*, not just individual queries, *before* sending to `graphql-js`. Ensure the total complexity of the batch is within acceptable limits.
    *   **Batch Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting specifically for batch requests, potentially with stricter limits than for single queries. This limits the rate at which batches are processed by `graphql-js`.
    *   **Consider Disabling Batching:** If batching is not essential and the risk of batching attacks is significant, consider disabling batching altogether to reduce the attack surface against `graphql-js` execution engine.

## Threat: [Introspection Abuse](./threats/introspection_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses introspection queries (e.g., `__schema`, `__type`) to discover the entire GraphQL API schema, including types, fields, arguments, directives, and descriptions. `graphql-js` by default implements and enables introspection as part of the GraphQL specification. This knowledge allows attackers to understand the API structure, identify potential vulnerabilities, and craft targeted attacks more effectively against the application built with `graphql-js`.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, easier vulnerability discovery, potential exposure of sensitive data structure and internal logic, aiding in more effective attacks.
*   **Affected GraphQL-JS Component:** `graphql-js/graphql` (introspection system, specifically the functions and modules that handle `__schema` and `__type` queries).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (in certain contexts, depending on the sensitivity of the schema information and the overall security posture).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Introspection in Production:** Configure your GraphQL server, which uses `graphql-js`, to disable introspection queries in production environments. This is often a configuration setting provided by the server library built on top of `graphql-js`.
    *   **Implement Access Control for Introspection:** If introspection is needed for specific purposes (e.g., internal tooling), implement authentication and authorization *around* `graphql-js` to restrict access to introspection queries to only authorized users or roles *before* they are processed by `graphql-js`.
    *   **Schema Minimization:** Design your schema to expose only the necessary information to clients. Avoid including internal details or sensitive information in schema descriptions or comments that would be revealed through `graphql-js` introspection.
