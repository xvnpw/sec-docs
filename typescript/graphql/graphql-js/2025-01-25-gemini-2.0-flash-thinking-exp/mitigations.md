# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for graphql/graphql-js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Complexity Analysis (graphql-js focused)](./mitigation_strategies/query_complexity_analysis__graphql-js_focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Complexity Cost in Schema:**  Within your GraphQL schema definition (using `graphql-js` schema building tools), design your schema with complexity in mind.  Consider assigning conceptual costs to fields based on their resolver's computational load. While `graphql-js` doesn't enforce costs directly in the schema language, this design thinking is crucial for later steps.
    2.  **Implement Complexity Calculation in Resolver Execution:**  Utilize `graphql-js`'s execution context and resolver functions to calculate query complexity.  Before resolving a field, access the query AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) within the resolver context.  Use a custom function to traverse the relevant parts of the AST and accumulate complexity scores based on field types and arguments. Libraries like `graphql-cost-analysis` (while external) are built to work *with* `graphql-js` execution and resolvers.
    3.  **Enforce Threshold in `graphql-js` Execution:**  Within your `graphql-js` execution logic (e.g., in your `graphql()` function call), integrate the complexity calculation.  Before proceeding with full query resolution, check if the calculated complexity exceeds a predefined threshold. If it does, throw an error *within* the `graphql-js` execution pipeline to halt processing and return an error to the client.
    4.  **Customize Error Handling via `graphql-js`:** Use `graphql-js`'s `formatError` execution option to customize the error response sent back to the client when a query is rejected due to complexity. This allows you to provide user-friendly and informative error messages.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries (High Severity):** Malicious actors can craft extremely complex queries that consume excessive server resources, leading to service degradation or outage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Complex Queries (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks by preventing execution of resource-intensive queries directly within the `graphql-js` execution flow.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic complexity analysis is partially implemented in the API Gateway layer *before* reaching `graphql-js` execution. This is a pre-processing step, not directly within `graphql-js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Complexity calculation and enforcement are not integrated *directly* into the `graphql-js` execution pipeline using resolvers and `graphql-js`'s error handling mechanisms.
    *   No usage of `graphql-js`'s `formatError` for complexity-related errors.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Depth Limits (graphql-js focused)](./mitigation_strategies/query_depth_limits__graphql-js_focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `graphql-js` Execution Options:** When executing a GraphQL query using `graphql-js`'s `graphql()` function, leverage execution options or validation rules to enforce depth limits.  `graphql-js` provides mechanisms to add custom validation rules or utilize existing libraries that integrate with its validation process. Libraries like `graphql-depth-limit` are designed to work seamlessly with `graphql-js`.
    2.  **Configure Depth Limit in Execution:**  Set the desired maximum query depth as a configuration parameter when calling `graphql()`. This limit will be applied during the query validation phase *before* resolvers are executed.
    3.  **`graphql-js` Validation Error Handling:**  `graphql-js` will automatically generate validation errors if the query exceeds the depth limit.  These errors are part of the standard GraphQL error response format.
    4.  **Customize Error Messages (Optional):**  Use `graphql-js`'s `formatError` execution option to further customize the error messages returned for depth limit violations, if needed, although the default validation errors are usually sufficient.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Queries (Medium Severity):** Deeply nested queries can lead to increased processing time and resource consumption, potentially contributing to DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Deeply Nested Queries (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of DoS by limiting query depth directly within `graphql-js`'s validation process, preventing resource exhaustion from excessively nested requests.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A depth limit is implemented using `graphql-depth-limit`, which integrates with `graphql-js` validation. This is a direct `graphql-js` focused implementation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Error messages for depth limit violations are currently generic validation errors from `graphql-js`.  Customizing these via `formatError` for better user feedback is missing.
    *   Depth limits are globally applied.  No context-aware or schema-specific depth limits are implemented within `graphql-js` execution.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Introspection Control (graphql-js focused)](./mitigation_strategies/introspection_control__graphql-js_focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Control Introspection Query Execution in `graphql-js`:**  When setting up your `graphql-js` server and schema, configure the execution environment to conditionally disable or restrict introspection queries.
    2.  **Schema Building Options (Less Direct):** While `graphql-js` doesn't have a direct "disable introspection" flag in schema building, you can indirectly control it by *not* exposing the full schema object in production if you are manually managing schema access. However, typically, you'll control introspection at the execution level.
    3.  **Context-Based Introspection Control (More Advanced):**  Within your resolver for the `__schema` field (the entry point for introspection), implement logic to check the execution context (e.g., user authentication, environment). Based on this context, either resolve the schema (allowing introspection) or return an error or `null` (disabling introspection). This provides fine-grained control within `graphql-js`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Schema Exposure (Medium Severity):** Introspection exposes the entire GraphQL schema, which can be used by attackers for reconnaissance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Schema Exposure (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of information disclosure by controlling introspection directly within `graphql-js` execution, preventing unauthorized schema access.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Introspection is disabled in production environments based on an environment variable check in the GraphQL server initialization, which is directly controlling `graphql-js` execution behavior.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Context-based introspection control within the `__schema` resolver is not implemented for more granular access management.
    *   No alternative mechanism within `graphql-js` to provide authorized schema access in production (e.g., via a specific role or permission check in the introspection resolver).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize Error Responses (graphql-js focused)](./mitigation_strategies/customize_error_responses__graphql-js_focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `graphql-js`'s `formatError` Execution Option:**  The primary mechanism in `graphql-js` for customizing error responses is the `formatError` option provided when calling the `graphql()` function.
    2.  **Implement Error Filtering and Masking in `formatError`:**  Create a custom `formatError` function. Within this function, inspect the original error object provided by `graphql-js`.
    3.  **Environment-Aware Error Handling:** Inside `formatError`, check the environment (development vs. production).
        *   **Production:**  For production environments, mask sensitive error details. Return a generic error message to the client (e.g., "Internal Server Error").  Log the *original* error details securely server-side (outside of the client response).
        *   **Development:** For development, allow more detailed error information to be returned to the client to aid debugging.
    4.  **Sanitize Error Details in `formatError`:**  Even in development or for server-side logging, within `formatError`, sanitize error details to prevent leakage of highly sensitive information (like database credentials) before logging or returning them.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Verbose Errors (Medium Severity):** Detailed error messages can reveal internal server paths, database structure, or business logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Verbose Errors (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of information disclosure by using `graphql-js`'s `formatError` to control error responses and prevent sensitive details from reaching clients in production.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Custom error formatting *is* implemented using `graphql-js`'s `formatError` function. Generic messages are returned in production, demonstrating direct usage of `graphql-js` features.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Server-side logging *from within* the `formatError` function is not fully implemented.  While errors are logged, integrating logging directly within `formatError` ensures all formatted errors are consistently logged.
    *   Error sanitization within `formatError` could be more robust to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive data in logs.
