## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands via Terminal Input](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_via_terminal_input.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious commands within the terminal input field.

**Mechanism:** This input is then processed by the backend application. If the backend lacks proper input sanitization, these malicious commands can be executed directly on the server.

**Potential Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Backend](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_command_injection_vulnerabilities_in_backend.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a specific instance of "Inject Malicious Commands via Terminal Input".

**Mechanism:** The backend application directly executes user-provided terminal input as system commands without adequate security measures.

**Potential Impact:** Allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data via Backend Integration](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_via_backend_integration.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the backend system to inject malicious data into the data stream that is sent to the frontend and displayed by xterm.js.

**Mechanism:** This could involve compromising backend databases, APIs, or other data sources. The injected malicious data can contain escape sequences or other characters that, when rendered by xterm.js, execute malicious scripts or cause other harmful effects.

**Potential Impact:** Similar to XSS, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or denial of service within the terminal context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Client-Side JavaScript Interacting with xterm.js](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_client-side_javascript_interacting_with_xterm_js.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the client-side environment of the application. This malicious code then interacts with the xterm.js instance to perform unauthorized actions.

**Mechanism:** This injection can occur through various client-side vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaws in other parts of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hijack Event Listeners](./attack_tree_paths/hijack_event_listeners.md)

**Attack Vector:** A specific type of "Manipulate Client-Side JavaScript Interacting with xterm.js".

**Mechanism:** The attacker's injected JavaScript code intercepts or modifies the event listeners that are attached to the xterm.js instance. This allows the attacker to monitor or alter user input, mouse events, or data received by the terminal.

**Potential Impact:** Stealing user input, injecting malicious commands into the terminal, or redirecting user actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify xterm.js Instance Properties or Methods](./attack_tree_paths/modify_xterm_js_instance_properties_or_methods.md)

**Attack Vector:** Another specific type of "Manipulate Client-Side JavaScript Interacting with xterm.js".

**Mechanism:** The attacker's injected JavaScript code gains access to the xterm.js object and directly modifies its properties or methods. This can alter the behavior of the terminal in malicious ways.

**Potential Impact:** Disrupting terminal functionality, injecting malicious code that is executed by the terminal, or bypassing security measures implemented around the terminal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via xterm.js](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_xterm_js.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach leveraging xterm.js vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via xterm.js](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_xterm_js.md)

This node represents a key stage where the attacker successfully injects malicious code that will be executed either on the server-side or client-side through the xterm.js interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Backend](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_command_injection_vulnerabilities_in_backend.md)

As detailed above, this is a direct path to server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data via Backend Integration](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_via_backend_integration.md)

Compromising this node allows for the injection of malicious content into the terminal display, leading to client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents a point where the attacker leverages weaknesses in how the application integrates with xterm.js, specifically through client-side JavaScript manipulation.
