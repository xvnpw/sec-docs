## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities in xterm.js](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities_in_xterm_js.md)

*   **1.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] Command Injection via Control Sequences**
    *   **1.1.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Craft malicious control sequences to execute commands on the server-side (if backend integration exists)**
        *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
            *   **Description:**  This attack targets applications that integrate xterm.js with a backend process (like a shell or container). The attacker aims to inject malicious commands into the backend by crafting special terminal control sequences within the xterm.js input. If the backend doesn't properly sanitize input from xterm.js before executing commands, the injected commands will be executed on the server.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (3/5) - Depends on application design and backend integration. Command injection vulnerabilities are common in web applications.
            *   **Impact:** Critical (5/5) - Successful command injection can lead to full server compromise, data breaches, and system disruption.
            *   **Effort:** Medium (3/5) - Identifying vulnerable backend logic requires code analysis and application testing. Crafting control sequences is moderately complex but well-documented.
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium (3/5) - Requires web application security knowledge and understanding of command injection principles.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (4/5) - Malicious commands can be obfuscated within control sequences, making detection challenging without robust logging and input validation.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   **1.1.1.a [CRITICAL NODE] Identify vulnerable backend command execution logic connected to xterm.js:** The attacker first needs to identify if the application uses xterm.js to interact with a backend process and how user input from xterm.js is handled in the backend. This involves code review, application testing, and potentially reverse engineering.
            *   **1.1.1.b [CRITICAL NODE] Inject commands through xterm.js input that are not properly sanitized by backend:** Once vulnerable logic is identified, the attacker crafts malicious input. This input includes terminal control sequences (ANSI escape codes, etc.) and embedded within or alongside these sequences, the attacker injects operating system commands. If the backend is vulnerable, these injected commands will be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.0 [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities (Application-Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/3_0__high-risk_path__exploit_integration_vulnerabilities__application-specific_.md)

*   **3.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Command Injection via Application Logic using xterm.js as conduit**
    *   **3.1.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Identify application code that passes user input from xterm.js to backend commands without proper sanitization**
        *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
            *   **Description:** This is a classic command injection vulnerability, but specifically in the context of xterm.js integration. The application takes user input from the xterm.js terminal and directly passes it to backend command execution functions (e.g., shell commands, system calls) without proper sanitization or validation. xterm.js acts as the communication channel for delivering the malicious input.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (4/5) -  A very common vulnerability in web applications that handle user input and interact with backend systems.
            *   **Impact:** Critical (5/5) -  Similar to 1.1.1, successful command injection can lead to full server compromise, data breaches, and system disruption.
            *   **Effort:** Medium (3/5) - Identifying the vulnerable code requires code review and dynamic testing of the application.
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium (3/5) - Requires web application security knowledge and understanding of command injection.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (4/5) -  Input might appear normal, and malicious commands can be crafted to be less obvious. Detection relies on robust input validation and security monitoring.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   **3.1.1.a [CRITICAL NODE] Analyze application's backend integration with xterm.js:** The attacker needs to analyze the application's backend code that handles input originating from the xterm.js component. The goal is to find code sections where user input is directly used to construct and execute commands on the server.
            *   **3.1.1.b [CRITICAL NODE] Inject malicious commands through xterm.js input that are executed on the server:** Once the vulnerable code is located, the attacker crafts malicious input within the xterm.js terminal. This input contains operating system commands that the attacker wants to execute on the server. Because the application is vulnerable, this input is passed unsanitized to the backend and executed.

*   **3.2 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exposed Backend Functionality via Terminal Interface**
    *   **3.2.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Application exposes sensitive or administrative commands through the terminal interface unintentionally**
        *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
            *   **Description:**  The application, in its design or implementation, might unintentionally expose sensitive or administrative commands through the xterm.js terminal interface. These commands could be intended for internal use or administrative purposes but become accessible to unauthorized users through the terminal.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (3/5) - Developers might inadvertently expose commands, especially in complex applications or during rapid development.
            *   **Impact:** High (4/5) - Exploiting exposed commands can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, data modification, privilege escalation, and system control, although typically less severe than full command injection.
            *   **Effort:** Medium (3/5) - Identifying exposed commands requires exploring the terminal interface and understanding the application's backend functionality.
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium (3/5) - Requires understanding of application functionality and how it's exposed through the terminal.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (3/5) - Detection depends on logging of command execution and access control monitoring. If command usage is not properly logged or monitored, it can be harder to detect unauthorized use.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            *   **3.2.1.a [CRITICAL NODE] Identify commands accessible via xterm.js that should be restricted:** The attacker explores the terminal interface provided by xterm.js within the application. They try different commands, analyze documentation (if available), and observe the application's responses to identify commands that provide access to sensitive data or administrative functions that should be restricted.
            *   **3.2.1.b [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit these commands to gain unauthorized access or control:** Once sensitive or administrative commands are identified, the attacker uses these commands to achieve their goals. This could involve accessing sensitive data, modifying configurations, creating new accounts, or performing other actions that should be restricted to authorized users.
