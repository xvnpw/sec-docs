# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, xterm.js, provides a terminal emulator component for web applications. It enables developers to integrate fully featured terminals into browser-based tools and applications.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a stable and reliable terminal emulation experience in web browsers.
- Offer high performance to ensure a responsive and user-friendly terminal interface.
- Maintain broad compatibility across different browsers and operating systems.
- Be easily integrable into various web applications and frameworks.
- Ensure security to protect users and applications that embed xterm.js from potential vulnerabilities.
- Foster an active open-source community to drive development and address issues.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Vulnerabilities in xterm.js could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code within applications that use it.
- Performance issues or instability could negatively impact user experience and the reputation of applications embedding xterm.js.
- Lack of compatibility with certain browsers or operating systems could limit the reach and usability of applications using xterm.js.
- Difficult integration could deter developers from adopting xterm.js.
- Security breaches could lead to data leaks, system compromise, and reputational damage for both xterm.js and its users.
- A decline in community support could slow down development, bug fixes, and security updates, increasing risks over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process for contributions (location: likely GitHub pull request reviews, details not explicitly provided).
- security control: Unit and integration testing (location: project repository, details not explicitly provided).
- security control: Use of TypeScript for type safety (location: project codebase).
- accepted risk: Reliance on browser security model for isolation (location: inherent to web browser environment).
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies (location: inherent to npm ecosystem, mitigation strategies not explicitly provided).

Recommended Security Controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
- recommended security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) on applications embedding xterm.js to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- recommended security control: Perform penetration testing on applications embedding xterm.js to simulate real-world attacks.
- recommended security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in applications embedding xterm.js to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) risks.
- recommended security control: Security focused code review guidelines and training for developers.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: xterm.js itself does not handle user authentication. Applications embedding xterm.js are responsible for implementing appropriate authentication mechanisms to verify user identities before granting access to terminal functionalities.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: xterm.js itself does not handle authorization. Applications embedding xterm.js are responsible for implementing authorization controls to ensure users only have access to permitted commands and resources within the terminal environment.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: xterm.js must rigorously validate and sanitize all input received from the terminal, including user input and control sequences, to prevent command injection, escape sequences vulnerabilities, and other input-related attacks.
    - requirement: Input validation should be applied at multiple layers, including client-side (within xterm.js) and server-side (in the backend application processing terminal input).
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: xterm.js itself may not directly implement cryptography, but if it handles sensitive data or communication, it should leverage secure cryptographic libraries and protocols provided by the browser environment (e.g., Web Crypto API, HTTPS).
    - requirement: Applications embedding xterm.js should use HTTPS to secure communication between the browser and backend servers, especially when transmitting sensitive terminal data.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Embedding terminal functionality into web applications.
- Providing a reliable and secure terminal experience for end users of these applications.
- Maintaining the reputation and trust of the xterm.js project and its maintainers.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Terminal Input and Output Data: Sensitivity depends on the context of the embedding application. It can range from non-sensitive commands to highly sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or confidential information displayed or entered in the terminal.
- Source Code: Sensitive as it contains the intellectual property and logic of xterm.js. Compromise could lead to malicious modifications and supply chain attacks.
- Build Pipeline and Release Infrastructure: Sensitive as compromise could lead to the distribution of malicious versions of xterm.js.
- Developer Credentials and Access Keys: Sensitive as they can be used to compromise the code repository, build pipeline, and release process.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the most common use cases for xterm.js? Understanding the use cases will help prioritize security requirements and threat modeling scenarios.
- What are the typical backend systems that xterm.js-based terminals interact with? (e.g., SSH servers, container runtimes, cloud APIs). This will inform the context diagram and identify relevant attack vectors.
- Are there specific security requirements or compliance standards that xterm.js needs to adhere to? (e.g., OWASP, PCI DSS, HIPAA).
- What is the process for handling vulnerability reports and security patches in xterm.js?
- Are there any specific addons or integrations that are considered high-risk from a security perspective?
- What is the expected risk appetite for applications embedding xterm.js? (e.g., startup vs. Fortune 500 company).

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure, stable, and performant terminal emulator for web applications. Security is a high priority due to the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: While some basic security controls are likely in place (code review, testing), there is room for improvement in automated security testing, dependency management, and formal vulnerability response processes. The project relies heavily on the browser security model.
- DESIGN: xterm.js is primarily a client-side JavaScript library. Security responsibilities are shared between xterm.js, embedding applications, and backend systems. Secure communication and input validation are critical security aspects. The build process is assumed to be automated and hosted on GitHub Actions.
