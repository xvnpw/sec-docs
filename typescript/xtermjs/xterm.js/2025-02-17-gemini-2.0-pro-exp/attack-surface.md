# Attack Surface Analysis for xtermjs/xterm.js

## Attack Surface: [Escape Sequence Injection](./attack_surfaces/escape_sequence_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted ANSI escape sequences are injected into the terminal, exploiting vulnerabilities in the parsing and handling logic.
    *   **How xterm.js Contributes:** `xterm.js` is directly responsible for parsing and interpreting these sequences. This is its core function.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends `\x1b[9999999C` (move cursor excessively) to cause DoS, or a sequence exploiting a known parsing bug in a specific `xterm.js` version.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) of the terminal and potentially the browser tab.
        *   Possible (though less likely) limited information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Whitelisting:** Implement a whitelist of *allowed* escape sequences; reject all others.
        *   **Input Length Limits:** Enforce reasonable limits on input length.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Regularly fuzz test the escape sequence parsing.
        *   **Stay Updated:** Keep `xterm.js` updated to the latest version.

## Attack Surface: [Control Character Mishandling](./attack_surfaces/control_character_mishandling.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of improperly handled control characters (e.g., null bytes, backspace) beyond standard escape sequences.
    *   **How xterm.js Contributes:** `xterm.js`'s terminal emulation must handle these characters, creating a direct vulnerability point.
    *   **Example:** Sending a stream of null bytes (`\x00`) to attempt a buffer overflow or trigger unexpected behavior in the parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS).
        *   Unexpected terminal behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all input, including control characters, before passing to `xterm.js`.
        *   **Code Review:** Review `xterm.js` code (and addons) related to control character handling.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Include control characters in fuzz testing.

## Attack Surface: [Addon Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/addon_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within `xterm.js` addons.
    *   **How xterm.js Contributes:** `xterm.js`'s addon architecture allows for third-party code, which may be less secure. The vulnerability is *within* code running as part of the `xterm.js` environment.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable addon exposes new, exploitable escape sequences, or has flaws in its own input handling.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies widely; could range from DoS to more severe issues depending on the addon.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the addon).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Addon Selection:** Only use trusted addons; review their code.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep addons updated.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Only enable necessary addons.
        *   **Security Audits:** Audit custom addons.
