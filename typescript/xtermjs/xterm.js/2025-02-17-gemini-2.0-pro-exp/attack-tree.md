## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Input Validation Bypass/Failure](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_input_validation_bypassfailure.md)

**Description:** This is the foundational weakness that enables the high-risk attack path. If an attacker can bypass or circumvent the application's input validation mechanisms, they can deliver malicious payloads to xterm.js. This node represents the *failure* of the application to properly sanitize or restrict the input it provides to the xterm.js library.

**Why it's Critical:** Without robust input validation, all subsequent security measures are significantly less effective. It's the primary gatekeeper, and its failure opens the door to a wide range of attacks.

**Attack Vectors (sub-points of this critical node, leading to the high-risk path):**

*   **Missing or Incomplete Validation:** The application may lack input validation entirely, or the validation may be incomplete, allowing certain malicious characters or sequences to pass through.
*   **Incorrectly Implemented Validation:** The validation logic may contain errors or flaws that can be exploited by an attacker. For example, a regular expression used for validation might have an unintended loophole.
*   **Client-Side Only Validation:** Relying solely on client-side validation is insufficient, as attackers can easily bypass client-side checks.
*   **Blacklist Approach (Instead of Whitelist):** Trying to block known-bad input (blacklist) is often ineffective, as attackers can find new ways to bypass the blacklist. A whitelist approach, allowing only known-good input, is much more secure.
*   **Failure to Handle Different Encodings:** The application might not properly handle different character encodings (e.g., UTF-8, UTF-16), leading to bypasses.
*   **Logic Errors:** Complex validation logic can introduce subtle errors that are difficult to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path.md)

*   **Step 1: Inject Malicious Escape Sequences (CSI, OSC, etc.)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts input containing malicious escape sequences. These sequences are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in xterm.js or to be misinterpreted in a way that leads to unintended behavior.
    *   **Attack Techniques:**
        *   **Standard Escape Sequence Abuse:** Using valid, but potentially dangerous, escape sequences in unexpected ways. For example, sequences that manipulate the terminal's state in a way that could lead to a later vulnerability.
        *   **Malformed Escape Sequences:** Intentionally crafting invalid or malformed escape sequences to trigger parsing errors or unexpected behavior in xterm.js.
        *   **Overly Long Sequences:** Sending extremely long escape sequences to potentially cause buffer overflows or denial-of-service conditions.
        *   **Combining Sequences:** Combining multiple escape sequences in complex ways to create unexpected interactions.
        *   **Encoding Tricks:** Using different character encodings or Unicode tricks to bypass simple string-based validation.
        *   **XSS via Terminal Output:** If the *output* of xterm.js is later rendered in a web page without proper escaping, injected escape sequences could be interpreted as HTML/JavaScript, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is a *critical* point: the vulnerability isn't in xterm.js itself, but in how the application handles its output.

*   **Step 2: Bypass Sanitization Mechanisms**
    *   **Description:** If xterm.js or the application has sanitization routines to filter out malicious escape sequences, the attacker attempts to bypass these mechanisms.
    *   **Attack Techniques:**
        *   **Obfuscation:** Using various techniques to disguise the malicious escape sequences, making them harder to detect by sanitization routines. This could involve using different encodings, inserting null bytes, or using alternative representations of the sequences.
        *   **Exploiting Sanitization Logic Flaws:** Finding errors or weaknesses in the sanitization logic itself. For example, if the sanitization routine uses a regular expression with a flaw, the attacker could craft input that bypasses the regular expression.
        *   **Double Encoding:** Encoding the malicious input multiple times to evade detection.
        *   **Unicode Normalization Issues:** Exploiting differences in how Unicode characters are normalized to bypass sanitization.

*   **Step 3: Find Weaknesses in Sanitization Implementation**
    *   **Description:** This is a more advanced step where the attacker actively analyzes the sanitization code (either xterm.js's built-in sanitization or the application's custom sanitization) to find specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Techniques:**
        *   **Code Review:** Manually reviewing the source code of the sanitization routines to identify potential flaws.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Providing a wide range of malformed and unexpected input to the sanitization routines to try to trigger errors or crashes.
        *   **Reverse Engineering:** Disassembling or decompiling the sanitization code to understand its inner workings and identify vulnerabilities.
        *   **Differential Analysis:** Comparing the behavior of the sanitization routine with different inputs to identify inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.
