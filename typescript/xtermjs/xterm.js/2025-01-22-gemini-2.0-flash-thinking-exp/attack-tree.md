## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities in xterm.js](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities_in_xterm_js.md)

- **1.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] Command Injection via Control Sequences**
    - **1.1.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Craft malicious control sequences to execute commands on the server-side (if backend integration exists)**
        - **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting potential vulnerabilities in how xterm.js processes terminal control sequences (ANSI escape codes, etc.) when integrated with a backend. If the application uses xterm.js to interact with a server-side process (like a shell or container), and input from xterm.js is passed to command execution functions without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. Control sequences might be used to obfuscate or manipulate these injected commands.
        - **1.1.1.a [CRITICAL NODE] Identify vulnerable backend command execution logic connected to xterm.js**
            - **Attack Step:** The attacker first needs to identify if the application's backend integration with xterm.js is vulnerable. This involves analyzing the application's code to understand how xterm.js input is handled on the server-side. They will look for code that takes user input from xterm.js and uses it to execute commands without proper security measures.
        - **1.1.1.b [CRITICAL NODE] Inject commands through xterm.js input that are not properly sanitized by backend**
            - **Attack Step:** Once vulnerable backend logic is identified, the attacker crafts malicious input. This input will contain commands designed to be executed on the server, embedded within or alongside legitimate terminal input.  For example, they might inject sequences like ``; rm -rf /`` if the backend naively executes input as shell commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.0 [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities (Application-Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/3_0__high-risk_path__exploit_integration_vulnerabilities__application-specific_.md)

- **3.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Command Injection via Application Logic using xterm.js as conduit**
    - **3.1.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Identify application code that passes user input from xterm.js to backend commands without proper sanitization**
        - **Attack Vector:** This is a classic and highly critical vulnerability. The application takes user input from the xterm.js terminal and passes it to backend processes (e.g., shell commands, system calls) without proper sanitization or validation. xterm.js acts as the communication channel for this malicious input. The vulnerability lies in the application's backend code, not directly in xterm.js itself.
        - **3.1.1.a [CRITICAL NODE] Analyze application's backend integration with xterm.js**
            - **Attack Step:** The attacker needs to analyze the application's backend code that handles input originating from xterm.js. Code review is crucial here. They will look for instances where user input from xterm.js is directly used in command execution functions without sufficient sanitization or validation.
        - **3.1.1.b [CRITICAL NODE] Inject malicious commands through xterm.js input that are executed on the server**
            - **Attack Step:**  After identifying the vulnerable backend code, the attacker injects malicious commands through the xterm.js interface. This input is designed to exploit the lack of sanitization in the backend and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

- **3.2 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exposed Backend Functionality via Terminal Interface**
    - **3.2.1 [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Application exposes sensitive or administrative commands through the terminal interface unintentionally**
        - **Attack Vector:**  The application might unintentionally expose commands or functionalities through the terminal interface that should be restricted. This could include administrative commands, commands that access sensitive data, or commands that can modify critical system settings.
        - **3.2.1.a [CRITICAL NODE] Identify commands accessible via xterm.js that should be restricted**
            - **Attack Step:** The attacker explores the application's terminal interface to identify commands that are accessible. They will look for commands that provide access to sensitive data, administrative functions, or any functionality that should not be available to unauthorized users through the terminal.
        - **3.2.1.b [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit these commands to gain unauthorized access or control**
            - **Attack Step:** Once identified, the attacker exploits these unintentionally exposed commands. They use these commands to gain unauthorized access to the application or system, modify data, escalate privileges, or disrupt the application's functionality.
