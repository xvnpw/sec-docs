### Key Attack Surface List: xterm.js (High & Critical - Direct Involvement)

This list details key attack surfaces with high or critical severity that directly involve the xterm.js library.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Escape Sequences in Server-Sent Data
    *   **Description:** A malicious server sends crafted ANSI escape sequences that are interpreted by xterm.js to perform unintended actions on the client's browser.
    *   **How xterm.js Contributes:** xterm.js is responsible for parsing and rendering ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting and control. Vulnerabilities in this parsing logic can allow malicious sequences to execute arbitrary code or manipulate the display in harmful ways.
    *   **Example:** A malicious server sends an escape sequence designed to inject JavaScript into the DOM if a vulnerability exists in xterm.js's handling of certain sequences. For instance, a hypothetical vulnerable sequence might be `\x1b]4;URL;javascript:alert('XSS')\x07`.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or arbitrary actions on behalf of the user. Can also cause denial of service by overwhelming the client's browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize or strip potentially dangerous ANSI escape sequences on the server-side *before* sending data to the client. Implement a whitelist of allowed sequences.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regularly Update xterm.js:** Keep xterm.js updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   **Review xterm.js Configuration:** Carefully review xterm.js configuration options related to escape sequence handling and disable any potentially risky features if not needed.
