Okay, I understand the instructions. You've provided a pre-filled response stating that no high-rank vulnerabilities were found in the Bookmarks VSCode extension itself, excluding dependency issues and vulnerabilities stemming from user's project files or missing documentation.

Based on your assessment and the instructions to filter for high or critical rank vulnerabilities, excluding those caused by insecure user code, missing documentation only, or DoS, and focusing on external attacker scenarios, your initial assessment that there are no vulnerabilities to list is consistent with the provided criteria.

Therefore, confirming your assessment, and based on the instructions, here is the updated list in markdown format, reflecting the absence of qualifying vulnerabilities:

## Vulnerability List for Bookmarks VSCode Extension

Based on the analysis and filtering criteria provided, no vulnerabilities meeting the 'high' or 'critical' rank and inclusion requirements were identified within the Bookmarks VSCode extension's code itself.

Specifically, after excluding:

*   Vulnerabilities caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns within user's project files.
*   Vulnerabilities that are solely due to missing documentation.
*   Denial of Service vulnerabilities.

And considering only:

*   Valid and not already mitigated vulnerabilities.
*   Vulnerabilities ranked 'high' or 'critical'.
*   External attacker threat model.

No vulnerabilities in the Bookmarks VSCode extension codebase qualify for listing under these constraints.  Dependency vulnerabilities, while noted in `CHANGELOG.md`, are being addressed separately and are explicitly excluded by the instructions as they are not vulnerabilities in the project's *own* code.

Therefore, there are no vulnerabilities to list that meet the specified criteria.
